    <li> Exactly what i wanted. I will definitely order it again.  ON time. Brand NEW. My favorite face lotion on this planet.</li>
    <li> Sheer Cover Moisturizer really works with your face. It&#x27;s not to heavy and moisturizes your face for the whole day. I use the cleanser and moisturizer which is the best combination. My face is oily and occassionaly I have dry spots on my face and this moisturizer is the best for it.</li>
    <li> one of the best facial moisturizer around for those of you (like me) who have &#x27;problem&#x27; skin. doesn&#x27;t leave a oily film which is great for someone who doesn&#x27;t need oil and great for acne sufferers trying to find a moisture solution without irriating and causing further breakouts.</li>
    <li> This dumb bottle has leaked over my stuff after flying so many times I had to throw it away. Even when I used a ziplock bag it broke through the bag and leaked on my stuff.</li>
    <li> LOVE this and what an amazing price!!!! Thin and not slimy or greasy plus an SPF? I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin oily. Coconut oil works better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well.  It has a light to feel.  I often get compliments on my skin.  Have to contribute this, in part, to the consistent use of this moisturizer.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I am using natural products on my skin and finally found something that will work naturally with my mineral make up . I love it . I think blends great and doesn&#x27;t melt off my skin . I plan order the bigger bottle next time . I can&#x27;t find it here locally .</li>
    <li> This moisturiser is very nice but the onliest thing is that the bottle is too all and would not last long so it  just worth the price .</li>
    <li> I am (unfortunately) one of those who breaks out after using most moisturizers, but not with Sheer Cover.  It is not oily and makes my skin nice and soft before putting on foundation. This is the only product so far that doesn&#x27;t give me pimples and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them! I only use this product and stopped trying all the others long ago.</li>
    <li> has been the best moisturizing cream I have worn with SPF Love it! I have been wearing it for three or four years every day and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product . If you use minerals as a makeup ,this is a must !  Please see my other reviews on sheer cover .I also offered a few professional makeup tips that can be done without buying other products .</li>
    <li> I like the sheerness of this lotion but it does make me break out.</li>
    <li> I have undiagnosed rosacea and have tried many moisturizers and makeup on my face. EVERYTHING breaks me out but this amazing product.  Thank you amazon for listing it so I can easily restock when I run out.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, feels nice.  Bought as an add-on,which is the most economical way to get this stuff if you&#x27;re a Prime customer.</li>
    <li> I have mature skin and I use this with a couple of drops of hyaluronic acid serum. I&#x27;m happy with the results my complexion looks dewy and feels well moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product is okay but nothing special.  It  is too thick and gloppy and therefore comes  out of  the container sort of like ketchup.</li>
    <li> I work construction and sweat all day. Every Spf moisturizer I have tried discolors my shirts except Sheer Cover. I use it on my face, neck, and shoulders. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It does a great job moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, just a faint sunblock smell, which I love. It also gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
