<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s okay the quality is very nice its thick the color is perfect a little more vibrant than the picture though. The only thing is its a circle seem and if you try to move the bangs you can see the wig cap. I bought this for Ariel cosplay for my girlfriend. She couldn&#x27;t style the bangs like Ariel which was disappointing. If you plan on  wearing it flat or using for A Poison  Ivy or any other costume that you just need long hair and not really styled i would recommend getting it. Its really a great deal for the wig you get. The shipping did take a while i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it two weeks before you need it it took about a month to get here so order it early just in case. i bought id october 6 it got her nov 2 so just be prepared to wait.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this wig! I used it for a Halloween costume, but will definitely have fun with it again! It came in super fast and held up the curls throughout the night! Great deal!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was perfect for my Ariel costume, great deal for the price. The color is a nice lighter red not orangey</li>
    <li> The color is great, it fits well (can be adjusted), I like the bangs.....haven&#x27;t tried applying heat to it yet so cannot say how resistant it is or how it may hold new curls. But it does come with some nice curls/waves already. Can&#x27;t wait to put wear it with my Poison Ivy costume :)</li>
    <li> This wig is not as pictured not to mention it took forever to come.  The color is VERY different.  Readly neon in the red hair category.  Totally don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> Its a lot brighter then it looks on the picture. But still soft and works well for cosplay but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it around because it looks very costumy and shiny. But as far as costume use its better then you can get at any costume stores especially for that price</li>
    <li> This wig was good, and obviously the other reviews clearly state there&#x27;s a delay or waiting period for the wig to come in, so I was patient and it came in perfectly in the arrival window that was provided. The only problem I found was that the wig color is extremely bright red. I thought it was going to look more of a darker red like the image but this red makes it definitely look like the hair is fake which is okay since this is for a costume, I just wish it was a little darker though</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT - ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE</li>
    <li> This is my second review, Just want to say that I know people can be scared buying online but I have been pleased with this seller and the product. I bought the cosplay dark red wig, it was nice and long, full, came with a cap. I needed for halloween and it came today 10/28, and I did purchase this wig late, like 10/14- and the item came on time from china!!! So that was awesome!- and the seller wrote back to my every concern which is very nice. I would buy again 100%! You can trust this seller. Thanks alot, I included  a pic of my ariel inspired look! Thank you! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> looks exactly as received it&#x27;s great and nice texture perfect curls perfect swoosh.. glad I stumbled apon this. Does not shed. Im sure it will last a long wig life meaning wont fall apart on me.. lol #theperfectitem</li>
    <li> I bought this in the light blonde, and because I thought it was a great buy for the price. I decided to get it again in red. The red had better bangs, and I didn&#x27;t have to cut them. It didn&#x27;t come with a wig cap like the blonde one. Which kinda sucked, but I already have one so its not too big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need the wig right away, I would not suggest buying it. It takes about a month and a half to two months to get to me. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal because I didn&#x27;t need it right away, but if you do you might want to look for another one.</li>
    <li> Very thin. You could c the wig Casio. Hair fell out so badly it kept shedding.. not even worth a dollar in my opinion</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and thick wig.  I&#x27;ll be using it for Halloween when I&#x27;m Fiona at work.  Nice wig to work with.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some trouble ordering wigs through Amazon in the past.  The wig will come looking like it was used and returned, the curls brushed right out of it, or it&#x27;s shoved in a bag haphazardly and in terrible shape upon arrival.  I&#x27;ve ordered two wigs through Hunnt, this red wine one and a white one of the same style.  Both arrived quickly and they were definitely brand new.  Cardboard inserts kept the wig safe from being balled up, and the wig came out of the packaging looking EXACTLY as pictured.  This is very important as there is nothing more upsetting than a new wig showing up and needing 12 hours worth of cleaning and styling before it can be used.  The wigs from Hunnt show up ready to go.  A little shake and easy styling and you&#x27;re set.  Definitely a bonus.  I highly recommend this seller and recommend the product.  It&#x27;s an extremely good quality wig and can be styled with hot irons and curling rods.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it; except the color, it is NOT as bright as it says it is, It looks faded.</li>
    <li> I ran around my house singing songs from the little mermaid one night when i had too much to drink. The only thing is that its really flat! I need to look up a video about how to make it have more volume up top</li>
    <li> First off, the wig wasn&#x27;t Hunnt brand. It was from Iroshima, or something like that. Second, it&#x27;s more of a firetruck red, it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture, the curls aren&#x27;t as tight, the wig isn&#x27;t as full. Parting it is near impossible, and the netting is visible at almost all times. It didn&#x27;t come with the wig cap or comb like it says it will. The packaging was literally a brown envelope. The wig was tangled when I got it and it took me 3 hours to untangle it. Then after wearing it for about an hour around my house, it tangled again. The only positive thing I can say is that it really is heat resistant. I straightened it on the lowest setting, then not caring if it got ruined, I decided to experiment with the highest setting and the wig didn&#x27;t melt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this wig would be good if you wore it under a hat or beanie, but other then that it&#x27;s not good at all. I do not suggest getting this product and will never by from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this wig. Doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up and minimal shedding! Excellent quality for the price paid</li>
    <li> Wore this to the club and everyone thought it was real! Obviously fake in the daylight but great for nightlife</li>
    <li> the wig is good quality, bangs definitely need a cut, but otherwise super happy. color is super vibrant as well</li>
    <li> I love this wig! The color is true to the picture but lighting alters the color of the wig (outside, inside, bathroom) I will be using it for my costume as Ariel the little mermaid. The wig is very long  and mine came perfectly styled with curls. I am 4&#x27; 11&amp;#34; and it reaches mid butt so that aspect makes it look unnatural. You can cut it to the desired length though. It doesnt feel stringy and is just beautiful. The cap holds everything in place very well! I&#x27;m planning to get more colors!</li>
    <li> Overall I am happy with this wig. It came in a timely fashion looks like the picture. Although I must say the bangs on the wig I got are EXTREMELY thick and long. I am going to have to trim them in order for them to look nice. I recommend</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WIG!!! Was so comfortable, it looked amazing. It is super long and the curls are great and the color is fantatstic! Loved it</li>
    <li> The wig worked well for Halloween, the fit was good and it stayed in place. My only critique would be that you do need to play with the parting a bit to avoid the under-cap/wig base from showing. Otherwise, once I had it parted and pulled back the bangs a bit, I did get lots of complements. I had devil horn barrette clips that I attached, and they stayed in place perfectly. I would say it was a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Ok, so it shipped October 15th and says it&#x27;ll be here between November 8th and 28th. But I&#x27;ve looked at reviews and saw that people have been getting theirs quicker than the anticipated time. So I&#x27;ve just been waiting and hoping that I get it.</li>
    <li> Love this! Long &amp; full! The red seems a bit more &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; compared to in pictures listing. (i.e. &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;), but it is beautiful! We may be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> i got this in red looks more pink and it feel and looks very cheap and real heard to brush</li>
    <li> It got here extremely fast and the product is even more beautiful in person.  I love this wig so much and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.......but I liked it some what.....I think it could&#x27;ve have been better and doesn&#x27;t look like the picture and it smelled a little too much like plastic that my room started smelling like plastic wig. Maybe keeping it in a better place.</li>
    <li> Great Wig The Net Shows A Little And The Wig Frizzes Easy But Good Qualitt Amd Color Comes Up A Lil Fake In Pictures Prepare To Color Net With A Red Marker Possibly Alot Of Hair Which Is Preferrable Great Price Too!!!</li>
    <li> i absolutly love it! it was at my door fast, and super light weight, i was kinda upset at first because it didnt come with a wig cap. but i dont even need one  ! and i dont need to worry about tangles cause of how light it is, and the curls arent too perfect to be real kinda thing. i adore this gem (:</li>
    <li> Terrible pinkish color :/ I wanted it deep red to use it daily but no it looks fake! And is super shiny and it was messing so much hair I&#x27;m mad!!! :/ is good for a costume tho. I give it 2 stars Bc it&#x27;s long and super curly!</li>
    <li> There are quite a few things wrong with this product.  The color, number 1, is like neon red, number 2 the hairs are coming out of the wig!! number 3, lost it&#x27;s curls VERY quickly, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although, I would like to take the time out to say the seller us fantastic! Very prompt. Nice and neat packaging.  The product even arrived earlier that it was supposed too!</li>
    <li> Its definitely not as red as I would have liked  nor did it feel as real as I would have liked. but you get what you pay for. id definitely purchase again though</li>
    <li> Love this wig! I ordered this wig for a cosplay and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!  Great service and they also sent me a wig cap free of charge which I thought was a nice touch. They will definitely have me as a customer any time I&#x27;m in need of a wig! (My husband&#x27;s profile :P)</li>
    <li> Color is much more orange-tinted than red. Not as expected; doesnt look good with my skin tone. Fits well, but the shape is somewhat like the image, just rounder at the top. good quality, is heat resistant, doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig. I used it for the little mermaid makeup look. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever wear it again. I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of the tangles without ruining the wig. But great purchase regardless.</li>
    <li> the color red of this item is much brighter in person then the image provided on the site. the item still worked out though</li>
    <li> Very good wig, a lot softer then I expected and the color was very true to the picture. The only issue I have with this wig is as others have described. You have to find the exact way to part it or the netting for the wig shows on your forehead. They should fix that but over all I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> a little bright for me but i can live with it, have to trim the bangs as their too long.  looking forward to wearing it at my next show..thanks</li>
    <li> I love love loved this wig and I will definitely order a backup even tho I think this one will last a long time. It is so long pretty and SOFT its unbelievable. Its definitely heat resistant I use all my heating tools on high heat and no melting.  I curled it, pin the curls let them set for about 30 mins and the results were AMAZING.  ot can take a curl so good. After I curled it it looked even more amazing the curl looked like virgin hair extensions.  No lie.  My friend was asking me what kind of hair it was I told her it was a wig and she wouldn&#x27;t belive me. I don&#x27;t know what to say I have no idea why this wig its so cheap  it&#x27;s so realistic and manageable! It&#x27;s seriously crazy the quality and for it to be so cheap! My advice comb it with a wide tooth comb it doesn&#x27;t shed when I use a wide tooth comb but when I use a paddle brush it sheds very very very little.  You would expect it like crazy because it&#x27;s long but nope!!!! Im tellin ya its a amazing wig. It barely tangles either.  I just don&#x27;t like the wait but it was well worth it!! Would order again and again. The red is pretty too! :)</li>
    <li> I really love this wig. Although it has no combs and is a little smaller than expected, and the bangs OH THE BANGS ARE LONG, I manage to work with it. I style it up and wear it daily. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Oh. Shipping did take some time but remember it is coming from overseas.</li>
    <li> This wig looks aweful in real life.. Even for a costume I wouldn&#x27;t wear it. I ordered red and I got an ugly orange color and the bangs were all jacked up. You can also very well tell that it is synthetic hair. Looks like plastic.</li>
    <li> Just like described. Looks great on!</li>
    <li> I love this wig, i wear it randomly.  My fiancé loves the color. Definitely a good buy for wig hoarders like myself!</li>
    <li> i used for a custom, very nice, silky and shiny i will recommend it for anyone who wants a cheap price and a good product at the same time.</li>
    <li> does not look nothing like picture but you get what u pay for huh...</li>
    <li> BEST WIG I HAVE EVER GOTTEN!!!! this wig does not tangle at all and when it does grow a few tangles i can easily run my fingers through it and its fine :D i have about 10 wigs and this one is the one that does not tangle like the rest and sinse there are multiple colors i can defently gerentee you can find the long haired wig you need...the color is so BEAUTIFUL a little bit lighter then the picture but i like that version better then the picture. GET THIS WIG ITS AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> bought for poison ivy costume at comiccon BUT did not go. wore out a few times but felt i looked like a crazy person/hoodrat. i love how vibrant it is and how extremely long it is but im already red/orange tone so i shouldve gotten a diff color wig. tangles VERY easy, white wig cap/net shows no matter which way you wear the hair which is a big deal because it looks tacky...its because the wig is SO THIN. it was great for the costume. redder than i expected. should have left it at costume only (i had to try)</li>
    <li> Okay this is the first wig I have ever bought. I looked at many reviews and different types of wigs and I ended up picking this one.I bought this wig to complete a costume and I would not consider it for every day use because it is a very bright red. I was a little sad by the color, but the lighting in the picture could be the cause for the color difference. It is more of a bright red like the little mermaid from Disney. It does get frizzy, which I expected. My solution is just a little light hair spray before going out to make it not so bad. This wig is very long which looked amazing and it fit perfectly (I do not have a very big head tho).</li>
    <li> Nice wig if you keep it in good condition</li>
    <li> Cons: it does tangle pretty easily (I&#x27;m sure there are products for synthetic hair to help reduce that though). It was kind of tight, I atretched it out but kind of oversid it (my fault entirely, not the product). Once it started losing its curls/waves I had to straighten it and keep it straight.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it looks realistic (on me anyway-I got the Red Wine one and its a veey bright and vibrant red, the shine makes it look freshly dyed)- I literally had people thinking it was real hair (my hair&#x27;s about shouder length) when I wore it in a low ponytail to work. I used about 310°F on my straightener and it was indeed heat-resistant. Its very pretty and you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth and then some with this.</li>
    <li> I only used this once because each time you wear it, strands of hair fall out. otherwise its good quality.</li>
    <li> The hair is soft and beautiful, shiny, silky, and extremely long but it does have a few cons. It does tend to tangle if your not careful and the curls do fall out. It&#x27;s also thin so u have to make sure the cap doesn&#x27;t show. Apart from that I love it!! Have no regrets at all!</li>
    <li> Very thin, can see the netting on top. Can&#x27;t brush threw it at all. I would NOT recommend this item.</li>
    <li> My daughter was searching the web one evening and found your website. She called me to see what beautiful wigs these are.. I like the fact that it is heat resistant. I like the color too. I sent your site to another person.</li>
    <li> This wig came a lot faster than expected and it was accurate to the picture. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Feels like real human hair and looks fab.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for an Ariel costume the quality was fine but the color appears darker in the this sample photo and the description also says dark red which I expected it to be but it wasnt as dark</li>
    <li> The wig came in about 20 days. I was really worried it wouldn&#x27;t get here on time but the sellers were so friendly and assured me it would. The wig is nice it just looks a little doll like. I would reccomend it for a costume but maybe not for everyday wear. The wig is pretty curly and the color is really nice. The hair is SO soft. I am not sure how well it works with a straightner or curler. The wig definitely needs a bit of styling.</li>
    <li> The color was a bit brighter than the picture, but overall it did what I needed it to.  I used it for Halloween, this is the only time this type of wig should be worn, or unless you&#x27;re part of a play, act, etc...&lt;br /&gt;The picture here is a toned down version of the wig I received as far as the color goes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my little mermaid costume. I couldn&#x27;t find one in town so decided to do an online purchase. I did expedited shipping since it comes from overseas and I didn&#x27;t want to risk not getting it on time for a halloween party I was going to. After all the shipping cost more than the wig itself but I was sooooo happy with my purchase and it got here in about 3 days!! The color is exactly as pictured and it has really pretty curls. The curls were a bit messy but nothing you can&#x27;t fix with some smoothing oil. The night I wore it I got so many compliments and girls thought it was my hair. I would purchase again for another event!</li>
    <li> Nice wig, long and curly... but the red is not as maroon as in the pic.  It is a brighter red, which is ok because it is for Ariel, but still.  Not same color as pic.</li>
    <li> More fruit punch bright red than in the picture. Not as dark.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this wig for the price ! I was afraid that it would not get here I time , I was ordering it for a costume for Halloween, but it shipped the next day and I recieved it in about a week ! The only thing is I ordered the dark red, and in the pic it seems more brighter than mine is. But it&#x27;s very pretty and worth the money!</li>
    <li> Quality wigs are expensive and the pictures show very nice wigs for a very low price. I decided to check the quality with a single order and I ordered a beautiful red wig from seller for an event I was attending in costume. I ordered with plenty of time in advance of my event but the item did not arrive in time and I was forced to purchase a very expensive replacement locally for the event. The seller sent me the replacement/second attempt and I received it promptly and the wig is beautiful. Great vivid color, very full, no spots where the cap is visible. Very good quality for very low price. I will 100% purchase again! Thank you.</li>
    <li> First of all... the picture for this product does NO JUSTICE to the wig you recieve. However, I am much more pleased with the wig I recieved than the one in the product picture. The wig I recieved (I will attempt to post a product review picture soon) was long, an orangey fire red, and wavey. Nothing like the picture. BUT, it is a beautiful wig and by far my most favourite wig I own. The wine red wig would be PERFECT  for a little mermaid cosplay or everyday wear! I can not fathom how much I love this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Soft&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful red colour&lt;br /&gt;-long and wavey&lt;br /&gt;-everyone thinks its my real hair!&lt;br /&gt;-whenever I wear this wig I am drowned in compliments&lt;br /&gt;-arrived in 2 DAYS??? I had no idea ho wit shipped so fast (I chose regular shipping) but i&#x27;m totally grateful&lt;br /&gt;-SO SOFT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-product picture does no justice&lt;br /&gt;-not true to described colour&lt;br /&gt;-tangles fairly easy (but that is expected)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definatley recommend this wig if you are looking for what I recieved but not if you want what is described and shown by the seller. Hope this helped, happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Love this wig. There is a little bit of shedding but that&#x27;s to be expected on longer wigs, would definitely by from them again.</li>
    <li> The bad: this wig should be thicker for how long it is. It can look a little stringy. It was also kind of frizzy and much less curly than it is in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: it is heat resistant and I was able to make mine look thicker by curling it. I used my straightner on low heat and then wrapped the hot sections around my finger til it cooled down. It makes a really pretty curl and the wig looked great afterward! (Hot rollers work too.) No more frizz. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend and there was a high quality for the price it&#x27;s going for. \</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig for the price. It&#x27;s not as curly as it is in the picture, and it&#x27;s a lot brighter. But otherwise I love it! Really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
    <li> This wig is exactly what it looks like in the picture the only thing is if you want to file the wig with the things back instead of in-your-face the way Would be showing for sure. But overall great quality especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Soooo disappointed about this wig bought it because of the great reviews and it looked soo pretty in the picture but its nothing like that. Gets tangeled very easily very poor quality and don&#x27;t even get me started on the color defiently not dark red more like dark orange.</li>
    <li> I got this wig more than 2 weeks before the estimated arrival date, and after reading some of the reviews I was rather prepared to be disappointed with the product but wanted to see for myself, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This wig is very full, the curls are bouncy, and can be easily separated with a wig brush, the color is just as it&#x27;s pictured, maybe a bit darker but it&#x27;s not by much, and it the adjustable cap on the inside makes it a comfy fit.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it also came with a separate wig liner, so that was a plus!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be wearing this wig often I&#x27;m sure, very pleased, I would definitely recommend it! I&#x27;ll be buying more colors now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m supper pleased with is wig! Shipping was fast and it came with 2 free stocking caps. I got this for my little Mermaid costume and I was perfect!</li>
    <li> This is hands down, the best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I purchased it for a cosplay from a small manga called Orange Crows, for a character named Natalie Batsgrave. (If you look up this name on google images, I am the first image to pop up and the first web link, so you can see the wig in action) I am not exactly nice to my wigs, and this one has stood up to the challenge through 6 full days of cosplaying on different occasions, and surviving my suitcase. Hardly any tangles, beautiful wig, perfect for any red curly wigged cosplay.</li>
    <li> It is very thin and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture the red is a lot brighter.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality wig, however it is a much lighter shade of red than in the photos.. also the ends are wavy with no curls :(</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastic! I really didn&#x27;t know it would be this soft and managable! The color was accurately portrayed with the picture provided and it was gorgeous btw. I got a hundred compliments at the event and a few people asking if it was my real hair dyed (i have very long hair)</li>
