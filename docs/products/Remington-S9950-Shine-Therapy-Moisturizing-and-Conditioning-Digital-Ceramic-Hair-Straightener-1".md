<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thus hair straightener is well worth the price and makes my hair soft and shinnie !!! I live it do much that this is my second purchase :) I&#x27;m going to keep this one in my suite case fir traveling as I never want to be with out it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it. It makes her hair smooth and silky with just one pass through. When she wants a light bend in her bangs it, she just turns her wrist slightly and BOOM there it is.</li>
    <li> It could be found cheaper.</li>
    <li> I recommended it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Remington is doing themselves a real disservice by calling this a straightener. The size and shape of the barrel allows it to do everything my Sedu does, and nearly just as well. I was able to use it for volume, root lift, curls and waves. It also added a lot of shine.</li>
    <li> My daughter has beautiful long hair and I had experienced difficulties with styling tool in the past, until now. This flat iron is awesome. It straightens quickly and has visible temp setting which can be locked in so you won&#x27;t change the temp. By mistake.</li>
    <li> Runs through hair very smoothly without snagging and leaves hair looking smooth.  Much nicer to use than my previous straightener which cost six times the price.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener because it works so much better than my old metal plate straightener.  It makes your hair smoother and less frizzy. I like this item but I do wish I had bought a remington model with longer and wider plates.  I also don&#x27;t like the lock on this particular model, because it is kind of hard to operate.  I bought this model after using a friends Remington, but it was a different model.  It was black and white.</li>
    <li> Great, the best undoubtedly brought everything indicated by the publication, is great quality, has exceeded my expectations. Great buy. From Venezuela recommend</li>
    <li> This is terrific!!! I am so glad I got this and my hair looks wonderful. So soft and shinny. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Walmart in October. It worked great until the last couple of weeks. It turns on just fine, heats up, then as soon as you put it to hair it would cut right off. It would cut off maybe 30 times before I was finished! I had a straightener from Sally Beauty for 7 years before this one!!! It would have been much smarter to go ahead and spend $20 more for a product that would last years instead of months. ! Its sharp and straightens well, but has zero long term quality! Do your self a favor, Dont buy this product!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on flat irons before purchasing this one.  It has so many good reviews, and the price was pretty good.  I bought this last week, and this week, it&#x27;s going back.  My 2 year old $15 Andis flat iron from Walmart still out does this product.  My Andis makes my hair smooth and straight, this thing made my hair look like I stuck my finger in a light socket!!  I can&#x27;t believe so many people love this thing.  I can&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener yesterday, looking for a Remington because it&#x27;s the only kind that has worked for me, I got my first Remington a year ago after trying 6 different straighteners that year, and to this day it still works great but i wanted to try this one out because of the vitamin E &amp; Avocado oil infused plates. When I got home I tried it out and fell in love with it immediately I love the way it glides through your hair and leaves your hair impeccably straight and last through the night, I still haven&#x27;t tried curling it but I am confident it won&#x27;t be a problem. [:  BTW: I have thin, wavy shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I researched several flat irons until I came across this one.  For the price and the good reviews I thought I would give it a try.  I am very happy with it.  The previous review described everything to a T.  I have very thick, coarse hair and that makes it hard for me to straighten it.  I love how smoothly this runs over the hair and how easy it is to use.  My boss even complimented me the next day on how good my hair looked and it takes a lot to get a compliment out of him!  This is a great buy for the price too.  Maybe it&#x27;ll get me a raise!</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 flat irons in the last few years.  One I still have as a backup but it pulls my hair so I dont like to use it.  The other two died at some point.  The last one I bought from a beauty supply store and was supposed to be professional grade and I paid about $50 for it.  It died right after the one year warranty ran out.  It did \\&quot;okay\\&quot; before that.  Now in comparison to this Remington, that professional grade iron gets a \\&quot;C\\&quot; in my book.  This flat iron is wonderful.  The moisturizing ceramic plates really do what they claim to do.  My frizzy ends that I have bought product after product to try to fix are GONE!  No change in product, its this amazing flat iron.  My hair is so soft, shiny and fizz-free.  I have had several people ask me about my hair this week.  One lady thought I had my hair trimmed (no frizzys) but my hair looked longer.  Remington, you have me hooked and I have highly recommended you to anyone who has complemented me on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, curly hair and have tried many different products (straighteners, curling irons, hair dryers) over the years to get it straight.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my curly hair, but sometimes a girl wants options, you know?  I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend after I went to visit her and my third cheapo straightener in a year bit the dust.  I borrowed her Remington straightener and was amazed by how quickly it worked and how straight it got my hair!  It cuts down my styling time by half, at least, as well as eliminating my aggravation!  My hair is ridiculously silky and shiny, which is unusual.  I usually have a good many flyaways or a few kinks with my old straightening iron.  Now, you can&#x27;t even tell my hair is naturally curly when I straighten it.  I love this product and have already recommended it highly to friends and family.  Stop looking, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble finding a hair straightener that would flaten my hair without the frizz or the poof after an hour. I was iffy about getting this one because of it being silver plated and everyone says gold works best. I had a gold plated chi straightener before this one, and I am sooooo much more happier with this one then anyother one i&#x27;ve ever bought in my life. my hair is so thick and wavey its hard to find something that works. it takes me 10 minutes to do my hair now. I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> OMG.... This is by far the best flat iron I have ever used wished I would have know about it sooner... I am an African American woman with natural hair, I have not straighten or permed my hair in over 2 years. So my hair is very virgin kinky, frizzy and hard to straighten. I purchased this product after doing quite a bit of research. I was about to purchase a babyliss, but when I went to get it the store was out, so I picked this one up instead because it had rave reviews. I have to admit I was really skeptical about how good it would work, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at how well it did. My hair is straight!!! It has not been this straight since my last perm. Not only did it straighten my hair it made it shine with almost no product. I used argon oil to blow dry it and that&#x27;s it. My hair is so healthy looking no frizz and it last for days so I don&#x27;t have to add much heat to my hair. I get so many complements on how pretty and shinny it is that I had to tell someone. I myself just can&#x27;t keep my hands out of it. It moves has body and shine... I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap and saved some cash. To top it off it is dual voltage so I can use it here in Portugal and home in the states...thanks Remington...I couldnt ask for more...  If you need a low cost iron that works just as good if not better than some of the more expansive irons this one is for you...I definitely wished I would have known about this sooner. I spent alot of money on CHIs and other exspensive brands that didn&#x27;t make my hair look half as good even with a perm....</li>
    <li> Straightens quickly with shine... quickly heats up and use is easy. Only issue is the buttons- it is easy to accidentally press the button while using to modify the temperature. That&#x27;s a bit annoying...</li>
    <li> Recommended, A+  Excelent, It´s beautiful, it is fine[[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> my wife has been wanting this for the longest and I just got this from woot.com for 17.99, the wife is gonna love it :)</li>
    <li> This is a very good straightener. My only gripe would be that the \\&quot;treatment product\\&quot; makes my hair slightly greasy. My hair is usually dry, so I like the conditioning...but it could probably dial it down a notch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only started using a hair straightener in the last year or so, and the one I had was making me not want to use one. So when I saw this for under $30, I figured it was worth a shot. And I loved the blue color :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived pretty fast (although I do have Prime shipping, so that was expected.) I used it the very next day, and have every day since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It has a power button, so you can turn it off/on instead of just plugging it in or unplugging it. My old one didn&#x27;t, so this was a pro to me. It also says there is a temp lock, but I haven&#x27;t needed to use this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can lock it shut. I like to have it locked closed when heating, because I think it helps to heat faster (doesn&#x27;t let the heat \\&quot;escape\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well. I don&#x27;t need to go over the same strip of hair multiple times for it to be nice and smooth/straight. I also don&#x27;t wind up with frizzy hair part way through the day. It really keeps my hair straightened/flat for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the &#x27;infused plates&#x27; do what they say, but I do love this straightener. I threw out the old one after using this one for a week. And now my daughter has taken to using this one over the one she spent more money one about a month before I bought this one.</li>
    <li> I am the type of girl who is always looking for getting the most from my money. Especially in todays economy. Needless to say, I was in search of a straightener that could give me BETTER results than my salon quality flat iron. I am 110% certain I have found it with this Remington straightener. As soon as I passed it along my hair, I noticed a beautiful shine and my hair felt so sleek and smooth. I was shocked, and needless to say, so was my husband. He noticed the difference it made to my hair right away and would not stop running his hands through it. I didn&#x27;t expect such a great product for only $50.00, but i&#x27;m elated! I&#x27;m even going to buy another one so that I can use it when this one wears out.    The next day at work, 15 coworkers (seriously) came up and asked if I had gotten my hair cut and styled. I laughed each time someone asked because I haven&#x27;t been to the salon in over a month (no lie, who has money to spend and go every week?). I got so many compliments its rediculous. This flat iron left my ends in beautiful shape. My CHI tends to make it look dull and coarse because it is a basic one w/no settings.    My hair is super thick and can get coarse sometimes. Being able to set the temperature was a HUGE factor in buying this product, and the added benefit of the Avocado Oil is what made me go out and buy it. It looks so great and is lightweight yet effective.     I agree with the iron getting too hot to hold so I grasp it close to the bottom where the cord is. I don&#x27;t have any weird smells and I get no pleats in my hair because i don&#x27;t leave it in one spot for more than 1.5 seconds. I run it through.    I would recommend this iron to EVERYONE. If you think it isn&#x27;t working for you, play around with the heat settings as that may be the issue.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as my old one, a much more expensive brand, but doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out as badly.  This is my straightener of choice now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and color my hair to cover the grey and have medium-fine wavy hair with a constant battle with the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve tried less expensive and much more expensive hair straighteners and been disappointed.  It was such a great surprise to have actually found a hair straightener that actually DOES WHAT IT PURPORTS!!!  It attacks the frizzies and actually lasts, even with our high humidity.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and definitely feel that I got more than my monies worth.  I would definitely recommend it, especially to those of you who have been searching for a hair straightener that ACTUALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I was a bit skeptical about trying yet another product that claimed to work. But I love it! I only have to go over each section once! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife claims the Remington S9950 works just as well as her CHI straightener which costs nearly double the price of this straightener. The unit heats up quickly and glides very smoothly over her naturally wavy and thick hair. She likes the \\&quot;floating\\&quot; plates which have a bouncy play while pressed together. And yes, I can also personally confirm it smells a little \\&quot;funny\\&quot; while its in use, but leaves no permanent odors.</li>
    <li> This is a very efficient product from rRemington. Works like a charm, takes less time compared to my older version from Remington. Also true to its name, there is more shine. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. Heats up fast and leaves my hair silky straight. I had two CHI&#x27;s before this one and I would say its quite good or even better than the CHI.</li>
    <li> Got it yesterday.  Washed, conditioned, and air-dried hair to do a comparison of this versus my Solia.  I have long, relaxed hair.  Used two heat protectants--Studio Line cream and TreSemme spray concentrated on ends.    First thing is that the plates do not meet evenly.  When closed to just meet, they only do so on one end.  When pressed to close completely, they only meet in the center of the plates.  Each end has a 1/8\\&quot; gap.  I&#x27;m hoping to get to Ulta or wherever and find a unit that does not have this problem.  My Solia also does that \\&quot;only on one end\\&quot; thing, so that&#x27;s 1 strike against both of them.  However, both can be closed to a degree where there is an even gap the entire length of the plates, but a section of hair that thick would be ridiculous.    Did one section with the Solia at my preferred temp of 180 deg F, pretty nice.  Now therein lies the second problem with the Remington.  The lowest temperature setting is 300 deg F.  I think that&#x27;s entirely too high for my relaxed ends.  It takes care to retain your added new growth so hair keeps getting longer ALL THE WHILE KEEPING UP WITH TOUCHUPS.    Three hundred degrees is fine for my new growth (beautiful), but 180 to 250 deg on the Solia did a beautiful job too.  I&#x27;ll go up to 250 on the Solia depending on how straight and smooth I want my hair.  And I&#x27;m not so worried about sweeping that past my ends once or twice per month.  That&#x27;s how rarely I use heat on my hair :)    So during that pass, I ended up pressing the increase temp button ALL THE WAY to the max 430 deg F!  I&#x27;m thinking, \\&quot;This can&#x27;t be it.\\&quot;  So I checked the instructions further, and you can LOCK THE TEMP by pressing and holding the minus/decrease button until the padlock appears in the display.  That worked.  AND you can&#x27;t even turn it off without unlocking it--same procedure.    Anyway, 300 degrees with this iron gave silky, smooth, and soft results--unrelaxed new growth on down!    Now, the snagging.  Solia snags my hair more than it should.  It happens when I&#x27;m doing the blind straightening I have to do at the back of my head.  With not being able to see, the iron needs to open more than the Solia does.  The Remington opens 3/4\\&quot; more than the Solia.  I don&#x27;t know what it is in degrees but it&#x27;s a real difference-maker.  The Remington only truly snagged one strand.  A couple more got caught, but that was TOTALLY me.  Didn&#x27;t lose the strands, though.    I am SO glad Remington is a good replacement for the Solia--so far.  My second time using the Solia, it didn&#x27;t heat up like it did the first time.  I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks and have used it as many times.  Not having that issue with the Remington, but we&#x27;ll see.    So if I find A Remington where the plates meet properly, I&#x27;ll be a THRILLED camper.  Otherwise, my search for a good flat iron will continue.    And I&#x27;m not getting this smell some others are.  But then they may not be having (or care about) the plates meeting issue I&#x27;m having.  Oh well.    *****OK.  Went to Ulta.  They had two.  Tried both of them for the plates meeting.  Both had different degrees of uneveness.  So, design/quality control problem, but I&#x27;m too in love with the results so something is more right than anything else is wrong.  It&#x27;s a keeper for now :)</li>
    <li> My future wife loves this straightener.  The old one she had was 5-8 years old.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and it straightens so fast and easily.  My hair has less frizz and straighter than my last one.  Best buy on a straightner.</li>
    <li> I researched hair straighteners quite a bit before taking the plunge.  This iron is so easy to use and I love how healthy and shiny my hair looks after using it.</li>
    <li> I like using straightening irons but honestly half the time when I&#x27;m getting ready to leave the in the morning my hair is still semi-wet, in order for it to work properly the hair must be dry so that&#x27;s the only obstacle that I can think of when using straightening irons. When my hair is dry, I like to use it when mood strikes but the results are worth even the small effort. I love the sleek and edgy look it gives to my locks, and its funny how most people notice a difference, I definitely get compliments on my hair when I use it.    This iron is really great, especially for the price. It heats up fast and is pretty powerful, sometimes I run it through the hair a few times, front to back and for no more than 45 seconds total, it really doesn&#x27;t take long to make the hair sleek and shiny. I think the avocado strip is a nice idea, it smells funny but it makes the hair glossier and it stays sleek for a long time. I haven&#x27;t notice any damage yet but then again I don&#x27;t do this every day, more like a few times a month. Great buy for something that makes a difference and can add a certain glamour to hair, and I always feel little prettier when I use it.</li>
    <li> A great little flat iron!  Works great on my coarse thick short hair, and is perfect size for travel!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure -- I don&#x27;t use this myself, however the recipient of the straightener tells me that indeed, it straightens hair. Taking only a few minutes to reach optimal straightening temperature, it&#x27;s well formed for easy gripping. Nice large heat area to get the job done swiftly. After regular use for the past few months no problems reported.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Chi flat iron for a few years which I love.  I was excited to try out this Remington when offered the opportunity.  Here are my thoughts in comparing the two:    Pros:  (1) The Remington has a temperature setting which is nice (though I don&#x27;t think it needs to go as high as it does -- it would seem to fry your hair at the highest setting). My Chi only has one setting.  (2)  The Remington does a great job straightening the hair, probably equal to that of the Chi  (3)  The price of the Remington is fabulous.  Chi&#x27;s are expensive.    Cons:  (1)  The smell of the Remington is awful.  I think it is the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; they use.  I would have preferred to do without this and stick with using my own product.  The smell stays with you all day.  (2)  The buttons are in an awkward place -- you will have to lock the heat setting before use or else you will find yourself inadvertantly adjusting the setting as you use the iron.  (3)  If you ever use a flat iron to make soft curls, this iron does not do a very good job.  It can do tighter, spiraled curls but, after a month and a half of trying, I have found that I must stick to my Chi for the soft curled look.  It might have something to do with the moving plates (which I don&#x27;t find overly useful).  (4)  I don&#x27;t think the Remington does much for \\&quot;shine therapy\\&quot;, as it is advertised.  I only used the middle setting so maybe lower heat would offer more shine (and similarly, I would think the highest heat would fry and dull the hair).    All in all, I think the Remington is a good substitute for someone who does not want to spend the money on a Chi.  I still use my Chi much more than this Remington but still think the Remington is a bargain, particularly for those who strictly use flat irons for straightening.</li>
    <li> What I liked the most about this flat iron is that my hair didn&#x27;t seem to frizz up as much between uses in comparison to my Solia. It doesn&#x27;t give me the smoothness that I get from the Solia, but my hair was still very soft and healthy looking and stayed that way until I washed it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the temperature settings (how hot it gets) and how quickly it heats up. The casing did run a little hot, a lot hotter than my Solia, especially towards the tip, but it didn&#x27;t burn me in any way, so it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not crazy about the temperature buttons. I like the nice digital display and the ease of use, but the first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t know I could lock the keys so I was constantly hitting the buttons and changing the temperature while I was doing my hair. It&#x27;s not a big deal, especially since it does lock, it was just a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I don&#x27;t like about this flat iron was that the side would sometimes leave a print in my hair and I would have to go over that spot again a couple of times to get rid of it. If it wasn&#x27;t for that and the fact that I get a smoother look with my Solia, I would have given have it 5 stars, minor nuances aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say that this is a good flat iron and a good buy for those not wanting to pay a hundred dollars more for a more professional grade flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  It has adjustable heat settings. It leaves my hair perfectly straight and shiny.  It is easy to use.  I can straighten my hair one day, sleep on it and it will still be perfect the next morning.  It will take some getting used to to not accidentally bump the buttons..during use. But I&#x27;m getting used to the buttons the more I use it.  It is a great buy and pretty inexpensive for how awesome it is!</li>
    <li> professional quality ive had this for soooo long now and it works just as good as the first day I got it</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin, slightly wavy hair. The first few times I used this iron, I liked it. I read several flat iron reviews before purchasing a new flat iron and decided to go with this one. The reviews seemed to be true...it made my hair silky. However, after the first handful of uses, it has made my hair very dry and increases my split ends and breakage drastically. I always use a product to protect my hair from heat tools before using this or other irons, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with this iron. Even though it does straighten my hair well, it makes my hair feel like straw (not attractive looking either!)    I was trying to save money by going with this one, but I&#x27;m disappointed. My next flat iron will be a Chi.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! This straightener Conditions and Moisturizes During Styling for Instantly Noticeable Healthier Looking Hair with More Shine and Less Frizz. My hair has never looked better! I will be buying a lot more Remington products in the future.     This straightener is great: It heats up fast to high temps of 430 degrees! I love that the plates are infused with avocado oil. My hair looks healthy and shiny!     I definately like the Automatic 1 Hour Safety Shutoff feature; I always used to worry that I forgot to turn my old flat iron off!    Other great things about this product are its Cool Tip, Swivel Cord, Hinge Lock, and 4 year warranty! I will be back for more!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite straightening iron ever!  I have curly/frizzy yet fine hair and this worked perfectly!  I have used other cheaper irons in the past, but this is worth the money!  My hair stays straigh all day- even in the fog.  It only takes a few minutes to straighten my hair now too.  The infused floating plates are awesome also!  My hairs is very shiny and straight!    Definite buy!</li>
    <li> ITS JUST RIGHT! NO DOUBTS OF ITS PERFECTION!&lt;br /&gt;I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT. U WONT REGRET IT, ITS JUST UNIQUE! :D</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help with a bit of friz and a flip in the back.  This product works perfectly for both.  It is easy to use (I&#x27;m not good with hair products or appliances) and does the job!</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant about ordering, but I ordered anyway - and now I am glad I did.  This flat iron is wonderful.  It is easy to use, gets really hot and heats quickly.  Leaves my hair smooth and shiny!  Some one mentioned the buttons being in a position where it was nearly impossible to not touch them.  I read the directions and you can lock your temperature selection so you don&#x27;t have to worry about hitting the buttons accidentally.  I have short hair so I use this to curl my hair a bit - does wonders and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Works just like the Chi my hairdresser uses when she fixes my hair.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Nice product, nice price</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for a few years. Last winter I used it almost everyday because it was incredibly cold in NY and wet curly hair was NOT an option. It works great. I have curly thick hair(think Sarah Jessica Parker/Heather Graham). when it came to spring time i decided i no longer wanted to have straight hair everyday.... that is when i discovered that the front of my hair was broken. my hair was pin straight in the front. It is growing out and it is awkward looking but it is slowly getting better. I have the T-Zone from Remington and I use that occasionally but honestly after this experience I am scared to REALLY straighten my hair. I know my hair well and i know where the worst curl is and I put this flat iron up to 430 and it worked. my hair was shiny and straight as can be but yeah.. the residue affects are not worth it. I would be careful with the heat setting and using this iron every day.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the god of all flat irons! it makes my crazy curly hair straight and it cut my time literally in half!!! i highly suggest it!</li>
    <li> I have a Remington S-9400 and it works great, eventhough the other day my roomate used her Remington S9950 on my hair and I love it! I mean, it had a healthy shine, very straigth and also very soft. I am considering buy this one as soon as possible!</li>
    <li> This iron left my hair nice and smooth.  I did note that it&#x27;s default temperature is much higher than that of my other flat iron and it takes a bit longer to heat up.  But, it does a great job and my hair doesn&#x27;t seem damaged by the heat...it&#x27;s left flat and smooth.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Remington Style therapy and was amazed at the results. Its definitely a good buy for its price. Its also running on sale in Target. Here are the pros and cons:    Pros:  1)Results in wonderful naturally shiny hair unlike other straightners for the same price that give you a frizzy look.  2)Fast heating and temperature lock feature disables accidental changes while using the flat iron  3)Floating heat plates, DOES NOT PULL ON HAIR, I am so glad to have come across an affordable styler which doesn&#x27;t pull. Most that are available in stores with embedded heat plate design end up pulling hair and damaging it.  4)Multiple temperature settings.  5)Light weight and stylish design, glides smoooothly through hair!    Cons:  Nothing that I can think of.     Some people tend to use the highest temperature setting to get the best results. I would recommend using the lowest setting first to see it that should suffice. I have wavy/curly hair and the lowest did a great job and was able to keep my hair straight for 2 days.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week and my hair seems to be a little brittle at the ends.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is this iron, or the new heat protectant isn&#x27;t working.  I guess time will tell!  Overall it seems to be pretty good.    UPDATE - This iron seems to be much better than my last one.  I think it was the heat protectant that wasn&#x27;t protecting my hair, so I have swtiched back to Biosilk (hair feels silky again!).  I think this iron is better than most for the price :)</li>
    <li> I have slightly damaged color treated hair but it&#x27;s a lot more healthy after I stopped color treating it. It&#x27;s texture is wavy/curly and very frizzy if I don&#x27;t straighten it or take the time to curl it.   I&#x27;ve used expensive straighteners like chi and sedu. They worked well but are very expensive. This particular straightener does the job and is budget friendly, light weight, nice temperatures and really straightens your hair.  What I really like about this product is that it has a digital computer to show the temperature and that you can lock the temperature you want it to stay at.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to ladies on a budget who have frizzy, hard to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 star because this hair straightener tends to get too hot when you hold it.  The digital temperature setting is a plus.  Again, when you set it to the higher setting it gets to hot to hold.  Another thing is there is always a burnt oil scent whenever you use it. It straightens pretty well and stays straightened all day. You get what you pay for.  Not to mention this is pretty light straightener.  Overall I like what I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I used to work in a salon for about 10 years. I had the best products the industry sold and over time, have tried it all. This item isn&#x27;t professional grade, but it&#x27;s close to it! I have a $150 ceramic flat iron and I love it but it&#x27;s too bulky to pack and up for travel and takes a few minutes to heat up. This flat iron is quick, and does the shop in less than a minute! I have horrible frizzy bangs that take about 15 minutes to blow dry, flat iron and add some product. I finally found a product that beats all that time. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it doesn&#x27;t give my coarse hair as much shine as the professional flat iron, but for the price, this is worth it!</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for awhile. And i straighten my hair EVERYDAY for school. Sometimes when i turn it on it will flash on and off like its heating up like normal. Once i turn around and do something else and look back it will be off. It stops heating up out of nowhere and shuts off. But thats only sometimes. And onece i try it a couple more times it works. But otherwise it is a AMAZINN straighnter!!!!!!:))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been saving to buy a more expensive, \\&quot;professional\\&quot; straightener as mine as nearing the end of its life. I would always be frustrated after leaving the salon, because when I straightened my hair at home it NEVER looked the same. My hair is thick, coarse, and somewhere between frizzy and wavy. No matter how much time I spent straightening, it never looked as sleek or straight as it did the one day every few months when I got my hair trimmed...until I bought this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical. My hair has been a hassle all my life. This straightener is AMAZING! With one swipe, my hair is smoother and straighter than it ever was with my old one-even after many swipes. I&#x27;ve been struggling lately with it being extremely dry (probably due to constant drying and straightening), and even my husband commented how my hair just \\&quot;feels softer\\&quot; now. My hair looks the best it has in years. I VERY HIGHLY recommend this product!! And the best part is, I bought it on Amazon&#x27;s Gold Box Deal of the Day-so instead of spending over $100, I only spent $22. I love a great deal!</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the flat irons in the market.  This one seems to be the best regarding freezes and leaves your hair smother than the others.  I bought 2 of them, one for me and one for a gift.</li>
    <li> Compre este producto para mi esposa, esta muy satisfecha con el mismo, funciona a la perfeccion y recomiendo a este vendedor y a este producto</li>
    <li> i am happy with this- wife thinks it works well and after she left her other one on all day for the 3rd or 4th time i smashed it-  and bought this auto shut off model-</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener at Target after having ordered the S9951 here on Amazon.  Unfortunately, the seller of the S9951 could not ship it for some odd reason.  Thankfully, Amazon contacted me to let me know they&#x27;d removed the pending charge from my account because of this less than desirable seller (ANTOnline, for those of you considering purchasing from them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and extremely frizzy.  I wished for a straightener that could give me the same results I get at the salon when the stylist straightens my hair.  This product is pretty darned close.  I use the highest setting because my hair is &#x27;difficult&#x27; and the effect is amazing.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and straight...but not that odd stiff straight you sometimes see with straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;I had to get used to using this straightener because it glides SO easily through my hair I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much.  With my old straightener I had to grip it so hard to get a really good &#x27;press&#x27; on my hair.  This one is so smooth it&#x27;s amazing.  It took me a lot less time than usual to do my hair, even with just learning the ins and outs of a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very best feature of this straightener is that my hair STAYS straight.  I have a condition called cranial hyperhidrosis, which is basically having a scalp that sweats easily and sometimes profusely.  When I have a &#x27;sweating attack&#x27; the underside of my hair gets very damp.  With any other straightener it&#x27;s like my hair is back to its post shower state...when it dries it is frizzy and hideous.&lt;br /&gt;After using this straightener though even if I sweat my hair stays nice and straight.  That is a HUGE thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this product a winner and at a very reasonable price since my stylist recommended a CHI or Paul Mitchell straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it stated it moisturizers the hair.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Was I surprised!!!  My hair looks so good!  It looks healthy.  I liked it SO much I called my neighbor&#x27;s children over to wash their hair just so I could use the flat iron.  OMG!  Their hair looks spectacular!  I gave the 12 year old the cutest 50 year old hair do (the only style I know)!  But really every person&#x27;s hair I used this on, the hair looked shiny and fabulous.... And no burnt hair smell!  I really like this iron!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron during a Gold Box deal of the day.  For $22, this flat iron works great.  But the best thing is that in my opinion, it works as well as my $150 flat iron. It has specific temperature settings and not only that, but it&#x27;s digital and on the outside rather than the usual temperature setting knob on the inside of the flat iron, allowing you to see what temp you have it set on.  Fast heat up, very smooth - doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all.  My hair is smooth, straight and very shiny after I&#x27;m done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this flat iron and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using a ceramic hair straightener (X brand ) before this. I have wavy to curly hair(coarse and thick) and I absolutely hated straightening my locks coz of the reason tht the X straightener left them very coarse and if I would sleep, hair would lose their shape altogether and turn their ends outside. So I always put some gel so that my waves /curls wud seem to be more defined and just not straighten them at all. I kept telling people that nobody can ever straighten my hair coz they will not remain straight after a while and yearn to come back to their own ugly shape. I just bought this product out of a curosity as I was getting a deal. I tried it just for the heck of it. And only then I realized in what nightmare and false beliefs I was living throughout my life. I straightened 1 lock and it turned out absolutely smooth and silky. My hair is not naturally silky. I did my hair and this is my 5 day. They are still as smooth as first day and people are asking me if I had got chemical straightening done . They are just softer and silkier than before. I dont know if it is the avocado oil or the product. But I love it. Hair just seem naturally softer. People can see they r more soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this. I am just sad why didn&#x27;t I find it before.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener for alot of reasons. First, it&#x27;s very light and small. Second, it gets very hot within seconds so i can straighten my hair in 5 minutes. Third, it makes my hair shiny and healthy. Fourth, it makes my thick,big,coarse hair feel &amp; look thinner! I love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had this straightener for only 3 weeks before it just stopped working on me. Before that I had a Nano Silver Ceramic straightener that was more expensive but last me 3 years of every day use. For almost $50 dollars you would think you&#x27;d get a better product (I usually opt to pay more with straightener because I know I use them every day heavily). It worked fine up until the point it just died on me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this brand to anyone else. I&#x27;m now going to purchase another Nano Silver Ceramic, which I should have done to begin with. :(</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair &amp; have tried many brands below the $120 range. This is by far the best. It heats quickly &amp; straightens hair fast. It&#x27;s much cheaper than the several hundred $ &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; straighteners but considering how fast this Remington is, I cannot imagine the &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; straighteners could do much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: when you&#x27;re not in a hurry, practice with the heat temp setting &amp; the amount of time it&#x27;ll take to straighten a section. Because my hair is so thick &amp; admittedly because of Remington&#x27;s low cost, I&#x27;d foolishly assumed it would take longer than was actually required. Don&#x27;t go slow, as I did, or it&#x27;ll leave crimp marks. Start off straightening a section quickly &amp; adjust if needed. Also, invest in one of those heat-resistant thing-a-ma-jiggys (the name of it eludes me right now) to lay the iron on or in a pinch, use 2 layers of heavy duty foil.</li>
    <li> My sister has been using this for a while now and she likes it. She feels that its light weight, easy to use. She said it does get very hot and you need to be careful. Also don&#x27;t hold it on your hair too long as it will burn your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to use a smooth, non-stop, slow moving motion, this way your not letting the iron sit on your hair in one section too long as it will burn it. Heat up time is quick and the iron stays very hot. There is a slight oder from both your hair and the special avocado oil pads the iron has but its not that bad. Her hair was also very shinny after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has long hair and she said it didn&#x27;t snag or pull. She did say that you have to be careful how hard you clamp it because if you use too much pressure the hair doesn&#x27;t slide as easy and you get crimp marks so again to use even pressure and slide it over the hair in an easy motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great hair iron.</li>
    <li> contrary to many other reviewers, my straightener did not smell badly. I didn&#x27;t smell anything out of the extraordinary. It heats up well, and lets me know when it&#x27;s done. You can lock the temperature, and it glides through my hair really nicely. I was very pleasantly surprised by this. At first, I thought it&#x27;s just a pretty piece of machinery; I didn&#x27;t think it would work well at all - I thought it would catch my hair, smell bad, burn my hair with whatever avacado oil it comes with... but none of that happened. I ended up with nicely straightened hair. I set the temperature at around 390 degrees, and I have Asian black hair with a hint of natural (non-dyed) brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this, but of course, as frugal as I am, I would not recommend anybody spending more than $50 on a piece of styling product.</li>
    <li> I like this iron, but I&#x27;ve had others I liked better. The biggest turn-off (so to speak) is the button placement. It&#x27;s really akward. It is VERY nice and good to note you can lock the temp. So if you&#x27;re reading this- now you know. I didn&#x27;t and kept turning it off and things like that.    This thing does heat up REALLY fast. Probably faster than any other iron I&#x27;ve had. That&#x27;s also very nice.    It&#x27;s also very cute, although that&#x27;s a matter of taste and probably not a good reason to buy this.     The plates are a lot bigger than the ones I&#x27;m used to, so it took a bit of doing to get accustomed. Some people said theirs had a weird smell. Mine doesn&#x27;t- although it&#x27;s common for them to start to smell a little burny if hair gets trapped in it. You won&#x27;t notice the hair gets caught in it- it&#x27;s just in little crevaces in the plates. Trust me- it happens. Nothing to worry about though.</li>
    <li> This is my third iron in 2 years. This one works just as well or better then the expensive ones I have over 150 dollars. Your hair will be silky smooth and stay that way just like when you get it done.   The reviews point out 2 issues the user of this iron has to deal with to get best results.    1. It is easy to hit the buttons by mistake as you use it. So put your temp chosen on lock. You hold the plus minus button down until you see a lock.It is in the instructions so be sure to read them    2. The plates are supposed to float.It did not bother me at all but you may want to practice on  a low setting or not turned on at all, if it is an issue for you.    It is a great product that leaves my course ( from gray covered by color over 10 years)  hair really looking hairdresser good.</li>
    <li> This product works fine to straighten hair.  I like the narrow plates so it is easier to use and less clumsy than a wider plate straightener.  I was able to flip up or under the ends of my hair, similar to using a curing iron.  This product heats up very quickly.  It also does not take up much room for storage.    I do not like the position of the buttons, as they are located right where one holds the iron (holding the iron any closer to the plates would result in burned fingers).  Thus straightener gets very hot, making me wonder how much damage is occuring to my hair.  I could not tell if the avocado oil/conditioners do anything.  The knob to lock the plates together is difficult to turn, especially if you don&#x27;t want to break a fingernail.    Overall a decent product and probably a pretty good value compared to the high buck salon brands.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different straighteners and this tops them all.&lt;br /&gt; After my sister took the professional straightener my mom bought for us, I had to go out and get my own. I actually bought it because of the pretty light blue color, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have bad to say is that the cord is not long enough.</li>
    <li> The low down - One amazing flat iron.  Great product for the price, works like something I&#x27;d expect to be at least $100.  It heats up quickly and begins to straighten my hair after just the first stroke.  I have shoulder length dark brown hair which is extremely thick and curly (and I mean THICK, I have hair that is so thick it&#x27;s hard to braid or put into a pony tail).  My hair is naturally curly which makes it thicker and easily tangles. If it works on my hair it&#x27;ll work on any hair.  I use it at the lowest setting it starts up at which is 390 degrees and it works great at that temp, I&#x27;ve rarely had to turn the heat up.  My hair also has some dryness and frizz issues which shampoo doesn&#x27;t help no matter what-this flat iron cures everything for me.  It makes my hair silky &amp; shiny and makes the tangles more manageable and makes it thinner &amp; flatter which makes it easier for me to braid or put in a pony tail if I want to though I usually wear my hair down.  I have to wear a small glove on my left hand so I don&#x27;t burn my hand on my hair (I hold the iron in my right hand), it does get that hot and will make your hair extremely hot for a few seconds afterwards so beware it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself on this iron.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out, doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy.  I use Got2b flat iron spray on my hair before &amp; after which enhances the shine, I recommend this stuff to everyone.  Only thing I have not done is try to put curls in my hair with this iron, I have been hesitant to do this since I&#x27;m worried about burning my hair if I keep the iron in one place for longer than 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Flattens even the thickest, curliest, unruliest hair perfectly and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produces a beautiful silky shine &amp; sheen on the hair without frizz or burnt hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not dry out my hair no matter how many times during the day I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can make my hair appear to be clean or just washed if I should skip a day or two of washing my hair, a nice quick fix if I&#x27;m going out with slightly dirty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No undesireable odor of burnt hair or the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; smell of a hot iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offers very high temperatures from 390 degree and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up in under a minute after plugging it in, gets extremely hot in seconds before even getting to the set temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to style your hair in a 60s flip-do or curling the ends under, my hair will stay this way all day without using any hairspray-this thing truly is a miracle hair appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will make your hair pin straight and shiny in under 20 seconds, just like on the shampoo commercials where the models have shiny straight hair, this thing makes my hair look just like the commercials no matter what kind of shampoo I use and even without using any other product on my hair.  And gives some great bounce to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do sell wider flat irons but I have found this size to be sufficient for my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps keep tangles at a minimum and makes it easier to braid your hair or put it up in a pony tail or even a French braid since your hair will be thinner after using the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to flatten your bangs as well, I have done this many times without burning my forehead, makes my bangs straight and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems pretty durable, I dropped it once on my bathroom&#x27;s linoleum floor, nothing broke and it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a dial/lock on the side which keeps the iron/wand closed when not in use so it doesn&#x27;t sit on a bureau wide open and the plates won&#x27;t get dirty, nice feature, this also makes it compact to transport if you&#x27;re packing it to go away somewhere, it won&#x27;t pop open in a suitcase or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED display is an easy to read bright blue color with big digital numbers, as soon as you turn it on the display turns into this vibrant blue color, just looks really cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the iron gets to the set heat temp it will beep at you to let you know it&#x27;s ready to use and has reached the temp you have set it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just has a really beautiful attractive color to it, like a bluish-green muted color, not only does it work great but it&#x27;s pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It is sometimes very easy to burn your hands while holding the flat iron since most of the wand gets very hot, you must keep your hand closer to the bottom &amp; this can sometimes be hard to remember when you&#x27;re going to town on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes up a lot of wattage and electricity, makes the light in my bathroom flicker when I use it (whether this is an issue in my house or not I don&#x27;t know)but I&#x27;ve yet to blow a fuse, just a nuisance so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to wear a glove on my free hand or I will literally burn my hand since my hair gets just that hot, not a major issue but an FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulls hair sometimes however this doesn&#x27;t happen often enough to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes produces a small amount of steam, or smoke, if your hair is slightly wet from spraying it with a product or if it is wet from water, this is a given but you can&#x27;t keep it in one place too long since this iron gets very hot, not really a \\&quot;con\\&quot; just another FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iron stays extremely hot for a while after using it &amp; after being unplugged, you cannot place it on anything that will melt or get heat damage.  I have to put it on a metal radiator in my bathroom for about a half an hour after use, this is one of the best places for it if you have a radiator or anything metal...it WILL burn anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;on\\&quot; button and heat setting buttons sometimes get accidentally turned on &amp; off when I&#x27;m using it, my fingers sometimes hit the button and turn the iron off, although I believe there is a way to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; it so this doesn&#x27;t happen but I haven&#x27;t messed with trying this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed with this flat iron, since I&#x27;ve bought it I feel like I absolutely need to bring this with me ifI ever go away on vacation, a definite must have for me.  It works great and does what it says it will do and then some.  Made sturdy, looks great, works great and that about sums it up.  If it works on my thick hair it&#x27;ll work on anyone&#x27;s hair.  It gives me salon results and that alone is why I&#x27;m in love with this thing. Gets an A+++ from me.</li>
    <li> I had been eyeing this flat iron for quite awhile because my other Remington one was getting old.  I was extremely pleased with my last one and am equally happy with this one.  It heats up quickly and it light enough so your arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  I read some reviews that said it smelled kind of weird, and it does, but if that would be the only negative I suppose.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This flat iron does the job.  Pro&#x27;s - adjustable temperature, on/off switch, and ready signal.  None of which are available on some more expensive irons.  Con&#x27;s - could use a longer cord.  Heated up quickly, and straightened my hair nicely with no frizz.  Not sure how long the conditioners are supposed to last or if they really make a difference.  I recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Remington Shine Therapy Straightener for about a month now.  It heats up in 30-60 seconds, has a nice, long cord and is lightweight.  You can lock in the temperature you want.  It leaves hair shiny, soft - and of course - straight.  Since the plates are small (1\\&quot; wide), I have found that you can use it to curl your hair as well.  My only complaint is the button placement is awkward and the plates can leave \\&quot;lines\\&quot; in your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful.  The sleek and shine to my hair is well worth the couple of \\&quot;dings\\&quot; that I could give this product - plus you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality!</li>
    <li> After a long line of past FAILS...  PLEASE PLEASE learn from our mistakes- all but one straightener (the first) was more expensive than this one!     Scan down to bottom for PROS of this product    Straightener #1 - Metal plates, smell of burnt hair throughout the house    Straightener #2 - Had ceramic plates, but you have to sort of contort  your hand to keep from hitting the heat settings and on off controls    Straightener #3 - Ceramic plates- heated to salon level - Controls not on outside, you can reach in and hit the on/off, but actual heat settings very difficult to see.  Results- hair looks ..STIFF-Straight after using this.  Had to wash hair and straighten the night before so it relaxes a bit.     Straightener #4 -  2\\&quot; ceramic - Wet /Dry with vents - hair of course sizzles when using it wet. It was just heavy and it takes some hand strength to close it.  Had a distinct smell of burning hair. If the steam from the wet hair option doesn&#x27;t burn you, using it on dry hair it is unbearably hot for way too long.     Straightener # 5 - Plates did not meet evenly, touched only at the end pulled hair out- cracked when you tried to make the plates touch. Went out on the next trash day.    Sraightener #6 - Checked out best straighteners on the web - purchased a CHI for 150.00 -  we have grown weary and low on cash -  because of the anti theft device the store applies you can&#x27;t read details - we opened it in the car parking lot - discovered plates don&#x27;t meet AT ALL ....certainly  not going to break it trying to press them together, also ........NO HEAT SETTINGS at all??  How strange.  Because of the way it was packaged, we carefully put back in box, walked back into the store shortly after, got our money back on this one.   *********************************************************************  THIS PRODUCT  Straightener # 7 - :) We are in love, a third of the cost of #6    * Heats of in 30 sec. to a minute  * Attractive design  * Controls easy to set  * Has digital precise temperature control all the way up to salon level heat.  * Has a controls lock so you don&#x27;t accidentally change settings   * Comfortable weight  * Swivel Cord  * Glides effortlessly through hair   * Floating plates (why didn&#x27;t others think of this?) assure you get even contact with the hair surface - no pinching  * Ceramic plates are infused with conditioners and avocado oil  *  Hair comes out shiny and soft and never with that stiff straight look we have seen with the others.   * Has instructions on how to manipulate the device for different effects</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair and was looking for a straightener that could handle my thick, wavy, unruly hair.  I think I found it!  The straightener heats up quickly and lived up to its promise of leaving my hair silky and shiny.  I realize it&#x27;s best to straighten your hair in small segments, but I have to admit I prefer a larger straightener, so it doesn&#x27;t take as long.  Regardless, this absolutely did what it said it would.  I definitely use it every morning, at least on my bangs, before work.  No muss, no fuss.  Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener last night at Wal-Mart, as a kind of splurge treat [since i never buy anything at this price for myself], and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to use it.  After spending about five minutes trying to get it out of the packaging it was in, I decided I&#x27;d wait so that the plates could air out and the \\&quot;new straightener smell\\&quot; could dissipate a little before I used it.  About an hour later was when I got the chance to use it as my little sister reminded me because she had bought herself a new one [we were both in desperate need of new straighteners] and she wanted to watch me use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the temperature settings!  I hate that my old straightener had a wheel with a 1-25 level.  I could never figure out which one to use.  I also love the fact that it took this straightener fifteen seconds to heat to 370, which was the first thing to pop up when I plugged it in.  Turns out, 410 is just way too much for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to really thick hair [depends on the day, really] and my old straightener took several swipes on small strips of hair to get straighter, and since the plates weren&#x27;t so close to the casing I&#x27;d always get the little bump near my roots.  The last thing I need is volume, considering my once beautifully natural pin-straight has become naturally curly in the past few years.  I loved that I did half of my hair in less than two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It straightened so smoothly it was a bit ridiculous.  Like, at first, I didn&#x27;t realize I was actually straightening my hair because it just glided without much force to keep the plates close.  Because, normally with my much cheaper straightener, I&#x27;d have to grip it so hard to get it to move that my hand would eventually cramp up because the plates didn&#x27;t want to meet properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use this on my freshly cleaned hair, without products, but I&#x27;ll see how it goes later today when I find the time to use it again.  I didn&#x27;t notice any major shine since my hair is healthy without the added benefits [as I dye it only after months of the colour fading] but I did notice that the frizz from last night&#x27;s fogfest disappeared after my hair cooled down.  It was incredibly soft though, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con was that my locking mechanism to keep it shut doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  I can get it in the lock position but it just pops out after thirty seconds.  Which is disappointing because I hate wrapping the cord around it to save space.  And, since I don&#x27;t have an iron grip to try to lock it even further, even though the lock itself pops up like it&#x27;s about to break after I used it just once, that&#x27;s the only reason why I gave it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping this one will last much longer than my previous straightener of four years.  I really only bought this because I needed a new one, but I like it so far.  &#x3D;]added benefits [as I dye it only after months of the colour fading] but I did notice that the frizz from last night&#x27;s fogfest disappeared after my hair cooled down.

    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It exceeded all my expectations! I used to own a Chi iron, which worked very well, but broke down recently. In need of a new iron, I stumbled upon this. It was less than half the price of the Chi, so I ordered it.  When I first used it, I was amazed at how it made my bangs look shinier and feel softer than before. One little problem I have with it is that it gives me more split ends than the Chi. I recommend using lower heat settings to avoid this problem. I also notice how it creates a horrible odor when ironing my hair, but doesn&#x27;t pass that odor onto me. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great item and would make any consumer happy.</li>
    <li> The straightener loads up within 30 seconds as it stated. For my medium fine hair, I can straight my hair by running it through just one time. It does keep my hair smooth and shiny. I&#x27;ve own this for 1 month and so far I LIKE IT A LOT! It saves me a lot of time when I straight my hair now. The price is decent for this straightener. Overall, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> This straightener works great, a lot better than my cheap on that I had. Definetly worth the price, when a coworker bought the same one for $125.00.</li>
    <li> great straightner! no need to condition the blades but need to definitely use heat protectant on hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for about 5 years now.  I&#x27;ve used really expensive CHI&#x27;s and this one is just as good or better to me.  I have wavy hair that just needs to be straightened quickly before heading out...so I&#x27;m not sure how it works if you have super curly hair...but I absolutely love it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t have any damage from it either...the ceramic evens heat out well and my hair looks very healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this  almost 2 years ago and love it. It was put though a lot! dropped ect. The cord is just now starting to come apart.&lt;br /&gt;However, I when I bought it. It was $32.00 on amazon now its over $90.00!!! It has gotten great reviews~</li>
    <li> Love it! I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have a question to users of this flat iron: can I still use the heat protection products or the avocado oil conditioner thing will be damaged?</li>
    <li> This is the best straightner. leaves my hair silky and soft. it is not that expensive which is a good thing. Im glad i decided to get it.</li>
    <li> I tried several flat irons and returned them before settling on this one.  I have to say, it works even better than the one my stylist uses when I see him at the salon.  The plates are SO incredibly smooth and friction free, it&#x27;s really impressive!  If they were any smoother, they&#x27;d almost be too slippery and my hair would just slip through too quickly.  I love how fast it heats up, and I&#x27;ve never noticed any kind of smell at all like some of the other reviewers.  I have fine hair so I can use a low heat setting, maybe that&#x27;s why.  I agree that the buttons are in an awkward place, but all you need to do is use the locking feature - hold down the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for 3 seconds - and then that problem is solved.  This thing smooths and shines my hair in no time, and I can also use it to add curls or waves.  It is simply the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, period.  But my favorite feature of all is that it NEVER snags my hair like all the others I tried - I love that! Try this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great for fine hair like mine.  It works for straightening or for making the ends of your hair flip under (even if one side naturally flips up).  It gets hot fast, and you can select the temperature you need for your specific hair type.  The straightener I received smells fine!  Sometimes the straightener will leave creases in your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful, and the body gets really hot, so you can&#x27;t necessarily hold it shut with your fingers. Also, it&#x27;s way too easy to push the buttons on the back of the straightener, and either turn the unit off or change the temperature without meaning to.</li>
    <li> This flatiron performs pretty darn well considering the compactness of it. Which is also what drops it from 5 to 4 stars. It&#x27;s small and easy to store, but that also means the plates are a bit on the short side so I had to do smaller sections of hair at a time. It heats up quick and has a thermostat that shows the temperature you&#x27;ve chosen (not just low-med-high). And the feature where you can lock the temperature setting is the best idea, ALL flatirons should have it! It is really nice not to have to worry that you&#x27;ll accidentally turn the temperature up as high as it goes and damage your hair. I burned my finger a couple of times on the edge of the plates while trying to hold them tight closed as I pulled. Never had any hair snag while using the iron. Over all a good iron, and definitely one worth using for travel.</li>
    <li> Even though the product works great when it works, it only last for 3 weeks to me. I was so dissapointed because I expected quality. I guess that&#x27;s the reason for this been so cheap. I guess I got a deffected one, I am now doubting on which one will I use to replace this, because I love the hair result (very shiny and healthy look) but I really need it to last.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto desde Venezuela he comprado 3 de este producto y estoy muy satisfecha, la mas antigua tiene 3 a&amp;ntilde;os y funciona perfectamente. A las otras personas que le he vendido esta plancha no me han dado queja sobre la utilizaci&amp;oacute;n de la plancha incluso las recomiendan a otras personas tambi&amp;eacute;n. .&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product from Venezuela I have bought 3 of this product and am very satisfied, the most ancient he is 3 years old and works perfectly. That I have sold this plate they have not given theirs complaint to other persons on the utilization of the iron flat even recommend them to other persons also</li>
    <li> I bought this after my FHI performance flat iron died. It was on sale on Amazon and I was in desperate need, looking for a cheap flat iron. I got an inexpensive flat iron that certainly wasn&#x27;t cheap! I have thick, wavy-curly hair and this flat iron performed better than my FHI and shined my hair, leaving it really soft. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that the flat iron itself feels kind of flimsy in my hand. There&#x27;s also a tiny space between the plate and the iron itself that snags my hair a little. Kind of annoying, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;I still love this flat iron and it is still going strong! I think the avocado oil has probably dried out a bit, but it still leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny. I would buy another and HIGHLY recommend even after nearly a year of use.</li>
    <li> I believe the height of the disaster in less than two hours the iron has increased in price of 29 dollars two times went up to 43 dollars. definitely abuse the buyer.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It leaves your hair smooth and shiny. I also like that it looks very nice and sleek and seems to be well made and not cheep like some of the others. 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at the end of January, and it was great while it worked.  I have very fine hair, so I always kept it on the lowest heat setting. Unfortunately, as of about two weeks ago it stopped working!  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always purchase CHI&#x27;s or Babyliss.  I needed another flat iron and saw the great reviews on this one.  I am not disappointed.  It gets very hot, heats up fast and does a great job.  I have a lot of hair but it is fine and limp after first washing it.  It does so much better if I use a heat spray.  I like Redken hotsets.</li>
    <li> I keep having this problem where it will shut off. I&#x27;ll have to hit the power button at least 3 times before it will go on and stay on. Other than that, pretty decent straightener but I&#x27;m saving up for a CHI.</li>
    <li> this flat iron is absolutely perfect I mean when I used it, it didn&#x27;t snag my hair at all and the finished results are like great!! at first the buttons were in my way and I kept on changing the temperature but then I figured you had to lock it (hold down the minus sign until a little lock icon comes on) then when your down you just have to unlock it ( do the same thing except the lock icon will dissapear) overall this is a great product!!</li>
    <li> This straightener worked fine for a while, but after a few months it has stopped working! It takes nearly half an hour to heat up now, and then doesn&#x27;t even get my hair very straight. If you want a good product, do NOT buy this!</li>
    <li> This has been my hair straighter for the last two years and today is as good as the first day. I use it often to straight my curly hair and i can&#x27;t complain about it, this is the straighter that less damages my hair, its plates infusion with avocado and vitamin e really work! it leaves my hair straight, soft and brilliant, i love it!</li>
    <li> I thought I was taking a risk buying this straightener after reading the bad news about the smell. But I have used Remington before, so I was prepared to take the risk. Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t come across any problems. I like how lightweight the iron is and it looks quite sleek too. The digital display is quite nice as well. I have shoulder length hair and I don&#x27;t waste much time getting my hair straightened. The only con I would say is that the iron automatically heats at 390 degrees every time it&#x27;s switched on. I have to lower it every single time, because 390 seems too high for my hair&#x27;s thickness (which isn&#x27;t really thin). If you hold the iron just above the +/- buttons, you don&#x27;t really have to worry about accidentally changing the temperature.</li>
    <li> Above my expectations. I love it! Heats up quickly and straightens way better than my old haistraighteners. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this straightener. It&#x27;s broken now, but not because of technical reasons. It&#x27;s so durable, and it feels safe on my hair. I straighten my hair ALOT and I&#x27;ve used every straightener imaginable, and I gotta say, this is the 2nd best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I found a better Remington model since, but a year ago, this was the best. Remington is so awesome, no one else does it better. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I have been straightening only my bangs for years now. I have very thick, wavy, curly hair, and longish... about halfway down my back. About 2 months ago I took a lot of time and straightened my whole head. I got so many compliments, and my hair felt so smooth and soft! I wanted to straighten it every day. I had a really good BabyBliss flat iron. It got my hair straight, but it took over an hour each time. I&#x27;d do my hair at night, then touch it up in the morning. Touch ups took about 15 minutes. I purchased some hair products to help with the straightening, and to protect my hair from the heat. I loved my hair... but I hated the time it took!&lt;br /&gt;I got this Remington S9950 on a lightning deal. The price was half of what it&#x27;s listed for now. I didn&#x27;t really think it would make a huge difference in the time it took to straighten my hair, nor did I think it would make it any more shiny. I got it thinking it would be good to have one in the car to do midday touchups if I needed. Well, the BabyBliss is now in the car for emergency touch ups. This Remington is my main flat iron now... and it&#x27;s WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I swiped it through my hair I knew it was different. It straightened the section completely with only 2 swipes! Amazing for my hair. I would be swiping about 4-5, or more times with my other iron. And, it did make it shine more too! I did my whole head it about 25 minutes, half the time it used to take. My hair was also straighter, and stayed straight. Morning touchups take a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter has think hair like mine, more wavy than curly. Her hair is very long, down to her butt. She loves this product too! She does her whole head in half the time it used to take also.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what makes this work so well. My old flat iron only went to 400 degrees. This one goes to 430, and we both use it at the highest setting because of the thickness of our hair. I&#x27;m sure that makes a difference. But it also shines our hair, andkeeps it staying straighter longer. It&#x27;s just an amazing product. Does just what it say it&#x27;ll do. I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great iron,hair looks great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is where the power and temperature buttons are. I wish they were on the side, less likely to turn off or change temperature during use.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with straightener.  It takes no time to heat up and does the job.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product worked as well as my friend&#x27;s Chi did!  I was hesitant to buy because I have heard you have to spend at least a hundred bucks for a straightener to work, but I am glad I did.  I have fine/naturally curly hair, and it straightens it as good as when I get my hair cut and she straightens it.  It does get very hot on the outside ends, I have to watch not to touch it.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of a flat iron because suddenly in my 50&#x27;s my perfectly straight and baby fine hair became wavy and unmanageable.  Too wavy for straight styles, too straight for curly styles AND the sides didn&#x27;t match.  The only answer was a flat iron.  I had visions of burnt hair and fingers.  I love the product.  I use it on the lowest setting because my hair is fine and only wavy - not kinky. But there is plenty of room to raise the temp for more difficult hair.  My niece has used it when she&#x27;s forgotten her flat iron &amp; the higher temp works just as well as her professional quality flat iron.  One caveat: it&#x27;s addictive.  Once you&#x27;ve seen the polished finish this product gives to your hair, you won&#x27;t want to skip it for any reason.  Some people have complained about the controls.  The iron is thin, which I needed for my short hair, so there aren&#x27;t too many options for placement.  The lock feature (using the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button) keeps the controls where you set them. I did have a problem one time when I turned it on &amp; then had an emergency.  By the time I got back, it had turned itself off &amp; wouldn&#x27;t turn back on until I both unplugged it &amp; let it cool completely.  The next day, it worked just fine.  Once I realized what the problem was &amp; how to fix it, I was glad it had that safety feature!  I&#x27;m amazed that I got such a great product when my hair dresser told me I would have to pay $85+ for anything I&#x27;d be happy with (professional quality).  I don&#x27;t need special sprays &amp; the only time I had a burn type issue was when I failed to thoroughly dry my hair &amp; then it was mostly steam.  Not something I&#x27;d repeat, but not a \\&quot;wear a hat for 6 weeks\\&quot; problem either.  The cord&#x27;s a good length for home use.  My niece had no problem using it on me when she was teaching me.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough cord for professional use, but the advertized limited lifespan (3 yrs) would not make this a choice for a professional. (The conditioners on the plates are used up after 3 yrs.) I really can&#x27;t think of anything to criticize about this product &amp; I&#x27;m pretty fussy!.) I really can&#x27;t think of anything to criticize about this product &amp; I&#x27;m pretty fussy!</li>
    <li> Just received this flat iron. The price was so cheap I didn&#x27;t think it will be that good, but I guess I was mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;I used it today and am extremely impressed with the results. It is much better than my previous flat iron for which I paid $100.00. Hopefully it will last longer than my last one. Will update my review at a later date.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that it leaves little marks in my sink, which is where I lay the flat iron in between preparing for the next strand of hair.  I should probably train myself to lay it on the vanity top instead of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair manageable and very soft.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up fast and gets really hot. It does not make your hair feel dried out and does exactly what it advertises. Works just as good as my other flat iron that costs 2x as much. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my first straightening iron, so I can&#x27;t compare to others, However, I can say that I am really impressed with this iron. Great features include fast heat up, locking controls ( so you wont change them accidentally), digital temp readout, a swivel cord,and locking hinge to keep it closed when not in use. The plates are very smooth &amp; glide over my hair like butter. I was in need of a haircut when I recieved this iron &amp; my ends were frizzy ( you know how they get). This thing made my ends  look great! I was truely amazed. I could not detect any residue from the avicado oil, but am sure it made a difference in the way my hair shone. The shape of the plates made a nice flip at the ends as well( no kinky look) I cannot think of any \\&quot;cons\\&quot; to include here. The style is nice, color is pretty, and it feels durable in the hand.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great design&lt;br /&gt;2. Comfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to operate buttons&lt;br /&gt;4. Compact&lt;br /&gt;5. Ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;6. Nice color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Took several attempts to get hair smooth and straight&lt;br /&gt;2. Inconvenient when in a hurry&lt;br /&gt;3. Hot plates don&#x27;t seem sturdy&lt;br /&gt;4. Doesn&#x27;t feel solid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad deal if money is an issue.  In comparison to the HAI (Hair Art and Information) flat iron, the performance and quality are lacking.  My hair is thick and slightly coarse and this product did not perform as well as the HAI flat iron.  It didn&#x27;t work so well on my hair, but perhaps different hair types would have better results.</li>
    <li> Have to &#x27;fess up - my hair is short.  But my daughter has nice, long hair.  So she gave this straightener a try.  For some reason, she thinks a Chi is the best brand out there (what&#x27;s a Chi?).  But she \\&quot;settled\\&quot; for this and is really happy with it.  She especially likes the light that tells you when it&#x27;s heated up.  Quality-wise, she says it&#x27;s very sturdy - not like another one I bought her (landfilled long ago).  I asked her about the smell others have mentioned - she says it&#x27;s not bad at all.  And she thinks the avocado puts a nice shine on her hair.      Daughter&#x27;s happy with her smooth, straight, shiny hair and a high-quality straightener.  Dad&#x27;s happy &#x27;cause he didn&#x27;t have to buy a Chi which he&#x27;s told is quite pricey.  Win-win!</li>
    <li> I prefer a smaller plate on my straightener, like the 1\\&quot; Remington S9950 model.  The smaller plate gives you the ability to flip the ends up. It works great for normal to thin hair.  Thick curly hair, might want a larger plate simply to save time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found this product delivered on it&#x27;s shine therapy promise.  Since it is \\&quot;infused\\&quot; with avocado, oils, among other things, I wonder how long the shine therapy portion of the straightener can last?</li>
    <li> Two things I don&#x27;t mess around with, my face wash and my hair products. I was soon coming to meet my 8th grade graduation when I bought this straightener. At this time, this was the most expensive flat iron I had ever owned. I had this straightener for 4 years before I left it at a hotel on accident. Months later, I am still heart broken. It was still in great condition. :( I will be buying another one asap. I would also recommend it to anyone. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, frizz free, my hair stays straight all day, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck or caught in it. I hate bouncy plates because my hair ALWAYS gets stuck. So I am very pleased that these are rounded plates that have just enough bounce to them. LOVE LOVE LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I got this a year back...and its pretty handy till now...Be cautious it become super hot very soon &amp; so hot it hurts your finger at times....My hair is not all so curly...its kinda wavy at the roots..and just rush through the straightener very fast...at times 2 or 3 stokes for a 1 bunch of hair...and go around like 8 - 10 bunches as whole for my hair. Its stylish...I carry it outdoors...after use it cools down pretty fast as well...say 5 mins...it doesn&#x27;t make your hair so dry like some other straighteners, but still it leaves some dryness in hair.</li>
    <li> Its price is acceptable. It heats up quickly as 30s. I can hold it easily and it make my hair straight, not frizzy anymore</li>
    <li> You get what they promise, I was very satisfied with this product. The advantage of chosing the temperatura according to your hair type is also great. The effect could last a little longer though. Congrats!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as my daily straightener (I have wavy/frizzy hair after blow drying). Unfortunately I received a defective model and whenever I would turn it on it would just turn back off again.  I learned that if I pressed it multiple times it would eventually work. The seller was great to work with and I was able to return the product.  I have to admit though that once it did work, it did a great job at straightening my hair.  i don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;moisturizing and conditioning&amp;#34; aspect but it straightened my hair great.  I tried to reorder another one but the seller was out.</li>
    <li> Of the non-professional hair straighteners, this is, by far, the best I have found. I have very thick hair and it works quickly and well on my hair.</li>
    <li> I just got this on Christmas (I&#x27;m using my dad&#x27;s account) and I am in love with it. It took a lot of time picking it out because I wanted a good flat iron, and this one really is!    Although I&#x27;ve only had it for a day, I really love it.     Pros:  -heats of in 30 sec. to a minute   -looks nice  -light  -swival cord/long  -it has a lock for the buttons so you don&#x27;t accidently hit them and change something (you lock it by holding down the minus button)  -glides through hair  -floating plates (which means the plates have a little \\&quot;give\\&quot; or \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to them when you press them together)  -leaves hair pin straight, shiny and soft (and I have fairly curling/thick hair)    Cons:  -leaves hair hot right after you run it through  -the outside of the plates gets rather warm  -it has a funny smell (which is the avocado oil, I&#x27;m sure. It says the heat \\&quot;activates\\&quot; it, so I think that&#x27;s the smell)    Overall this flat iron is a great buy. I gave it FOUR STARS out of five because of the minor cons (but none of them should keep you from buying this product!)    I will update this review after I&#x27;ve owned it for a little longer. But I say BUY IT!</li>
    <li> OK, this is for those stubborn curls that need extra attention.  Easy to use.  Portable.</li>
    <li> This straightener performs well.  The plates heat up quickly and evenly and the slim design makes it easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to ding something for having only 1 inch plates because the size of the plates is clearly stated, but I hate small plates on a hair straightener.  I have long, naturally curly hair and the small plates take me forever to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons on this are also in a less than ideal spot and I find myself accidentally pressing them.  I can&#x27;t fault it too much because where else could they place the buttons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a nice luster on the hair and mine hasn&#x27;t been this shiny, maybe, ever.  I would recommend this to people with hair shorter than shoulder length.  People with longer hair should seek out a straightener with bigger plates and save time in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener from target about 5 years ago, and I absolutely love it. It still works, but I noticed target doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I decided to buy another for when my current one finally gives out. I have used lots of different straighteners and I have never found one that I liked as much as this one. There is no friction when ironing your hair, and it makes your hair straight, smooth and shiny. Best straightener ever!</li>
    <li> sending the plate was excellent and I work great router meets all the expectations I had, I am very pleased thank you</li>
    <li> I have other Remington hair tools and have always loved them. This one, though, is a dud. It stopped working after a few days which, you know, no big deal. Any product will have a lemon every now and then; having to replace one faulty item doesn&#x27;t reflect on the product as a whole. However, for the few days that it was working, it would make my hair insanely static-y the moment it came near my head. What use do I have for a straightener that makes me look like a Miyazaki character overcome by rage? So back it goes, refund rather than replacement.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this straightener!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a wide variety of straightening irons at this point, and the Remington Shine Therapy is a nice addition.    It&#x27;s a smallish, compact straightener, the perfect size for travel when you don&#x27;t want to cart around a ton of heavy hair implements. It heats up quickly; the temperature control is well tuned and has a nice locking feature. The plates zip through the hair effortlessly and do a fine job of straightening.    The downside? It takes a few more passes on average to get a good straightening effect (comparing this to other straighteners in the same price range.) The avocado oil, with which this is supposedly imbued to give hair a high gloss, has an odd odor when the thing heats up. Not enough to discourage me from using it, but you might buy this and wonder what that odd smell is!    My hair responded really well to the Remington; it really gave my thick, wavy hair a nice shine and a feel akin to a salon straightening visit.     I&#x27;d highly recommend it for travel use for the size and function, although it works well for a reliable daily straightener. Granted, it might be a little pricey for a travel purchase, but something cheaper might not work, and if it doesn&#x27;t, the money is a total waste.    The bucks you&#x27;d spend on this straightener are a good investment, and then, once you arrive at your destination, you won&#x27;t have to worry that your hair appliances are going to fail you!</li>
    <li> I am going to return this item.  As it warms up, it often turns itself off within the first 30 seconds and has to be restarted 4 or 5 times before it will actually perform as it should.  When it eventually works, it works well, but this one is defective.</li>
    <li> My flat iron arrived last week but today I finally had the chance to use it....boy was I surprised! I have been using Gold n hot products for so long but had to stop because they didn&#x27;t last and the result left my hair stiff and kind of crispy. I switched to a Con air flat iron which was an improvement but its on its last leg! Low and behold Amazon had this as a Gold Box Deal and I had to try it before taking the plunge and purchasing a Chi iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this iron today I am totally satisfied. My ends are salon smooth. I used it at 370 - I may lower the temp next time it was pretty hot. I didn&#x27;t get a smell like some have mentioned. There was no burnt hair/product odor. It didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was getting damaged with every glide. I also can&#x27;t comment on the shine as I use coconut oil and Shea butter mixed with a thermal protectant which leaves my hair soft and full of sheen. I will say my hair is softer than usual after using this straightener compared to the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do read the instructions before hand to ensure you have a grasp on the features (locking the temp, pivot plates, etc). I am very satisfied with the iron overall and am glad I gave this product a chance. I will be looking into other Remington hair appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+TIP+&lt;br /&gt;To get your roots and new growth easier, pull your ends taut with the other hand away from your scalp while pressing the iron for 3-5 seconds close to the roots of your hair , comb with a fine toothed comb and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Rainy Day Update+&lt;br /&gt;After walking outdoors into a misty rain I have to say the humidity didn&#x27;t take it&#x27;s toll on my hair. I didn&#x27;t get the insta-proof when I walked out the door. My hair is still holding up well and the ends are pin straight. It usually takes a salon visit for my hair to have bounce, I am totally pleased with this flat iron!</li>
    <li> After year working perfectly</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great except for the fact that it has a problem staying on when I first turn it on. It flashes &amp; then it turns itself off immediately. It does that same thing about 2-4 times when I first turn it on.</li>
    <li> I have had this since 2007!! It still heats up perfectly!!! I just started curling my hair with it and it&#x27;s just perfect! It doesn&#x27;t snag or dry my hair!! I love it!!! Defiantly a good buy!! Worth the listed price, although I only paid 40 bucks for it 7 years ago, I would still pay the price listed!!</li>
    <li> I had been struggling with one of the flat irons that you get at the local box store and it was a losing battle. I was burning my hair, and it still did not straighten. I finally asked my hair stylist, who said that I needed to buy an iron of better quality. She suggested one like hers that was around $250. After my initial shock at that price, I decided to see if I could find something for a little less. As usual, Amazon came through. I decided to give this one a try, thinking that if it did not work out I could always return it. I am happy to report no returns on this item for me. The fact that this model offers a temperature control makes it a perfect choice. My hair straightens at a lower temp than a lot of other peoples&#x27;; I can use it at around 370. I don&#x27;t think it actually adds any moisture to my hair, like it claims to, but it does straighten very nicely. I will add that I also use a thermal protection spray. In response to those who said it gets hot ... well yes, isn&#x27;t what you want? It does get hot, but you should not be holding it by the end. Hold it down by the handle and you will not even feel the heat. The reason I gave four stars instead of five, is that you do need to be careful how you hold it because of the button placement. I have found that if I hold it with the buttons resting against my fingers, as opposed to the thumb side of my hand, I have less trouble. Even so, it is a minor issue. I would not hesitate to purchase this iron again.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the BEST purchases I have EVER bought on Amazon. I LOVE this straightener. I have thick hair.....THICK. It takes me normally like an HOUR to straighten my hair, I can actually get my hair done in like 30 minutes! It does not burn my hair, and it&#x27;s the fastest straightener I have EVER seen get hot and ready in a minute. AWESOME product! BTW - the buttons never get in the way of my hand.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several $100+ straighteners, but I got this one on Woot for under $25 a while back and it&#x27;s turned out to be my favorite.  I like that it beeps when it gets up to temperature, and I LOVE the moisturizing/conditioning.  Other straighteners have made my hair frizzy and dry but this one left it shiny, soft and successfully straightened.  My hair&#x27;s growing out and I&#x27;m starting to get some split ends, but voila!  A few passes with this straightener and you can&#x27;t even tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had at least a dozen mid-range straighteners in the past decade, and this is by far my favorite.  I got it for a very good Woot deal of $21.99, but I think I&#x27;d be happy paying full price for it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the &#x27;infused conditioners&#x27; but it certainly makes my hair straighter than my other ceramic straighteners and the sheen is noticeable. My hairdresser has also commented on my hair being healthier and noticing fewer split ends, which I&#x27;d attribute to this as nothing else in my routine has changed.  I took one star off only because the buttons are in a position where it&#x27;s easy to turn it up/down/off while straightening, but the results fair outweigh this minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this! I&#x27;ve only had it 1 month and it&#x27;s already broken! This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had that broke. Horrible!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works well in humid places. It keeps the hair in place without flying or sticking up like static. It warms up quickly and cools down rather quick. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants a great hair straightener. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> These flat irons rock. They are definitely the best. I really like these flat irons</li>
    <li> Ok, so I get this item and before I can even use it, my sister has completely stolen it and used it on her hair! Even though she has the longer hair of us two, I eventually did get to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is such an amazing item that I am planning on buying it as Christmas gifts for all my female relatives. Who doesn&#x27;t love straight, smooth, shiny hair? This item was so easy to use that even me, a hair amateur was able to easy maneuver it and even enjoyed the difference in my once fuzzy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to list some pros and cons for those out there interested in this item.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It heats up in about a minute so its great if you are in a rush. Just plug it in and while you are applying your mascara, it&#x27;s heating. By the time you finish making your eyes as beautiful as can be, it&#x27;s ready to make your hair the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The long swivel cord and smooth design paired with it&#x27;s small size is a great eye catcher and doesn&#x27;t look ugly if it has a permanent spot next to your sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s light as air and extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The locking buttons and floating plates makes this an easy one handed operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The outer parts of this item does get a little warm to hot depending on the length of time you use it. I didn&#x27;t get burned using this item but depending on how long or how much hair you have, this might cause a problem for some users if it gets much hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say this is one of the better models out there for people who want to tame their wild hair or just take out a little extra fizz from their locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A+</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Damage reducing conditioning plates are infused with Avocado and Conditioners that prevent moisture loss and cuticle damage\\&quot; may be a gimmick but I was pleasantly surprised to find this iron to works better (straighter hair faster) than my current iron. My hair felt much, much hotter to the touch (I nearly burnt myself when touching my hair after straightening) but the hair needed fewer passes through to become straight. I will be interested to see if the \\&quot;Avocado and Conditioners\\&quot; wear off the iron over time.</li>
    <li> This works wonders.  It only takes one quick swipe through the hair and it is super straight.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same damaging effects some other straighteners have.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing, it glides over hair and heats up in less than 30 seconds (to a functional temperature). I have the old version of this hair straightener as well, and it doesn&#x27;t function nearly as well as this one. Good job Remington. My hair is much straighter after using this straightener.</li>
    <li> This straightener is wonderful. I have wavy hair and it is perfect, you can adjust your setting well and have a lock setting.</li>
    <li> Great price!  I had a $100 straightener before this that lasted 4 years with moderate use before it burnt out.  This one has lasted 3 years already and has been just as good if not better and It was only $15!  The ONE thing I can&#x27;t stand on this straightener is the buttons!!!  It&#x27;s SO easy to push on them and change the temperature!  A really bad design in that way but I&#x27;d still rather pay $15 than $100 :)</li>
    <li> As you know all flat irons do cause damage to your hair but this coated plate cause less damage then a non-coated plate in my opinion. My all time favorite was the Remington Damage Therapy but since that one has been discontinued I decided to give this one a try and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have been using a flat iron two to three times a week for the last 12 years and have always ended up with Remington versions because I have found that they not only last longer but have been better for my needs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend when her old one broke. She absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener allows different heat settings. The thicker the hair the more heat needed to straighten. This allows her to set a heat that will not over fry her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less time needed to straighten her hair. It now only takes one pass to straighten, whereas her old one took several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes how smooth and shiny this straighter makes her hair. Her old straightener would leave her hair looked frizzy and fried. The avocado moisturizer really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I can say this has is that it randomly shut off at first. She would plug it in and turn it on and let it heat up but after a minute it would shut off. I was going to return the item but then it stopped happening.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd attempt at finding a good flat iron and I finally found it. I don&#x27;t know if the hype about conditioning the hair with vitamins actually works but I do know that the flat iron does a great job at straightening. I recommended this to a coworker and she loves it and seems to be using it everyday judging by her straightened style every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Wal-Mart and I&#x27;ll admit the infused avocado oil was a big selling point for me.  It worked wonders at first but it did leave my hair with a funny smell (maybe the infused oils?)  After a few months, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting as hot as it did when I first bought it.  Today, it stopped working all together.  I know it has a 4-year warranty, but who saves all of that stuff?  I won&#x27;t be purchasing a Remington ever again.  The $20 straighteners I&#x27;ve purchased from Wal-Mart in the past did the job and lasted much longer.</li>
    <li> After reading the rave reviews of this iron, I was excited to get mine. My hair is very thick and coarse but has a little shine after it air dries. This iron completely takes away the shine and makes my ends look crispy. I blamed my styling products for a long time until I finally upgraded to a more high-end iron (Sultra), My hair immediately looked healthier after a good ironing, and maintained more shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another weird thing is that the iron would turn itself off after about 8 seconds when I turned it on, *if* I hadn&#x27;t unplugged it first. Meaning, I had to unplug it after every use or it wouldn&#x27;t turn on the next time I used it. Dunno why that is, but this is actually my second Remington iron that had the same quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does get very hot quickly and it does straighten my hair effectively. I used it at a 340 degree setting but I think it goes to 410.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing straightener, when it stays turned on. Sometimes while heating up, it will just shut off by itself. I will have to continuously keep turning it back on and watching it to make sure it heats up without turning off. This always seems to happen when I am trying to get ready in a hurry. For this amount of money, I expect it to be 100% hassle-free.</li>
    <li> This thing straightens better than any tool I&#x27;ve used before, even a Chi. It heats up quickly and does the job smoothly. I love it, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this ceramic iron to straighten my hair and this product is so wonderful. I had comment on my hair, people were asking what was i using, and if they can borrow it</li>
    <li> It is SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY OTHER EXPENSIVE BRAND NAME STRAIGHTENER (I&#x27;ll call it X)!!! I&#x27;ve had my X straightener for 2 years, it (the X) straightened my hair after working with it, at its highest setting, for about 20 minutes (I have long, wavy, heavy hair). With the Remington, in 4 minutes flat, my hair was straighter than I&#x27;d ever had it with the X. I LOVE this straightener. Frankly, I didnt get any smell (some reviewers remarked on that), and the automatic temperature was set at 410 degrees, which was higher than my X, and caused my hair to steam, so I lowered the temperature to 370 degrees f and it worked out perfectly! Check the right temperature for your hair, starting with the lowest, and moving it up to adjust with your hair type. My hair stayed straight the next morning too (with the X, people had to ask me, the next day, if I&#x27;d not straightened my hair)! From other reviews, I saw that even in the rain, it doesnt spoil the hair, so am very very hopeful. The only thing I wonder about is how long will the avocado oil and vitamin E last? The other good thing is the 4 year warranty. I gave it 5 stars on the ease of use (I never hit the temperature button, you have to place your thumb just above the temperature control, and if you cant, just hit the - button for 3 seconds and that locks it, to unlock it, again press the - button for 3 seconds), the short heating time, the salon-like straight and silky look (no more spending $30 at the salon for a professional looking straightening), the slim and light design (makes the X look like a hulk, next to it), and temperature setting (much more than the X), digital, and last but NOT the least, the price, 1/3 the price of the X! LOVE IT!!!! UPDATE - Can&#x27;t believe I bout this in 2009, it&#x27;s now Feb 2016 and it&#x27;s still going strong! I use it maybe once or twice a week, except on vacations, then its sometimes daily and it still straightens my hair within 5-10 minutes completely! Love this hair straightener and I&#x27;ve alwaysrecommended this brand to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I understand the technology of this being infused with moisturizers or whatever, but it works pretty well. It&#x27;s the hottest hair tool I&#x27;ve ever used and it heats up quickly. The buttons are so conveniently-placed that it&#x27;s impossible to use without touching the buttons so the locking feature is essential. Unfortunately, on mine the locking feature doesn&#x27;t work the way the instructions said it did. It works, but the instructions said to activate the lock by holding down the \\&quot;up\\&quot; button. That doesn&#x27;t work. Holding the \\&quot;down\\&quot; button, however DOES activate the locking feature. Guess that&#x27;s not a product flaw, just faulty instructions. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron bought it ages ago still very useful still heats up quick</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this very often but when I do my hair is super shiny!  Gets hot very quickly and works nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim, it had been a couple years since I purchased a straightener so I was pretty clueless to brands. I bought this strictly off reviews after starting with chi and working from there. I couldnt be more thrilled with this it came overnight and meets all expectations and more. It definitely gets hot enough and makes my hair stick straight and very shiny, and it stays that way throughout my entire work day-and I&#x27;m outside most of my day. The ceramic plates also dont grab your hair it is very smooth and heats up within a minute. I love this straightener and would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever owned and I have owned alot. I am very picky about how a styling tool does my hair, but this was perfect my hair was smooth, silky and so manageable, I didnt even have to retouch my hair during the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this flat iron, by far the best that I have had!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener back in October 2013 and it&#x27;s already broken, constantly turns off, sometimes doesn&#x27;t even turn on. It pulls my hair whenever i straighten it. I would not recommend this product. Its way over prized. I am so mad that It couldn&#x27;t even last a year. I just threw $75 down the drain for this crap.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Remington Straightener.  My first one lasted about 2 years and I decided to buy the same one again.  I love the way this straightener straightens my hair.  It does a very good job and gives me the look I want.  I have very thick hair and if I just let it dry it gets pretty wavy.  This straightener takes care of that :)  It has different heat settings, I set mine on 340 and it gets the job done.  It also has a temperature lock so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your fingers accidentally changing the heat setting.  It doesn&#x27;t grab or pull my hair at all.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It does what it promises and it does not snag my hair or pull it out!! It glides on the hair so smooth, and it gets really hot fast. I like the fact that it goes up to 430 degrees as I&#x27;m african american and have real thick hair. I brought this product on Tuesday and got it on Wednesday, and it was worth it. My hair dresser has tried to talk me into buying a Chi or a Sedu, I will never go that route. I believe this product is waaaay better, and cheaper. You can actually curl your hair with the iron too. Great product. It is so worth it. You won&#x27;t be disatisfied.</li>
    <li> It straightens my hair quickly, however, I do have a couple of complaints. My first complaint is the position of the buttons, which makes it impossible not to accidentally change the temperature. My second complaint is that it&#x27;s a little thick. I prefer flat irons that are thinner and can get closer to the scalp. For the price, I would probably re-purchase it though.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It&#x27;s small, easy to handle. It does have an odd fishy smell when you&#x27;re using it. I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about, but it has a great temperature range, heats very quickly and does the job really well.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my hair!  I have very thick, coarse, long, curly hair that tends to frizz easily and this straightener makes my hair silky, soft, shiny and perfectly straight!  It&#x27;s a miracle I never thought my hair could be like this.  My daughter had straightener that I tried and all it did was make a frizzy mess out of my hair.  After reading many reviews I bought this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My daughter threw her old one away and bought one of these for herself.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and takes just 15-20 minutes, lasts until I wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my girlfriend, about less than a year ago, when her last flat iron stopped working right. She loves it! She is 18 years old, has blonde dyed hair so it tends to be dry all of the time, no matter how much she takes care of it and uses moisturizing shampoo and conditioners. Sometimes her hair lacks that healthy looking shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been through tons of flat irons that haven&#x27;t worked, or worked somewhat. She has found one flat iron that kind of worked well but didn&#x27;t help fight against damage, or helped make her hair silky straight and put moisture back into her dry, damaged hair. Until she started using the Remington Shine Therapy Moisturizing and Conditioning flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she has been using this flat iron her hair has become silky, softer, shiny, less damaged, and moisturized every time she straightens her hair. Which she straightens on an almost daily basis. It&#x27;s the best flat iron that anyone could buy for all hair types. Everything Remington says about this flat iron is true. It gives professional results for an inexpensive price. Anyone should definitely give this flat iron a try, it&#x27;s amazing! Remington&#x27;s products are all amazing and gives professional results!</li>
    <li> I seemed excellent product, I loved it and it looks very nice, it is good quality, thank you very much to you all.</li>
    <li> ok so i have been looking for hair straighners for ages and i couldnt find any i have had loads of straighteners b4 thease and i can say thease are the best!!!YES EVEN BETTER THAN GHD!!!they give excellent shine and make my hair realy soft and it stays straight for days! AND MY HAIR IS REALY THICK!i brought thease half price so its a bargin!but even at full price i would buy again and again!    YOU CAN CONTROL THE HEAT SETTING EASILY AND THEY LOCK AND STORE AWAY IN A HEAT BAG AND THEY LOOK REALY NICE TO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT PAIR OF STRAIGHNERS THEASE AER THE ONES!!</li>
    <li> I bought this earlier this year because I wanted see if the heating technology had improved enough to keep my thick, natural, long, coarse hair (jamaican) straight and frizz free for more than an hour. Needless to say, not only did it keep it straight for more than a day, it also shined and made it easy to comb.  However, I got just a bit addicted to it (used it every morning for the roots and frizz), and it damaged my hair (heat set too high). Interestingly enough my hair still had too much frizz (flyaway) to let out during the day. But any product that could make my fingers pass through my hair, and feel soft and silky at the end of the day is still nothing short of a miracle for me. Plus I got my natural hair back after washing! Hence the four stars.   If I had tried the shine frizz control s9951, maybe I would have had better results regarding the frizz. Who knows?</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It heats up fast and I can select the temperature I want. I have thick, coarse hair and I have never had to put it over the 410 degree setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy the product did not come in the box as pictured and the color is not the same.  I&#x27;m not even sure I received what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Remington in general is a great brand so that&#x27;s why i got this straightener. I really am satisfied with it. Straightens very well with no problems. Leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is similar to a lot of nice irons out there, except the other flat irons don&#x27;t do a thing to keep your hair from frizzing again in humid weather. Hairsprays and serums don&#x27;t always do the trick either for my curly frizz-prone hair. but THIS! This works. I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 years, and while I don&#x27;t use it heavily, it has never left me down. This is better than a blowout from a salon because it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I purchase this to my wife, she loves it, now she do not have to spent money at the saloon! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, and it will turn off by itself and also heat up the handles (on the outside part) so hot that it hurts to pick it up.  I bought this because I had the previous model, which I had for years, loved, and had no problems with.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair iron on a recommendation and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. It&#x27;s efficient and well-built. The heat settings have a good range and I was able to do my entire thick head of hair in half the time of my old hair iron. I have oily hair and was very wary about the conditioning piece, but I cannot even tell except that my hair does feel softer after use. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
    <li> We tried this on a family member who sometimes uses an iron costing several times as much as this Remington.  As such, I was ready for some heavily critical comments but in reality in turned out well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive compact unit.  This makes it easy to store away for those with tight bathroom space.  The compact size makes for a lighter unit; good for girls with weak arms so they don&#x27;t have to get muscle-pains the next day in their arms compared to heavy units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Digital control.  No old fashioned dial switch here.  Instead, a dead-on temperature precise modern digital unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly.  Got up to operating temperature quicker than more expensive units. Might have to do with the smaller heat plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The touted vitamin E with avocado oil is gimmicky.  Fact is, doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  Hair came out looking a little on the dry side.  This in turn means you need to be careful about making the passes so you don&#x27;t damage the hair.  Maybe more of an issue with those who have drier hair to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the unit does work and its price is hard to pass up.  Will make a fine gift for yourself or for someone special.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on the Remington Shine Therapy Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener on Amazon, about half off the list price. I love how quickly the tool heats up. I had trouble with my old straightener pulling my hair. I do not have any trouble with this one pulling my hair. It does the job well, in half the time and with a lower temperature. I use the lowest heat setting for my fine, straight-but-stubborn, hair. I also use this on my 5-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair occasionally to calm her locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea how the plate are infused with conditioners, but you really can feel a difference in your hair after you use this item. It feels as though you have put a drop of leave-in conditioner in your hair - the best way I can think to describe it. I do not use products in my hair, hate the way they leave my hair feeling, but this tool doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s just enough to keep the frizzies at bay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener seems to be hotter than my old straightener, even though the temperature settings are almost identical. I use the lowest heat setting, which is easy to do with the digital read-out and push-button controls. I would highly recommend you start with the lowest setting and gradually increase it if you need more heat. I could see someone easily burning their hair off with this thing! I almost wish it had an even lower heat setting for those of use who have no curl, but just need some heat to tame our locks!</li>
    <li> This is a good hair straightener for the money. My fiance loves it. She received it last year for Christmas and has not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product is very good, works fine I have no problem with its use, which is recommended for all .</li>
    <li> This is the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve ever had!! 100% recommendable. I sold 6 of these ones down here in Venezuela and everyone loved them!</li>
    <li> I broke my older straightener and bought this one as a replacement. I couldn&#x27;t find my original one, so this may have been it&#x27;s replacement at some point, however I think this one works much better than the one I had from Remington. Heats up quickly, only takes 1-2 passes at each section before it&#x27;s completely straight. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I really love this thing I set it for 340 degrees and it works great I haven&#x27;t noticed damage caused by heat to my hair since using it.</li>
    <li> Excelente calidad, llena mis expectativas. Muy buen diseño confortable y cumple con lo que promete el fabricante. Lo recomiendo ampliamente</li>
    <li> Llego en perfecto estado, estoy muy contenta y agradecia con la compra, recomendable totalmente, pesonas cumplidas y correctas con lo que envian.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener.  However, like some of the other review stated, it takes about four attempts to get it to stay on.  It&#x27;s a little irritating when you are in a hurry in the morning.</li>
    <li> excellent and good product</li>
    <li> it is good! it works great. i got it at a time. it worms fastly, and my hear looks very beautiful with it...</li>
    <li> esta Remington Shine Therapy S9950, le encanto a mi esposa y funciona muy bien, es economica y de buena calidad</li>
    <li> Great quick fix for my hair, not having to wait on the iron to heat.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> Great item! Love it.Straightens my hair quickly and effectively and doesn&#x27;t damages hair. Absolutely satisfied!!! Thank you  Remington and Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal!  i just can&#x27;t see spending more money than this on a flat iron and this one is great!  It heats up fast and I love that i can change the setting.  My hair is shiny and I don&#x27;t have flyaways hardly at all.  Love it and bought one for my sister too!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of review comparison on Amazon before purchasing this flat iron.  Remington is a good name, i thought, and the price seemed right.  I went ahead and purchased the flat iron, and it arrived quickly to my house.  I used it once, it worked great and didn&#x27;t snag my fine hair.  Great, I thought.  The next day I turned the iron on, it got warm, but not nearly hot enough to be effective in straightening hair.  I shut it off, unplugged it, and tried again.  This time the screen just flashed, the irron didn&#x27;t warm up at all, just blinked at me.  I returned it, still awaiting my return credit.  Maybe i just got a bum iron, but I&#x27;ll not buy the same one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for more then four or five years now and even though I didn&#x27;t get in on Amazon I still had to wrote a review. I got my flat iron at Walmart way cheaper then this years ago... It gets my hair super straight, I love the different temp settings, I love how it heats up fast and I love how it turns off when its overheated. Also the cord is really long which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought this flatiron to replace my very old Remington flatiron, which had died on me. Since I was very happy with the brand I looked into it again and found this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the positives:&lt;br /&gt;- heats up in under a minute&lt;br /&gt;- locks shut&lt;br /&gt;- swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;- digital temperature display&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- leaves hair smooth and shiny&lt;br /&gt;- small and compact - makes it perfect for traveling&lt;br /&gt;- plates are rocking, so that hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the negative:&lt;br /&gt;- gets very warm on the outside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flatiron. It is an excellent value for the price. My last Remington lasted for years! Don&#x27;t spend hundreds of dollars on a flatiron. Just buy this one.</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old female who has fine, brown hair that is colored blonde and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  Because my hair is fine, it is effected by any humidity in the air making it frizzy and generally, not shiny.  I love shiny hair, and my old flat iron was just frying my hair and not making it shiny.  I read the reviews on this and they sounded promising, thought that I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reall love this flat iron!  First, the material that is used for the plates is super flat and smooth and allows for your hair to glide right through it.  Also, it has a tempurature control - you can adjust the tempurature based on your hair type (I typically set it to 390 degrees for my hair type).  It also heats up pretty quickly, and is very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, most importantly, it REALLY shiny.  I only need to go over the section of hair twice to get that shiny effect.  My hair has a natural wave to it which gets worse in heat and humidity.  This tool does a great job of straightening it and the effect lasts all day even through the worst humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product - it is the best flat iron that I have tried.  And, for the price, it&#x27;s a great deal.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This score was chosen for &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; as the color of the product along with its quality make the vendor is qualified in such manner. I recommended to my niece buy a model shine therapy and hopefully soon will enter. thanks</li>
    <li> It met my expectations, good service delivery.</li>
    <li> Hello ... I bought you 6 Ceramic devices for hair 430 degree heat as Mann written clarification of the very equipped and, unfortunately, I received at a temperature of 230 !!! Jaddaaa shocked ... Masbb in this error?</li>
    <li> It is not bi-volt, and my hair got stuck on it at the first time I used. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i had one of these already anf i loved it these are great hair straighteners!! i would reccommend to anyone. i have thin hair. not sure how it works with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sis after I tested it out from my roommate. I felt in love right then and there so for my sister&#x27;s birthday I ordered her one and she LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> The straightening iron is good quality, it heats quickly, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  The problem is with the moisturizing feature.  I have silver hair,  Normally, it&#x27;s a clear, bright silver.  But when I use the straightening iron, the ends of my hair turn greenish-yellow . . . like avocado oil.  The effect is obvious, not subtle, and is actually pretty comical.  The straightening iron should be okay for dark hair, but it&#x27;s a disaster for white or silver, and perhaps for light blonde.</li>
    <li> I read many of the reviews of this flat iron prior to purchasing.  I bought because WOOT had a special for $21.99.  I would have paid 3 times this for this flat iron.  It is AMAZING.  It straightens my hair in a third of the time.  I have a lot of type 3C curly hair, being a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot;.  It is coarse and thick.  My hair shaft looks like fishing line.  I have so much hair that when I used to have it relaxed at a salon it took two people on each side of my head to get it on and off in time.  My hair dresser used to have to take a break from blow drying and flat ironing because her arms would get tired.  I have A LOT OF HAIR.  This flat iron does it in 30 minutes.  It gets it straight AND glossy the first time through.  I have had more compliments on my hair since I started using it.  Including I look younger.  Seeing as I am almost 50 that is huge.  For the person who was complaining about the plates being too hot, not to insult you but just a bit of friendly advice.  I would suggest you go to a beautician and have them show you how to use a flat iron properly.  You never put your fingers on the portion of the flat iron where the plates are.  I used to think blow drying was not for me (I used to look like Albert Einstein on a bad humidity day when I was done) turned out I was not doing it correctly.  A beautician showed me how to do it properly and now my hair, especially with this flat iron, turns out gorgeous.  I owned 2 CHI&#x27;s which I paid over $150 a piece for, this out does them both.  I am sold on this flat iron.  I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it works.  Thanks Remington!  If you are thinking about getting this flat iron...think no more... it works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Let me first off say this, I am an AA woman with natural hair ranging from thick and cottony 4a/b around my edges, to soft and loopy 3a/b/c ringlets along the front, back, and crown of my head. I always blow dry (with a paddle brush) my hair out before I attempt to flat iron.. If you&#x27;re not seeing the results you want on thick, wavy, coarse, and/or curly hair you may want to give that a try first, regardless of what flat iron you may use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to my review.. I have several flat irons ranging from top of the line, to the super cheap pair that I only travel with. This one has my Chi&#x27;s, Joico&#x27;s, and Maxi Glides beat by a long shot! These Remingtons gave me superb shine without having to add oil sheen or serum at all. Matter of fact, all I used was the same heat protectant spray that I always use. My hair was super soft, frizz-less, and shiny with only ONE pass of these irons. I set them at 370 degrees, by the way... oh, and to lock your temp in just press the minus sign down for a few seconds. The floating plates weren&#x27;t an issue because I tend to press down while gliding through anyway. Because of the great price I&#x27;m ordering another few sets to travel with and to give as gifts. My only complaint is that I couldn&#x27;t give them MORE stars!!!</li>
    <li> When my beloved vapor-iron broke, I gave this iron a try.  I was SURPRISED at how well it works.  It&#x27;s now my go-to flatiron.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> After a recent business trip, I borrowed my co-worker&#x27;s hair straightener (the Remington S9950) and I just KNEW I had to replace my old one at home; this one straightened my hair in under a minute - (I have wavy hair) and made my hair super sleek and shiny. It heats up really fast and I love that you can set the temperature. Excellent value for the money. It&#x27;s sleek, lightweight.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair. My rule of thumb is to never spend less than $50 on a hair straightener. I bought this at Walmart for $48 2 years ago. I was staying with family and learned the hard way why you don&#x27;t roll the cord around the straightener, and that&#x27;s the only reason why it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. But it straightened my hair wonderfully and never snagged. I really miss this straightener...and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for nearly a  year now. It was great, the heat settings were easy, and my hair is straight for two days after I initially flat iron my hair (my hair ranges from wavy at the top to twisted curls at the ends). However, today i noticed that the power button got loose, and now my flatiron turns off while I&#x27;m in the middle of doing my hair. Besides that, this is such a great buy, especially for the price. I would definetly buy this again.</li>
    <li> good but not dual voltage as i expected.</li>
    <li> This is the only straitening iron i will ever use. It leaves my hair smoother than other straitening irons and does what i want it to do. Its hot enough for thick course hair and your could turn down the temperature for very thin hair. It takes me about 10 minutes or 15 minutes max to straiten my hair or even flup out or in the ends. I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I first ordered this product in 12/11. I had a problem with it not staying on so I exchanged it in 1/12. This one also continually shuts itself off before it gets warmed up. I was relocating and changing jobs during this time so decided not to hassle with returning it yet again thinking I would just be sent another defective product. It has now been over a year and this product continually shuts itself off. I have to watch it and turn it back on numerous times before it will finally continue to warm up on its own. Something that should take a couple of seconds now turns into a daily 5 minute ritual that is extremely frustrating. Other than this problem, the product works wonderfully. I have tried turning it on at different temperatures in different outlets in the hopes I would come across the secret combination but I guess it is just a flaw in the product. It&#x27;s a shame. I bought it based on the positive reviews but apparently I was unfortunate enough to receive a lemon twice.</li>
    <li> Excellent for really curly hair</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great temp control and range and easy to handle.  My daughter took mine liked it better than her Chi.</li>
    <li> I used this the day after I received it with no problems. Second day it wouldn&#x27;t heat up and would shut itself off on its own . Got it to work after many attempts (changed temp several times and finally it heated up and stayed on). Tried again the following day - same thing. Looks like I got a lemon. Called Amazon - they handled my complaint promptly and to my full satisfaction. Wish I could give the straightener 0 stars and Amazon 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I was told to look for a flat iron that was high in quality, but I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a large amount on the purchase.  This flat iron has served all the purposed I had hoped and is very easy to use.  The heat setting can be adjusted and it has a digital display so it is very easy to see what the heat setting it at.  My fingers sometimes accidentally hit the buttons but they make a beeping sound so I know I have changed something when that happens.  It is quick to warm up and easy to use in hair.  It also has a lock so when it is not in use it can take up less room and you aren&#x27;t in danger of burning yourself. The plates do get hot, but they are made to easily worth through your hair without getting too close to the scalp.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easily it worked through my hair and gave it the straight style i had hoped without split ends or scorching.  It is a very nice item for the price and I&#x27;d recommend it for someone who would like a quality flat iron at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought Remington S9950 Shine Therapy Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital flat iron from walmart about 3 years ago. It was my favorite iron. It broke this year and I wanted to replace it and get the same one. I looked on amazon and ordered one. I got it in the mail and after a few days of use it started messing up. It wouldn&#x27;t come on. So I ordered another one thinking maybe I got a defective one. My new flat iron does the same thing. I would recommend ordering it from amazon.</li>
    <li> Works very well and leaves hair shinny. Very happy and pleased. Works better then my expensive chi iron, that I paid $200 for.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my long hair into a short A-line bob. This straightened works well for smoothing my hair into my sleek and stylish hair style! I love how it has the ability to adjust the temperature. My fine hair would be fried if I used the highest temperature. I had a chi prior to this and that was one thing I disliked about it. This iron is easy to use and is customizable for a variety of hair textures and styles!</li>
    <li> I just got the product and it say 120V/60Hz support only... no mention of 220V. Why does the Amazon.com review say it supports worldwide voltage? This is clearly misleading. Haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> I have bought hair straightener before with poor results so imagine my surprise to found a product that works wonderfully and not damaging your hair.Really amazing product..try it!</li>
    <li> So, unfortunately - I can&#x27;t return this item. I received it a few days ago and have since then gone around my house trying out every plug to see if one will work for this thing. My previous flat iron worked fine in my bathroom and would turn on and stay on until I turned it off (sadly, I got rid of it before thoroughly testing this new, disappointing product). This flat iron seems nice, but I haven&#x27;t been able to keep it on long enough to use it. It lights up at first and flashes as if it&#x27;s heating up, but shuts off right before completely heating. I&#x27;m not sure how common this problem is with the flat iron, but I&#x27;m not going to risk buying a second one since you can&#x27;t return. :P Note: So, it&#x27;s been a month since I e-mailed the seller about my problem with the item and I still haven&#x27;t heard anything back. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying a Remington again. :/</li>
    <li> This little baby heats up in the blink of an eye, and when immobile for &#x27;too long&#x27; automatically shuts off (great safety device!).  My fine hair looks shiny and has body after using this on wet or dry hair.  I would recommend this, without reservations, for someone with my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be a lot happier tho if this model was more than the 1-inch design.  As a new user, seems to take s long time when straightening my wet -- but fine -- hair.</li>
    <li> What I love about this iron is that the temperature and power buttons lock. Price is right and would buy again. Good value for the money</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a complete waste of money. When I purchased it, it only cost $50 so there is no way the current $79.99 sticker is worth it. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, as I was unable to return it, and have simply put up with it because I could not afford a new flat iron. Beginning a few days after I bought it and continuing as long as I have had it, I have to turn it on 4 or 5 times before it will actually stay on. On the lower temperature settings it does nothing to straighten my hair (I have relatively straight hair with only slight wave as it is) and on the higher settings it destroys my hair, making it look frizzy and damaged. I recently spent under $30 on a BaBylissPRO Ceramic Tools flat iron and it works a million times better than this terrible Remington flat iron. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> works great for the price!! my daughter LOVES IT, heats up fast! easy to handle and has long cord that swivals.</li>
    <li> I just resently bought this product off of amazon and was shiped in two days it was my first straightener ever and I had been searching for the prefect one this straightener got great reveiw and there is a video on youtube that help me make my desintoin as well! So I bought it! I was in beautiful shape and work perfectly I also noticed that when I pushed the two pads together I would pushe the temperture up or down but before you straighten you can hold down the + or - button so that it lock and you do not have to watch out for pushing the buttons and end up with burnt hair! It works on my wavy hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a low quality one or not...with my luck. First two weeks it worked great. Then after two weeks, it has problem staying on when I first turn it on. It flashes &amp; then turns off. The iron is not even warm yet. I have to turn it on again and again. It does that same thing at least 3 to 5 times. At last it keeps on and hot enough for hair. Sometimes it really makes me frustrated when I&#x27;m in hurry. Other than that it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have quite curly hair and have always worn it curly.  Decided to go with straight hair and these straightners are excellent.  Lots have people have commented on how straight I get my hair.  Very pleased with my purchase, thanks!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair straightner, and works so quick! I love everything about it, but the fact that I used to wash my hair every two days, but now with this product, it kind of leaves hair greasy, so I need to wash it like every day.. Though it takes me only 15 mins to straight hair, rather than my other one that took at least half an hour.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my daughter absolutely loves the hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I almost wish I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews before trying out this straightner.  Maybe then I wouldn&#x27;t have been so disappointed, especially when I saw that someone else preferred it over my favorite [[ASIN:B001E6ILDM Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Straightener, 1 1/4\\&quot;]]. I opened up the [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy Straightener, 1\\&quot;]] this weekend when I knew that I would have at least an hour to spend trying it out.  If you take a look at my profile picture you can see I have mid-back length, medium thickness, naturally curly hair. It is not easy to straighten, but it is fun to do every once in a while so having a quality straightener is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before turning the iron on I read through the instructions and got an idea of what temperature setting I should use along with some tips. I set the unit at 370*F, locked it in and waited for it to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then started piece by piece on my hair, but unfortunately less than one third the way through I had to stop and here&#x27;s why: With my hair thickness and curl, a straightener needs to clamp down tightly for me to be able to get a smooth result. This straightener doesn&#x27;t close tightly without you holding the ends together because of the floating plates. Now this wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the outside of the unit gets nearly as hot as the inside. Fifteen minutes in and my fingers were red, scorched and burning - so I gave up!  I ended up plugging in my [[ASIN:B001E6ILDM Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Straightener, 1 1/4\\&quot;]] and finishing the job. (There I have posted before and after pictures on my review of it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the good. Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me didn&#x27;t mean I was giving up, so I lent it to my daughter to try out and she loved it! Her hair is much finer with just waves, no curls and doesn&#x27;t require so much pressure.  Previously she was using this [[ASIN:B000U0C65C Andis 67690 1-Inch Nano-Silver Tourmaline Wet or Dry Ceramic Flat Iron]] and although she was happy, she says the Remmington is so much better for her hair.  It kept it straight even over night and that really surprised her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation would be that although this might not be great for those of us with thick curly hair, based on my daughters review and that of many others it probably works just fine on other types of hair. I can say that I like the look of the Remington Straightener, very feminine. I also wish I could give it more stars, but because the unit gets so hot on the outside I really do feel this is a huge flaw and potentially a recipe for disaster.gh she was happy, she says the Remmington is so much better for her hair.

    <li> 100% ok. All good excellent product</li>
    <li> I just love my new Remington straightener! My hair is straight. But has become a bit frizzy lately. I did think of buying \\&quot;Remington S-8510 Shine Therapy Frizz Control\\&quot;. But its slightly more expensive. And I don&#x27;t really use it all that much(only on 20% of my hair which is frizzy). So I settled with this one.. also because it looks sooo.. cute! It works just great with frizzy hair!! Why would I pay more! It took more than just 30 seconds to heat up even though it was set on low temperature. I don&#x27;t really care that it may take up to a minute. Or may be, b&#x27;cz it was the first time. I am so happy with this. I Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. My family member has a chi and this works better in my opinion.  I think this is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Its an amazing product for a first timer! But it does get heated a bit too much to hold it..... otherwise a wonderful product especially the LED and lock system make it a desirable product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron looks beautiful and heats up well but it does nothing for my coarse thick hair. It does get hot but it does not straighten my hair. My 20$ Andis flat iron straightens my hair way better!</li>
    <li> I bought thius product, used it twice and the next time i went to use it would not heat up. It stopped working all together, the buttons would not even click on to start up. After trying to get it to work a few days later, it still hadnt worked. My cousin has the same one, it works perfect although she didnt buy hers off here.</li>
    <li> After over a year of researching this flat iron (reviews, features, etc) I finally decided that this was the right flat iron for me! I didn&#x27;t want my dad&#x27;s money to go down the drain! When I got this in the mail on Christmas I immediately tried it out and straightened a small section of my hair. Wow, it was so straight!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very hard to tame with tight waves and frizz. I am just so happy that this works! It takes only a few minutes to get my hair generally straight which is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;One con however is that the flat iron has a very strange smell almost like I am burning my hair,</li>
    <li> Very good Iron, it heats up really fast and Works at the first pass through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light too, I loved it!</li>
    <li> I see this item is cheaper than when I purchased it a year ago, and for good reason. This was absolutely not worth the money I paid. It worked fine for a few weeks, then began shutting off automatically every time I turned it on (same as other reviewers). It would do this 3-4 times before it would finally stay on for me to use it. I got used to it and even though it was an annoyance, it wasn&#x27;t THAT bad. Now it has started shutting off 7-8 times before it will stay on!!! That is extremely frustrating and makes me angry that I paid more than I normally would to get a little better quality straightener. This is NOT good quality.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t look like picture, but, it works amazing!! I gave it to my daughter as a gift, I used it myself and now I have to get one for myself!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have relatively fine, but fairly abundant hair.  This works well for those occasional times when I want my hair to be really smooth.  It also seems to add shine.  It heats up fast.  As with all these tools, there is a knack to learning how to do it.</li>
    <li> i love it!!! its amazing perfect!!!!!i friend of mine borrowed me one of those flat irons in el salvador,and now i got it cuz my hair its shine and completely straight!!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly for about 1 week and then started shutting off spontaneously. It would take several attempt to turn it back on before it would actually power on. Now it is impossible to use. I decided to buy a better brand...sultra and i am very pleased with my sultra.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener.  I gets super hot and does not grab at the ends of my hair like some others I have had.  I hope they never stop making this...I may even order another just incase something happens to the one I have now.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about three months now.  Don&#x27;t spend hundreds of dollars on any other...get this, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Varing temperatures very helpful. My hair will stay straight even on a humid day lightweight  on and off switch. Use a moisturizer on hair pre using</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE, LA ENTREGA FUE EN TIEMPO RECORD</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up quick. Leaves your hair looking shiny and beautiful. Love it and was a.great price too!</li>
    <li> So far it has made my life easier and my hair smoother.  I have very fine straight hair and was only using a blow dryer with round brush to curve under ends but decided with new wirey gray hair popping through that I needed something different.  This fits the bill and the pocket book.  I ordered this after doing a little research.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much and wanted one that had auto shut off, variable temps and floating iron parts.  This also comes imbedded with avocado and conditions which make my hair shiny.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  The whole &amp;#34;avocado-infused&amp;#34; technology and such is great until that wears away in 8 months (at least I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s what happened) and then the plates just start stinking all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main gripe with this is I use it to straighten sometimes which it does a fine job, but I also use it to curl and it is not the best for that. Most of the time it leaves those awful kinks/bumps in your hair when you try to curl and its frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted to save a few bucks (I had an FHI and a CHI before that I loved). Those lasted at least 5-7 years. This one I&#x27;ve only had a year., and now here I am, looking to replace it. I&#x27;ll go back to the tried and true brands. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I travel professional a great deal.  This is my second of these flat irons.  The first I dropped and broke.  I love how I can adjust the heat to several different settings.  I have very coarse hair.  This is just a great flat iron with a long enough cord to be very useful.  Any hair type will enjoy this high quality product.</li>
    <li> The great thing about it is that you control the amount of heat you need for your hair so it won&#x27;t get damaged, I really like it, it gets heated quickly and the results are amazing</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was crazy about to buy a hair straightener, so she decided for this model and ask me if I could buy her . She is very happy with his remington hair straightener . Recommended .</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a straightener that could handle my hair - and finally I have found it. It doesn&#x27;t yank my hair out, it is gentle and smooth and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> great straightener. good price, feels like it doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair, gets hot, and heats up quick. great option if you wanna spend under $100.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s hot quick. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this! It works amazingly well! Just make sure you use heat protectant and you are on your way! It is amazing, I would recommend this product to anyone! It got here as said, very well packaging. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> i purchased this straightener because i was unhappy with my old one that left my hair frizzy even after using it.  This one keeps your hair straight and looking shining.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i had this model before and wanted to buy it as a gift for my sister in law... my original remington model came with the keep bag and was of a better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have bought the same model again but i guess i did not get a genuine one as it dont have any keep bag and it is not of the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if these two are placed side by side, u can easily tell the difference between my original remington and this fake copy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the model of remington is excellent but be careful of the fake ones.. make sure you get the original one.</li>
    <li> This one is a great straightener I love how my hair looks after I use it. It is really easy to use. I had no problem with that. Gives my hair a lot of glow</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations with the product because of the price but it works even better than other expensive straightener I had in the past. Other reviews say it makes your hair stinks but it was not my case. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is good but not as good as the one I bought in Paris.  I like it and use it for backup.  One I bought in Paris has more oil therapy.  I bought a converter to use it in USA.</li>
    <li> The heat setting would not go past 230 degrees. Returned and bought a Rusk Heat Freak. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> tittle says it all . my hair is so silky straight , i discovered it from a former friend who lend me it for escape from wonderland .</li>
    <li> Sometimes, and it happens often, this turns off prematurely.  Try it in different outlets around the house. Read the instructions as there is a way to &#x27;hold&#x27; the temp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 7 months. I absolutely LOVED it for the 6 month it worked consistently. Quick heat up time, easy to set the right temperature for my hair, convenient swivel cord and plate lock. I have lots of ridiculously fine hair so I need a flat iron that can be set to relatively low temperature. The product, when it worked, was perfect for me. Within the past month and a half or so, it shuts off almost instantly after I turn it on. I&#x27;ll have to keep my finger on the power button as I curl my hair (the only use I have for a flat iron since I have naturally straight hair) and keep pressing it every few seconds in hope that it&#x27;ll stay warm. Really unfortunate that A $45 flat iron became nearly unusable after such a short amount of time. It really was the perfect product for me, but I need to find a flat iron that will last me longer for how much I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone complaining about button placement and accidentally changing temperatures, press and hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button after you&#x27;ve adjusted to your preferred temperature setting. It&#x27;ll lock the buttons for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves the hair smooth and shiny. It has various levels of heat control, but should be used preferably with a spray to protect hair from the heat of the iron.</li>
    <li> Love the Remington Shine Therapy flat iron.  My only concern is that the control buttons are to close to the lower part of the handle and it&#x27;s easy to shut the iron off or change the heat setting while using it.  The iron&#x27;s base also get very hot so be careful.</li>
    <li> I bought this Remington because of the reviews. I was really amazed what it did for my daughters natural hair! I washed and used conditioner and blow dryed hair. This Flat Iron gave her hair the look and feel of a perm, even down to the ends.I used protection spray with argon oil not to weigh hair down. I want to buy another just to have on hand.. African American hair is very difficult to straighten but not with this Flat Iron!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, dyed hair that is prone to frizz when I use straighteners.  This straightened my hair really well on the lowest two settings and leaves it sleek with minimal frizz.  Heats up extremely quickly and doesn&#x27;t catch on my hair.  I can straighten my entire kinda wavy bob in just a couple minutes.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had this and I just fell in love with it. It definitely leaves your hair so smooth afterwards. Not dull looking like other ones Ive used before.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the product reviews and on the recommendation of a co-worker. Received on Monday, used for the first time today and it worked great. The iron glided through my hair very easily and left it shiny and straight,  just like I just left the salon. It heats up quickly and I personally like the lock feature which allows you to set and keep the temperature until you want to change it. I would classify my hair as normal according to the hair type guide included in the box.</li>
    <li> I ordered this .. was very excited about it but when I got it , it was packaged for South America &amp; the straighter was in Celsius for the degrees , when the description cleary stated degrees were suppose to be F .</li>
    <li> My hair stays straight for days!  I have fine curly hair and nothing has ever worked but this flat iron.  Love, love it.</li>
    <li> My cosmetologist told me what to buy to use on my hair.  This fit all the specs she told me to search for in a flat iron with ceramic one-inch plates plus has some extra qualities.  I am very well pleased with the Remington S8500.  Thank you for shipping it to me promptly.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of heat on my hair and this straightener makes my hair really shiny and a lot less damaged. I strongly recommend this, I love it</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mom as a gift. this is a great quality straightener and works pretty well on my moms curly/wavy hair. she loves it. its also very reasonably priced. order arrived within 5 business days.</li>
    <li> dont go too far , its within your reach..dis is d right straightener u need.i bought it this and used it and im glad i did.good price,excellent quality!!!</li>
    <li> I love this iron! Before it would take me at least 2 hrs to do my hair but now with this iron it takes me 45 min tops. I LOVE doing my hair now. :-)</li>
    <li> UPDATED 3/18/2014 What I have figured out is that my unit has to be unplugged between uses, not just turned off. When I unplug it, it works every single time. Great straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be my favorite straightener ever, BUT I have trouble getting mine to stay on long enough to heat up. This was my second one actually and I had the same problem with the first. Decided to keep this one because I do love the way it works when it stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer I only use this on my bangs because it would be a waste of time to do my whole head on a humid day. When it heats up, it heats up FAST and I can get my bangs done in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/19/12 Remington was nice enough to replace my defective one with another one that will not stay on unless I push the button five times. This is my third unit and I will not spend another seven bucks to mail this one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I have found that if I pick it up and turn it on, it tends to turn on on the first try more often.</li>
    <li> it get the work done. I have used better but its true when you plug it in after 2-5 seconds you can start using it. When I am in a rush this come in handy.</li>
    <li> ES UN PRODUCTO COMPLETAMENTE LIVIANO,  DE FACIL MANEJO, LA TEMPERATURA PUEDE SER GRADUADA. PERMITE AHORRAR TIEMPO, EL CABLE ES BASTANTE LARGO.LO RECOMIENDO TOTALEMENTE!</li>
    <li> So, this is just a flat iron after the first 2 uses.  The conditioner only really works the first 2 times and after that, it&#x27;s just a regular ceramic flat iron.  Buy a Paul Mitchell Flat iron.  That&#x27;s what I wanted, but this was a Gold Box deal.</li>
    <li> Avocado and vitamin E conditioning plates that prevent moisture loss?  Welllll, I&#x27;m not too sure about that.  But what I do know is that this thin, lightweight straightener does a fine job at straightening hair and smoothing frizz.  For years, I used a large, heavy Solano Sapphire straightener.  Until I gave this Remington a try, after seeing it on sale for half price, I didn&#x27;t know how much easier straightening could be.  The straightening effects of the Remington are equal to the Solano, but the Remington is significantly easier to use, due to its lighter weight and smaller width.  It&#x27;s easier to get a firm grip on my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t snag.  It heats up quickly, and I like the digital temperature display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would ignore all the marketing hocus pocus and focus on the fact that this is an effective straightener.</li>
    <li> This iron is so overrated!  I have slightly wavy hair and I expected this iron to straighten it with just a couple passes but it didnt!  I even set it to the hottest temperature and it still didnt do much.  I dont understnd all these great reviews. I was dissapointed!  And when it was time to return it... they deducted a shipping fee so be sure you want this piece of junk!!  UGH!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used this product but am very excited too. The item was in perfect condition and is very attractive.</li>
    <li> Yeah no more i can say about it except that this review requires three more words now one two three</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great ! It definitely leaves behind a nice shine in your hair. You don&#x27;t even have to raise it to the highest temperature in order for it to work.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron 3 years ago, use it everyday, it is just now wearing out and I have come here to buy a new one. It&#x27;s a great product and really adds shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once since I received it but I really like how my hair turned out. Silky smooths and bouncy. Lock the screen and its fantastic. Can&#x27;t beat the results for the price.  Will update review once I&#x27;ve had it for a while.  Update: 5/20/13  I have had this for about a month and let me tell you I love it. I am blowdrying my hair with ( Infiniti by Conair SD8R Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, Black) and the flat ironing it. The results continue to be fantastic. My hair is very shiny and soft. I use at the 300 setting because that&#x27;s plenty hot.  The one thing I would change :  it may be me but it seems to take longer than 30 seconds to preheat and after reaching the 30 sec mark it cuts off. That&#x27;s slightly annoying, once I had to turn it back on 3 times in a row but oh we&#x27;ll that&#x27;s not the worse thing in the world.  Update December 2016: It&#x27;s still going strong and I still love it! I am using it at around 375-390 as I am wearing my hair in its naturally curly state. I still use the same blow dryer but I added the Denman Thermoceramic Straightening Brush with Boar Bristle, Model D7, Ceramic Plates, Boar Bristle (Love that too). If my hair needs a trim it helps smooth those ends.  I use it every 3 to 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener a lot! My hair is usually frizzy, thick, long, and dry. but when I use this it helps with the frizz and it makes my hair shiny. The buttons are a little annoying since they are pushed in however, there is  the temperature lock that&#x27;s really helpful, because of where the buttons are I keep pushing them, but other than that its great</li>
    <li> As many other reviewers have mentioned, this straightener turns itself off several times before it heats up, however, I have found that it powers up without issue as long as you unplug it after each use.
