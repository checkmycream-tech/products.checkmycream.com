      <li>I loved this product because it was really original!</li>
      <li>She was especially pleased with this particular product, I assume, because of the smell test.</li>
      <li>I received this perfume years ago as a gift and loved the light flowery scent.  </li>
      <li>She loves it, I love the way she smells and so many people have commented how nice this fragrance is on my Mother.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this beautiful scent in it&#x27;s lovely perfume bottle and ballerina stopper.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to find it in department stores for $20.</li>
      <li>I choose Pavlova just because of the fragrance and once applied was even better on me.........</li>
      <li>but I love the perfume and have been using for years.</li>
      <li>Will keep you posted as to the scent, as this was my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My mother&#x27;s favorite scent...</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>But then when she out in on she fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Again I love the product and thank&#x27;s to amazon</li>
      <li>Scent is okay but not as I remembered, somewhat stronger.</li>
      <li>Dont guide always for the price, not always the expencier is better.</li>
      <li>Still my favorite</li>
      <li>Though discontinued for many years, it was re-released in the 1980&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I wore Pavlova many years ago --- and this is not Pavlova.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many scents since then</li>
      <li>and so glad I was able to find somewhere that carries it.</li>
      <li>; what is that, it smells great &amp;#34; , the odor is soft but memorable, time and time</li>
      <li>A classic scent as beautiful today as when it was first created.</li>
      <li>Received package quickly, hope my mother will like her Christmas gift!</li>
      <li>Thank you again for making it available.</li>
      <li>Amazon for having this available for me as my home burned,there went a lot of my fav&#x27;s..........</li>
      <li>Have had many compliments, such as &amp;#34; you smell so good &amp;#34; &amp;#34</li>
      <li>Even before she could smell it she fell in love with the modern ballerina sculpture top.  </li>
      <li>This rendition of the scent is not the original.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent and love the way it makes me feel young and refreshed</li>
      <li>While this has a pleasant fragrance reminiscent of the Pavlova</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon and at a really low price.  </li>
      <li>The stopper, made in the shape of a ballerina, adds to the charm and sweet elegance of the bottle.</li>
      <li>, it was exactly what I expected and this is a happy customer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A lovely, old fashioned fragrance!</li>
      <li>which is when I first bought a bottle.  </li>
      <li>This product arrived on time and is exactly as I remembered it from years past.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Her exact words were that it was &amp;#34;Elegant.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I buy this perfume occasionally as a gift for my mother, who has worn it for many years.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute perfume, have not had another since and Thank You....</li>
      <li>I really like my purchase</li>
      <li>This is NOT the same formulation as the original.  </li>
      <li>It is not bad, just different</li>
      <li>So glad that I can buy it here instead of hunting it down store by store as I had to do before.</li>
      <li>My spouse likes to test new perfumes and toilettes.  </li>
      <li>Pavlova was first released by Payot back in 1922 in honor of the famed dancer, Anna Pavlova.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of an old ladies perfume.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;initially than the old formula.  </li>
      <li>I took a big chance as my wife is very picky about her perfumes.  </li>
      <li>Received well packaged and with other pretty perfume samples which I included in her Christmas stocking.</li>

    <li> Pavlova came on the market just about the same time white diamonds did.....I choose Pavlova just because of the fragrance and once applied was even better on me.........This is my absolute perfume, have not had another since and Thank You....Amazon for having this available for me as my home burned,there went a lot of my fav&#x27;s..........Again I love the product and thank&#x27;s to amazon I have it back...Diana Stoler</li>
    <li> I think this perfume is counterfeit&lt;br /&gt;My mother has used it for years and it just doesn&#x27;t smell like Pavlova</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I used to be able to find it in department stores for $20. Not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive now, but I love the perfume and have been using for years.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume my Mother has worn for 40+ years. She loves it, I love the way she smells and so many people have commented how nice this fragrance is on my Mother.</li>
    <li> My spouse likes to test new perfumes and toilettes.  She was especially pleased with this particular product, I assume, because of the smell test.</li>
    <li> Scent is okay but not as I remembered, somewhat stronger. Or maybe my taste has changed since the last time I used it. I still use it but probably would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Pavlova was first released by Payot back in 1922 in honor of the famed dancer, Anna Pavlova. Though discontinued for many years, it was re-released in the 1980&#x27;s which is when I first bought a bottle.  I&#x27;ve gone through many scents since then but I have always had a bottle of Pavlova on my dresser.  So glad that I can buy it here instead of hunting it down store by store as I had to do before.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in any areas stores.  So happy there is another option.  Thank you again for making it available.</li>
    <li> Received package quickly, hope my mother will like her Christmas gift! Will keep you posted as to the scent, as this was my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite scent...I purchased for a Christmas present. Received well packaged and with other pretty perfume samples which I included in her Christmas stocking. A classic scent as beautiful today as when it was first created. I highly recommend this beautiful scent in it&#x27;s lovely perfume bottle and ballerina stopper.</li>
    <li> While this has a pleasant fragrance reminiscent of the Pavlova I used several years ago, it seems slightly different.  It is sharper&lt;br /&gt;initially than the old formula.  I remember Pavlova having a softer scent.  It is not bad, just different and I will use it.</li>
    <li> Es el favorito de mi esposa desde hace treinta a&amp;ntilde;os. Tiene un rico,misterioso aroma.</li>
    <li> This rendition of the scent is not the original.  I can&#x27;t even begin to guess what was done to ruin the formula, but the &amp;#34;boof&amp;#34; is gone....</li>
    <li> I received this perfume years ago as a gift and loved the light flowery scent.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and at a really low price.  I gave myself and a friend a bottle this Christmas.</li>
    <li> Have had many compliments, such as &amp;#34; you smell so good &amp;#34; &amp;#34; what is that, it smells great &amp;#34; , the odor is soft but memorable, time and time again people make comments on how good I smell. This product arrived on time and is exactly as I remembered it from years past.&lt;br /&gt; A great buy !!!</li>
    <li> This is NOT the same formulation as the original.  A big disappointment.  Guess they just licensed the name and the design.</li>
    <li> I wore Pavlova many years ago --- and this is not Pavlova.  This smells old and dusty.  It does not look discolored, but the fragrance is surely not fresh.  Note these cannot be returned, so I will pursue a refund.  Yuk.</li>
    <li> I loved this product because it was really original! its smell is perfect and as I remember it. Dont guide always for the price, not always the expencier is better.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this scent long ago.  I guess my body chemistry has changed because I do not like it on me at all.  Perhaps they changed the formula. I hope it smells better on a friend!</li>
    <li> I buy this perfume occasionally as a gift for my mother, who has worn it for many years. It remains her favorite! The stopper, made in the shape of a ballerina, adds to the charm and sweet elegance of the bottle. A lovely, old fashioned fragrance!</li>
    <li> I had this years ago and was so happy when I found it again.  Maybe I have changed.  Reminds me of an old ladies perfume.</li>
    <li> I really like my purchase, it was exactly what I expected and this is a happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for it.</li>
    <li> Anything made in Paris is wonderful! Love the scent and love the way it makes me feel young and refreshed</li>
    <li> The item is perfect. Love it. It was a great price for the quantity. Could not find it at this price on ebay.</li>
    <li> Have worn this for years. Still my favorite</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  I knew nothing about it but saw that it had been around since the 1920&#x27;s so I assumed it must have a lot of followers.  I took a big chance as my wife is very picky about her perfumes.  In this case, however, I scored a home run.  Even before she could smell it she fell in love with the modern ballerina sculpture top.  But then when she out in on she fell in love with it.  Her exact words were that it was &amp;#34;Elegant.&amp;#34;  She absolutely loved it! Hooray!</li>
    <li> Been wearing Pavlova for 40 years.I love it and so glad I was able to find somewhere that carries it.</li>
