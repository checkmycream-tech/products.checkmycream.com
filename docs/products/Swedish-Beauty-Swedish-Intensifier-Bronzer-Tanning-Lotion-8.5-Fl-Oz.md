      <li>This is by far the best, no streaking at all, not a bad smell and def</li>
      <li>My girlfriend tried it and had good results the first time.</li>
      <li>I never have purchased a swedish beauty product that I did not like and this is no different, my daughter even asked me what kind of cologne I was wearing, so it must smell pleasant as well.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that if I switch it up with another lotion my skin is fine.</li>
      <li>This lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a clean, almost perfume</li>
      <li>I like using this along with Obsession products, I alternate them and am able to keep up nice coloring</li>
      <li>This lotion is good for starting your tan or maintaining a tan.</li>

      <li>The first time I started tanning, the Swedish Beauty line was suggested to me.</li>
      <li>I have been using the above Product for many years.</li>
      <li>however i purchase this product From my local tanning salon for $20 bucks:)</li>
      <li>The results were really amplified when I went in a level 2 tanning bed as opposed to a level 1.</li>
      <li>I started on Pink Diamond (no tingle) and feel in love with the feel and smell.  </li>
      <li>This product is okay, not as good as Solid Black and Black and Tan.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not that greasy, it&#x27;s bronzer is normal, the price is normal.</li>
      <li>first time user of this brand long time tanner</li>
      <li>They discontinued that lotion and after much searching, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Swedish Intensifier because it has the exact smell (not your typical tanning lotion smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product consistently for the past 3 years and have found it to do exactly what it claims to do ... enhance and intensify my tanning.</li>
      <li>nothing bad or good to say about this lotion, really.</li>
      <li>No streaks, no stains, overall it gives you such a natural bronze tan!!</li>
      <li>Since I started out reallly pale, I was told to first get a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer</li>
      <li>no strong smell, no fake gold color.</li>

<li> Derma dark is the way to go when it comes to a bronzer!</li>
<li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
<li> I just started tanning a few weeks ago</li>
<li> and I have a very pale complexion.</li>
<li> so I can build a base tan.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lotion does not smell good not to mention that my tan is not intensifying at all. This product is a waste of money. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just started tanning a few weeks ago but I go almost every day.  Since I started out reallly pale, I was told to first get a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer so I can build a base tan.  (I&#x27;m blonde..and I don&#x27;t wanna turn orange).  I can definitely tell that It&#x27;s helped me get a darker tan ALREADY.  AND it&#x27;s smells really good which isn&#x27;t the case for a lot of them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally pretty pale and wearing long pants except on weekends, have trouble tanning on my legs.  This product was recommended at a tanning salon so I tried a bottle.  After 10 sessions I couldn&#x27;t tell that it had done anything for me.  My girlfriend tried it and had good results the first time.</li>
    <li> Out of all the lotions I&#x27;ve ever used this is my absolute favorite!! Derma dark is the way to go when it comes to a bronzer! No streaks, no stains, overall it gives you such a natural bronze tan!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I like using this along with Obsession products, I alternate them and am able to keep up nice coloring and I have a very pale complexion.</li>
    <li> I have tried many tanning products! This is by far the best, no streaking at all, not a bad smell and def gets the job done and then some:) My tan looks natural:) however i purchase this product From my local tanning salon for $20 bucks:)</li>
    <li> This lotion is good for starting your tan or maintaining a tan. It&#x27;s nice because there&#x27;s no tingle, no strong smell, no fake gold color. And you don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after because of the antibacterial in it.</li>
    <li> I never have purchased a swedish beauty product that I did not like and this is no different, my daughter even asked me what kind of cologne I was wearing, so it must smell pleasant as well.</li>
    <li> It smells great is very silky. It doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feel afterwards that some lotions do. I&#x27;m not getting any darker than I would with any other lotion- but I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for tanning. Give it a try!  Used this before and will use it again.  It does not tingle.</li>
    <li> I have been using the above Product for many years. I use it throughout the year after showering and also  at the Pool &amp; Beach.  This should not be used as Sunblock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product consistently for the past 3 years and have found it to do exactly what it claims to do ... enhance and intensify my tanning.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t gone tanning in quite some time, so I needed just a standard lotion to start off. This lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. The results were really amplified when I went in a level 2 tanning bed as opposed to a level 1.</li>
    <li> i have only used it a couple time. smells great came sealed. first time user of this brand long time tanner</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lotion and does a great job. It smells nice... feels good, and produces a long lasting tan.</li>
    <li> nothing bad or good to say about this lotion, really. The smell is alright, it&#x27;s not that greasy, it&#x27;s bronzer is normal, the price is normal.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell &amp; works great.  Don&#x27;t recommend putting it on &amp; being outside for 4 hours....LOL  Got more sun than I intended :)</li>
    <li> This product is okay, not as good as Solid Black and Black and Tan.  probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> The first time I started tanning, the Swedish Beauty line was suggested to me. I started on Pink Diamond (no tingle) and feel in love with the feel and smell.  They discontinued that lotion and after much searching, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with Swedish Intensifier because it has the exact smell (not your typical tanning lotion smell, it&#x27;s a clean, almost perfume smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said I can only speak for my skin type, which is fair/pale, it did make my skin turn slightly red, which is why this product only got 4 stars, because I can&#x27;t use it every time. However, I&#x27;ve found that if I switch it up with another lotion my skin is fine. If you&#x27;re looking to become instantly dark, then this isn&#x27;t the lotion for you, but it&#x27;s great for that sun kissed look.</li>
