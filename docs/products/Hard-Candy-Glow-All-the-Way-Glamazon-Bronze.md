<li> but a little goes a long way</li>
<li> I will recommend it to other people looking for the bronze look.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just too messy,heavy and not worth ruining my clothing.</li>
<li> It is very thick and feels heavy on the skin.</li>
<li> The stains did not come out in the wash with cold water</li>
<li> Terrible, terrible product.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a great bronzer and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. It&#x27;s inexpensive and can catch up whiter spots to more tan spots.</li>
    <li> This is very pretty. It is cheaper at the retail stores, though.</li>
    <li> I chose this particular Hard Candy Glow because I did not want a self-tanner added. It&#x27;s nice when combined with a body lotion or added to a dry oil spray for a little bronzy glow. However, I slathered it on my arms and legs and thought I would NEVER get it smoothed on evenly. It is very thick and feels heavy on the skin. I waited 10 minutes after application before dressing and unfortunately still got it all over my new yellow top and had to find somthing else to wear. The stains did not come out in the wash with cold water and I had to throw it away. I also noticed that it rubbed off on my bed linens hours after application. I will use the tube lightly mixed with body lotion, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It&#x27;s just too messy,heavy and not worth ruining my clothing. Also, Walmart carries this for $8.00. I noticed the price here on Amazon is $29.00. Really??? That is avery high mark-up!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT FOR PRICE!!</li>
    <li> * I like the baked bronzer in tropics the best, it looks so natural with the right amount of shine  * Hard Candy makes some great eye shadow colors as well but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love them all, great stuff. thank you I have been using this for 2 years now hope they don&#x27;t go out of bussiness.</li>
    <li> Terrible, terrible product.  I should have known by the name.  Turns out this product is sold at Walmart, should have known that too.  METALLIC look to it.  Rubs off for hours on everything.  Leaves no tan at all.  Just like metallic grease paint.</li>
    <li> I feel pretty oh so pretty!</li>
    <li> great stuff ... original and wrapped well and had it on time&lt;br /&gt;u just won a client from saudi arabia&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll always purchase from u&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> Rub it in good, check in the mirror to be sure how it looks....make sure you smooth it out.....it lasts ALL DAY....SPARKLEY.....HEALTHY....no stain incidents at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at walmart. I like the product. It is shimmery has very fine glitter in it... I think that&#x27;s the glow. Didn&#x27;t make my skin orange or Jersey Shore looking. Easy to remove with makeup wipe.. Didn&#x27;t come off on shirt when changing</li>
    <li> Not half as good as Tarte&#x27;s Amazon creme, but ok. the Gold they speak of is hard to see and instead of a translucent shine of tint, it seems to cake on like old fashioned liquid makeup...the old CoverGirl Bronzer. Better products are out there...</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff. I&#x27;m a Carmel beige color and  use it on my legs to give them a sexy glow and I also use it as a highlighter on my face. It&#x27;s beautiful, seriously a little goes a Long way with this product. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The product gets into my wrinkles and seems to enhance them.  However, it does look really nice on my legs.  I really appreciated the video on how to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I will recommend it to other people looking for the bronze look. Fast shipping for where I was.</li>
    <li> i love it so much! thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, gives me a glow just enough to match the tan on my body and if my face is tan adds bit more glow. I dont break out from it either so thats a plus</li>
    <li> I bought this bronzer to be used as a partial foundation and blush on cheeks, and as eye shadow foundation.  It does a beautiful job because it was designed to be layered and removed easy when applied.  This bronzer is the ONLY blush I use now.  It does an excellent job also as lip base.&lt;br /&gt;Used as body bronzer is very good too. Perhaps not dark enough for my skin tone on legs.  It does come out easy, so if you are sweating it will streak.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good and it last a very long time if used as face foundation like I do.  I also purchased the darker version which is too dark for the face but very good for the rest of the body.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I LOOOVVVEEEE ITTT.&lt;br /&gt;very nice finish, and it stays for a long time</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve only used it on my face, and I love it! The reason I&#x27;m posting is this - DON&#x27;T buy it here! You can get it at Walmart, either online or in the store, for only $8!</li>
    <li> Love this product, always cringe at the price.  great product, but they could lower the price tag.</li>
    <li> Sent me the self-tanner, not the bronzer. Uck</li>
    <li> Quick tan in a tube .... And great for an evening out ...no hosiery needed !!  Easy to apply too !!!!</li>
