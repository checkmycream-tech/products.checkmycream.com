    <li> This is a great product for chapped hands.</li>
    <li> Very good hand treatment - prompt delivery.  Good for gifts -</li>
    <li> It is actually a very good product.  There are two reasons I gave it four stars and not five: (1) The jar (tin) packaging is as convenient to use as the tube, and (2) The cream consistency is just a little on a thicker side to my taste.  Having said that, it actually does a pretty good job for dry hands!</li>
    <li> All was good! Came on time and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast relief for very dry, itchy skin.  Also, overnight improvement for dry cracked hands and feet.  Works well on feet when covered by sox.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Very satisfied with the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price from a great vendor!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!</li>

    <li> I am a retired hairstylist and have used Glysolid for years with great success.  Recently my local Supplier discontinued the product and I was no longer able to buy local so it was a great day to find it and have it delivered to my door.  This is a great product to keep hands and elbows from cracking.  I Use it daily once in the am and once in the pm.</li>
    <li> I love Glysolid.  I have been using it for over 10 years and will not use anything else.  I like the fact that it is scent free and once it absorbed by your skin you can&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
    <li> Great service!  Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> what my wife wanted Thanks</li>
    <li> Everything was awsome!</li>
    <li> This cream is the best for dry skin.  I had used this cream a few years back, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so I tried others since then which didn&#x27;t give me the same results as Glysolid.  Use it all the time during the winter months especially.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used, I have very dry skin and this works very well.</li>
    <li> I love glysolid.  I use it every night.  Glysolid works better than anything I can find.  I also really like this particular distributor.  You know exactly what you are getting and what the price is.  There are many places to purchase glysolid on Amazon and I like this particular site the best.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Especially good for cracks in your skin.</li>
    <li> my wifes hands were awful after one use they were better it is awesome the best stuff ever it gets an A plus</li>
    <li> My husband cannot live without this cream.  He is allergic to the cold in the Northeast and welts pop up on his body.  This is the only cream that helps his dry skin. I&#x27;ve used Glysolid as well and love it.  Glysolid makes my dry, flaky skin soft and it is great to use before you go to bed.  Cover your hands and feet with the cream and cottons socks/gloves and your skin will thank you in the morning.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Glysolid  does wonders for my husbands dermatitis - and at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Received amazingly fast!</li>
    <li> The cream was exactly what I wanted and it came promptly!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Best thing for my dry, cracked hands.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to this product because I am always washing my hands.  I was spending a lot of money on lotion only to wash my hands and have to reapply it over and over and over again.  This product feels great and does not wash off after just one wash.</li>
    <li> After years of being a hairstylist and having dry, cracked hands all the time, I tried anything anyone told me would help. I tried bag balm, hoofmaker, and on and on. Then a fellow hairstylist had the shop owner order this in to sell. I tried it, and I&#x27;ve never tried anything else. My hands can be dry and cracked from not using this for awhile, and within a few days of wearing this at night when i sleep, they&#x27;ll be healed up. It is a bit greasy, so that&#x27;s why I usually put it on at night with a pair of cotton gloves. It also works great on elbows, feet, etc.</li>
    <li> Glysolid hand cream is excellant for hands, elbows and heels!  the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used it myself and sold this to my customers for 25 years.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product!  For years, Glysolid has prevented the re-occurance of eczema on my legs.  Wonderful for use on my hands, as well.</li>
    <li> Tried it at my aunt&#x27;s home.  Loved it!  Cleared up the scaling on my husband&#x27;s elbows overnight!  With regular use, no more problem.  Looking forward to see how it does this winter.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it seems to be the best product for healing my winter dry cracked skin</li>
    <li> excellent product, I&#x27;ve used glysolid for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Glysoid for years. IF you get dry hands, feet, skin THIS is for you. LOOK NO MORE! does not leave Greasy film, it has a subtle refreshing smell almost non-existence once you rub into skin. FYI make sure when you use it you put a SMALL amount on your fingers and then ADD a little WATER to it. RUB hands together and APPLY to any area of your body. you can use it on your face too. it is THICK so if you don&#x27;t DILUTE it with water it&#x27;s hard to apply...this will last for a long time becos like i said a little goes a long way and it STAYS FRESH.. There is NOTHING like it on the market. It&#x27;s very hard to FIND in a store. i am also a Cosmetologist and i SELL this in my Booth. My clients LOVE it. Once you try it and feel how SOFT it makes your skin,keeps your skin MOIST and you hear comments like \\&quot;OMG you have soft skin\\&quot; you&#x27;ll be obsessed with Product.YES it&#x27;s that GREAT (Really). Men Love it to for dry hands and feet. All my Brothers in Law use it too... A+++++</li>
    <li> love this product, have used it for years and is the only hand cream that helps my hands . In So Cal we have a very dry climate!</li>
