### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Compared to my hair&#x27;s wonderful reaction to [[ASIN:B00A0IWSN4 Suave Professionals</li>
      <li>For me, though, as a Caucasian woman, it&#x27;s too greasy, but it&#x27;s perfect for her.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and</li>
      <li>This hair treatment has worked great for both us.</li>
      <li>Great to use before a blow out as well.</li>
      <li>Works great, my hair is softer and smoother and it also smells amazing!</li>
      <li>This will make your hair more mangable and make it look its best.</li>
      <li>Nothing terribly remarkable to comment upon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very good conditioning product that I am glad I took the time to try.</li>
      <li>This was a really good once-a-week treatment for my hair.</li>
      <li>If you have my problem too, it is a good choice.</li>
      <li>It smells so good as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for the price and quite serviceable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good product to try, for all hair types.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel any need to add styling products to make it look good--</li>
      <li>My hair already felt better, but I have experienced *that</li>
      <li>I love low-maintenance!</li>
      <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice hair treatment.</li>
      <li>I grabbed this because I&#x27;m always in search of a decent hair mask, but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>The greatest  part is the price isn&#x27;t too high.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It washes out quickly and leaves my hair smelling really great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this product because it still works even while using another kind of shampoo....</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very impressed with Clear products.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special going in or rinising out, but it really did a great job with my hair!</li>
      <li>I liked that there wasn&#x27;t a strong scent to it.</li>
      <li>I have to say that my hair feels more mangable and livelier then ever before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably going to cut it back to using it once a week at this point, just to see what happens, but I am very happy with the results I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note:</li>
      <li>best part is that is smells fantastic; I wasn&#x27;t surprised to see almond oil in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because my hair is shorter, the positive effects are not as noticeable, but the wife- who has much longer and thicker hair than mine- agrees that this is a very good conditioner</li>
      <li>Once one, the smell was very clean and not too flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed and wasn&#x27;t very happy that my hair still felt tangled and not very moisture rich.</li>
      <li>Detangles and adds shine, easy to style with, recommended.</li>
      <li>Clear Scalp Therapy is a good hair conditioner for most any type of hair.</li>
      <li>Good deep conditioning mask, really smooths your hair out, smells great, locks in moisture without making it too greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;leaves hair shiny, smooth and does not weigh my hair</li>
      <li>Being a proud latina, my hair is in the middle between wavy and curly, tending to frizzing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every 2-3 washes, and I wash my hair once or twice a week and use either no product or a light oil in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it is so smooth after this process.</li>
      <li>treatment is nice and creamy and does not make your hair feel greasy and the smell is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you get when you touch something that is smooth and clean.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since my hair is so dry to begin with, I was pretty impressed by the shiny and manageable results achieved in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;A winner!</li>
      <li>/use a particular kind of \\&quot;pre-wash\\&quot;....</li>
      <li>This was a smooth and creamy product, and it did feel great while in my hair, but the scent was a little overwhelming, and I didn&#x27;t notice an appreciable difference in texture after rinsing.</li>
      <li>and I have not noticed any significant difference.  </li>
      <li>It looks a bit like the stripes that come out of Aquafresh toothpaste, but not as cleanly separated.  </li>
      <li>The strong floral fragrance goes right through the plastic of the tube</li>
      <li>I LOVED it and will be watching for it in my local stores.</li>
      <li>Cool for pharmaceutical racism.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Simple, no heavy scents, inexpensive, and highly effective.</li>
      <li>A good product especially if you bleach your hair</li>
      <li>This mask like the shampoo and conditioner of the same brand is good product for dealing with frizzy flyaway hair.  </li>
      <li>Mild scent&lt;br /&gt;thick</li>
      <li>This deep nourishing mask makes even the driest, most over-processed hair manageable again!</li>
      <li>I have medium length, fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair soft and shiny, and my curls more defined.</li>
      <li>But the ingredients are okay for natural hair, so this may work well for others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clear line of ethnic products for my daughter&#x27;s hair (she&#x27;s from Taiwan, of mostly aboriginal origin), and I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this container&#x27;s worth, but I will not be purchasing an additional supply.</li>
      <li>I had tried the Clear sample challenge with their shampoo and conditioner several months ago, and I was happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>bottle size might not stretch over very many treatments depending on how much hair you have, but given that I&#x27;m only going to be using it about once a week</li>
      <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve gotten great results using [[ASIN:B007RTR8AC</li>
      <li>But this treatment mask washes out pretty cleanly without leaving your hair smelling too much like flowers.  </li>
      <li>my hair was dry, it felt, well, *nice* to run my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>treatment mask is not creamy smooth like some masks, but it is rather thick, so it does not spread out as easily, requiring me to use more product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a way to get more nourishment into my hair, especially during the hot summer months, and this was just what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I squirted a dollop out, massaged it through my hair, tried to guesstimate when it had been three minutes, and I rinsed it out.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Use bi-weekly in place of Clear Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I use this hair mask once a week and my hair is soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Use bi-weekly in place of Clear Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products to combat frizz, but few actually help my cause in a good way.  </li>
      <li>It left their hair feeling sleek, and I was able to brush my daughters&#x27; hair without difficulty.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work pretty well and to do what it claims.  </li>
      <li>I noticed it even after the FIRST week.....</li>
      <li>The white stripe is the nourishing treatment component and the orange/pink stripe is the \\&quot;concentrated Nutrium 10 technology\\&quot;, which includes vitamins B5/C/E, aloe vera extract, and sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils... an interesting blend.  </li>
      <li>And by the time that your hair totally dries, the fragrance subsides even more.  </li>
      <li>And...I was NOT disappointed and am glad I decided to try it out, for, when I had seen it, I was experiencing abnormally dry skin/having more dry of a scalp than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have a lot of very fine, medium long, color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I LOVE products with almond oil, and I also happen to be a fan of the new Clear hair products that have come out.</li>
      <li>I found the smell of the product pleasant and not overwhelming</li>
      <li>and this really makes my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I have notice a positive difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product is fairly priced for the results garnered though this is a small container (six ounces).</li>
      <li>I used this product three times a week in the place of my regular conditioner for about a month, and it worked ok on my long hair that frizzes and tangles easily.</li>
      <li>It helps also keep my and color fresh and looks like new.</li>
      <li>hair is not as dry and lays better.</li>
      <li>do, however, have hair that always feels a bit brittle and doesn&#x27;t look terribly healthy, and my scalp seems dry.</li>
      <li>It was a little floral, but not the kind of overwhelming smell that I&#x27;m still noticing long afterward like some products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I have used it 3 times in 2 weeks and it has certainly helped with the summer humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With this product, my hair does look shinier and it feels softer, with a certain slickness to the touch.</li>
      <li>My hair, which is typically dry and dull with lots of fly aways, is always smooth and shiny after I use the treatment mask.  </li>
      <li>&quot; treatment should be for every two weeks, and using it twice a week is four times too much.</li>
      <li>So I really think that this \\&quot;bi-weekly\\</li>
      <li>But once I brushed it out, it was smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t use or need conditioners very often, but even those of us with shorter hair need to turn to conditioners at some point.</li>
      <li>have pretty frizzy hair normally</li>
      <li>So I really think that this \\&quot;bi-weekly\\</li>
      <li>It recommends using bi-weekly, but I have found that once a week seems to really give my hair a lift.</li>
      <li>product really seems to un-do the environmental damage of salt and chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about this conditioner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair is thick and can get a bit out of hand if I neglect it much. This did a decent job of calming it down and smoothing things out. I liked that there wasn&#x27;t a strong scent to it. It was a little floral, but not the kind of overwhelming smell that I&#x27;m still noticing long afterward like some products I&#x27;ve tried. I did have to be a bit careful to thoroughly rinse, but it wasn&#x27;t anything too onerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle size might not stretch over very many treatments depending on how much hair you have, but given that I&#x27;m only going to be using it about once a week I think it&#x27;ll be all right for how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, fine straight hair. My husband has nearly waist-length hair that is thick and wavy. This hair treatment has worked great for both us. My husband&#x27;s hair looks healthier; I started using this after I had a touch-up trim to my hair, and I have yet to see any split ends, which are usually a big problem for me because of all the sytling that I do to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that is smells fantastic; I wasn&#x27;t surprised to see almond oil in the ingredients. I LOVE products with almond oil, and I also happen to be a fan of the new Clear hair products that have come out. In the past, I&#x27;ve gotten great results using [[ASIN:B007RTR8AC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo]], as well as using [[ASIN:B007RTR8UM CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner]].</li>
    <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special going in or rinising out, but it really did a great job with my hair! After just one use, it was shinier and way less fluffy and frizzy. I have a really bad haircut I&#x27;m trying to grow out, so I&#x27;m especially sensitive to my hair looking poufy or frizzy, and this has made a huge difference in my ability to tolerate this awful cut. I&#x27;ve been using it every 2-3 washes, and I wash my hair once or twice a week and use either no product or a light oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have short, very slightly wavy hair that I wear straight. Before I started using this, it went out every which way with the \\&quot;textured\\&quot; cut, but now I can manage to get it more or less how I want it with just some wetting and smoothing, and a few drops of light oil if I want some extra gloss.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light scent, and the container makes controlling the flow of product easy.</li>
    <li> Clear Scalp Therapy is a good hair conditioner for most any type of hair. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and generally like what I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and I don&#x27;t use or need conditioners very often, but even those of us with shorter hair need to turn to conditioners at some point. My scalp and hair tend to be dry and conditioners can make a difference. With this product, my hair does look shinier and it feels softer, with a certain slickness to the touch. It isn&#x27;t an oily slickness, but more like the slick feeling you get when you touch something that is smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is shorter, the positive effects are not as noticeable, but the wife- who has much longer and thicker hair than mine- agrees that this is a very good conditioner and I can see a difference in her hair when she uses it. The slickness I described above is certainly present, as is a certain amount of shine. I also notice that my hair is a little less brittle than before and there is less breakage at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good conditioning product that I am glad I took the time to try. I like the performance better than that of my usual conditioner, Aussie, and I like the scent, too. It&#x27;s definitely a good product to try, for all hair types.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair treatment. I started using it about a month ago. I used it once every week and I have notice a positive difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not as dry and lays better. I do have mid-back length hair, but it is naturally curly. I usually have a stray hair look, and this is helping in managing my hair from looking out of control. Not to big on hair sprays and gels for hair management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment is nice and creamy and does not make your hair feel greasy and the smell is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a perfect solution but it does help. If you have my problem too, it is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with short hair. During parts of the year, my scalp gets dry so I decided to try this product. It&#x27;s good for the price and quite serviceable. Nothing terribly remarkable to comment upon. Leave it in for a few minutes to penetrate the scalp then wash off.</li>
    <li> This works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty frizzy hair normally and this really makes my hair soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s much easier to style and the smoothness lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick product, so for me, it&#x27;s a bit hard to get it throughout my hair.  But, once I have it massaged in, it takes out all the tangles and I can feel the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes out quickly and leaves my hair smelling really great.</li>
    <li> So, I naturally have a dry scalp, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as some/most, and it usually doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...when I first saw this product, I was a bit skeptical, &#x27;cause all of the other hair shampoos &amp; conditioners I&#x27;ve used before have said &#x27;moisturizes&#x27; to some degree/fashion, but have yielded nothing. In any case, I decided to give her a go. And...I was NOT disappointed and am glad I decided to try it out, for, when I had seen it, I was experiencing abnormally dry skin/having more dry of a scalp than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I will preface this by saying, this is not a cure, nor is it something I think actually \\&quot;fixes\\&quot; the issue, but merely helps and aids...it helped me greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this product because it still works even while using another kind of shampoo....you don&#x27;t have to follow a specific order/formula/use a particular kind of \\&quot;pre-wash\\&quot;....though it does give a recommended suggestion on the back with the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Overall, I have sensitive skin, and stronger hair/skin products tend to irritate and negatively affect my skin, though their intent are to help benefit the skin....this does not affect me negatively in ANY way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had with trying to massage it into my scalp is that I have VERY thick hair and have to use a bit more than the average \\&quot;Jane,\\&quot; per se.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Even though - if memory serves correctly - the information says to expect results in about 2-3 weeks....I noticed it even after the FIRST week.....which is only two usages, the maximum amount it recommends the user apply/consume.  *That is another nice thing: it isn&#x27;t something requiring a person to use everyday, AND, like the shampoo, on the \\&quot;off\\&quot; day I don&#x27;t shampoo &amp; condition my hair, I can use what I normally use for conditioner, and I&#x27;ve noticed no \\&quot;canceling effect\\&quot; or any sort of other negative repercussions for doing so. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been swimming a lot recently, in both salt water and treated pool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both elements in combination with the sun&#x27;s UV rays can really dehydrate hair. In addition my hair is already naturally very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really seems to un-do the environmental damage of salt and chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is so dry to begin with, I was pretty impressed by the shiny and manageable results achieved in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;A winner!</li>
    <li> My wife and daughters tried out this nourishing treatment mask from Clear.  It left their hair feeling sleek, and I was able to brush my daughters&#x27; hair without difficulty.  It seems to work pretty well and to do what it claims.  The only possible complaint is the smell, which is strongly reminiscent of tanning butter.  Of course, that may not be a problem for everyone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t afford a spa?  Buy this product!  You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied!  It isn&#x27;t too heavy but knows how to treat your hair and  moisturize it.  The greatest  part is the price isn&#x27;t too high.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair that gets really \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; if I don&#x27;t add some conditioning products to it or flat-iron it each time I wash it. When I use a particularly heavy conditioner regularly, this treatment mask doesn&#x27;t make much difference. However when I use lighter, less \\&quot;deep conditioning\\&quot; conditioners and my hair gets less controllable, using this mask can help. It works about the same as the thick conditioners that come with boxes of hair dye. A good product especially if you bleach your hair (like I use to), and your hair needs as much moisture as possible. So if you&#x27;re looking for a deep conditioner like works like the small tubes included with boxes of hair dye, you&#x27;ll find this is very similar.</li>
    <li> This was a smooth and creamy product, and it did feel great while in my hair, but the scent was a little overwhelming, and I didn&#x27;t notice an appreciable difference in texture after rinsing. I will keep trying it, but maybe only on days I can sit outside while it soaks in!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say about this conditioner. It works and it smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of very fine, medium long, color treated hair. I used it before and after color treatment and it seems to not affect the color AND help to condition my hair. I second the several people who have commented that when put into the hair, it is very thick and needs a lot of &#x27;working&#x27; to get it to go through all of my hair. Once one, the smell was very clean and not too flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed and wasn&#x27;t very happy that my hair still felt tangled and not very moisture rich. But once I brushed it out, it was smooth and silky. I have used it 3 times in 2 weeks and it has certainly helped with the summer humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for everyday use, but to help condition every so often, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product since I have curly and frizzy hair. I&#x27;m always looking for a way to get more nourishment into my hair, especially during the hot summer months, and this was just what I was looking for. Works great, my hair is softer and smoother and it also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Good deep conditioning mask, really smooths your hair out, smells great, locks in moisture without making it too greasy or oily. Detangles and adds shine, easy to style with, recommended.</li>
    <li> I am finding that one of the elements of getting older is having frizzier hair.  I have tried so many products to combat frizz, but few actually help my cause in a good way.  While this one does help combat frizz, it left me with a greasy, slick appearance.  I didn&#x27;t find that it left my hair as soft as I would have expected a nourishing hair treatment to do.  Once the bottle is gone, I doubt I will look to replace it.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week and let it sit for 20-30 minutes on wet hair.  I then shampoo and condition.  I have long, curly hair and it is so smooth after this process.</li>
    <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a semi-arid climate where the humidity is low, and the air can be even more dry during the winter, leaving both my hair and scalp dry.  Although this conditioner treatment is referred to as \\&quot;Ultra Shea\\&quot;, the shea butter smell is faint, and it has a much stronger floral smell to it.  I do not mind the fragrance, even though I would have preferred less fragrance, but the floral odor may be quite strong and overpowering for some people.  But this treatment mask washes out pretty cleanly without leaving your hair smelling too much like flowers.  And by the time that your hair totally dries, the fragrance subsides even more.  The strong floral fragrance goes right through the plastic of the tube and I can even smell the fragrance emanating from the closed-up tube as I initially step into the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment mask comes out of the tube as a partially-separated striped orange/pink and white combination.  The white stripe is the nourishing treatment component and the orange/pink stripe is the \\&quot;concentrated Nutrium 10 technology\\&quot;, which includes vitamins B5/C/E, aloe vera extract, and sunflower, almond, soybean, coconut oils... an interesting blend.  It looks a bit like the stripes that come out of Aquafresh toothpaste, but not as cleanly separated.  Just like the striping in Aquafresh toothpaste, this two-toned blend (what they call a \\&quot;bi-phase formula\\&quot;) is probably just a marketing gimmick, and they probably could have just pre-blended everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment mask is not creamy smooth like some masks, but it is rather thick, so it does not spread out as easily, requiring me to use more product.  Because of this, I can see how this 6-fluid-ounce bottle may not last long if you have lots of long hair.  But at least this product is quite inexpensive.  I do wish that this treatment mask was easier to spread and massage into my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the tube say: \\&quot;Use bi-weekly in place of Clear Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner\\&quot;.  But the word \\&quot;bi-weekly\\&quot; is a classic ambiguity of the English language: all dictionaries define \\&quot;bi-weekly\\&quot; to mean either \\&quot;twice a week\\&quot; or \\&quot;every two weeks\\&quot;, and dictionaries define \\&quot;bi-monthly\\&quot; to also mean either \\&quot;twice a month\\&quot; or \\&quot;every two months\\&quot;.  Hmmm...  While this is not important for a hair product, this ambiguity of the \\&quot;bi-weekly\\&quot; word&#x27;s meaning could be very important if a doctor wrote you a prescription to take a medication on a bi-weekly basis.  When I used this treatment every two weeks, my hair felt soft and silky.  But when I tried using this treatment twice a week, my hair still felt soft, but it also felt too limp and too lax.  So I really think that this \\&quot;bi-weekly\\&quot; treatment should be for every two weeks, and using it twice a week is four times too much./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the tube say: \\&quot;Use bi-weekly in place of Clear Ultra Shea Smooth &amp; Nourish Conditioner\\&quot;.

    <li> I got this from Walmart with Ibotta.  I had tried the Clear sample challenge with their shampoo and conditioner several months ago, and I was happy with the results.  This treatment mask gives the same result, even with other brands of shampoo.  My hair, which is typically dry and dull with lots of fly aways, is always smooth and shiny after I use the treatment mask.  I don&#x27;t feel any need to add styling products to make it look good--I love low-maintenance!</li>
    <li> I grabbed this because I&#x27;m always in search of a decent hair mask, but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product. It smells wonderful and it wasn&#x27;t too drying once I washed it out, but I didn&#x27;t feel any difference in my hair after its use. Compared to my hair&#x27;s wonderful reaction to [[ASIN:B00A0IWSN4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask, 8 Ounce]], this product was sorely lacking. But the ingredients are okay for natural hair, so this may work well for others.</li>
    <li> This was a really good once-a-week treatment for my hair. I recently had gastric bypass and one of the side effects is dry, brittle hair. This product did wonders for my hair. I LOVED it and will be watching for it in my local stores. I have naturally curly hair and this product leaves my hair soft and full of bounce without the frizz. [[ASIN:B00AE0790U Clear Deep Nourishing Treatment Mask, Ultra Shea, 6 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This deep nourishing mask makes even the driest, most over-processed hair manageable again! I use this hair mask once a week and my hair is soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
    <li> Mild scent&lt;br /&gt;thick yet moves well through my thin fine hair&lt;br /&gt;rinses well&lt;br /&gt;leaves hair shiny, smooth and does not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very impressed with Clear products.  This product continues in that same line...&lt;br /&gt;Simple, no heavy scents, inexpensive, and highly effective.</li>
    <li> I used this product three times a week in the place of my regular conditioner for about a month, and it worked ok on my long hair that frizzes and tangles easily. First of all though, this is a thick mask that spreads smoothly through my hair. It has kind of a shea scent that isn&#x27;t really my favorite, but I didn&#x27;t hate it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for conditioning, again, while I didn&#x27;t love the results, I didn&#x27;t hate them either. While still wet, I found that my hair was somewhat difficult to comb out, and when dry, the conditioning looked good enough but it would eventually frizz. After awhile, I started adding a small amount of an additional detangling/defrizz product before blow-drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as far as deep nourishing, I wouldn&#x27;t say I achieved that particular result, but it was a decent enough daily type conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clear line of ethnic products for my daughter&#x27;s hair (she&#x27;s from Taiwan, of mostly aboriginal origin), and I&#x27;m a fan. This product is no exception. For me, though, as a Caucasian woman, it&#x27;s too greasy, but it&#x27;s perfect for her.</li>
    <li> My wife used this for a while and seemed to have at-the-moment quality, but not lasting.  She prefers more serious masking treatments, but this one still worked for short-term relief.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients. EW. Sulfates, chemicals, alcohol; how is that moisturizing? Also, I like how they color-code products for women of color by putting it in tanner bottles. Cool for pharmaceutical racism. All this stuff did was weigh down my hair with grease and stain my shower. No, thank you.</li>
    <li> According to the directions, this mask is to be used biweekly in place of conditioner (they presume you are using conditioner of the same brand).  There isn&#x27;t a lot of guidance about how to use this product such as, for instance, how much to use, so I just used about as much as I would with regular conditioner, which is to say slightly more than a pea-sized drop.  The directions do indicate to massage the product into your scalp and leave in for three minutes, then presumably rinse like regular conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product three times over the course of a month and I have not noticed any significant difference.  There is perhaps slightly less flaking, but still more than I&#x27;d like.  My hair has the same feel and texture as it&#x27;s always had before the use of this product.  There is no noticeable smell to the product, either pleasant or unpleasant.  As far as I can tell, this product is just overhyped conditioner.  I will continue to use this container&#x27;s worth, but I will not be purchasing an additional supply.</li>
    <li> Being a proud latina, my hair is in the middle between wavy and curly, tending to frizzing. This product leaves my hair soft and shiny, and my curls more defined.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, color treated, mid-back length hair and I really like the way my hair is left feeling after using this mask.  It squeezes out of the tube like a thick cream and requires some working through my hands before applying.  Left on for about 3-4 minutes it seems to rinse clean, but my hair is still left soft, untangled and moisturized. It recommends using bi-weekly, but I have found that once a week seems to really give my hair a lift. The price is competitive with similar products and I expect that I will be purchasing this as soon as my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, fine hair that is somewhat longer than shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t tend to have problems combing through my hair after using regular conditioners, so that aspect of this deep treatment mask doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have hair that always feels a bit brittle and doesn&#x27;t look terribly healthy, and my scalp seems dry. Especially in our incredibly dry Colorado summers. This appealed to me on that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  The first time I used it, I squirted a dollop out, massaged it through my hair, tried to guesstimate when it had been three minutes, and I rinsed it out.  My hair already felt better, but I have experienced *that* before with other conditioning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair was dry, it felt, well, *nice* to run my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, it was still manageable.  Washing it again and using regular conditioner left it feeling a bit more normal, but not quite as brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it roughly twice a week for four weeks now, and it is clearly less dry, not at all brittle, and my scalp feels better as well. I&#x27;m probably going to cut it back to using it once a week at this point, just to see what happens, but I am very happy with the results I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: the first time I used it, I was a little concerned. It comes out kind of a pale yellow, with a slightly darker, orange-er stripe on either end.  My initially reaction was that it was rancid or something... like it had been stored in a hot room for too long.  I sniffed it, read the bottle, etc. and determined that is the way it is made.</li>
    <li> This works so well on permed hair. I have to say that my hair feels more mangable and livelier then ever before. It helps also keep my and color fresh and looks like new. Great to use before a blow out as well. Will not leave your hair dr and unmanagable. This will make your hair more mangable and make it look its best. It smells so good as well. Its not chemical smelling like other hair masks I used in the past. The Ultra shea will make it feel so soft as well.</li>
    <li> The Vine program has recently introduced me to the Clear line of hair care products.  This mask like the shampoo and conditioner of the same brand is good product for dealing with frizzy flyaway hair.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly dry scalp at least in the summer so I can&#x27;t really address how this mask works on that particular condition.  I found the smell of the product pleasant and not overwhelming but individual tastes will of course vary.  The product is fairly priced for the results garnered though this is a small container (six ounces).</li>
