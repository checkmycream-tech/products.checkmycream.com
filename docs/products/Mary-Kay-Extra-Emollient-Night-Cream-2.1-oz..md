    <li> This cream has totally turned my skin around. I actually use it on my face before bed. As I have aged, the areas around my nose &amp; mouth started to become dry. Even peel sometimes. I have tried numerous high cost/high end moisturizers... nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick, like petroleum jelly. Pink in color. Pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after cleansing my face, hop into bed &amp; in the AM the product has absorbed into my skin makes it super soft. It had completely corrected my dryness.</li>
    <li> a little thicker than i expected but i am going to keep it. works well</li>

    <li> I have used Mary Kay cosmetics for many years.  I decided to order on line instead of finds a new consultant.&lt;br /&gt;The product is just want I needed and I will continue to use it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good for dry, irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I actually use it on my hands because I have pustular psoriasis.  Without this product, my hands are dry, flaky, and cracked.  No other psoriasis cream works.  Thanks MK!</li>
    <li> Always a great- smelling, deeply moisturizing and healing product. I have used it  for years, and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this product....had to buy one for mom too!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Not only a night time beauty cream, but is makes a great lip balm. Also heals chafing in personal areas.</li>
    <li> I simply love Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cream.  I have used it for years and years.  Lost my Mary Kay distributor and thought to check out Amazon and there it was.  Thanks so much!  I would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Best hand cream EVER.</li>
    <li> I have memories of my mother putting this under her eyes every night before bedtime when I was young, and think about that every time I put this on. My mom is known for her very youthful skin, and she always credits Mary Kay! :)</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful.  My skin dries out very easily in the winter with the heat in my apartment.  This really saved me.  I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Got this is a timely fashion and works great.</li>
    <li> shipped quick. great product</li>
    <li> Emollient Cream is the best stuff.  It really works on those really dry spots.  Leaves skin very soft and definitely not greasy.</li>
    <li> The night cream feels just like vaseline on my skin.  I thought it would be more like the wonderful MK regular moisturizer that I use everyday.  The only use I can find for this night cream is removing my mascara from under my eyes!  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my secret weapon!  I&#x27;ve been using it since 2002 when i found a jar in my grandma&#x27;s dresser.</li>
    <li> My 91 year old aunt has used this for 40 years. She looks about 70.  Good stuff. Delivery was a little slow.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers for hands, feet, lips, in fact any area of the body that needs some refreshing.  I have used it on my face when I run out of my regular moisturizer.  I never travel without the travel size which I use for my lips.  But, the single most important use for me has been the way this product has contributed to my health by moisturizing my calloused feet.  As a child I went barefoot most of the time unless I was attending school or church.  We lived in a country town and I hardly ever wore shoes when I played inside or outside.  As an adult, my feet were very calloused and often, my heels would crack and bleed, especially during the summer when I wore sandals.  This product has been nothing short of miraculous for my feet.  My heels no longer crack and bleed and I always have a large tube right by my bedside to ensure it is handy for application to my feet or lips. When this product is applied to an area of the body, the moisture seems to be retained for several hours which enables the product to work on those dry areas.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream..I have very dry skin and this really helps. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Only cream that works for super dry skin. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Put it on overnight with gloves and your hands are super soft. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has done wonders for my thickening dry skin and roscea</li>
    <li> This I love it it helps with my dry skin so much! I take it everywhere with me</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
