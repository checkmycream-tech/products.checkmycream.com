<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After having a very bad experience with my first gel polish kit, I was skeptical about trying another.  I made sure that I ordered a good UV light recommended on amazon and followed several utube video&#x27;s very carefully as to each step.  When I completed the last step and used a cotton wipe with solution to wipe over the finished product, I was expecting all the polish to just wipe off as it did with my last kit.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It all stayed on and looks even better than the first two times I had a professional gel manicure at the salon.  I have mastered it and it has stayed on for over a week now still looking great.  I love this color Good Gossip.  It is very ritsy and glamorous for date night.  It has the most beautiful shimmer in the sun.  Most of all it is very complimentary and is not too wild for those that like fancy but conservative.  I highly recommend the gel polish system if you follow it carefully.  In about 2-3 manicures, it pays itself off vs. going to the salon.  I recommend for removal, soak in the gelish soak off solution until polish starts to peel.  Assist the polish off with a wood stick and then file whatever is left over.  It didn&#x27;t take long at all and my nails wern&#x27;t ruined.  I even applied another gel manicure right after taking the old one off.  Finally, it&#x27;s worth putting time into doing your nails and having long lasting results.</li>
    <li> Love the glitter!!! I think this is a great shade of true red.  It&#x27;s a little more blue than Red Roses.  I&#x27;m not seeing any orange but can imagine the glitter could reflect that way in a yellow-toned light.</li>
    <li> Yup! Ruby Red Slippers Glitter for your nails!&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It can dress up any casual outfits and it coats very evenly. If you have ever had a hard time getting an even red, this is the color for you! It is self leveling and the depth created with the glitter saves any slightly uneven application.&lt;br /&gt;The LED light curing capability is the icing on the cake!</li>
    <li> I bought this color on accident. . And it is now my most favorite color!  I have to put on about 4 coats to get the look I want.. then cover with a clear gel top coat.. im constantly admiring my hands.. looks gorgeous in the sun light.. I love this color! its a must have for red lovers! The layers of sparkles make it almost holographic.</li>
    <li> It is true, it is VERY sparkly. But not the obnoxious l&#x3D;kinda that is hard to get off. it&#x27;s the perfect amount of subtle yet noticable sparkle that reallly makes your nails looks beautiful! It&#x27;s temping to paint it on think since it&#x27;s a bit sheer, but after two coats it looks well on my nails. Also, I let it cure for 2 minutes since it&#x27;s a darker color instead of only 1 minute. It seems to help make it last long. This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever practiced doing the shellac nails on myself also.</li>
    <li> Awesome color, great coverage with 2 thin coats, pairs well with striping tape etc.  Amount is good enough to play with several times. Love this color!  I always get compliments with this one!</li>
    <li> the color is amazing. but after 4 weeks the actual polish in the bottle dried out &amp; it clumped up. I closed it tightly.&amp; stored it a room temperature. SO I have no idea why this happened. therefore I only got 2 uses out of it. super sucks.!!!</li>
    <li> too much glitter for me, again. It&#x27;s a brighter red so with the glitter it&#x27;s too flashy. If it was darker maybe with the glitter than that would be pretty . I like subtle glitter. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Was new and as expected.</li>
    <li> Just pretty! Looks great on my hands and feet! Very red and sparkly. This color is a must buy! I have been a Gelish fan now for 4 months!</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful and the metallic pieces are very tiny, not gaudy at all, Red is my favorite color,and this is a beautiful red.  Wear. On my toes is almost 2 months without chipping great for the Holiday season.  My seller shipped the next day, and got it in two.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and several other gelish colors. I love them all, but this one is just WOW! Like others have said, this is a dead on ringer for Dorothy&#x27;s ruby red slippers. Very bright and flashy, heavily sparkled, true ruby red.</li>
    <li> 3 coats &#x3D; Perfect glittery Christmas color!! Agree with previous reviews, just like ruby slippers! Very similar to the glitter in high voltage -- just red not pink. Would 100% recommend to others</li>
    <li> My nails look like a Tilt-a-Whirl.  Just a beautiful classic red with a TON of sparkle!  Great coverage with two coats.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the late review...I bought this color last month. I was busy wearing Caution so when I finally decided to wear another color...I love Good Gossip because it reminds me of Wizard of OZ&#x27;s ruby slippers with the blingage. :) I had Bella&#x27;s Vampaire as a base coat and good Gossip as a secondary color...I have to tell you, it&#x27;s so pretty together! :) Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite red gelish colors! It has a deep red tone with glitter already in it. looks great around Christmas and Valentines day. I recommend this color,</li>
    <li> Great color and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love doing my own gel polish at home, saves me tons of money and this is the BEST color!!</li>
    <li> The color is a very vibrant red, however, do not use nail polish remover or alcohol to remove sticky film after curing the polish. For some reason the red would bleed &amp; rub off when using alcohol and/or polish remover to remove sticky film. Otherwise, color is very pretty &amp; true to the photo color shade.</li>
    <li> Color resembles the picture.  Bright red with sparkles. I recommend if you like the louder reds.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite color for the x mas holiday</li>
    <li> People keep commenting on my nails saying it looks very Wizard of Oz! I was pleasantly surprised how gorgeous this color ended up being. I was expecting a deep red but it is very bright candy apple red with red glittery sparkles. I can never wear red polish because it always chips and fades after a few days.     I bought the UV lamp and my own gelish nail polishes and now do my mom&#x27;s and my friends&#x27; nails. Saves tons of money and time!     I&#x27;d probably do 3 layers though...</li>
    <li> One of my favourite colours of all time</li>
    <li> Maybe I should have done my research a little bit better, but this came with no instructions at all. After sitting with my hand under the light for over an hour without it drying, I gave up. I later found out two things, my UV light was not strong enough, and the polish does not completely dry, there is a top tacky layer, that you must take off with alcohol.   So I would buy this product again, but I would do my homework first. It really is a beautiful color!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected! Beautiful coverage and long lasting. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of gelish and agree that most of the color previews are inaccurate.  THIS color is an exception. It is a glitter red, think Dorothy&#x27;s ruby red slippers.  It was perfect for Christmas and lasted for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Just like one of the reviews has said, it looks just like \\&quot;Ruby Slippers.\\&quot;  Very red, very flashy, very bright, and very very sparkly. Cute red sparkles. If you love the slippers from the Wizard of Oz, you will love this color.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
    <li> This polish is very similar to China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Ruby Slippers\\&quot; polish. It has very tiny specks of glitter that evenly distributes on your nail bed. It really makes your nails pop and it&#x27;s the perfect color for the holiday season. I get so many compliments when I wear this polish, people always ask \\&quot;where did you get your nails done?\\&quot; and they are surprised to find out that I bought the polish and UV lamp on amazon and do my Gelish/Shellac manicures myself! I live in California and the average gel manicure is $35.00 not including tip! Great purchase! Will buy more of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one for a lot of color (safe neutral tones are my norm,) but when I saw this color - I knew I had to have it!!! I have gotten multiple, multiple compliments on this and just can&#x27;t say enough about how pretty it is. It&#x27;s not like little chunks of glitter, it&#x27;s a uniform sparkle metallic - exactly like ruby slippers that everyone here describes.   Enjoy your pretty nails and all the compliments you will receive wearing this color. :D</li>
    <li> This color, more than any I have ever worn before, has received numerous positive comments. It is so striking on. Very sexy and impressive! The glitter also makes all the difference in the world. It spreads evenly and reflects lights beautifully. If red is your color, you won&#x27;t be unhappy with this color.</li>
    <li> I have never really had people comment about my nail colors until I used \\&quot;Good Gossip\\&quot;. I have had more people compliment me on how beautiful it is..including men who typically don&#x27;t notice you have polished nails at all.  It looks like Dorothy&#x27;s ruby red slippers on all 10 of your finger tips!</li>
    <li> This is a true red with two coats and has just enough sparkle to stand out. I love it!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product despatched quickly and at a good price.  Only used once and product still intact without any peeling.  Great value for money and will certainly use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color, great polish. fast shipping &amp; a nice price. I used this brand of polish for the first time &amp; now let&#x27;s just say all my gel color will be this brand. It&#x27;s so beautiful all the girls at work wanted their nails done in this color.</li>
    <li> color was great will order again</li>
    <li> My wife was very pleased</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Bright red and sparkly!  You need to use at least 2 maybe 3 coats to get a nice bright color.</li>
    <li> I almost never leave reviews, yet I rely heavily on them.  Based on the glowing reviews and the fact that I love ruby red slippers (the color) I had to buy this gelish.  I put on 4 coats.  One, two and three just didn&#x27;t cut it.  I could have gone for a fifth, but I ran out of time.  My natural nails are long, and when I look at my nails I can see through the top portion, it is a slight pink.  The red is quite translucent, with a lot of red sparkles.  I can see thin spots in the paint, also.  Perhaps that is due to my application, but other colors have blended down well, with no thinning between the glitter.  I might try to layer this with a red and put this on top.  That may get that true ruby red slippers that I am after!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product....beautiful color....Looks like Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers on the Wizard of Oz !!!  Great service.  Came quickly and packed well....Very well pleased.</li>
    <li> love it. lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This polish color is fantastic! It truly looks like Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. (I did use two coats though which seemed to look the best.)</li>
    <li> This shipper is very quick which I very much appreciated the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because I haven&#x27;t got to apply this particular polish yet however I have many Gelish products and they are all fantastic so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome bright red with sparkles.  I&#x27;m loving this new color - great for dress up or for wearing with jeans.  Be prepared for lots of compliments as this color will catch everyones eye!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
    <li> Colour is AWESOME!!! The shine lasts for more than a month, even if I take long to change my polish, the shine lasts and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say  anything about this product because the two dryers I bought to cure it did not work.  I applied very,very thin coat and never dried.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  It&#x27;s gel polish and it works well.</li>
    <li> I have searched for the perfect red since I started using Gelish.  This is true red with lots of sparkle.  It is a deep red with no hint of pink or rose.  Perfect for Valentines Day and Christmas.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  This gel seems to need extra curing time though, which is probably because it&#x27;s a darker color.</li>
    <li> Great rich color, don&#x27;t peel,long lasting.I&#x27;d recommend it if you want have ruby red glittered nails.Dark red in dark and sparkling on the sun.</li>
    <li> This color is really pretty, its got depth to the sparkles in it. Very pretty.Sparkles are not just sitting on top like you see on regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Beautiful deep red with tiny sparkles like ruby slippers. Looks even better with two coats. The picture is true to color.</li>
    <li> best color. truley a great red. and I always get compliments.  Hope to use again this summer and fall all the way thru the holidays</li>
    <li> I have about 10 Gelish colors and this is definitely one of my faves.  It wears beautifully.  The sparkles are subtle.. It doesn&#x27;t look too young or cheap.  Would be a great Christmas color. However I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Cute color and the polish lasts longer than regular polish.</li>
    <li> Left it on for hours and it never dry off. Can&#x27;t believe the price and good reviews. Are those for real?</li>
    <li> I started using gelish because I had thin, brittle nails.  This polish lasts two to three weeks and gives my nails time to grow.  Unlike fake nails this polish does not weaken the nail when it peals off.  I only bought this product because this is a most popular color at the salon I go to and they are always out, so I bring my own.</li>
    <li> Gelish makes great quality gel polishes. Good Gossip is a bit of a brighter red in person, with plenty of sparkle. The formula of Good Gossip beats most Gelish polishes and it was completely opaque in two thin coats. The glitter isn&#x27;t nearly as rough as regular glitter nail polishes so it doesn&#x27;t require any extra top coat to be completely smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I bought this color and I get compliments all the time on it. Its a bright rich red color. perfect for xmas</li>
    <li> Pretty color but does not stay on. Regular nail polish stays on longer.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Been wearing it for three weeks and just got compliments last night like it was new.  This color just sparkles.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of gel polish and this brand appears to be the longest lasting on me. I work in an environment where I have to wash my hands constantly and this polish stays on close to two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet at the salon, but I can&#x27;t wait! I love red nails (which is not typical for me) and this color is why.</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous color, goes on nicely and last for 2 weeks.  Such a great color for Christmas and holiday time.</li>
    <li> Such a gorgeous color. I was amazed by the sparkle in the polish it was a beautiful christmas color. Gelish is such a long lasting brand that it is the only kind I buy. The polish is also very affordable. To get a mini of this bottle at the store it is $14, so the $12 is amazing for a full size bottle. I highly recommend if you are looking for a stand out deep red shimmer</li>
    <li> Bought from Hollywood and I dont know why but it clumped up and thickened. I kept it in the dark out of exposure.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the colour while it lasted</li>
    <li> This color is faboo.  Bright cheerful red with bright red glitter.  Everything you&#x27;d want for a valentine&#x27;s dinner or a holiday soiree!</li>
    <li> I love this polish. I had an OPI color put on at the salon once called ruby slippers and haven&#x27;t been able to find it. This is as close as it gets. I love it on fingers and toes. It is bright and glittery but not overwhelming for a grown up.</li>
    <li> I really like the color and sparkle, just the perfect red, The price was also awesome, way more affordable than what they cost in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Like this brand work great</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful, it looks like a sparkley ruby slipper.  Gorgeous!  After paying $30 a pop to have some one else apply the gel polish too thin and not cure it long enough, I thought I would try it myself.  I have already saved money!</li>
    <li> Gelish is the best Gel Polish on the market!  I have tried others that work nice but are so crazy expensive it is not worth the investment.  Also using the LED light that cures in 30 seconds is a wonderful time saver.  My only complaint would be they need a better color selection.  Gelish has over 75 colors but it seems that 1/2 are neutrals or sheers.  My clients want color!  If you are on the fence about Gelish I say give it a try you will love it.  Also they have the absolute BEST top coat.  It will stay &#x27;wet&#x27; shiny for a full 2 - 3 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry I&#x27;d bought hated it</li>
    <li> This gelish polish color is my favorite. It definitely looks like Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers. It&#x27;s gorgeous and wears nice. Lots of sparkle and shine!!! It&#x27;s a fun color and you need 2 strokes to get the desired effect.</li>
    <li> Polish goes on smoothly and I have worn it for three weeks without signs of wear or chips. The only reason I had to remove it was due to my nail growth.</li>
    <li> the best nail polish hands down, great color!</li>
    <li> The color is just as it looks online.  It is beautiful on and I love it!  The bottle is giant, compared to the mini&#x27;s that are sold locally and cost around the same.</li>
    <li> I used 3 coats and it completely covered my nails in solid red glitter, I&#x27;ve had multiple compliments and questions about the color as well!... If you love sparkly things, this will be your new favorite Gelish color. It reminds me of the ruby slippers in The Wizard of Oz!</li>
    <li> It is a great color. I love it. Looks good on and long lasting. Thank you for the great service.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors! It works all year round! I prefer the Gelish colors with lots of glitter. I think they are easier to apply, easier to cure and they stay in better. I only ever have to put 2 coats of this color on. I have never had issues with it bubbling up. It looks awesome on toes!</li>
    <li> stunner shade! ;D I don&#x27;t like to repeat week after week but it will be hard to part with this shade, I just re-painted in the same color. While I find that gel lasts two weeks pretty well I just change it every week, and gelish is my new favorite brand! I like it even better than Shellac and Opi doesn&#x27;t compare to either brand for effectively drying, shiny finish and staying power.</li>
    <li> Great red sparkle.  Perfect for the Christmas or valentines day holiday. I used it as a top coat over red and also by itself. Looked great both ways.</li>
    <li> All the greatness of a salon manicure at a fraction of the cost! fantastic shimmer color</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and matched description</li>
    <li> I am always drawn to this red at the salon, so I finally got it for myself! It&#x27;s beautiful on its own, but over a coat of black, it&#x27;s stunning! It looks like black cherry! One of my favorites! Perfect for Valentine&#x27;s day!</li>
    <li> Polish was just as expected.  Love the color, wear it frequently.</li>
    <li> This color is fantastic and looks great! I get compliments on this color every time I wear it.  If you are looking for a sparkly red look no farther!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received several bottles of Gelish polish now from this seller.  I have been pleased with all of them.  As for the colors, you do need to do your homework with Gelish and find (google) pictures of people with the color you&#x27;d like on their nails.  That&#x27;s the only way to make a determination of what the color will actually look like.  As for Good Gossip - it&#x27;s awesome.  Think Dorothy&#x27;s Ruby Red Slippers in the Wizard of Oz.  Red color that is saturated with red sparkles. It covered easily in two coats, although I did three just because I was a messy painter that day and left a streak or two.  That was over a week ago and they look great.  The polish is so cute and sparkly that everyone notices that first.  Great for holiday&#x27;s, although I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to paint this color more often as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually wearing this product right now. It&#x27;s exactly how it looks in the picture, but since I like the color a little darker I use about three coats if not two. You just have to make sure to have the proper products for this like the UV lamp, and the gel wipes because gel nail polish doesn&#x27;t dry 100% under a UV lamp. I love the color, and I love the sparkles. I get a lot of complements on it, and I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more gel polish from Gelish.</li>
    <li> Love love love this color! so very shimmery! My husband says he would love to paint a car this color (lol). The red is sort of a pinkish red though not a deep red.</li>
    <li> Just great quality and awesome color !</li>
    <li> This is a great color especially for the holidays. It works really well and i&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments. Looks just like the salon shellac manicures!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite glitter polish. It looks beautiful over a bright pink and really gets a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color! It is so glittery and looks great! Not to mention that Gel Polish is just great all around, so hard to chip, and you can peel it off when you want it gone.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color! If you like sparkly then this is great for you. Definately has a deep pink hue. If you are wanting that bright red color you want to put three coats on, then it is a nice sparkly red. I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish so you want to be cleaning your brush often otherwise it runs onto your skin. No problem if it does - just wipe it off but to avoid it just keep a little on the brush. Love how this stuff just evens out on it&#x27;s own to give you that prefectly smooth look.</li>
    <li> I tried this line at home after paying someone else to do the same and it has already saved me money.  It stays on just as long as if I would have done it at a salon.  I can watch some TV while I&#x27;m curing and finish it up at home in comfort.  This is the best thing out on the market.  It seems like you are spending a lot on the curing lamp and polishes but if you look at it in the long run, you would pay the same or even more after 4 or so salon polish jobs.</li>
    <li> I loved the color and also bought the red that is similar.  Great pink for formal wear because of the glitter.</li>
    <li> the glitter is embedded in the red color - i&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. it&#x27;s awesome and ive gotten many compliments. i love this color!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this color a 4 because I do like the color; however, it really isn&#x27;t exactly the color I was expecting. In the picture, it looks more red than it truly is. It&#x27;s got a more pink/ rose tone than I expected. To me, it looks more like a ruby slipper color, which is what I was going for, but in reality it&#x27;s not a true red. That being said, the glitter is really great looking and plentiful, and by doing 3 coats I got it to be pretty close to what I was going for. If you&#x27;re not set on a truly red, red glitter, and just want a glittery polish that is their standard good quality, then this is a good one to try.</li>
    <li> this was the first color that I tried from Gelish and I love this color.  Its a beautiful red it really is a ruby red that sparkles like a bass boat, so pretty much your nails looks like a ruby red bass boat :)</li>
    <li> I love the color of this red, its great. I love the sparkle the red is like a Christmas red almost. Great for Valentines day too!</li>
    <li> Good Gossip is a great color.  I&#x27;m very picky about the colors because some of them don&#x27;t look the same after they are applied as they do in photos or the color swatches.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! I used this color all of December. Got many compliments.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Picture looks slightly darker than the actual color. Is a pretty bright red with lots of glitter. Very pretty!</li>
    <li> I love the color, but it only stays on for about a weel... could be because of the base and top coat??</li>
    <li> I do my own gel polish at home and mostly use Harmony Gelish products. I love this color for Christmas. It&#x27;s a beautiful red, with just enough glitter to make it sparkly but not overly glittery. I like a dash of sparkle -- but not an overload of bling! The color applies evenly and the glitter/sparkle is evenly distributed. I have used other glitter polishes where the glitter streaked unevenly. It is just exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> This is the first color I tried when I got my first gel manicure.  When I decided to do them myself I knew this was the first color I had to purchase.  It&#x27;s a great, shimmery red that attracts a lot of attention.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite color!!  They&#x27;re glittery ruby red or the color of Dorothy&#x27;s red slippers.  With all the correct steps/ layers, it lasts a really long time.  And if you don&#x27;t leave it on for more than 2 weeks, there&#x27;s no damage or wearing down of the nail (at least for me).</li>
    <li> This was sent by mail. When i went to use it a week later the top of the bottle broke off in my hand ad i was opening it! Will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely gorgeous. It&#x27;s a classy red with glitter but definitely not overwhelming. It can be worn casually, or for work and parties. Reminds me of Dorothy&#x27;s red slippers. My favorite red.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as her bday present. I can&#x27;t really comment beyond that. I&#x27;m sure she likes it as she placed them on her wish list.</li>
    <li> Love the color!! Beautiful deep red with matching sparkle. Looks awesome in the sunlight.</li>
    <li> LOVE ! Perfect for Christmas ! Everyone commented on my gel manicure that I did myself !! Cant wait to use for Valentines Day !</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments on this red.  I wear it every christmas and its perfect!  A deep rich red with lots of shimmer to it.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous red with a sparkle to it. Perfect for a night out on the town. Looks great especially in the winter when my hands are so pale. Have used multiple times without any problems. I would buy this color again!</li>
    <li> I love this colour, but I only got to use it once. I bought it late last year and used it for Christmas with no problems, but when I opened the bottle 3 months later to use it again, the ENTIRE bottle of polish was hardened! I&#x27;m wondering I was indeed sold a genuine bottle of Gelish. (And no, I did not expose the bottle to UV/LED light or sunlight.)</li>
    <li> This is a great red, reminiscent of &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34; but more Candy Apple than that. It&#x27;s got great shimmers in it that really makes it look glossy. It wears well but like any darker color, chips are more obvious. This is my go-to color for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful and really stands out. The actual color matches the picture perfectly. Product was shipped fast and properly protected! Perfect holiday color!</li>
    <li> This is a gel nail polish. Not a regular polish- meaning this does not dry the old fashioned way. You must prep your nails and use a gel primer, a gel base coat (cure), then apply color (cure). I applied two layers. Then top coat (cure). After top coat remove excess nail wash for gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is cure? This is an led or UV light tray to dry your nails. I use the Mally professional gel nail kit. I highly recommend this kit! This polish requires at least 30 sec to cure per layer. I used 60 sec per layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not understand how gel polish works you must educate yourself before you so this on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used properly, this gel polish is amazing. Very high quality. Bright red with sparkles. A true ruby red slippers!</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Great quality!</li>
    <li> &#x27;Good Gossip&#x27; is a great color to wear for the Holidays!  It has so much sparkle and a deep cranberry color.  It is a perfect shade of red and can be worn anytime of the year.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone it is a great color and stays on well.  It is very shiney and I got a lot of compliments when wearing this polish.</li>
    <li> It looks beautiful on, but this is the first Gelish color that dried up in the bottle after about 6 months. I think it is because of the glitter content. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal!  Now that I have this color, I don&#x27;t have to pay $18 per application at my salon.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s an amazing color. Like another reviewer said, it has this wonderful three dimensional glittery, sparkly sheen. And the color is gorgeous and vibrant while still being rather classy. Like many others said, it&#x27;s like the ruby red slippers. Pictures don&#x27;t do it justice. And I would say that it&#x27;s not too flashy. Most people only see the glitter when they look a bit closer.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, perfect for xmas.</li>
    <li> I love this color! A beautiful red with amazing sparkle and shine.  I do my nails with an LED lamp and do them every 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m sitting at nearly 2.5 weeks with this color on my nails and no chips at all, just the regrowth area at the base of the nail, but honestly, I could let it go until this next weekend if I wanted.  I will never go back to regular polish again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color! My absolute fav. Color ever!! It is like looking thru a hot rod car painted candy red...or Dorothy from wizard of Oz, he shoes! It is so beautiful!</li>
    <li> I purchased girlish polish for the first two weeks ago. It&#x27;s awesome the color is vibrant. It last over two weeks and has super shine. Love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> The red is a beautiful shade and the glitter just makes it better. I get compliments on this color every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> love this color! and all colors i have purchased from this particular brand! most definitely will buy again! thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this gel nail polish! It lasts just as long as the shellac. Great color and a good buy!</li>
    <li> Love this gel. Cures hard and shiny. Looks like Dorothy&#x27;s ruby red slippers. Nearly 3d effect. Always get compliments on this one.</li>
    <li> I love this true red color with sparkles. Absolutely perfect for Christmas, Valentines Day and 4th of July.</li>
    <li> Looks like Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers. So pretty</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Exactly matches my favorite non-gel toe nail polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this color hoping the picture was correct.  Not only was the color spot on, it is so much prettier in person!  I use three coats to get that deep red with that beautiful sparkle.  It is the perfect color for the holidays.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> My aunt and I call this....&amp;#34;girl red&amp;#34; - that&#x27;s my G rated name for it. It is such a cool color.</li>
    <li> THE COLOR IS VERY PRETTY &amp; I HAVE USED IT OVER &amp; OVER AGAIN.  iT LOOKS GREAT ON ANY SKIN COLOR &amp; LASTS A LONG TIME!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice red shade, sparkly for Christmas, goes on with good coverage.  Love harmony gelish. I did three thin coats.</li>
    <li> not only was the shipping quick, but also the color it shows is the exact color! This red is SO pretty with the sparkles! It has a very classy look vs childish sparkles! I highly recommend the company and also this color!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! Similar to Ruby Slippers by China Glaze. Good durability too. My new favorite color. :)</li>
    <li> I love the way this polish sparkles. It was a perfect Christmas red. And it will be great for Valentines Day nails too.</li>
    <li> The color is vibrant with sparkles. The gel goes on very smooth does the other colors. The package was small and fit the polish perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT shade of red!  It&#x27;s not obnoxious, nor is it in the burgundy/wine reds.  To me it&#x27;s the perfect shade of red for this look.  It&#x27;s full of glitter that gets great reflection in light, to the point it looks wet.  The glitter that reflects are small and shimmery so they look classy.  I&#x27;m not always a fan of glitters as they tend to make a color look cheap or tacky but this polish has a great sparkle to it. It almost reminds me of an expensive metallic paint on a show car.  It&#x27;s fun but looks professional and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually trying to find a glittery red that some of my friends had gotten at the salon (they never knew the name but it had \\&quot;bigger\\&quot; glitter chunks in it.  I still haven&#x27;t found it).  My friend&#x27;s daughter does nails and she thought this was the color.  It wasn&#x27;t but I still love this one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy more of these...and probably will.  All Tied Up With a Bow has my attention.</li>
    <li> **If you are new to Gelish or gel nails, or need some tips, see this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWRFDI073BON/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3VWRFDI073BON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Good Gossip: wow. Someone else mentioned \\&quot;Ruby Slippers\\&quot; and that&#x27;s pretty accurate! It also reminded me of a candy apple Camaro I once saw at a car show, with a glitter clearcoat. Or (I cringe to say it) a fiberglas speedboat we saw at a fancy boat show once; let&#x27;s face it, this color is HOT. If you want to be noticed, you pick this color! This is \\&quot;Pimp My Nails\\&quot;! I have a ton of Gelish polish and must admit that right now, \\&quot;Good Gossip\\&quot; has to be right up there in my top five favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Gossip is a nice, cool-based red. I have pale skin that tends towards pinkness, and the wrong undertone just looks BAD on me. With this color being so screamingly-obvious in its glittyness, it would be hard to forgive if it were so flashy AND the wrong tone. I think this color would be universally flattering on anyone. It&#x27;s just so deep and vivid! I have worn this to work for over a week now and several people have noticed this color and commented. Not just, \\&quot;Oh that&#x27;s pretty\\&quot;. I have been asked where I had my acrylics done (they are my own nails), what salon did I get this color from, etc.  I think if you worked in a demure professional office setting (or for someplace that has a strict dress code), you *probably* would not consider this an ok color to wear to work. If you work for yourself, who&#x27;s going to care?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a pedicure color, I almost swooned with it&#x27;s perfection. When carefully applied (again it showcases every painting mistake!) this color made my toes look as if I spent a ton of money at a salon! The effect on toes is (of course) different than on your hands. I can see this color looking amazing with black sandals, or just about anything else. It&#x27;s not just a flat red, but so much more. I LOVE IT and this may be my new favorite pedicure color. My feet never see daylight, they are as albino as the rest of me, and for a color to look good and not garish on them is really something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats is enough to give you a solid color, but three coats is where this truly stands out. After trial and error with this color, my advice would be to use your first two coats just laying a good foundation (think thin, of course) and concentrating on the tips/ends, because that&#x27;s where the wear really stands out. And then, use your third color coat, to make it pretty. Use that last color coat to get the edges, the sides, the top, because this color WILL showcase any area you miss, or any crooked strokes. Every missed area just stands out and draws attention. When you have all ten fingers done and hold them out, you&#x27;ll see in a hurry where you messed up! With three coats, the depth of this color is at its optimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION TIP FOR LED LIGHT: I have an 18w LED light, and had to up my time with this color. My first application netted me a few peeling nails, as in: I looked down and they were just gone, popped off like a whole fake nail. But, there was wet residue left behind. It appeared that my usual timing for LED/Gelish wasn&#x27;t enough and I had uncured polish. So my routine with Good Gossip is: 30 seconds base coat, 60 seconds coats 1 and 2, 90 seconds coat 3, and 90 seconds top coat. With that combination I am on day 10 of wear with no problems. It still looks as stunning as it did on the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is a great overcoat color! Try two layers of a black base, and one layer of this on top for a deeper look..

    <li> A deep red with lots of red sparkles. I needed to apply 3 coats to get that deep red color. Otherwise it&#x27;s more of a fuchsia.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and full sized!</li>
    <li> This brand of nail polish is really gorgeous, all my friends complement the color and the quality. Other than that my other shipped almost immediately and arrived really quickly.</li>
    <li> I think this is my new favorite gelish shade. There is so many sparkles and it goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this red- its always a toss up of which color I pick when I do my nails. I always have problems with &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; nail polish lasting for more than a day, but the gel polish really holds up!</li>
    <li> I want all my colors to have this shine and glitter! I love it, perfect for the holidays. Not too deep, not too garish.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. I like this brand, as it wears it does not crack like some others that I have used.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the other comments &amp;#34;ruby slippers&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this color...I wear it all winter long.</li>
    <li> Pretty pretty! Good for everyday. Just enough sparkle to lighten up a burgundy red. Safe for all seasons and everyday wear</li>
    <li> Love this red!! Even though it&#x27;s spring now, I will still wear a striking sparkly ruby red polish! I just love it!! And the name.. &amp;#34;Good Gossip&amp;#34; lol, gotta love that too! - P.S. This was my first attempt at an &#x27;at home&#x27; Gelish application. Wasn&#x27;t hard! Practice makes perfect! ;)</li>
    <li> Fabulous color, great staying power. I&#x27;ve been doing at-home gel manicures for myself for about 3 months now.  This is probably my favorite color over all - like other reviewers, it reminds me of Dorthy&#x27;s Ruby Red Slippers.  PERFECT!  Application is smooth and easy (it&#x27;s got a great brush) and drys well with my LED dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a great, sparkly red.  I bought it after having my nails done in the salon with it, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  It&#x27;s now my fiancee&#x27;s favorite.  Looks great on fingers AND toes!</li>
    <li> Gelish is by far the best brand out there for gel nail polish. I have tried many other brands and I really like how easy Gelish goes on and how nice and shiny it looks. I really like the color Good Gossip. It is great for the holidays. It is a dark reddish color with a slight glitter. It&#x27;s not super glittery, just a subtle glitter and shine.</li>
    <li> Nice red, not too glittery but packs a bang! Wear this one if you want to grab attention. Durable polish just like all the rest of the Gelish polishes</li>
    <li> Beautiful sparkles in the red color!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product, by far my favorite nail polish by Gelish, With only 2 coats I was able to achieve the right color.&lt;br /&gt;totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color.  Love all things Gelish!</li>
    <li> This is a great color if you like deep Reds with a little pizzazz.  This color has depth and shine and glitter.  Definitely a keeper.  I used to get this color all the time when I got my manicures/pedicures.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to figure out the color my nail salon was using.  My nail salon was so secretive about the colors and brands they used - everything had a number assigned to it.  I knew what the bottle looked like, but that was it.  Finally I found it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, especially because I am saving money by doing my own nails at home!</li>
    <li> Nice color. Very vivid.</li>
    <li> Love this color! Its perfect for the holidays. It goes on really nice. I&#x27;ve had issues with other sparkle polishes (non-gelish, shellac, etc) going on uneven or feeling coarse and rough after. That is not the issue with this. It goes on really smooth and even! Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of color and glitter. Looks just like that famous red ... Something about a waitress ... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a full size bottle, not one of those little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I use it with my shany uv light &amp; gelish starter kit, also bought on amazon!</li>
