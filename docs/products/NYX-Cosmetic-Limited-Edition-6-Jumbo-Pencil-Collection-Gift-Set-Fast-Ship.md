      <li>These are kind of a pain to sharpen - make</li>
      <li>All nice and very bold.</li>
      <li>The rest of the colours are great as well, the metallic neutrals are beautiful and the black is very smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>I would love these</li>
      <li>sure you have a large-sized sharpener</li>
      <li>Cannot stress enough how AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>I love every color...</li>
      <li>and I am pleased.</li>
      <li>I love the quality of NYX without the overpriced cost.</li>
      <li>Glides on smoothly, and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>Oh, and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>They love them.</li>
      <li>Love this collection.</li>
      <li>It feels so creamy when applying, and for the price you will not find a better set of make-up.  </li>
      <li>Nyx is amazing and has never disappointed me with any of their products.</li>
      <li>My 11 year old daughter loved it for Halloween!</li>
      <li>I WILL re-order, so long as the price remains this great!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply for eye shadow of even eye liner.</li>
      <li>It applies so easily.</li>
      <li>but they are so creamy that they smear too easily.</li>
      <li>and they are easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I use Milk as a primer for eyeshadow, as a highlighter, and as a light eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Great Christmas present for my niece!  </li>
      <li>Fabulous eye markers.. STAY on color..</li>
      <li>best collection better then buying individualy smooth to put on love the milk color use as a base and great for creases</li>
      <li>I love the pencil eyeshadows, the milk and yogurt colors are great for illuminating, the blue and black are great for smokey eyes.</li>
      <li>Unique item</li>
      <li>color stays true all day...</li>
      <li>you love NYX and are looking for a versatile, quality eyeliner/eyeshadow, you really won&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
      <li>Better price then buying them from your local make up or beauty supply store I love the array of colors.</li>
      <li>A little bit darker when they go on but work beautifully as a foundation for the rest of your eye makeup.</li>
      <li>and she said on the first day 3 different people told her she looked particularly good.</li>
      <li>These shipped pretty fast, love the colors</li>
      <li>Worth the buy.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this is worth the price just to get Milk (the white crayon).  </li>
      <li>The other colors are good, but the Milk color is worth the whole thing!</li>
      <li>LOVE using the white pencil for highlighting brows and to create an eye-opening effect by lining the bottom eyelid (inside the lashes).</li>
      <li>I learned that in order to sharpen these pencils you need to first freeze them for about 15 minutes first and than sharpen.</li>
      <li>Colors are pretty &amp; vibrant though.</li>
      <li>and I will be puchasing a bunch more of those in the near future.</li>
      <li>My favorite by far is the white</li>
      <li>Colors r beautiful.. Cannot go wrong on this product..</li>
      <li>I use the black one more than anything</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant.  </li>
      <li>The colored pencils can be used under eye-shadow as well, or as your main eyelid color.</li>
      <li>Would highly suggest buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>c what other colors they have available..</li>
      <li>But overall, they are creamy and easy to apply and the colors are subtle and blend easily.</li>
      <li>Once I tried this I ended up loving it so much that I now have at least ten or twelve pencils!  </li>
      <li>, I thought that I got ripped off when I got them because they look like complete plastic</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase a few more of these before they run out</li>
      <li>but they are excellent as a base color.</li>
      <li>So far I love them and use them everyday!!!</li>
      <li>- but they are worth the slight</li>
      <li>I have not a single regret.</li>
      <li>I am a little confused as to why the electric blue color is in this neutral colored set, but it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I used the sparkle nude color as a base for my gold eyeshadow and it was absolutely beautiful..</li>

<li> They crease a little, but not to worry.</li>
<li> They do have a little flecks of shimmer in them, which I did not know.</li>
<li> They do have a little shimmer to them but not overpowering.</li>

    <li> Better price then buying them from your local make up or beauty supply store I love the array of colors. Easy to apply for eye shadow of even eye liner.</li>
    <li> I wear the white under all my eye-shadows.  It helps in the application of my eye-shadow and it allows the eye-shadow color to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. The colored pencils can be used under eye-shadow as well, or as your main eyelid color. Beautiful colors! I will buy this product again and recommend it to family/friends (already have!!). LOVE!</li>
    <li> AMAZING color pay off. I have wanted the Milk pencil and when i saw this deal I had to get 6 pencils instead of 1 for 1/2 the price. A great buy. Would highly suggest buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I thought that I got ripped off when I got them because they look like complete plastic and like you can&#x27;t sharpen it. But, after a lot of research I found out you can sharpen them with a jumbo sharpener. Even though they look plastic its just a very thin coating. :)</li>
    <li> These shipped pretty fast, love the colors and they are easy to apply. I do not really use the blue color but if i want a simply look i use the brown and pink colors. I wish NYX included instructions on how to sharpen these pencils.  I learned that in order to sharpen these pencils you need to first freeze them for about 15 minutes first and than sharpen.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use the black one more than anything but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> These are all great! A little bit darker when they go on but work beautifully as a foundation for the rest of your eye makeup. My favorite by far is the white and I will be puchasing a bunch more of those in the near future.</li>
    <li> Bought one for each of my daughters. They love them. I love the quality of NYX without the overpriced cost.</li>
    <li> They last a long time without creasing as an eye shadow. Blend well. They do have a little shimmer to them but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Luv them&lt;br /&gt;There the best I would buy them for eye shadow or eye line I recommend them for every day makeup</li>
    <li> Cannot stress enough how AMAZING!!! These eye pencils are!!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing and I think you should try them out. So far I love them and use them everyday!!! At Ulta this set was about $20.00 and for jumbo eye pencils this is a great deal! These are my first ever eye primers and they work great! They can also be used as an eyeliner and a shadow. I love them all and would recommend these to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Great value. Of course the pencils work great alone and as an eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> like the ease of application and the subtleness of the colors.  Perfect for daytime application</li>
    <li> Oh, and I&#x27;m in love. Why didn&#x27;t I try this sooner??  The pigmentation is wonderful and the colors are gorgeous. I am a little confused as to why the electric blue color is in this neutral colored set, but it&#x27;s gorgeous. I still can&#x27;t get over the incredible color payoff! Nyx is amazing and has never disappointed me with any of their products.</li>
    <li> best collection better then buying individualy smooth to put on love the milk color use as a base and great for creases</li>
    <li> Just got this and I am pleased. Was half afraid that it would arrive with the package damaged. I wish they would introduce sets with other Pencil combinations...</li>
    <li> Great pencils! They do have a little flecks of shimmer in them, which I did not know. But overall, they are creamy and easy to apply and the colors are subtle and blend easily.</li>
    <li> LOVE using the white pencil for highlighting brows and to create an eye-opening effect by lining the bottom eyelid (inside the lashes). The other colors are good, but the Milk color is worth the whole thing!</li>
    <li> Officially In Love with NYX cosmetics! 😍 I use these for eyeliner, shadow &amp; highlighter. Glides on smoothly, and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Love this great color great condition</li>
    <li> This was a good find. The colors are vibrant.  It feels so creamy when applying, and for the price you will not find a better set of make-up.  For the price I paid, it breaks down to less then $3.05 for each pencil!  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smudges &amp; creases. Maybe my skin it too oily. Colors are pretty &amp; vibrant though.</li>
    <li> These pencils do not irritate my eyes at all. I mostly use them as a base and have even used them for Halloween makeup, etc. I love NYX products!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and she says that people immediately noticed the change in her make-up. She&#x27;s been using the Milk shade as a base for her regular eye-shadow and she said on the first day 3 different people told her she looked particularly good. Amazing purchase! :)</li>
    <li> I Love these eye pencils, they really go on smooth with great color! I get a lot of compliments on my eye make up. I would recommend these eye shadow pencils. I&#x27;m purchasing more colors!</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is worth the price just to get Milk (the white crayon).  I use Milk as a primer for eyeshadow, as a highlighter, and as a light eyeliner.  The rest of the colours are great as well, the metallic neutrals are beautiful and the black is very smooth and creamy. These are kind of a pain to sharpen - make sure you have a large-sized sharpener - but they are worth the slight hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love NYX and are looking for a versatile, quality eyeliner/eyeshadow, you really won&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
    <li> I own every shade now! I have not a single regret. Compare to drug store prices on these! You stand to save up to 35%! I WILL re-order, so long as the price remains this great!</li>
    <li> Love this collection. Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> All different colors in this one set. All nice and very bold. Can be used as eyeliner, eye shadow, or even as a base for your other eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> Good eye shadow! Works as eye shadow base too!</li>
    <li> Fabulous eye markers.. STAY on color.. No creasing.. Colors r beautiful.. Cannot go wrong on this product.. Let&#x27;s go c what other colors they have available..</li>
    <li> I like the ease of application.  Colors are as I expected.  Very nice Product</li>
    <li> great colors, glide on easily... color stays true all day...</li>
    <li> Great Christmas present for my niece!  Unique item</li>
    <li> My 11 year old daughter loved it for Halloween!</li>
    <li> I would love these but they are so creamy that they smear too easily.</li>
    <li> I love the pencil eyeshadows, the milk and yogurt colors are great for illuminating, the blue and black are great for smokey eyes. They crease a little, but not to worry.</li>
    <li> This set is amazing I love every color...I used as an eyeshadow base and my colors really popped. I used the sparkle nude color as a base for my gold eyeshadow and it was absolutely beautiful..I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase a few more of these before they run out it is a limited edition</li>
    <li> These are a bit too shimmery for my taste but they are excellent as a base color.</li>
    <li> Once I tried this I ended up loving it so much that I now have at least ten or twelve pencils!  It applies so easily.</li>
