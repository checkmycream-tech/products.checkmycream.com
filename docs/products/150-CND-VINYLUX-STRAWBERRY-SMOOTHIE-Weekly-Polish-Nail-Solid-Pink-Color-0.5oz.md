      <li>Great , very happy !,</li>
      <li>The color is great.</li>
      <li>Great product and merchant</li>
      <li>Great color.</li>
      <li>Stays good on nails</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a good top coat to keep your nails looking good!</li>
      <li>they look better!</li>
      <li>This polish really is the best alternative to a gel manicure.</li>
      <li>I just love this color as it makes my nails look really good.  </li>
      <li>You can go for a very light touch of color with one coat or a really nice opaque with 3 coats.</li>
      <li>Was glad to find my favorite shade.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Used two coats and the top coat.  </li>
      <li>Love this brand - does stay on for over a week.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>You must use it with the Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
      <li>I liked the free shipping and it got to me within a week.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very nice and looks good for a long time.</li>
      <li>I love the color; for me, it&#x27;s the perfect light pink.</li>
      <li>this CND weekly polish is wonderful and so nice to have for someone, like me, who is hard on her nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the UV light formula and this formula.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s kind of like regular polish in that respect), but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of coats to look nice.</li>
      <li>This is nice because it dries pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Love the CND Vinylux polish but strawberry smoothie is a bit too sheer on its own.</li>
      <li>The shade was true to the photo</li>
      <li>No chipping  Lasts a full week</li>
      <li>It was ok, I thought this polish was not shimmery, but turned out to have a really shimmery/ glitter look</li>
      <li>should mention the other color (blue rapture)  was also off from it&#x27;s depicted color (and for the record my monitor is fairly well calibrated I actually have a color calibrator at home because we have a projector and my husband likes perfect color)</li>
      <li>The best polish I have ever had for my weak nails.  </li>
      <li>It gives a nice sheer shimmer.</li>
      <li>Going to try some other colors because the polish lasts better than most I have tried.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something that was very matte, this is not it, but not a bad color</li>
      <li>I have learned many of these polishes by CND do not look the same on the hand.</li>
      <li>Still a pretty color.  </li>
      <li>I gave three stars because the vinylux polish is great and with the top coat will last at least 5 days without a chip and up to 10 if you don&#x27;t work with your hands often.</li>
      <li>and it was fine the next morning until I showered and then the ends chipped.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it dries quite a fast as advertised, but I like the fact that it lasts</li>
      <li>I prefer the UV light formula, but don&#x27;t often have the patience to wait for the multiple curing times.</li>
      <li>Though it is very well packaged when shipped</li>
      <li>Love using this over some of the other opaque colors.</li>
      <li>Super sheer..</li>
      <li>It peels away quickly, even after your nails being prepped properly.</li>
      <li>It is a light pink with some frost look to it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be more of a matte light pink since it says solid pink, it&#x27;s actually a frosty pink that requires 3 coats for full coverage.</li>
      <li>but it is not as far off as this one.  </li>
      <li>It does hold up better than other polishes which chip further down</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much thinner than I expected for a pricey polish.</li>
      <li>As far as lasting a week, I have used another color by CND Vinylux (blue rapture) and I put it on at night</li>

    <li> Lasts a long time - just like a gel manicure.  I don&#x27;t think it dries quite a fast as advertised, but I like the fact that it lasts</li>
    <li> Great color. No chipping  Lasts a full week</li>
    <li> Color: Strawberry Smoothie&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the color - it seemed very bright after 2 coats on my fingers.  It is a light pink with some frost look to it.</li>
    <li> Super sheer.. Still a pretty color.  I don&#x27;t like that these polishes aren&#x27;t in the actual product box. Though it is very well packaged when shipped</li>
    <li> This color is NOTHING like how it appears in the picture here or on CND&#x27;s website.  It SAYS it is opaque and it appears to be a pink color which is not at all see through.  In fact it is a sheer whitish frosty looking color.  In no way opaque.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because I paid $6.95 and it can&#x27;t be returned since it is &amp;#34;flammable.&amp;#34;  As far as lasting a week, I have used another color by CND Vinylux (blue rapture) and I put it on at night and it was fine the next morning until I showered and then the ends chipped.  I did seal the ends (by painting the edge and underside of my nail) with the color.  Used two coats and the top coat.  It does hold up better than other polishes which chip further down (this only chipped off the ends of the nails) but it still did chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention the other color (blue rapture)  was also off from it&#x27;s depicted color (and for the record my monitor is fairly well calibrated I actually have a color calibrator at home because we have a projector and my husband likes perfect color) but it is not as far off as this one.  The color chart is just useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no issue with the seller (SalonSupplyStore) I liked the free shipping and it got to me within a week.</li>
    <li> I just love this color as it makes my nails look really good.  Color is one of my favs and is long-wearing as advertised</li>
    <li> The shade was true to the photo and it lasts just as long as the Vinylux does when applied in the salon. I love it.</li>
    <li> this CND weekly polish is wonderful and so nice to have for someone, like me, who is hard on her nails. the strawberry smoothie is a delicate shade of pink with a hint of sheen. it&#x27;s very nice and looks good for a long time. it is not as it appears in the bottle. I have learned many of these polishes by CND do not look the same on the hand. they look better!</li>
    <li> The best polish I have ever had for my weak nails.  The regular stays one day ., I will buy another color and will recommend to my friends and coworkers .. Great , very happy !,</li>
    <li> This polish really is the best alternative to a gel manicure. My nails were getting so thin and fragile from all the gel manicures that I had to find an alternative. This is it!! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product. You must use it with the Vinylux Top Coat. If you do it lasts 10 days or more.&lt;br /&gt;The color is shimmery not a flat pink.</li>
    <li> It was ok, I thought this polish was not shimmery, but turned out to have a really shimmery/ glitter look</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! It peels away quickly, even after your nails being prepped properly.</li>

Beware that this shade is not a &amp;#34;solid pink color&amp;#34;as stated though, it is frosty, shimmery and sheer.</li>
    <li> Love the CND Vinylux polish but strawberry smoothie is a bit too sheer on its own. Love using this over some of the other opaque colors. It gives a nice sheer shimmer.</li>
    <li> A little too sparkly for my taste.  I was hoping for something that was very matte, this is not it, but not a bad color and it seems to hold well. Going to try some other colors because the polish lasts better than most I have tried.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be an opaque color but it is translucent and shimmery. It does last for 7 days but I just don&#x27;t like the color.</li>
    <li> the color is almost see through, not as in the bottle.  Stays good on nails</li>
    <li> Did not love the color very transparent</li>
    <li> The color is great. The polish doesn&#x27;t last as long as CND advertises (it&#x27;s kind of like regular polish in that respect), but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of coats to look nice.</li>
    <li> I formerly used this color in the Shellac.  Shellac was ruining my nails so I switched to Vinylux.  Was glad to find my favorite shade.</li>
    <li> Love this brand - does stay on for over a week.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much thinner than I expected for a pricey polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the UV light formula and this formula. I prefer the UV light formula, but don&#x27;t often have the patience to wait for the multiple curing times.

    <li> Chipped  in 2 days. Disappointed in magazine reviews</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected having already previously bought this product</li>
    <li> Great product and merchant</li>
