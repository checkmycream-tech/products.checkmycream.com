<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> best smell, soft skin, my boyfriend even comments when I use this lotion that my skin is so soft! I love this and have ordered around 5 bottles by now!</li>
    <li> I am very picky about lotions.I&#x27;ve used a lot, but this Playboy lotion blows the rest away! My skin is so soft and it lasts!Most lotions moisturize a couple hours and wear off, but this stays on all day.The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming,it has a fresh,clean scent. My tan has lasted twice as long since using this.I would definitely recommend this lotion to the pickiest of people!</li>
    <li> I liked it very well, was creamy going on skin and rubbed in really good. The smell was ok,</li>
    <li> It is great, it makes my skin sooo soft and smooth for the whole day! Even if I put it on before going to bed, i&#x27;ll still have it on when I wake up on the next day. The smell it&#x27;s awesome, my husband always says something when I wear it and he is really picky when talking about perfum and stuff. It&#x27;s a little bit pricy, but I consider it worthy it  because those moisturizers that only cost $ 5 a bottle don&#x27;t hydrate you skin at all, so you end up wasting your money over and over again till you find one that is kind of decent.. but now you don&#x27;t have to any more, here is the most perfect moisturizer ever! It is considered a tan extending just because it hydrates your skin so much that it won&#x27;t let your skin peel from sunburn.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin so soft &amp; silky!  It also makes my skin glow and the fragrance is wonderful:)  Smells like delicious honeydew melons! I seriously became addicted to this lotion after the first use! A great buy!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because one of the bottles top somehow opened-- it was a mess !! As far as the lotion that&#x27;s the best lotion I have ever used ! Margaret Maus</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Smells so good and it&#x27;s perfect to&lt;br /&gt;Cover up the post tanning bed smell. Also I put it on before I work out and everyone compliments me on how I smell. Got to love it!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion works ok but I prefer thicker lotions</li>
    <li> I first tried this lotion a few years ago.  I tanned almost every day, and bought a bottle to see if it would prevent peeling. It worked wonders, I didn&#x27;t peel at all, and my skin stayed soft and healthy looking. I&#x27;ve used the same lotion ever since as a daily moisturizer, my logic being that if it worked that well against peeling, it probably would be good against wrinkles, too!  I absolutely love this lotion, and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> love love love this lotion!!! Smells so amazing &amp;&amp;&amp; has extended my tann for sure... the only downside is my pumper was broken ish(lotion doesn&#x27;t move through very well cause of air)...but I was so excited to have it I deal with it!! Great Lotion!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing.  It rubs on smooth and soaks up easily.  It smells wonderful, I was completely shocked.  Great for everyday and even better for after tanning.  When I use it, people constantly tell me I smell good. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> At first I liked this product.  The more I used it the less I liked it. You have to reapply after a couple of hours or your skin feels really dry.  I dont feel it extends my tan at all compared to products I&#x27;ve used before. (Hempz) is far better.    It smells really good but quite a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion smells just like playboy hottie which i love.  this lotion is soo silky and I just love it great! Also I recieved sample packets and playboy tanning stickers which is awesome will def do business again thanks</li>
    <li> I love the creamyness of this lotion, and how it makes my skin feel.  Never dry, not oily, and really great for your skin.  Keeps you looking tan and glowing!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so good and leaves my skin sooo soft. I love it although I wish it had some brozer in it. Great item. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it, I love it, I love it. It leaves your skin so smooth and silky and with a wonderful sexy sent.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion at my local tanning salon as a last resort. I got it home and smoothed it on. I was very pleased with the wonderful scent. And it sticks with you all day. It doesn&#x27;t wear off so you won&#x27;t have to re-apply it. It&#x27;s not like other lotions where the scent stays for about an hour then wears off. It also helps if you have problems with any kind of razor rashes or any irritation from everyday shaving. As long as I use this product everyday I don&#x27;t have that issue. It has lasted me 2 months as well so you get alot for what you pay. I plan on using this product even in the winter when I don&#x27;t tan as much. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It leaves your skin feeling so silky and smooth. It&#x27;s so refreshing. The smell is great, it&#x27;s real subtle and clean smelling. It&#x27;s wonderful after a hot shower or bath.  It&#x27;s awesome at helping your tan last longer then it normally would. I don&#x27;t have to tan as often. It&#x27;s Awwwwsome!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this lotion and decided I had to have it. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive and when it did and I finally got to use it, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. In fact, I ended up giving it to my daughter to see if she like it any better than I did. I also oredered Love My Couture Moisturizer and fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle last me all summer...</li>
    <li> It smells great but not too strong and overwhelming. It leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching a youtube video review. It does smell wonderful, and it feel amazing. BUT it didn&#x27;t last the whole day. I would apply it after my morning shower and by the time I got off work at 5pm, my elbows and knees would be dry again. I switched to JWoww&#x27;s One and Done and it really lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Great smell, superior moisturizing effect. Awesome product. Great Price. It&#x27;s a great bottle of happiness! If your looking for after tan lotion, look no further.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and is easy to apply. I love the bottle and the pump is always nice. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Playboy Bunny</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome &amp; it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it everyday since i got it. It really moisturizes my skin, helps my skin glow and helps keep my tan longer!&lt;br /&gt;I love it !</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, like cucumbers and melon, and it feels really nice too. It&#x27;s kind of thin, but not in a cheap, dollar tree kind of way. It&#x27;s just kind of light and silky. If I get a bit pink at the tanning salon this feels so amazing and soothing on my skin. Very fresh. It&#x27;s a good value too, even though it costs more than the drugstore lotions (which I normally use) it&#x27;s not MUCH more, so it&#x27;s basically just become my daily moisturizer. I saw some complaints about the shipping condition of this item, and mine arrived in great condition. The pump was taped down and no damage occured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to tanning and can&#x27;t give a good review about the tan-extending qualities of this lotion. My skin looks and feels great though!</li>
    <li> I love this product. most lotions leave your skin feeling sticky after applying, but this lotion goes on very thin and soaks right in. its very moisturizing and keeps you moisturized. smells wonderful as well and there is no added bronzers or anything thatll leave you streaky/orange. def recommend as an after tanning moisturizer or just an everyday moisturizer as well! love it!</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these for my wife, and saved tons of money since I started buying it on Amazon instead of the salon.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion for the first time more than a year ago. I generally just buy a different tan lotion every time I need a new one I don&#x27;t stick to any one lotion. Except this one it&#x27;s a must have for me. When I start getting low I buy another bottle. This lotion makes my skin so soft and smooth its unreal. I highly recommend this lotion to anyone. I even use this lotion when I&#x27;m not going to the tanning bed its excellent at keeping skin hydrated. By far the best I have used and does extend the life of your tan as well.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE the smell of this lotion! It also makes my skin soooo incredibly soft. Perserves my tan very well. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! I like that after I put it on I cools my skin down because when I&#x27;m done tanning my skin gets very hot.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so smooth and smells great! I used it all and bought another bottle right away. I have never found a better lotion than this.</li>
    <li> I used this all the time. Great satin feeling with very pleasant smell. Well worth the price. I will never buy from the salons again! Shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion, and it moisturizes all day, not just for a few hours. I can&#x27;t tell how much it helps me keep my tan, but I like it so much that I used it every day and used up the bottle in a little over a month. Definitely made my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> great smell, make my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, The pump quit working quickly though</li>
    <li> This lotion smells like someone&#x27;s perfume. People always ask what perfume do I have on and all I wear is this lotion!</li>
    <li> Awesome fruity smell that lasts long. Leaves your skin silky smooth. Haven&#x27;t used long so not sure how much it extends your tan. Spout on pump was broke so watch out for that!!!</li>
    <li> Not the same. The one I bought before was the real playboy brand lotion. This is some knockoff or something. Does NOT smell the same. Feels similar but not the same. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> i love the smell is great</li>
    <li> These are so much more money in the salons. I love the scent and effect it has on your skin after using the playboy hottie hot bronzers- which is super firming and def eliminates cellulite ! I even use it when I&#x27;m not tanning just to keep the firming. This and the hottie hot go great together.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, it works well and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite moisturizer and it foes wonders on makeing your tan last. Goes on smooth and last all day.</li>
    <li> HUGE bottle! Smells wonderful and really does make your tan last, but be sure to bring it to the salon with you after you get out of the bed, that&#x27;s when it works its magic.</li>
    <li> Playboy Tan Extending Daily Moisturizer is a great value. The 22 ounce bottle will last at least 6 months and it smells nice. I am using it with Playboy Glitz Celebrity Sunless Golden Glow Self Tanning lotion that I also love.</li>
    <li> In hopes of saving a little money, I purchased this lotion instead of FOREVER AFTER ALL DAY MOISTURIZER 22 FL OZ AUSTRALIAN GOLD. Lesson learned. The reviews for the Playboy lotion were pretty good, but after using the product for several weeks now, I&#x27;m just not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize quite like the Australian Gold. I have to reapply regularly, which is  frustrating. Although several people bragged about the smell, I&#x27;m not a big fan. It&#x27;s a little too much for me..too perfumey. In the future, I&#x27;ll just spend the extra money to stick with a product I know I love.</li>
    <li> Smells good, shipped quickly, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin and dries me out.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Works great. Moisturizers and holds your tan. Also smells good. Doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.</li>
    <li> When I received this order the pump to the bottle was broken so it is a little tricky trying to get lotion out without taking the pump out and just pouring the lotion in my hand. Otherwise the lotion smells mostly of honeydew and less of the other scents. It&#x27;s a nice scent but not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I have dry flaky skin, and I started tanning this past month- which dried my skin out more.  I used this after tanning lotion and it has moisturized my skin tremendously!!!  My skin is so soft!!!! My husband complments me on how smooth and nice my skin looks now. LOVE the smell-- its fruity with a hint of vanilla- my husband also likes this smell on me. This lotion Helps extend my tan, I only need to tan twice a week with the help of this tan extending lotion.  It is definately worth every penny.  I will be buying this lotion again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the price was so unbelievable for a huge bottle- 100% happy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The fragrance is mild but very pretty smelling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years and it has never let me down!  You get a nice big healthy 22oz jug (for under $15!) and it lasts me two to three months.  It has a really nice kiwi scent to it, which is beautiful in spring and summer.  Your skin soaks it up nicely, and there is absolutely NO greasy or oily feeling to it.  I put it on when I get out of the shower at night, and again before I leave for work in the morning and my skin love love looooves it!</li>
    <li> I like it well just received it yesterday</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It smells amazing!!! It feels wonderful on my skin and its a huge bottle for a great price! I believe I will be ordering more of this!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion at my local tanning salon for the same price, I love it! It smells great, not like other extenders I have tried, and it really works good.</li>
    <li> Headline says it all.  Works great when used daily after tanning.  Trust me...you&#x27;ll like it.  Five more words required?  Are you kidding me?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing lotion with a very unique smell to it that I instantly fell in love with. This is great for right out of the shower and after you shave your legs. I also tend to use it right before bed. I have insanely sensitive, dry skin. This leaves me feeling soft for hours upon hours.</li>
    <li> Watery watery watery watery watery....It&#x27;s like that cheep lotion you can buy for 2 bucks at Wal-Mart... it smells like a cheep cucumber melon as well...Sorry to be so negative but please dont throw your money away on this.</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it would be the best boy was I wrong. I put it on and 10 min later my legs would be dry like I had put nothing on. You are better off going to Walmart spending $2 on an off brand lotion. And the smell wasn&#x27;t all that great. I used for two weeks and no change in my skin. Buy at your own risk</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go to the tanning bed but I love this as a daily lotion. It is really light. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I tan a lot. This is my second bottle of this moisturizer. It smells really good and never leaves that greasy feeling like some others moisturizers do. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing &amp; skin silky smooth after use</li>
    <li> I have used a LOT of moisturizers, and specifically after-tan lotions. This one rocks my socks.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too thick, so it spreads on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel like you need to use a ton to get covered.&lt;br /&gt; It is also SILKY SMOOTH and does not feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh, and reminds me kind of cucumber and fresh fruit.&lt;br /&gt;It could definitely be used by either men or women, in my opinion. It is not too girly at all, just fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The size is DEFINITELY worth the price! You get a giant dispenser compared to a lot of tan extenders. Also, like I said before, less goes further with this lotion. I was using Body Kisses before this, and liked it a lot, but I think this wins my ultimate vote.</li>
    <li> i gave a three star because i paid for next day delivery and didnt receive it until two days later! they said no one was home when they attempted to deliver but my boyfriend was home the entire time and that same day we was expecting another package..but only one was received and the next day when it finally came! it was poorly packaged and the pump on the bottle was damaged! but other than that i love the lotion ..it smells great and leaves your skin so smooth and its a very big bottle for a great price</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m in love with this lotion. Has a fruity smell which is nice. This has made my skin the softest it has ever been, especially right after showering. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell and makes my skin feel soft but I do not like it nearly as much as the Designer Skin tan extender.  For some reason the other just feels silkier and seem to make my tan more intense.</li>
    <li> Love This Product Great Smell And A Great Price &amp; A Perfect Moisturizer Leaves My Skin Very Soft &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> During the 4 years that I managed a tanning salon, I tried all different types of tanning products. This is the best after tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever come across. It is light enough to use every day and goes on smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy either. I&#x27;m 41 and the 20-something girls don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them my age. They think I&#x27;m in my 30s because I don&#x27;t have leathery dried out skin/ Thank you Playboy for making such a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I really like the weight of this lotion.  It&#x27;s very light, soaks in quickly, and leaves nothing sticky, shiny, or tacky on your skin.  The scent is quite pleasant and not overpowering at all for the few minutes that it lasts.  The pump spout was broken off on my bottle when it arrived, but I just unscrewed one from an old bottle of lotion I had laying around and it works fine.  There is A LOT of product in this bottle and since the coverage is so good it&#x27;s lasting me a long time.</li>
    <li> Came on time and the product is great.  However, when I opened the package, the bottle was open and had leaked all over.  What a waste!</li>
    <li> Is an awesome scent, works well, and has a great amount for the price. Wasn&#x27;t my favorite out of all the tan extenders but surely is one that I&#x27;d recommend to someone who doesn&#x27;t like designer skin or Australian gold tan extenders</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps your skin moisturized. I use it to maintain my tan, but it&#x27;s Great to use as an everyday lotion too.</li>
    <li> This is a great tan extender lotion!  The scent is nice - it does resemble a cucumber melon scent, its a good moisturizer and if I use it after each bath or shower my tan is maintained well!  It not a thick lotion so it doesn&#x27;t take much product for each use.  The pump spout was broken during shipping but was still able to function so no harm done. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> very good moisturizer, and it kept me from peeling from my first time in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. It also has a great smell and is not at all greasy feeling</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!  Smells fresh!!</li>
    <li> Love this as a regular moisterizer</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t think this lotion extends the life of your tan, you&#x27;re missing out!!!  Use this every day and you&#x27;ll be surprised at the color you keep between tans.  I don&#x27;t know how or why, but I know this product does what it claims, whether real sun or \\&quot;fake bake\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not a great moisturizer, but it truly does extend the life of your tan!!!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a great smell, goes on thin but not greasy, soaks in very nicely and does a great job for an all over lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT thick so if you are looking for that, this is not it.  However, this makes for a great lotion to use morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;And the Amazon price is way better than the tanning salons!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion but the top was broken off When received the package. Luckily I have another top to put on it</li>
    <li> I wish I had gotten a trillion bottles of this stuff! It smells amazing, feels amazing after a tan, and makes my skin feel like a babys butt!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this after reading all the things it&#x27;s supposed to do for your skin but the lotion is watery, smell is light but not great, it did not prevent peeling and I have itchy bumps on my skin since I used it.&lt;br /&gt;It does make skin look soft and shiney but that doesn&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;I should have stuck with designer skin products, they&#x27;ve never let me down.</li>
    <li> Product smells nice. Pump was broken when received.</li>
    <li> This review is 1/2 that I will post. This lotion is a 22oz. Filled to the top! Expired dec 2014. But I already knew it would be. The smell is fruity at first but then remonds me of scented baby wipes. I will tey it out after tanning and tell you all how I like it. But so far, I&#x27;m a little disappointed cause It&#x27;s playboy brand. And also the top of the pump was broken off.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says as far as moisturizing, but I do not care for the fragrance.  I have had someone apply the lotion to my back and they even commented on the smell.  It does seem to moisturize and continue to keep my skin smooth, but when I go out I use a regular Bath and Body Works moisturizer due to the fact that I just don&#x27;t like the smell of the Playboy Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to so many tanning creams and moisturizers, but Playboy Tan Extending Daily Moisturizer is wonderful.  I use it all year, even when not tanning.  I have given the 4 oz bottles as gifts.  All my friends want to know where I got it.  It is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the pump was damaged during shipping. It was broken so that part is unusable but the actual lotion is wonderful. Maybe just pack it better or in a box. The bubble envelope was not enough protection for this heavy item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells amazing- bottle is bigger than I expected. It is very light and not overpowering. Also not greasy or too thick. Getting so many compliments on the smell. Can&#x27;t comment on the tan extending side of things as I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet but it&#x27;s a great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion! It had a really soft scent and leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Over priced, product did smell lovely but honestly felt like this product has been watered down, no real thickness to this lotion, did not retain any moisture on my legs, will not purchase again.  Sad too because I really was expecting more from this product. :(</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve used for the past couple of years and always get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> Great smell, really help to maintain her skin soft and tan ( I&#x27;m the applicator). Good amount of product and quality for this price. Very very pleasant smell sweet-citrus. The only down is the packing from the store, came in a plastic back (prime member) and the tip of the pump was broken, shame in Amazon, I should returned but the cream was needed it and the pump was still working but not properly. Amazon pay attention and wrap item according needs.</li>
