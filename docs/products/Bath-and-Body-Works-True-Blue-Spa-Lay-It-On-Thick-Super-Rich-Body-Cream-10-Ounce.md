      <li>It is super moisturizing, and I&#x27;m glad because I don&#x27;t use body cream often,</li>
      <li>so i decided to give it a try they were having a sale buy 2 get 1 free</li>
      <li>worth the price...will purchase more it works wonders on my skin.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff, and the large tube was a bonus!</li>
      <li>Ever since, I have been using this cream, which is rich and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased the large size this time.</li>
      <li>Best yet, now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;of a certain age,&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my hands has largely disappeared with regular use of the product.  </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t have to leave the couch to go find it, which is good because I was supposed to get this before the last one ran out.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, and while some work moderately well, I haven&#x27;t found anything as good as this True Blue Spa cream.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell is it keeps my body soft</li>
      <li>I replaced my baby oil gel for this stuff and it was worth it.</li>
      <li>The sales lady at BBWs immediately applied true Blue Shea butter, and by the time I was back in my car, I experienced relief.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells fantastic, and it makes my usually dry hands super smooth and</li>
      <li>taking hot showers was not helping but</li>
      <li>This really is like a spa!  </li>
      <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
      <li>so when I do I want it to really work.  </li>
      <li>It really worked.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and is very soothing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like smells and there isn&#x27;t much of one with this item.</li>
      <li>no matter how much you try to rub it in.  </li>
      <li>Laugh Out Loud)</li>
      <li>It is so thick and wonderful this one tube will last me near a year.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft and smooth and shiny especially my legs after a shave.</li>
      <li>have a very sensitive nose...</li>
      <li>Simple and very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>have never found another lotion with a similar smell... and that&#x27;s one of the first things I look for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>mentioned, the cream is thick, but extremely good to apply in dry areas.</li>
      <li>I use it when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>As the title suggests, this is THICK, rich body cream!  </li>
      <li>It also really helps with dry, cracked winter cuticles.</li>
      <li>this is the only product that gives the central Oregon high desert dryness a run for its money.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it is a bit greasy for a while until it completely soaks in...</li>
      <li>Everyone has dry skin in New Mexico.  </li>

<li> ....really helps dry skin....</li>
<li> a week the dry patches are gone and the discoloration of my skin on my arms are fading....</li>
<li> I use it on my dry feet.</li>

    <li> Incredibly thick, so you only need a tiny bit.  Somehow it warms my cold hands as I work it in, and the odor is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I even shared with my daughter</li>
    <li> Simply because I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Our other products by them are good, so I&#x27;m guessing if you can handle or enjoy the smell it would be good.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable for dry skin.  Works like a charm.  Can be greasy, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Everyone has dry skin in New Mexico.  This is a fragrant solution to the problem!  It is excellent for the grandbabies after swimming!</li>
    <li> The BOMB body cream!! Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and is very soothing. I put it under my eyes at night as well as my hands.</li>
    <li> Simple and very moisturizing! I love it!</li>

    <li> Best lotion for a pregnant belly!! A friend and I both used this throughout our pregnancies and never got a stretch mark with either pregnancy. Used day and night, kept me moisturized all day long. Well with the price!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself and love it.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that gives the central Oregon high desert dryness a run for its money.</li>
    <li> Always great.  Great price.  Will order again and again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone who loves this cream - same price as B &amp; B W but I didn&#x27;t have to leave the couch to go find it, which is good because I was supposed to get this before the last one ran out. Highly recommend, and with prime it came in less than 72 hours. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping! ! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting the self tanner but this is just the lotion. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> great product received on time</li>
    <li> I bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation to minimize a surgical scar.  It really worked. And the best part is the smell. It smells like the plastic baby dolls I grew up with.</li>
    <li> I received this as a birthday gift, along with the paraffin lotion, and the invigorating body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic, and it makes my usually dry hands super smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have never found another lotion with a similar smell... and that&#x27;s one of the first things I look for.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive nose... so if something doesn&#x27;t smell good, I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this since April, and my hands are no longer dry, cracked, and turning black (no idea why they were doing that...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to ANYONE looking to get rid of their dry hands.</li>
    <li> very nice product; works for hands that have to continually be immersed in water.</li>
    <li> Have used this body cream for years.  It is one of the best moisturizers available.</li>
    <li> I love the smell is it keeps my body soft</li>
    <li> This is a favorite. I don&#x27;t like smells and there isn&#x27;t much of one with this item. Very thick cream. I use it on my dry feet.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lotion I have ever used!</li>
    <li> It is so thick and wonderful this one tube will last me near a year.  It also really helps with dry, cracked winter cuticles.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  Have gone to several stores and they always seem to be out of it. So, I purchased two of these and there were only two left in stock online!  Great moisturizer. Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Best moisturizer ever. I use it on my feet daily. Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cost only 20$ at the store. smh</li>
    <li> As the title suggests, this is THICK, rich body cream!  It is super moisturizing, and I&#x27;m glad because I don&#x27;t use body cream often, so when I do I want it to really work.  It does not have any overpowering scent to compete with any cologne or perfume, either.  The only problem is that it is a bit greasy for a while until it completely soaks in...no matter how much you try to rub it in.  For a wonderfully moisturizing body cream that is almost unscented, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> My Husband was looking all over for this lotion he could not find it. I went to my faithful Amazon site and found the lotion for him. And surprised him with it he was so HAPPY. (PS. I am not allowed to use his lotion. Laugh Out Loud) I did find this product at Bath and Body Works but it cost $20.00 it was less to order it from Amazon and with shipping and handling cost.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 10oz side to keep at home. I purchased a smaller size for my handbag.  Great product. Absorbs well when applied and spells good!!!</li>
    <li> To start with, let me tell you how I got introduced to this awesome product. I was at Bath n Body works, trying one of their body scrubs. The scrub turned out to be harsh on my skin, and thehand area where the scrub was applied turned red. The sales lady at BBWs immediately applied true Blue Shea butter, and by the time I was back in my car, I experienced relief. When I reached home, I still found my hand fully moisturized. Ever since, I have been using this cream, which is rich and lasting.&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, the cream is thick, but extremely good to apply in dry areas. Smell is not too strong . I will keep purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, and while some work moderately well, I haven&#x27;t found anything as good as this True Blue Spa cream.  I tend to have my hands in water a lot, and I&#x27;ve found that a good application that&#x27;s been rubbed in well lasts for many hours, even through food prep, dish washing, cleaning, etc.  Best yet, now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;of a certain age,&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my hands has largely disappeared with regular use of the product.  I think it would even work better if I could train myself to keep gloves on when I&#x27;m washing up.  I&#x27;ve also had excellent results using this on my legs, feet, elbows.  Good product!  I&#x27;m glad I purchased the large size this time.</li>
