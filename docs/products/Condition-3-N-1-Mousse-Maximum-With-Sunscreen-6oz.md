    <li> This was just basic mousse to me - nothing fancy. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very think, very curly hair and this mousse is FANTASTIC!  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I have searched for years for a good product for my curls and this is it.  TRY IT you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I just love this product. My hair used to be frizzy and dull, Dove Damage Therapy - Shine Boost along with this product made my hair so nice, I now love my hair the way it looks. I don&#x27;t know how it will perform to hold a style but my natural waves couldn&#x27;t look better. Don&#x27;t know what I will do if they ever discontinue this product (or the shampoo for that matter). Love it! I don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon though, I get it from our local Walgreens.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one I would buy, it leaves my hair very full and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before--great stuff.  Perfect Mousse for frizzy, dry hair.  Tames it down, but remains easy to manipulate and easy to wash away later. I live in Florida, land of maximum humidity.  The CONDITION 3-IN-ONE mousse laughs in the face of humid weather!  Online vendors have been excellent--no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using 3 in 1 Condition Mousse for years since it was made by Clairol now and I can no longer buy it in So. Cal. for some reason. Thanks for the help</li>
    <li> Still the best ever. Tried all kinds of mouse.now my sis, daughters and even my stylist loves this product…  USED THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 15 YEARS, NOW ALMOST EVERY CONTAINER  (WHERE THE FOAM COMES OUT) IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND BREAKS OFF COMPLETELY. NOW YOU HAVE TO USE TWO HANDS TO MAKE IT SQUIRT OUT. AND THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE CONTAINER IS NEW…..ALSO HAPPENS WITH MY SISTERS AND DAUGHTER TOO. FRUSTRATING...</li>
    <li> Another product hard to find any more in the stores. I typed this in on Amazon and there it was available, for how long I don&#x27;t know. But I was so pleased to be able to purchase it. Many thanks to the seller.</li>
    <li> Having fine, flyaway hair, &amp;#34;Condition&amp;#34; mousse is the best product to use! Add a small amount to dampened hair and smooth it in. Blow dry, or comb into style! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mousse for 20 years! I have was having a hard time finding it! I am so excited I found this product &amp; ordered 10 bottles! I don&#x27;t mind what I had to pay for it ! Nothing compares to this product!</li>
    <li> I already love this mousse. Unfortunately, there are not too many stores that carry it. The ones that do carry the product, charge more than I can buy it in bulk here. It is a bit expensive on this site due to shipping, but still better than the stores. :\</li>
    <li> It holds my soft hair in the tropical Caribbean air. I will buy this product again when I need it.</li>
    <li> This product has been purchased by my wife for some years whenever we were in Florida for holidays.&lt;br /&gt;Now we are not travelling so much she is delighted that she is still able to purchase her much loved product.&lt;br /&gt;Pity it is not available here in the UK!!</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse that works perfectly on my S curl wavy hair. All other mouse&#x27;s either leave flakes or do not have enough hold, leaving my hair looking drab. The negative thing about this whole thing is that I can not find this  mouse in major cities of Virginia. I happen to stumble across this mousse in a Duane Ready pharmacy in NYC... fully stocked there.  Shipping makes this an almost 6 or 7 dollar mousse...which I will gladly pay for to have many \\&quot;good hair\\&quot; days. Yay!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to all women 16 and over.  It is difficult to find in the stores locally and that is a concern of mine.  It is affordable when in the stores.  It does not leave any flake or dry out your scalp.  I love it and have used it for many years.  My daughter got me hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for many years and could not find it in stores.  Then I thought of Amazon.  This is the best Mousse in the market., it is a great boost to my fine hair.</li>
    <li> helps give voume and also moisturizes the hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Too expensive!</li>
    <li> Yup, it&#x27;s good hair mousse !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love this old product.  Glad I can still find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend this product.</li>
