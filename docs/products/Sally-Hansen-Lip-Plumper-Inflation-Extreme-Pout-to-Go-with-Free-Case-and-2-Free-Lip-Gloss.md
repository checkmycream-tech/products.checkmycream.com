<li> u get the clear and a pink and red color gloss</li>
<li> but this one didnt do anything i think its because it has been stored for so long that it has lost its values so it didnt work for me &#x3D;-</li>
<li> I saw absolutely no difference to our lips (daughter, friends...).  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> The gloss is nice...sheer, not too sticky, stays on for a few hours but the plumper....</li>
<li> Moisturizes and a hint of color with the small ones.</li>

    <li> After more research, I understand that none of these &amp;#34;lip inflators&amp;#34; really work, and these are a bit too shiny for my taste.</li>
    <li> I liked the cinnamon smell. However I did not see visbile plumping. The color did not suit me. I threw the color out and used the plumper for lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell!! As far as the plumping ? Not to much of a  differents</li>
    <li> The gloss is nice...sheer, not too sticky, stays on for a few hours but the plumper....i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the shape of my lips but i am still using it for another week or so....maybe by then, my lips will respond to the product....the free case is cute and sassy....would i repurchase this? probably</li>
    <li> Yep! The same great product. The price was more inline, also.</li>
    <li> i had one from the store before they discontinue them and when i applied it it gave me like a tingle sensation but this one didnt do anything i think its because it has been stored for so long that it has lost its values so it didnt work for me &#x3D;-</li>
    <li> Love this stuff , can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore?</li>
    <li> Loved the case. Grand daughter has it as a coin purse now, lol. Moisturizes and a hint of color with the small ones. Doesn&#x27;t cake or flake on lips</li>
    <li> i wasnt wowed by the plumping effect of the plumping extreme gloss.tingles and has a great cinnamon taste  and glossy shine but my lips looked the same!! good deal u get the clear and a pink and red color gloss also!1shine i give it a ten..plumping a 2!</li>
    <li> I think this is a gimmick.  I saw absolutely no difference to our lips (daughter, friends...).  I gave 2 stars because it was shipped quickly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It really did not do anything for my lips it just makes them look shiny and when i first used this product i felt the tingles but now i don&#x27;t. Get it if you want a foul smelling lip gloss. The coloring is the only really nice thing about it. Oh and the smell i can live without!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best lip plumper on the market ! Arrived on time and was the same great product i expected! Its a must have!</li>
    <li> Doesnt do too much to help.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and I was excited to see what I had purchased. It was a great price and the lip plumper delivered as the description read. I loved the cinnamon flavor and scent. My lips stayed moist and healthy looking for hours. Will definitely get this again!</li>
    <li> The best on the market .. at last for me&lt;br /&gt;it really blow up my lips maybe too much .. well working for me&lt;br /&gt;make sure you prepare your lips  by brushing them before with toothbrush</li>
    <li> I have used it and another one she had in a gold case.  It works well.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these sets and they do work as advertised.  I am &amp;#34;very satisfied&amp;#34; with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Nichol Lynn&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money</li>
