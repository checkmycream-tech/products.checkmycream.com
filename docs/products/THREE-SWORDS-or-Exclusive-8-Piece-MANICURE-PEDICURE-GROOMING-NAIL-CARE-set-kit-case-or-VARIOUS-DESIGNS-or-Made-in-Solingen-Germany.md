      <li>Not made in China, which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>, Kit looks nice and very well made..</li>
      <li>Also my favorite finger nail clippers are the Revlon with the (R) on the handle (2 1/4+&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how many different situations a college student will need these tools for, and not just taking care of nails.  </li>
      <li>Really good quality, especially for the price we paid!</li>
      <li>I needed a good set of personal grooming things.  </li>
      <li>Bought this product for my at-work use, trimmers cut great, tweezers are very sharp and accurate.</li>
      <li>Quality Set, I bought for the Husband for christmas, came quickly with prime shipping.</li>
      <li>I used the set already and enjoy the product very much.</li>

      <li>well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Good, sharp tools.</li>
      <li>Would purchase it again, priced right.</li>
      <li>The compact case is a nice size for traveling and it folds very flat.  </li>
      <li>The tools are very firm and great.</li>
      <li>Would have given it 5-stars, except I had to get a replacements for the first set of clippers that didn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
      <li>Great size, solid and last forever.</li>
      <li>Much better than what I expected, what a nice little kit,, I&#x27;m really pleased with the kit I may order some as Xmas gifts.</li>
      <li>First off, I bought this set for my son since he is going away to college.  </li>
      <li>Should last many years.  </li>
      <li>if the most standard tool didn&#x27;t work that says a lot.</li>
      <li>I tried the clippers and they are nice and sharp.  </li>
      <li>The kit comes in a simulated leather zipper case with a nice assortment of clippers and other tools.</li>
      <li>in all, so far I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and can see that these should last me a very long time.</li>
      <li>Very high quality product.</li>
      <li>The nail clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut the whole length...</li>
      <li>This nail set is far better than anything I could find in the local department stores and is reasonably priced by comparison.  </li>
      <li>The finish on the tools is very polished and the items appear well-crafted.  </li>
      <li>I got really tired of the cheap, flimsy nail clippers that my fiance buys and decided to get a set of my own.</li>
      <li>This set of tweezers has a nice angled cut and are sharp along the complete edge.  </li>
      <li>It has the toenail clipper which was not in many of the other kits I considered.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying the larger size - the small one has everything you need and is great for travel.</li>
      <li>I like the set and haven&#x27;t had any problems, but the quality doesn&#x27;t feel like anything special, especially of the fingernail and toenail clipper.</li>
      <li>This is a first time kit for a young man.</li>
      <li>I bought this manicure set as a gift for my granddaughter, who needed an set that held up better than the ones she previously used.</li>
      <li>high quality, all it was promised to be.</li>
      <li>Gave to my husband as a gift and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Tools are well made and I highly recommend this kit.</li>
      <li>Well constructed and high quality feel.</li>
      <li>It was a little bit more than I wanted to pay, but I feel like we definitely got our money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>That being said, if you need a great travelling kit, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one</li>
      <li>The first time I used the clippers they did okay, but since then they are dull and will not cut through your nails completely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The tools are very sharp and make easy work of a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome selection</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t sharp enough and of high enough quality of steel to get a nice &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>the nail file blade is only a little over 2 1/4&amp;#34; long (total length ~3 3/4&amp;#34;) it could have easily been an 1&amp;#34; longer and still fit in the case.  </li>
      <li>They work well but feel a little cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so far both the finger and toe nail clippers and also one of the cuticle tools...</li>
      <li>Small and compact case would make it easy for travel.</li>
      <li>The construction appears solid, the case straps that hold the instruments are tight, and the zipper on the case is strong.</li>
      <li>My main complaint is that the first time I opened the tweezers to use them they were rusted shut, so I&#x27;m totally not going to use them and get Tetanus.</li>
      <li>Very sharp worth minimal effort.</li>

    <li> Tools are ok.They work well but feel a little cheap.</li>
    <li> Nice kit with mostly well made products in decent case that actually does hold everything in place.  Fingernail clippers not as sharp/sturdy as I would like, but do the job.</li>
    <li> Quality Set, I bought for the Husband for christmas, came quickly with prime shipping. Everything as described and everything is sharp and works well.</li>
    <li> Great product. well worth the price. Not junk garbage made in China or Japan.</li>
    <li> Very nice travel kit that has everything you should need.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my at-work use, trimmers cut great, tweezers are very sharp and accurate. My main complaint is that the first time I opened the tweezers to use them they were rusted shut, so I&#x27;m totally not going to use them and get Tetanus. Very disappointed in this aspect but other products seem stellar.</li>
    <li> I got this pack for myself as my wife always seems to find other manicure and pedicure instruments constantly on her person and not where we keep them collectively... Well, no worries! I now have this kit to pack with me or keep practically anywhere I want to keep it. I&#x27;ve used so far both the finger and toe nail clippers and also one of the cuticle tools... The construction appears solid, the case straps that hold the instruments are tight, and the zipper on the case is strong. I&#x27;ll say the only thing I&#x27;m not incredibly fond of is the actually case exterior. It&#x27;s just a personal thing, and in no way impacts the usage(s) of the tools inside. I very well may buy another set or two for gifts to give to friends who have had the same &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had with missing clippers, etc... hehehe&lt;br /&gt;All in all, so far I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase and can see that these should last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for Three Swords customer service.&lt;br /&gt;They are great!!!&lt;br /&gt;The tools are very sharp and make easy work of a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome selection</li>
    <li> This nail set is far better than anything I could find in the local department stores and is reasonably priced by comparison.  The kit comes in a simulated leather zipper case with a nice assortment of clippers and other tools. The compact case is a nice size for traveling and it folds very flat.  It has the toenail clipper which was not in many of the other kits I considered.  The finish on the tools is very polished and the items appear well-crafted.  This is just the gift to motivate the grandson to improve his nail care.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time while he is watching tv.</li>
    <li> the nail clipper just broke! how i can return the item since I purchased in Apil and it is not returnable now?</li>
    <li> I was looking for a set for YEARS~  This set is very good quality so far. The tools are very firm and great. I love this set!!!</li>
    <li> Has everything you need in one kit. Well-made solid steel pieces. Should last many years.  Would purchase it again, priced right.</li>
    <li> Great product. Had everything that I needed. Delivered, faster than I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> Does everything it was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Really nice set I just didn&#x27;t expect for it to be so tiny.</li>
    <li> Gave to my husband as a gift and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Tools are well made and I highly recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> A very nice concise set, perfect for home or travel use. German quality. Very sharp. Cant beat the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> After a complaint about small cutters they sent me high quality, larger cutters.</li>
    <li> Good, sharp tools. Small and compact case would make it easy for travel. Good price, and value!</li>
    <li> Really good quality, especially for the price we paid! This is a first time kit for a young man. When my husband saw it he thought it was nicer than a lot of kits out there in this price range. I agree....</li>
    <li> Pleasantly pleased with the quality of this item.  Bought it for a gift for my mom and I&#x27;m sure that she&#x27;ll love it.  It&#x27;s also small enough to be convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> Great - better than my manicurist uses my cuticles do not bleed cause the scissors are sharp and thin.</li>
    <li> Much better than what I expected, what a nice little kit,, I&#x27;m really pleased with the kit I may order some as Xmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Perfect German manufacture</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Waste your money on these.  The first time I used the clippers they did okay, but since then they are dull and will not cut through your nails completely.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut the whole length...if the most standard tool didn&#x27;t work that says a lot. Returning</li>
    <li> looks great&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping it holds up as well as reviews indicate</li>
    <li> First off, I bought this set for my son since he is going away to college.  There were a few things I was looking for in a set and had trouble finding what I wanted, until I saw this one.  Things I wanted were, finger and toe nail clippers, sharp pointed scissors, and tweezers.  It was almost impossible to find that combination (the tweezers were the piece nobody else had in their sets).  I had actually just ordered a different 5 pc [more expensive] set by someone else, and as soon as I did, this showed up in the &amp;#34;Items other people viewed&amp;#34;.  After reading the reviews, I cancelled the other order and ordered the 3 Swords set.  I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set feels durable and well made.  I tried the clippers and they are nice and sharp.  And the tweezers that came with the set are also sharp.  Not like those tweezers that have child safety tips that are rounded.  You can&#x27;t dig anything out with those.  This set of tweezers has a nice angled cut and are sharp along the complete edge.  My son didn&#x27;t care what set he got but I did.  It&#x27;s amazing how many different situations a college student will need these tools for, and not just taking care of nails.  This set looks like it will stand up well to college life and the case that they came in is top notch.  A nice sturdy zippered case that feels like it can take a good beating.  It was a little bit more than I wanted to pay, but I feel like we definitely got our money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> As described.  Very pleased with item</li>
    <li> I needed a good set of personal grooming things.  I read a few reviews and all pointed to purchasing a set from &amp;#34;3 Swords&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did get these and not some cheap stuff from China.</li>
    <li> Very high quality product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a groomsmen gift. They all loved it. Well constructed and high quality feel. Perfect for travel or at the house.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Very happy with the quality and the feel of the product.</li>
    <li> Very nice case, tools of high quality. only problem, the small nail clippers are very dull, the large ones along with the scissors are very sharp.</li>
    <li> Love the kit. Everything was well made. The case is also beautiful .</li>
    <li> This is a great kit! I got really tired of the cheap, flimsy nail clippers that my fiance buys and decided to get a set of my own. Very happy to report that the quality is fantastic! Also very happy that she doesn&#x27;t complain that I keep breaking her cheap ones with my toe nails...</li>
    <li> Great set and the quality is excellent for the price. Not made in China, which is a huge plus. I used the set already and enjoy the product very much.</li>
    <li> Acceptable quality for the price. Ideal for travelling.</li>
    <li> Good quality and my husband is happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this manicure set as a gift for my granddaughter, who needed an set that held up better than the ones she previously used. This set is very good quality, and had a fine reputation.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you:-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so she would stop using my manicure set and she loves. (And yes she stopped using mine!)</li>
    <li> This is a well made manicure set. I am very pleased with it. Might get another to give as a gift. Shipper was great too!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality, compact kit that is great for travelling. I would have given this 5 stars but the nail file blade is only a little over 2 1/4&amp;#34; long (total length ~3 3/4&amp;#34;) it could have easily been an 1&amp;#34; longer and still fit in the case.  Also my favorite finger nail clippers are the Revlon with the (R) on the handle (2 1/4+&amp;#34;). Great size, solid and last forever. The clippers here are about 2&amp;#34; long and feel a little small in my hands.  That being said, if you need a great travelling kit, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one, Kit looks nice and very well made..</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5-stars, except I had to get a replacements for the first set of clippers that didn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
    <li> Best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used. Very sharp worth minimal effort.</li>
    <li> Recipients of the gifts liked the kits.</li>
    <li> I like the set and haven&#x27;t had any problems, but the quality doesn&#x27;t feel like anything special, especially of the fingernail and toenail clipper. They aren&#x27;t sharp enough and of high enough quality of steel to get a nice &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is a well made manicure set. I am very pleased with it. Might get another to give as a gift. Shipper was great too!</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily. Each piece is well made. Don&#x27;t bother buying the larger size - the small one has everything you need and is great for travel.</li>
    <li> high quality, all it was promised to be.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for a beautiful feel when you&#x27;re giving your nails their much needed bit of love.  As a guitarist and IT engineer, keeping my nails trimmed is a must; this 8-pack is compact enough to stick in a purse, cargo pants, or mens front pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has my two thumbs up.  Being of German origin is a plus too.  ^.^</li>
    <li> Best quality manicure set. Hard to find scissors are included.</li>
