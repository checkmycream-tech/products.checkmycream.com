      <li>I was very impressed with this foundation!</li>

      <li>thank you influenster for the free sample!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with &amp;#34;drugstore brands&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m always spending more at Sephora or MAC.</li>
      <li>I received this product from #voxbox and I am totally in love.  </li>
      <li>I am in love.  </li>
      <li>The color was a great match for me and was easy to apply, and lasted the whole day for me.</li>
      <li>I loved the foundation at first while i was applying it on my face .</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this foundations formula, but the color that I received was too light for my skin tone during the summer.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed this foundations formula, but the color that I received was too light for my skin tone during the summer.</li>
      <li>I was actually able to try this product for free in</li>
      <li>This is truly a great Foundation, lightweight and natural looking.</li>
      <li>although it looks beautiful I won&#x27;t be able to really wear this very often...</li>
      <li>and I got great coverage on the more red areas of my face.  </li>
      <li>CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation was easy and silky to apply</li>
      <li>I applied this with my Beauty Blender and found that it blends easily and adds a lot of coverage.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I was pleased and feel this is a great product especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Because I liked the foundation, I will most likely purchase it in another color that is more appropriate for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>my I Do Vox Box from influenster, but I have used covergirl products before and wasn&#x27;t too happy with the foundation, but this one definitely stepped it up!</li>
      <li>so something light like this will make it a lot easier to wear during the summer.</li>
      <li>My skin feels really smooth and moisturized even after I take it off.  </li>
      <li>It feels light and luxurious...almost like a mousse.  </li>
      <li>I got this product for free in an influenster box</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product for a great summer time glow when going out.</li>
      <li>It was light and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have never had good luck with foundations in general because I feel it gives me a painted face look.  </li>
      <li>It is light but buildable, longlasting, &amp; it does have a nice natural looking glow.</li>
      <li>I generally stick to matte foundations, but this one left my skin with a perfect amount of luminous-ness without appearing greasy</li>
      <li>I generally stick to matte foundations, but this one left my skin with a perfect amount of luminous-ness without appearing greasy.  </li>
      <li>this was good solid product that hid my acne scars and blemishes.</li>
      <li>so I am always hesitant to try a new foundation, but after receiving a free sample of this product for testing from influenster I was pleased to learn that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin AT ALL.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using covergirl foundations for many years, and this particular one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and true to Cover Girl quality, this foundation worked fabulously for me!</li>
      <li>I got this product for free, but I absolutely will buy it again when it runs out!</li>
      <li>Amazing product, I receive a sample of the stay luminous natural glow foundation in shade 860 , and i have to say its very lightweight and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to get such amazing results as I did with this foundation.  </li>
      <li>I received these products complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>It does apply with a soft, hydrating feel but it sets to more of a satin-y matte.</li>
      <li>It applies nicely with a nice, thick texture.</li>
      <li>I applied this foundation as usual, like every other, with a kabuki foundation and it applied beautifully, and gives a nice luminous finish without having glitter, and I really enjoy it in the summer, gives a nice and fresh look, without being very heavy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first time user of any foundation &amp; I really like this one!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a pretty committed user of department store foundation for years.</li>
      <li>The color is true and it looks very natural when applied.</li>
      <li>Love the even coverage it prrovide and long wear effect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think the product is well worth the money if liquid foundation is something you normally use in your beauty line up.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I was actually using the Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous when I received this and loved the coverage but on days when I had dry spots on my skin, I found it could cling to those, even with prior moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly, and I only apply it in the mornings.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>It really makes my face glow</li>
      <li>and  aren&#x27;t always high end that a girl can depend on!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very close to a cream foundation.</li>
      <li>I still felt like I had too much</li>
      <li>/&gt;I’m not really a lover of most foundations as I like for my freckles to show.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very impressed with this foundation! I usually only purchase matte foundations, as I have combination skin that tends to get pretty oily in the t-zone. Luminous or dewy foundations always kind of scared me away because I thought it would make that more pronounced. However, I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster and fell in love! I was actually using the Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous when I received this and loved the coverage but on days when I had dry spots on my skin, I found it could cling to those, even with prior moisturizing. This, however, has good coverage (not as good as Stay Fabulous but still nice!) and gives my skin a healthy, subtle radiance without making it appear shiny and greasy. I like the pump applicator and get best results applying this with a foundation buffer brush or makeup sponge.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation from Influenster for review purposes. This foundation is slightly thick but creamy. A little goes a long way! I applied this with my Beauty Blender and found that it blends easily and adds a lot of coverage. It has lasted throughout the work day and did not leave my face feeling greasy or shiny. The color is true and it looks very natural when applied. I did receive this for free for review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free in an influenster box and I have to say that I had my doubts. I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with &amp;#34;drugstore brands&amp;#34; so I&#x27;m always spending more at Sephora or MAC. But to my surprise this product is amazing! It covers flawlessly and I do indeed have a glow. I love it!</li>
    <li> I too got this in the #idovoxbox and I loved testing it out for free. A little goes a long way and it does last all day. This mom on the go loved not having to touch up her foundation. One less thing to worry about during me busy day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a pretty committed user of department store foundation for years. The COVERGIRL Outlast Foundation is definitely comparable as far as coverage. It does a great job and this color was a good match for me. My only negative is the thickness of the liquid. It takes only a little which is good, but also feels heavier on my skin. Otherwise, I was pleased and feel this is a great product especially for the price. I received the Outlast Foundation for free as part of Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I receive a sample of the stay luminous natural glow foundation in shade 860 , and i have to say its very lightweight and stays on all day. Love the even coverage it prrovide and long wear effect. It keeps you face glowing all day. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own. I enjoyed this foundations formula, but the color that I received was too light for my skin tone during the summer. I generally stick to matte foundations, but this one left my skin with a perfect amount of luminous-ness without appearing greasy</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The color is the same as what you might be used to from other Cover Girl foundation products, but the consistency is not as heavy.  It feels light and luxurious...almost like a mousse.  The color went on smoothe and I got great coverage on the more red areas of my face.  I have very sensitive skin and true to Cover Girl quality, this foundation worked fabulously for me! I got this product for free, but I absolutely will buy it again when it runs out!</li>
    <li> I applied this foundation as usual, like every other, with a kabuki foundation and it applied beautifully, and gives a nice luminous finish without having glitter, and I really enjoy it in the summer, gives a nice and fresh look, without being very heavy, the thing with this foundation its that for a while it gives a somewhat tacky feeling in the skin, like it never really sets, but when you check it with tapping a paper against the skin, it does not transfer, so I guess is just the overall feeling of the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this foundation if your skin is dry, because on very oily skin, it can give not a pretty look&lt;br /&gt;I received this foundation for free, to test it so this is my honest opinion about it</li>
    <li> this was good solid product that hid my acne scars and blemishes. always loved covergirl products. good, inexpensive product. thank you influenster for the free sample!</li>
    <li> I am used to using high end make up.  I didn&#x27;t expect to get such amazing results as I did with this foundation.  I am in love.  To think it costs a fraction of the price of what I am used to.  I received this product from #voxbox and I am totally in love.  I definitely plan on purchasing it as soon as I run out. I waited two weeks to do my review just to see if my opinion would change, but it didn&#x27;t.  It really makes my face glow and I love it!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin so I am always hesitant to try a new foundation, but after receiving a free sample of this product for testing from influenster I was pleased to learn that it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin AT ALL.  This is a super long wear foundation and won&#x27;t even come off in the heat or the pool.  My skin feels really smooth and moisturized even after I take it off.  Overall, I&#x27;d say this makeup has improved the overall condition of my skin, and its extreme pigmentation does wonders for covering up my existing blemishes.  I would definitely buy this product, and I&#x27;ve told all of my friends about it too.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and this did leave my skin itchy and although it looks beautiful I won&#x27;t be able to really wear this very often... if you have non-sensitive skin this is a great choice because it does leave a beautiful glow to the skin. Although I received this product for free, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of any foundation &amp; I really like this one! It is light but buildable, longlasting, &amp; it does have a nice natural looking glow. I applied it with my fingers and a sponge. I did set it with a Cover Girl powder to prolong it&#x27;s wear as well as used a setting spray when I was all done with my makeup. It lasted all day in the sun playing with my toddler and doing chores. I look forward to family pictures now :) I did test this product for free and these are my own honest opinions.</li>
    <li> I received Covergirl outlast Luminous Foundation about a mouth ago through my Influenster I do Vox box.  I have never had good luck with foundations in general because I feel it gives me a painted face look.  I think Outlast formula was lighter and easier to blend in for a lighter look than some other products I have tried.  I still felt like I had too much make up on but I did get complements that day on my makeup.  I think this product is excellent for people that use foundation daily.  I prefer a lighter natural look where my freckles show through.  I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Natural Glow Foundation comes in a 1 oz glass pump bottle. It is a new foundation that launched with the Covergirl Summer 2015 Collection which boasts all day wear with a radiant and luminous finish. There are quite a number of different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product in my IDoVoxBox from Influenster to try and review. It applies nicely with a nice, thick texture. It&#x27;s very close to a cream foundation. It has a very nice matte finish after application and leaves skin feeling hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you wear foundation regularly you will not be disappointed with this brand new full coverage product from Covergirl.</li>
    <li> This foundation felt very lightweight when applied, however, depending on the type of applicator used it gave different looks.  When I used a foundation brush (Urban Decay) it seemed to go on with a bit of a caked on look.  When I used a sponge it seemed to go on a bit smoother.  This is a great foundation for the summer time as it does leave a nice glow with the shimmer ingredient within the formula.  However, this is not a foundation that I would wear on a normal basis for work.  As this was sent to me for trial purposed through Influenster&#x27;s I Do VoxBox, I wanted to share my opinions of this product.  As having to choose a shade via the computer, I do have to say that the color I chose was almost a perfect match when I received it first hand.  I would definitely recommend this product for a great summer time glow when going out.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great Foundation, lightweight and natural looking. Good product I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It was light and smooth. I am not a huge make up fan so something light like this will make it a lot easier to wear during the summer. The color matched my skin perfectly. I received this free from influenster and all my opinions are of my own.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation for free, but all opinions are my own. I&#x27;ve been using covergirl foundations for many years, and this particular one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It applies smoothly, and I only apply it in the mornings. I have dry skin, but this does not disappoint in the moisturizing department! I will continue to use Covergirl!</li>
    <li> I really liked this foundation it was a perfect match and looked really good against my skin and was very smooth I wish it was a matte foundation but I fixed the buy using a matte primer</li>
    <li> I loved the foundation at first while i was applying it on my face . I felt it very light on my skin.  But I was not satisfied completely with the product.  It felt sticky after few hours of wearing it. But it really lasted for a very long time. I din&#x27;t feel it caky on my skin. I received it free in return for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I was actually able to try this product for free in my I Do Vox Box from influenster, but I have used covergirl products before and wasn&#x27;t too happy with the foundation, but this one definitely stepped it up! The color was a great match for me and was easy to apply, and lasted the whole day for me. I love how it covered some blemishes for me and worked well to give me even skin tone throughout my face. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who may be on a budget, but still wants high quality makeup!</li>
    <li> As all CoverGirl products this one you can depend on as well effective. CoverGirl Outlast Stay Luminous foundation was easy and silky to apply I found that the coverage was sufficient and long lasting. I was delighted to find it  in my Voxbox and have since then purchased another to have on hand. The color blended well with my skin tone and did affect the bronzer I used on top. It&#x27;s great to find beauty products that work well and  aren&#x27;t always high end that a girl can depend on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many liquid foundations but this one one of my favorites. It applied very smooth and even, and blended well with my skin. I loved how light it felt, too! It really did keep my face looking polished and fresh throughout the entire day. I also liked the pump top as it made it easier to use a desired amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> I received this foundation for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.  I enjoyed this foundations formula, but the color that I received was too light for my skin tone during the summer.  I generally stick to matte foundations, but this one left my skin with a perfect amount of luminous-ness without appearing greasy.  Covergirl foundations are something that I use frequently, but this one would not have been one I would have usually picked up, so I am glad that I was given a sample to test.  Because I liked the foundation, I will most likely purchase it in another color that is more appropriate for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own. This foundation is a bit thick. It doesn&#x27;t feel thick on the face though and does have a paint smell to it.  My skin does look great after I apply it; its not too matte and not too dewy. Even on my oily skin it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Natural Glow Foundation is a new foundation that launched with the Covergirl Summer 2015 Collection which promises all day wear &amp; with a radiant, luminous finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not really a lover of most foundations as I like for my freckles to show. However, after trying this foundation I am SOLD!!!&lt;br /&gt;Covergirl Outlast Stay Luminous Natural Glow Foundation comes in a 1 oz glass pump bottle that runs around $9.99 at drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not really a liquid foundation lover as I prefer a loose powder myself so I wasn’t too keen on seeing a liquid foundation in my IDoVoxBox from Influenster but the texture surprised me and it is thicker and creamier than I thought it would be. It does apply with a soft, hydrating feel but it sets to more of a satin-y matte. In all honestly it didn&#x27;t even feel like I was wearing a creamy foundation on my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the product is well worth the money if liquid foundation is something you normally use in your beauty line up.</li>
