    <li> I bought a lot of replacement heads so I don&#x27;t have to think about it for a while. Love the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love the handle for this toothbrush, and have changed the heads a number of times.  The handle is rounded and has some heft to it, and the head can be inserted for lefties or righties.  It is a very soft bristle, with a nice, oval shape.  This last purchase was the best price yet.</li>

    <li> Awesome toothbrush. It massages your gums while you brush. I have been cavity free for 10 years now using the Radius toothbrush. My dentist says to just keep doing what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
