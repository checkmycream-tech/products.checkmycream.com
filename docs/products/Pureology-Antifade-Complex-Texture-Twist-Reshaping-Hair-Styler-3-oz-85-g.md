      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that compares to it.</li>
      <li>I love this product but can&#x27;t spring for $151.  </li>
      <li>and I love how easy it is to use.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Texture Twist for several years now, and have found it to be very good.  </li>
      <li>This product lifts my hair and it appears very full.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not stiff or sticky but does a great job of controlling fly-aways and chunking-out the hair, as i say.  </li>
      <li>I have used Pureology texture twist for a couple years now and think it&#x27;s the best out there as far as holding down fly aways without a greasy or crusty look.</li>
      <li>You just can&#x27;t easily find it anymore.</li>
      <li>The product came very quickly as well.</li>
      <li>The original formula of this product was great - gave my hair texture and lift like no other!</li>
      <li>So fine that I require a spritz of hairspray before using my curing iron or my hair falls out of the iron.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that needs some product to do anything.  </li>
      <li>This product work great especially for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great product that lasts.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>I purchased because it had been discontinued and wasn&#x27;t available anywhere else.</li>
      <li>When I found this I was excited.  </li>
      <li>It keeps body in my very fine straight hair...    </li>
      <li>I bought several bottles of it to get me thru while I search to find a good replacement.</li>
      <li>Other products while they might work great, smell like stuff your grandfather used to use.</li>
      <li>and so I switched and seriously, this is the best texture product I have ever used in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipment and</li>
      <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because this product has gone up in price tremendously</li>
      <li>You quickly run through your hair and style it as you apply.  </li>
      <li>I love, love it and wish they&#x27;d bring it back.</li>
      <li>For a fresh up, just dampen your hair with spray or water from your tap, work through your hair and style away.  </li>
      <li>Nice lasting moveable hold.</li>
      <li>Pureology - they obviously don&#x27;t need the business when they discontinue a popular item.</li>
      <li>when you find the right amount needed for your hair, I think you will like it too.</li>
      <li>Hi, for those of you looking for a replacement for texture twist, my stylist just informed me that the original creator of pureology line has a new line called ColorProof.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, I should have bought a couple to last because its a discontinued product.</li>
      <li>exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the product for many years and love it, and usually costs about $20+.  </li>
      <li>I have natural (not thick) curls and tried many products ...</li>
      <li>I have used it for at least two years and it is a really great product.</li>
      <li>It did work better when I had my hair really short, but since my hair has grown out a bit, it doesn&#x27;t provide any hold to my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Quick shipment and exactly what I ordered.  I had not been able to find Texture Twist in salons and Amazon came to my rescue!!!  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the smell of this -- but, unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t provide lasting hold for my thick hair.  I&#x27;ve had it for about two years, and, during that time, have had my hair in everything from a longish pixie cut to a bob that&#x27;s about two inches below my ears.  It did work better when I had my hair really short, but since my hair has grown out a bit, it doesn&#x27;t provide any hold to my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you have thinner hair, but if you have thicker hair, it may not give you the hold or style you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I love the smell and I love how easy it is to use.  One small squirt and rub my palms together then scrunch my hair.  You should know that if you&#x27;re going to use it in the car (you know, like after you take out your velcro rollers when you&#x27;re on the go) you need to have some moist wipes available to wash off the excess product from your hands (or just use some water from your water bottle and dry your hands with a napkin or paper towel).  It works really well and holds the wave or curl just right.  It also gives body.  My hair loves it.  Oh, and did I say it lasts a long time - - it lasts a long time!  Both the product and the hold it gives.</li>
    <li> Product container has \\&quot;false bottom\\&quot;, a space of almost 1.5 inchs! It seems like you are getting about twice the product, but you aren&#x27;t. Beware.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use to enhance your haircut.  it makes all of the layers of your hair be shown.  Great Control.</li>
    <li> After my hair stylist used this product for several visits, I purchased it to use at home everyday and just love it.  It keeps body in my very fine straight hair...    Ray in Florida</li>
    <li> I have used this Pureology Anti-Fade Complex Texture Twist for several years now. I have a shorter hair style, and it works for me well. It add&#x27;s enough body to manipulate the hair, without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last 5 years. I have fine hair that needs some product to do anything.  I apply while my hair is wet and then blow dry.  It adds volume and body with out all the \\&quot;gook\\&quot;  I sometime use it with dry hair.  It adds the body with the tiny little \\&quot;fibers\\&quot;.  At the salon I was paying $25-$30 a bottle!</li>
    <li> I have flat hair and I put this on dry and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I can&#x27;t even tell anything is in my hair. It&#x27;s still limp. I put a quarter size dollop so I know it&#x27;s not me. I guess this just isn&#x27;t for my hair. I use other products that give me way more volumne then this. Not worth the $20</li>
    <li> I have natural (not thick) curls and tried many products ... most of them dry my hair out or make it look fuzzy. Texture Twist is the best for my short hair cut. But don&#x27;t use too much or it looks \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and your hair dries out fast.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price</li>
    <li> So, so sorry they stopped making this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I love this styling product.  I&#x27;ve tried many products on my fine hair and this works the best by far.  Just a very small amount gives my hair loads of body without weighing it down!  I also recommend the Pureology firm hold hair spray - these two products work great together.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Pureology Antifade Complex Texture Twist AND low and behold they discontinued the product! Bummer. I&#x27;ve discontinued my purchases of anything Pureology - they obviously don&#x27;t need the business when they discontinue a popular item. Grumpy in Oregon!</li>
    <li> It is great stuff.  Too bad Pureology shot themselves in the foot by discontinuing this product.</li>
    <li> I was told it could not be found anywhere!  Amazon always comes through when I am looking for something no one else has.  Love the product.  I will keep buying it from Amazon along with lots of other things.  You&#x27;re the best, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> When you put it into hands, it seems to be like glue then you work it through your hair, it will stle a bit and then half an hour later, the flops down, no style, does not hold at all!</li>
    <li> I love this product but can&#x27;t spring for $151.  Are they crazy? I tried the alternate ColorProof product - but they were right - it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all for thick hair. Even my hairdresser asked me what was wrong with my hair when I used it. BRING BACK THIS PRODUCT. I thought I read where the manufacturer said they weren&#x27;t discontinuing it due to high demand.</li>
    <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t buy this locally anymore so she was delighted that I found it online.  She loves the product.  I didn&#x27;t love the price so much, but she was very happy to get it and it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Pureology is expensive at my hairstylist shop so was so happy to find it here.  I love this stuff and I understand they won&#x27;t be making it anymore that makes me very sad!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while.  This product work great especially for fine hair.  I reallyrecommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this Pureology product and they discontinued it!! It&#x27;s one of the best products and they got rid of it:(</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and love it.  The perfect amount of hold without being too thick or messy.  The product came very quickly as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now.  It allows me to give life to my thin straight hair and have an attractive hairstyle.  I received positive compliments about my hair on a regular basis.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So sad they discontinued this product. I love, love it and wish they&#x27;d bring it back.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have been using other products of this brand and like all of them I have tried.</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t look like a movie star!  I feel more like a porn star with a bad case of gas and bloating.</li>
    <li> Hi, for those of you looking for a replacement for texture twist, my stylist just informed me that the original creator of pureology line has a new line called ColorProof.  Their FiberBlast texture cream is a great alternative to texture twist.</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology texture twist for a couple years now and think it&#x27;s the best out there as far as holding down fly aways without a greasy or crusty look. It makes my hair so nice and smooth and I just ran out of it. I was planning on purchasing more online however after seeing the price jumped up $50 or more on any website I&#x27;ve looked at from Amazon, I am no longer going to consider buying this product online. This is the only reason for four stars. I can get this for $23 at Walgreens. If the price jumps any higher than $23, I can live without this product! :/</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and find it to be the very BEST EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have now is that it has been discontinued and I cannot find&lt;br /&gt;ANY product even close to it.  I&#x27;m also disappointed that the price has skyrocketed&lt;br /&gt;since it&#x27;s discontinuation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sad indeed that Pureology can&#x27;t continue to produce this fabulous product!! :(</li>
    <li> Excellent produce for curly hair !</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product, but it&#x27;s hard to find. Thankfully we can get it through Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  My hairdresser introduced me to this and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this product as many others did. Don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s off the market.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it worked the best on my hair.  Pureology no longer sells this product in beauty supply stores or in salons.  It is only sold on line.  I would never pay over $25.00 for one bottle.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair lift and texture.  My hairdresser suggested I use it because I have hair with no body.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I should have bought a couple to last because its a discontinued product.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff!  after trying tons of different texturizers i got this one from my hairdresser.  i have very thick long hair with just enough wave that if i let it air dry it looks crappy - somewhere in between straight and textured.  i put this in my hair while towel dried and scrunch it up.  it&#x27;s not stiff or sticky but does a great job of controlling fly-aways and chunking-out the hair, as i say.  easy and looks great :)</li>
    <li> I use this product daily! Love everything about it! It is more expensive to buy in a salon.  Amazon has been the cheapest place to buy it through.</li>
    <li> Too expensive.  I purchased because it had been discontinued and wasn&#x27;t available anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and I love it.  I&#x27;m sorry that it was discontinued too, but I was always lucky enough to find it on Amazon.  Now, the price of it has gone through the roof!  It used to be just $20-22 a bottle.  Now, in just a few months, it&#x27;s over $50 a bottle!  I can&#x27;t believe it -- price gauging on hair product!  Shame on you!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Pureology quit making this stuff.  I love it.  Maybe they will come to their senses and make it again.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a product like it on the market that I have found to date.  It is light, holds hair in place without being heavy and pasty as other products.  It is a shame that it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have short, fine hair and it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that keeps my hair where I want it. i like a slightly tossed look on top, that stays where I tossed it and doesn&#x27;t look or feel stiff. Be careful to use sparingly and add a bit as needed. If you overdue it, it will look and feel a bit greasy and weight your hair down. Experiment and when you find the right amount needed for your hair, I think you will like it too. Pricey though, so I rated as only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Too bad it got so expensive. Out of the reach of many who bought it before.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the allotted time period and just recently used it.  I really think it does the job.  A little goes a long way, as in most Pureology products,so less is more.  It makes my hair \\&quot;piecy\\&quot; looking and just the way I wanted.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product! The hair looks and feel soft.  It is not greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  I cannot find it in Puerto Rico anymore, but I always find it at Amazaon.</li>
    <li> Makes your face greasy</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t easily find it anymore. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well and smells as pleasant. Other products while they might work great, smell like stuff your grandfather used to use.</li>
    <li> Holds well - helps keep style in summer heat. Hard to find locally.  Glad to be able to order it here.</li>
    <li> I love this product for fly aways &amp; control...only takes a tiny smidgen to do the trick! I hope I am able to continue buying it off Amazon since they seem to have discontinued making this!</li>
    <li> This is great.  With my short hair, you only apply a dab to your fingertips, rub to spread on the tips of the fingers and work through your dry or damp hair and style the hair to suit your look.  A little hair spray and the style stays all day.  For a fresh up, just dampen your hair with spray or water from your tap, work through your hair and style away.  Great for the pool days as well.  Lasts for a long time.  Need to stock up with the coming summer and travel season.</li>
    <li> Not much in the way of hold.... it doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff, which is good but it doesn&#x27;t begin to hold the hair in place.... very expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it advertised... I have grey/white hair and it is good that is doesn&#x27;t strip the color.. so there is that!&lt;br /&gt;would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this purelogic product. It is great for my hair and helps control it. I have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser always uses great products on my hair.  A new neighbor moved in and her hair was incredible.  She insisted it was \\&quot;all product.\\&quot;  This is what she used in her hair and so I switched and seriously, this is the best texture product I have ever used in my hair.  I have fine hair and this isn&#x27;t too heavy, greasy, or waxy.  Separates and holds style better than the other expensive products I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I always use this product. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because this product has gone up in price tremendously but you only need to use a little bit so it should last me all year.</li>
    <li> I love Pureology Texture Twist. I&#x27;m sorry that the product has been discontinued, but was glad to see that it was still available through Amazon. I bought several bottles of it to get me thru while I search to find a good replacement.</li>
    <li> The original formula of this product was great - gave my hair texture and lift like no other! Then, they changed something in the ingredients and now it&#x27;s worthless. Not as sticky and has no hold like before. My hairdresser refuses to buy this &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; version of texture twist and has many disappointed customers because of it! Will not buy this again unless they go back to the original formula.</li>
    <li> I have been using Texture Twist for several years now, and have found it to be very good.  The products performs well, and smells nice.  Sadly, I have heard it is being discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product works to reign in your curls and allows you to shape them to your liking.  I would recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for many years and love it, and usually costs about $20+.  Since Pureology has dis-continued this kind...I searched to find something comparable...not the product they say is comparable.  When I found this I was excited.  Shame on me for not reading the details closer.  I thought I was getting 3 bottles...not one 3 ounce bottle. I paid $70+ and then shipping.  Not such a good deal, but it is still the best.</li>
    <li> I have used it for at least two years and it is a really great product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The pump broke after I used about 1/8 of the product and I was unable to dispense the rest. I love the product, it has excellent hold and works really well, but I couldn&#x27;t get most of it out if the packaging.</li>
    <li> The best way to use this is by placing a very small amount on your middle fingertip.  About the size of a pencil eraser for short hair.  Then rub your finger tips together so the product is on all finger tips, then pat your finger tips together.  You&#x27;ll see threads or strings as the product blends.  At this point you can rub it into your hair as you wish.  Be careful because if you use too much your hair will look greasy.  I have very fine hair.  So fine that I require a spritz of hairspray before using my curing iron or my hair falls out of the iron.  And now that I&#x27;m older, my hair is thin as well.  This product lifts my hair and it appears very full. Once I&#x27;m finished lifting my hair, I spritz again with hairspray and it stays all day.  I must say again that too much texture twist is bad.  Your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this styling product.  In fact I recommend Pureology products in general...I use shampoo, conditioner, texture twist and hairspray.  Love all of them!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair styler that I would use.  I have tried other products (mouses, sprays, ect) but this is the best.  You only need to use a small \\&quot;dab\\&quot; that you spread on your finger tips and the palms of your hands.  You quickly run through your hair and style it as you apply.  This holds your hair style in place and leaves your hair shiny and not dried out as does other products with an alcohol base.</li>
    <li> I love this product but very expensive.</li>
    <li> Texture Twist is AMAZING,  and I&#x27;m so upset it is discontinued. Newer Control Twist can&#x27;t  compare. It weights down my curls and leaves a greasy effect. Prices up over $100. elsewhere for Texture Twist now that it&#x27;s discontinued. Discusting. Pureology should get the message. I&#x27;m trying all the Neuma products now but feel hopeless, with a headache!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS - USUALLY BOUGHT IT AT MY HAIR SALON BUT COULD NO LONG GET IT THERE.  THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS - VERY SPEEDY.  AND, AS ALWAYS, THE PURELOGY PRODUCT IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that just looks stupid if I use gel or other stiff product. Since Sebastian Threads was discontinued, this is my go to product. I can be beautifully wavy or stick straight with this product. Nice lasting moveable hold. Product seems to last for months too. Overall a great product that lasts.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and I am very sad to find out that it has been discontinued.  The pump works perfectly and helps eliminate mess like other styling products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued! Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that compares to it. I&#x27;m not sure why Pureology quit making it.</li>
