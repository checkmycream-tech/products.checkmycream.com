      <li>Omg ... Love my wig!  </li>
      <li>and it shook our nicely each time.</li>
      <li>nicely</li>
      <li>Really nice quality wig and very reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>This wig is a fun addition to my wardrobe, it&#x27;s good to wear for fun or at a costume party.</li>
      <li>Was used a few times and held up wonderfully!</li>
      <li>This is a great wig, was packaged well, so the wig was not a mess, with a little fluffing and spraying, and moving the part around, it looks really great on my Marilyn Monroe mannequin.</li>
      <li>Great fit, soft, and curls last forever!</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>I have had many approach me to tell me that my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; looks amazing, only to look completely dumbfounded when I inform them that it is a wig.</li>
      <li>The hair is a good quality for not real hair.</li>
      <li>Fun wig.  </li>
      <li>It came in good condition, not messed up like other wigs I have ordered.  </li>
      <li>I have a very large head for a woman ...</li>
      <li>Wonderfully soft and easily worn.</li>
      <li>Did not take much styling at all!  </li>
      <li>So it was very snug!</li>
      <li>I purchased this wig for a Comic Book Convention in February 2014, just to wear Marilyn Monroe as a space-filler costume.</li>
      <li>It does okay with gentle brushing, but may require some finger-shaping to get back to exactly where you want it, but once it&#x27;s there, it will hold its glamorous look all night, whether you&#x27;re posing for pictures or dancing the night away~</li>
      <li>Came flat but was easily styled.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The wig arrived promptly and packaged very well.</li>
      <li>Way better than the other Marilyn wig I had to buy from spirit of halloween until this one arrived</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The wig is high quality.  </li>
      <li>We will not be able to use it because it does not fit the actor.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>The quality was pretty good, but the hair was not styled like the pictures at all, which was a disappointment.</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to fit my nearly waist long, thick hair into a short hair style wig.</li>
      <li>and it is classy.</li>
      <li>As with all wigs, it will need just a little bit of work to make it look exactly like the picture.  </li>
      <li>There are no strange smells</li>

<li> and the front is completely flat</li>
<li> The wig was shipped in a flat plastic sealed bag.  </li>
<li> Not a high quality wig, the curls are mich smaller than in the photo</li>
<li> The wig arrived in a timely manner, but is entirely too small for the average adult head.  </li>
<li> Too small, and I do not have a big head at all.</li>
<li> It was just as I expected it would be!</li>
<li> My Halloween Costume was not a success because of it.</li>
<li> It took a lot of shaping and fluffing and honestly never looked like the wig in the picture.  </li>
<li> In the months since, I have taken this wig and the rest of my Marilyn costume to EVERY SINGLE CONVENTION (at least 2 per month, I should add) and this wig is still in almost-new condition, despite the terrible abuse I put it through.</li>
<li> I am not impressed.</li>
<li> The picture shown is not like the one I got :(</li>
<li> disappointed and won&#x27;t purchase this brand ever again.</li>

    <li> The moment I placed the wig on my head; I instantly turned into Marilyn Monroe. I have worn it now 7 times on stage (community)  and it shook our nicely each time. I have a very large head for a woman ... So it was very snug!</li>
    <li> Fun wig.  It came in good condition, not messed up like other wigs I have ordered.  Looked and fit great!</li>
    <li> Good wig for the price. Very pretty.</li>

    <li> Omg ... Love my wig!  There are no strange smells and it is classy.Great fit, soft, and curls last forever!</li>
    <li> Looked like it did online.</li>

    <li> I am not impressed. Too small, and I do not have a big head at all. I will return it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Just as described. Did not take much styling at all!  Thanks.</li>

    <li> This wig is beautifully made. I am very happy with my purchase and  I would buy from Wigiss again.</li>
    <li> The wig was shipped in a flat plastic sealed bag.  It took a lot of shaping and fluffing and honestly never looked like the wig in the picture.  I don&#x27;t have any experience shaping wigs, so for me, this was an overpriced wig for Halloween.</li>
    <li> It did not stay on my head . My Halloween Costume was not a success because of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for a Comic Book Convention in February 2014, just to wear Marilyn Monroe as a space-filler costume.

    <li> Really nice quality wig and very reasonable price!  I am very happy with this purchase.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Love this&lt;br /&gt;Comes in great condition&lt;br /&gt;Fits nicely</li>
