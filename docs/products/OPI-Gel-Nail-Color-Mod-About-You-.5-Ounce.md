      <li>Good coverage.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
      <li>Love love love it!!!!</li>
      <li>told me it was not the best quality, as she placed the top coat after having applied the color and allowint it to set under the ultraviolte light</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this color!  </li>
      <li>so I can do my own nails at home and save money.</li>
      <li>fast service, OPI gel wook great!</li>
      <li>The color is nice, but until OPI changes the brush, I will not be using this brand.</li>
      <li>I can see the color sticking to the top coat.  </li>
      <li>love this color.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite polishes.</li>
      <li>Polish is probably ok but didn&#x27;t work well with gel nail dryer that I had.</li>
      <li>What more can I say.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find out that it is made in gel.</li>
      <li>I bought this product and was so excited to get it!</li>
      <li>The perfect light pink!</li>
      <li>While the color is great, the brush quality is sub standard.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s just the light color</li>
      <li>I would rather have had the original color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had great success with every other OPI Gelcolor I&#x27;ve purchased, but this one is the exception.</li>
      <li>I do my own gel every week, and have never had an issue with this color, but when I brought it in to my local salon to have it put on my toes</li>
      <li>NOT the original Mod</li>
      <li>I kept the color, it is still pretty.</li>
      <li>so more patience is necessary than with some colors to get an even color.</li>
      <li>If you like pink, you&#x27;ll love this color.  </li>
      <li>But when it came, it was Mod</li>
      <li>This color is BETTER than I expected.  </li>
      <li>But honestly ladies, I don&#x27;t mind a few extra minutes for a super flattering, classic color!</li>
      <li>Very pretty pastel pink with the right amount of vibrancy.</li>
      <li>Fabulously pale gel color that goes on smoothly and ends up just right.</li>
      <li>I decided to keep it mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning.</li>
      <li>when you remove the sticky layer after a clear top coat, half the color wipes off with it.</li>
      <li>When I get my nails professionally done I always get this color.  </li>
      <li>But with the pastel, it is much lighter and took 3-4 coats to make solid.</li>
      <li>Too pink....did not match what professional salon had (but had run out of).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty and pink.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure this product was an original from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>That being said, the extra few minutes is well worth it!</li>
      <li>but it gets very streaky if you don&#x27;t apply carefully!</li>
      <li>She told me that&#x27;s a sign that it&#x27;s not the real OPI but an imitation.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s muted with white so that it appears pale.  </li>
<li> I like to buy other colors of this brand to take to my nail salon.</li>
<li> The gal doing my nails at the salon wrote it down so they could get it.</li>
<li> This is a milky pink shade opaque not sure yet about durability lighter shade than cnd shellac  (cake pop). .</li>
<li> she was not happy with the extra care required to get an even application.</li>
<li> Recently they told my that they don&#x27;t like the brushes that OPI uses, that they are poor quality and leave stroke marks.</li>
<li> I typically do three thin coats of gel polish to ensure the opacity of the look - that&#x27;s what is pictured here.</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> Disappointed once I took it to my salon.  </li>

    <li> Fabulously pale gel color that goes on smoothly and ends up just right.</li>
    <li> This color is BETTER than I expected.  Can not wait to use it!  Great color!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you like pink, you&#x27;ll love this color.  It&#x27;s muted with white so that it appears pale.  It&#x27;s a creamy!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite polishes. I love it! Definitely a good buy. I was very excited to find out that it is made in gel.</li>
    <li> This is a milky pink shade opaque not sure yet about durability lighter shade than cnd shellac  (cake pop). .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great success with every other OPI Gelcolor I&#x27;ve purchased, but this one is the exception. The polish doesn&#x27;t set... when you remove the sticky layer after a clear top coat, half the color wipes off with it. Not good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was so excited to get it! But when it came, it was Mod About You PASTEL. NOT the original Mod About You color!!!! No where in the description said it would be the pastel version. I kept the color, it is still pretty. But with the pastel, it is much lighter and took 3-4 coats to make solid. I would rather have had the original color. I decided to keep it mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning. But if you don&#x27;t care about which version you might get, go for it! Opi makes great polish.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color but it didn&#x27;t set when I tried to use it this morning.</li>
    <li> Poor gel did bit dry under opi light</li>
    <li> My go to, favorite summer color!!! Now, this is a pastel, or white based color... so more patience is necessary than with some colors to get an even color. That being said, the extra few minutes is well worth it! I do my own gel every week, and have never had an issue with this color, but when I brought it in to my local salon to have it put on my toes she was not happy with the extra care required to get an even application. But honestly ladies, I don&#x27;t mind a few extra minutes for a super flattering, classic color!</li>
    <li> While the color is great, the brush quality is sub standard. I like to buy other colors of this brand to take to my nail salon. Recently they told my that they don&#x27;t like the brushes that OPI uses, that they are poor quality and leave stroke marks. The color is nice, but until OPI changes the brush, I will not be using this brand.</li>
    <li> Too pink....did not match what professional salon had (but had run out of).</li>
    <li> fast service, OPI gel wook great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! The perfect light pink!</li>
    <li> Good coverage. I typically do three thin coats of gel polish to ensure the opacity of the look - that&#x27;s what is pictured here. Very pretty pastel pink with the right amount of vibrancy.</li>
    <li> Disappointed once I took it to my salon.  My nail tech who has been my nail tech for over 15 yrs. told me it was not the best quality, as she placed the top coat after having applied the color and allowint it to set under the ultraviolte light I can see the color sticking to the top coat.  She told me that&#x27;s a sign that it&#x27;s not the real OPI but an imitation. Save your money!</li>
    <li> The polish was not the pastel color as I had ordered. The consistency of the polish was off as well. I am not sure this product was an original from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> When I get my nails professionally done I always get this color.  I recently purchased an LED GEL KIT so I can do my own nails at home and save money. So obviously I needed my signature color!!! It&#x27;s pretty and pink.  What more can I say. Love it!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s just the light color but it gets very streaky if you don&#x27;t apply carefully!</li>
    <li> love this color. The gal doing my nails at the salon wrote it down so they could get it.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  It only takes 1-2 coats to thoroughly cover my nails.  Plus, it will last for over a week.</li>
    <li> Polish is probably ok but didn&#x27;t work well with gel nail dryer that I had.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors ever!! Actually bought the polish for my toes!!! Love love love it!!!!</li>
