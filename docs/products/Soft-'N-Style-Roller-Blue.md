      <li>I found that the best way to prevent this was to use the hot roller clamps on the brush roller</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 72 yrs old and will continue using rollers as they are so much easier for me to handle.</li>
      <li>They roll easily and stay tight all night.</li>
      <li>Because I use this size and they are readily available at retail stores, and because I didn&#x27;t want to pay another shipping charge to return them, I still have them--in the bottom of my bathroom cabinet for some time--way down the road when I can put them to use.</li>
      <li>They work better for me when I use them on dry hair instead of wet.  </li>
      <li>I was glad amazon had these for sale because they are hard to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an old fashioned gal and still use rollers for my hair instead of a curling iron.  </li>
      <li>Two packs were marked &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; Diameter&amp;#34;, the third pack was marked &amp;#34;5/8&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Soft &#x27;N Style 1/2&amp;#34; Blue Velcro Roller (Bag of 12)</li>

<li> They work really well on short hair but be careful to keep loose hair away from the just rolled hair as it gets tangled and makes the curler hard to remove.</li>
<li> No pins necessary, works with dry or wet hair.</li>
<li> These little gems actually stay in my hair without every single one needing a clip.  </li>
<li> I ordered these rollers because I was looking for a small size Valcro roller.  </li>
<li> This size sets a mean little curl too!</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t say anything bad about them.</li>

    <li> I use curlers for perms. this type of curler gives me a nice body perm with out frizzing. I have several sizes and use according to the length of my hair which is short. I was glad amazon had these for sale because they are hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> great size for short hair.  Good quality</li>
    <li> I tried to purchase thee in November 2010 and the vendor just cancelled my order as they were out of stock and the vendor did not have any idea when they would become available again, they simply canceled my order from Amazon and it just disappeared as if I&#x27;d never ordered them. So: 1) Out of Stock. 2) No know restock date; perhaps never. 3) Order gone from my listing of Amazon orders; would prefer record of it remains.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to manage the hair around the nape of my neck because it is so short.  Works perfectly, holds the hair well and stays in.</li>
    <li> These rollers are great for my short hair.  They roll easily and stay tight all night. The 1/8 inch larger makes no difference at all. They don&#x27;t tangled in my hair. There&#x27;s plenty to roll my whole head and I can&#x27;t say anything bad about them. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
    <li> These rollers are very strong grippers!  I would recommend them to people with shorter hair styles.  I was asked to write four more words before I could leave this recommendation and now I just want to see how many words bring me to the max, hmmm guess there&#x27;s no max.  Have a nice day!</li>
    <li> Excellent for very short hair - I use them for lift and body for my fine, limp hair.  No pins necessary, works with dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these handy 1/2&amp;#34; blue velcro rollers.  They stay in your hair without using clips and provide lovely soft curly locks.</li>
    <li> I have lots of velcro rollers, of varying sizes.  These little gems actually stay in my hair without every single one needing a clip.  This size sets a mean little curl too!</li>
    <li> Soft &#x27;N Style 1/2&amp;#34; Blue Velcro Roller (Bag of 12) (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt; just what i wanted, they are the perfect size</li>
    <li> This item is a good quality for a good price.  It also arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> the size is not what advertised ... the size received is 5/8&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The order was for three 12-packs of rollers.  Two packs were marked &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; Diameter&amp;#34;, the third pack was marked &amp;#34;5/8&amp;#34; Diameter&amp;#34;, but they are all identical, and all measure 5/8&amp;#34; in diameter (diameter of the solid cylinder, not including the Velcro hooks).  If you wear your hair short, these are just one size too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S.  The local Dollar Store used to have these, one 6-pack for $1, but they no longer have them.  Still, you may want to check from time to time.)</li>
    <li> They work really well on short hair but be careful to keep loose hair away from the just rolled hair as it gets tangled and makes the curler hard to remove. I found that the best way to prevent this was to use the hot roller clamps on the brush roller and it works great to prevent tangled curlers.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this size roller anywhere and was so happy I was able to purchase them.  I&#x27;m an old fashioned gal and still use rollers for my hair instead of a curling iron.  I&#x27;m 72 yrs old and will continue using rollers as they are so much easier for me to handle.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use that I use them almost every day, and I am getting many compliments on the body and volume of my usually fine, stick-straight hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase! Recommend especially for anyone with medium to short length hair, needing extra body.  Compact for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Love these!  Do not catch on hair when taking out.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful rollers and hard to find in the stores. Just how many words are needed to tell others about hair rollers?</li>
    <li> I always buy these kind of curlers as they stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> these rollers work great.  They are alot better than the hot iron.  They work better for me when I use them on dry hair instead of wet.  Thank You !</li>
    <li> They work great.  I especially like the velcro feature.</li>
    <li> Big improvement - they stay were you put them. I really like them.</li>
    <li> Good quality and work great.  Great deal also</li>
    <li> Rollers work very nice, just takes a bit of time to get used to them.  Can&#x27;t think of much more to say about hair rollers, except they were just as described.</li>
    <li> I ordered these rollers because I was looking for a small size Valcro roller.  The size was described as 1/2 inch.  I use velcro rollers and have a size that is 5/8&amp;#34; so I thought these would be smaller.  Nope--same size.  Keep looking.  Because I use this size and they are readily available at retail stores, and because I didn&#x27;t want to pay another shipping charge to return them, I still have them--in the bottom of my bathroom cabinet for some time--way down the road when I can put them to use.</li>
