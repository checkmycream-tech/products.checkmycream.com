      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>Scentsiv is awesome.  </li>
      <li>This has been wonderful</li>
      <li>Great stuff!!!</li>
      <li>Very happy with product.</li>
      <li>This is some good stuff and is 99.999% fragrance-free (nothing is 100%!).</li>
      <li>Great prompt service, works  like salon wax.</li>
      <li>I spike my hair so it works great for a dry/messy look.  </li>
      <li>I am buying it again for sure!!</li>
      <li>I gave up after searching through row upon row of brightly colored and over scented potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just as good the J. Crew product.    </li>
      <li>Works just as good as J.Crew product I used to use.    </li>
      <li>Better than Crew and no scent at all!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>This is not quite as nice to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not pliable on its own.  </li>
      <li>The texture is nice once applied.</li>
      <li>You would have to dig it out and mix in warm water and rub it thoroughly with your hands before applying.  </li>
      <li>on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>Completely unscented and works great!</li>
      <li>It is more crumbly and brittle compared to the J.Crew product; however, the J.Crew product has a very strong cologne smell that I quite dislike.</li>
      <li>Works as well as Aveda control paste but without the Aveda scent (which I love</li>
      <li>For people like myself, who get an instant migraine from fragrance of any kind, this product is a God-send!!!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I love that this one is unscented.</li>
      <li>the best part is, because smells are so much stronger to me, some of them -- especially manufactured scents like perfume, cleaning products, candles, etc. --</li>
      <li>I have a full head of fine wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I have a very hard time finding true fragrance free products and this is certainly one, works great too!!</li>
      <li>It is unscented which is good but its sort of dry.</li>
      <li>Yes, this is really fragrance free.</li>
      <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s worth a shot if you are as &amp;#34;scent-sitive&amp;#34; to fragrances as this girl.</li>
      <li>Then I use a pea sized amount of this product and rub my hands together until they are warm, then I run my fingers over the back  and sides of my head until they are sticking up, then I get another pea sized amount and do the same for the top and bangs.</li>
      <li>Hard to find good products that are fragrence free.</li>
      <li>This always gives me good application of the wax while still using a small amount of the product.</li>
      <li>But the main draw to this is the unscented claim and it does just that!  </li>
      <li>The fragrances, if not unhealthy, are certainly obnoxious.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair very well and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I really like this stuff..</li>
      <li>It is strong and has a nice finish - a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>After everything is flat and tidy I comb the front up and slightly back.</li>
      <li>I just want to live a normal life, but no, instead I am a super-smeller, and I detect even the faintest scents that no one else in the room is even aware of.</li>
      <li>and now I can throw out that smelly, expensive hair salon stuff that a beautiful stylist talked me into purchasing.</li>
      <li>The only way I can use it is to warm it in my hand first, then add a little styling gel to mix with it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a hair wax.</li>
      <li>It has just enough hold to keep the back and sides in line and put my 5&amp;#34; bangs up and back off my forehead in a nice natural looking quaffed hairdo.</li>
      <li>I used to go through this stuff much faster when I tried to apply it dry and without \\&quot;melting\\&quot; it first.</li>
      <li>It truly is unscented, even for those of us with super-smelling abilities, and my boyfriend actually likes its effectiveness on his hair even MORE than that of his disgusting-smelling previous choice products.</li>
      <li>Cons:  A little more crumbly and not as nice to apply (very minor complaint)    </li>
      <li>It holds my hair in place, adds shine and my hair stays soft, not sticky.</li>
      <li>It holds and gives texture while keeping your hair soft.</li>
      <li>Originally, i thought it was old product that simply dried out on the shelf.  </li>
      <li>imagine my joy when my boyfriend decides he wants to have cool dude hair and starts purchasing styling products with disgusting, granny-perfume scents.</li>
      <li>I *almost* moved out and got a new boyfriend, but at the last minute I found this hair styling wax, and it saved my relationship, my nose, and my sanity.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;ve been shying away from your man&#x27;s caresses because his head smells like a granny, or if you&#x27;ve realized your significant other is mysteriously shying away from your caresses (possibly because your head smells like a granny), do yourself a favor and try out this hair wax.</li>

<li> All of them smelled like various fruits which is not what this middle aged man wanted.  </li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t do it carefully or wet it enough, it will show as white flaky gook on your hair.  </li>
<li> Yes, that woman in the house across the street just put one single dab of perfume on her left wrist.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard to find unscented hair products, and this wax is absolutely unscented.  </li>
<li> It will take me a long time to use this up, but I will re-purchase someday.</li>
<li> Not really greasy looking, they stay put without actually looking waxy.</li>
<li> It helps my long hair stay in place, I use it on my bangs too..</li>
<li> Even then I can&#x27;t use it on dry hair -- I have to have wet hair, put it on, and blow dry to essentially melt it into my hair.</li>
<li> When I get out of the shower I dry my hair as much as possible and comb it all down flat.</li>
<li> Other products can get the same style</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way too dry</li>
<li> Wet your hair  2.</li>
<li> Wet your hands  3.</li>
<li> I do not enjoy the white paste color as it takes FOREVER to work into your hair before the color disappears.  </li>
<li> I took a chance and spent what seemed like a lot</li>
<li> It has absolutely No scent!</li>
<li> it should last for at least a year longer.  </li>
<li> My hair is basically platinum, so I don&#x27;t know about how it would look on dark hair...</li>
<li> It also holds well and is comparable to Aveda&#x27;s Control Paste minus the heavy scent.  </li>
<li> Then I comb everything down again.</li>
<li> Its not very easy to work with.</li>
<li> but it takes so little of the wax</li>
<li> Being sensitive to fragrances has made it difficult to find a hair wax product that works.</li>
<li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look oily, greasy, shiny, clumpy, or stiff, it just behaves.  </li>
<li> it can be a little hard to wash out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not very pleased with this product!</li>
<li> Not sure if the product i received was how it was meant to be.  </li>
<li> So that is a little annoying and sometimes (depending on how much you use)</li>
<li> Make hair stiff as a board, UGH, even if used in very small amounts.</li>
<li> actually make me feel queasy and sick.</li>
<li> Works just like Aveda but no scent and much less expensive!</li>
<li> The one review I saw that was negative said that the product was difficult to apply, but I think hair wax just can&#x27;t be applied like hair gel.</li>
<li> Keep rubbing until the wax turns into a cream which is covering palms and fingers in a thin coating.  </li>
<li> Take a small finger tip sized amount and rub it between the palms of your hands (like its a cold winter morning)  4.</li>
<li> I have terrible allergies and have been unable to use hair product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great prompt service, works  like salon wax.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so greasy! I&#x27;m not very pleased with this product! Wish I had never purchased it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find unscented hair products, and this wax is absolutely unscented.  It also holds well and is comparable to Aveda&#x27;s Control Paste minus the heavy scent.  My nose and my SO&#x27;s nose thank the manufacturer.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Not sure if the product i received was how it was meant to be.  Since it came the same way the second time, i&#x27;m thinking it is.  It&#x27;s way too dry on it&#x27;s own.  Originally, i thought it was old product that simply dried out on the shelf.  It&#x27;s not pliable on its own.  You would have to dig it out and mix in warm water and rub it thoroughly with your hands before applying.  If you don&#x27;t do it carefully or wet it enough, it will show as white flaky gook on your hair.  Only thing i like about it is the unscented part.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Hard to find good products that are fragrence free. I have an allergy to fragrance. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This product is so firm/waxy it can&#x27;t even be distributed in your hair. You&#x27;ll end up with white flecks of the product in your hair! The only way I can use it is to warm it in my hand first, then add a little styling gel to mix with it. Even then I can&#x27;t use it on dry hair -- I have to have wet hair, put it on, and blow dry to essentially melt it into my hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a unscented, matte finish wax or clay styling product.  I could not find it at a local pharmacy or grocery store because they didn&#x27;t have section for unscented products out of HUNDREDS of types. All of them smelled like various fruits which is not what this middle aged man wanted.  I gave up after searching through row upon row of brightly colored and over scented potions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a chance and spent what seemed like a lot but it takes so little of the wax it should last for at least a year longer.  It has no odor at all and now I can throw out that smelly, expensive hair salon stuff that a beautiful stylist talked me into purchasing.</li>
    <li> Works just like Aveda but no scent and much less expensive!</li>
    <li> While this product does not have any fragrance, it does still burn my scalp when I use it.  I guess I have to look elsewhere.  The texture is nice once applied.</li>
    <li> Make hair stiff as a board, UGH, even if used in very small amounts.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It has just enough hold to keep the back and sides in line and put my 5&amp;#34; bangs up and back off my forehead in a nice natural looking quaffed hairdo. My hair doesn&#x27;t look oily, greasy, shiny, clumpy, or stiff, it just behaves.  I have a full head of fine wavy hair. When I get out of the shower I dry my hair as much as possible and comb it all down flat. Then I use a pea sized amount of this product and rub my hands together until they are warm, then I run my fingers over the back  and sides of my head until they are sticking up, then I get another pea sized amount and do the same for the top and bangs. Then I comb everything down again. After everything is flat and tidy I comb the front up and slightly back. Every so often throughout the day I run my fingers through my hair to push back the forces of gravity.  Other products can get the same style but I love that this one is unscented. I only buy unscented products. The fragrances, if not unhealthy, are certainly obnoxious. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I am cursed. People always think having superpowers would be awesome, but I have a superpower, and take it from me, it is terrible. I just want to live a normal life, but no, instead I am a super-smeller, and I detect even the faintest scents that no one else in the room is even aware of. Yes, that woman in the house across the street just put one single dab of perfume on her left wrist. Yes, that guy 50 yards over there just let one rip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is, because smells are so much stronger to me, some of them -- especially manufactured scents like perfume, cleaning products, candles, etc. -- actually make me feel queasy and sick. Yay!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my joy when my boyfriend decides he wants to have cool dude hair and starts purchasing styling products with disgusting, granny-perfume scents. I *almost* moved out and got a new boyfriend, but at the last minute I found this hair styling wax, and it saved my relationship, my nose, and my sanity. It truly is unscented, even for those of us with super-smelling abilities, and my boyfriend actually likes its effectiveness on his hair even MORE than that of his disgusting-smelling previous choice products. Win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;ve been shying away from your man&#x27;s caresses because his head smells like a granny, or if you&#x27;ve realized your significant other is mysteriously shying away from your caresses (possibly because your head smells like a granny), do yourself a favor and try out this hair wax. The noses of the world will thank you.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is really fragrance free. I like the product.</li>
    <li> This wax is not greasy. I am ecstatic that it is UNSCENTED. It will take me a long time to use this up, but I will re-purchase someday.</li>
    <li> For people like myself, who get an instant migraine from fragrance of any kind, this product is a God-send!!! It has absolutely No scent! It holds and gives texture while keeping your hair soft. I am buying it again for sure!!</li>
    <li> I used to use the J.Crew \\&quot;FIBER\\&quot; Styling cream. This is not quite as nice to use. It is more crumbly and brittle compared to the J.Crew product; however, the J.Crew product has a very strong cologne smell that I quite dislike. This product once spread into the hair works just as good the J. Crew product.    Pros:  Unscented  Works just as good as J.Crew product I used to use.    Cons:  A little more crumbly and not as nice to apply (very minor complaint)    The one review I saw that was negative said that the product was difficult to apply, but I think hair wax just can&#x27;t be applied like hair gel. I thought I might share how I apply hair wax.    How to apply:  1. Wet your hair  2. Wet your hands  3. Take a small finger tip sized amount and rub it between the palms of your hands (like its a cold winter morning)  4. Keep rubbing until the wax turns into a cream which is covering palms and fingers in a thin coating.  5. Work it into your hair moving your hand back and forth through your hair vigorously.    This always gives me good application of the wax while still using a small amount of the product. I used to go through this stuff much faster when I tried to apply it dry and without \\&quot;melting\\&quot; it first.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.. It helps my long hair stay in place, I use it on my bangs too.. Not really greasy looking, they stay put without actually looking waxy.</li>
    <li> Being sensitive to fragrances has made it difficult to find a hair wax product that works. This product is amazing. It holds my hair in place, adds shine and my hair stays soft, not sticky. I would highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a hair wax.</li>
    <li> Scentsiv is awesome.  Better than Crew and no scent at all!</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding true fragrance free products and this is certainly one, works great too!!</li>
    <li> I have terrible allergies and have been unable to use hair product. This has been wonderful</li>
    <li> Completely unscented and works great!</li>
    <li> It is unscented which is good but its sort of dry. Its not very easy to work with. I have a fragrance allergy so I have to use something like this though.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff and is 99.999% fragrance-free (nothing is 100%!). It is strong and has a nice finish - a little goes a long way. My hair is basically platinum, so I don&#x27;t know about how it would look on dark hair...it might leave a cloudy residue? But for the price, it&#x27;s worth a shot if you are as &amp;#34;scent-sitive&amp;#34; to fragrances as this girl.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Aveda control paste but without the Aveda scent (which I love but my coworker didn&#x27;t appreciate).</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  It is as &amp;#34;scent free&amp;#34; as I imagine is humanly possible to get.  It holds my hair very well and lasts all day.  I spike my hair so it works great for a dry/messy look.  I do not enjoy the white paste color as it takes FOREVER to work into your hair before the color disappears.  So that is a little annoying and sometimes (depending on how much you use) it can be a little hard to wash out.  But the main draw to this is the unscented claim and it does just that!  I would buy this again.</li>
