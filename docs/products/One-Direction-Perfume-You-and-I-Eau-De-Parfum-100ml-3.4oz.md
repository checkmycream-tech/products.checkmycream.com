    <li> christmas gift for 15 year old granddaughter  i got an OMG when she opened it...that the best rating ever lol</li>
    <li> Obviously overpriced, but anything with One Direction attached to it is destined to be popular with the teens and tweens, and my daughters indeed love it. Smell is best described as not annoying, which actually isn&#x27;t bad since there are plenty of perfumes that smell like garbage.</li>

    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Great price!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it and wants more one direction items now</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this fragrance.  It is light and slightly sweet.  I have a sensitive nose and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  The price on Amazon was lower than others I&#x27;ve seen.  The perfume bottle/box arrived in great shape.</li>
    <li> Perfect !!! Pageaged great and came on time !!</li>
    <li> No. Just no. Do not buy this. At first spray it was a pleasant, sweet floral scent but once settled gave off a distinct odor of stale urine. I still feel nauseous just thinking about it. I read that everyone has different scent experiences when it comes to perfume, so you may like it but if I want to smell like urine then I will call R.Kelly.</li>
    <li> the smell its sooo good! realy good</li>
    <li> Daughter smells good.  She&#x27;d give it a 10 because its 1D!!</li>
    <li> The design doesnt really look soo good kinda looks pirated</li>
    <li> My daughter was given this sample from Ulta and fell in love with the scent! It has a pleasant smell that I would gladly wear as an adult. I don&#x27;t listen to 1D and she doesn&#x27;t either but it could be called any name and I would wear it. It lasts all day and it&#x27;s not overwhelming when you first put it on.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing and the bottle is absolutely beautiful!  My daughter wears this every day!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  It actually smells very nice</li>
    <li> Amazing smells great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it so much!!!!:)</li>

    <li> Loved the perfume!! It&#x27;s a must buy!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume. And I think if smells fantastic as it is a very attractive fragrance.</li>
    <li> May i say?? I loved this perfum,not only because if has a good smell,but also because it comes with a beautiful ring :)</li>

    <li> Gift for Granddaughter She was Very happy</li>
    <li> No. Packaging was loose and there was hardly anything holding up the perfume. I needed to open and re-adjust the contents. I was disappointed being that it was a Christmas present for my daughter. On a positive note despite, my disappointment, my daughter was surprised upon receiving the gift!</li>
    <li> For my 12 yr old niece. She lived it, but she loves anything 1D. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Everything was great, exactly what I expected and came before promised.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, the bottle is much bigger than I expected it to be, which was nice. The perfume was not packaged to great and was leaking when she took it out of the box. Other than that, she loves it.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter turned 15. Her grandpa and I couldn&#x27;t be there for her birthday so I ordered her this perfume...she loves One Direction. It was a surprise and she was elated when it arrived. Beautiful package and the perfume smells nice. Great gift and it arrived as promised! I am definitely a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I am a big One Direction fan and when I heard about this perfume I just had to get it! It smells beyond amazing. I love the cute charm it comes with on the bottle as well. It smells like a floral but berry scent.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter&#x27;s 21st B-Day smells awsome</li>
    <li> Bought all 3 of the one direction perfumes and was not disappointed at all I would wear all three myself</li>
    <li> Great my niece loved it (also great price) Thank you!</li>
    <li> Everything that I have expected from this perfume.  Fell in love with the packaging and scent. Highly recommended.</li>
