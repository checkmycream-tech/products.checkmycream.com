### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>wife was very happy with the performance and the results that this product gave her.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Otherwise; GREAT!!!</li>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy that I bought the ISO and it takes time and practice to get the perfect results.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing good about this!</li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>This product was received in great timing and in great condition.  </li>
      <li>My wife and sister are happy and contented.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The plastic teeth on the brush can get caught in your hair sometimes but everything else is great.</li>
      <li>Does a great job at curling.  </li>
      <li>I think the product is good its just not for my hair.</li>
      <li>and I really loved how it made my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>and they spend the most beautiful day jejejej</li>
      <li>Not to mention since I&#x27;m sure practically no one buys them amazon has them sitting on a shelf collecting dust just as someone else said I recieved mine covered!</li>
      <li>I am not even sure why it spins and what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing??</li>
      <li>so I was glad when I saw it on amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>$30 more.  </li>
      <li>and it was better, but also</li>
      <li>It makes her hair fuller and more managable.  </li>
      <li>I have used it and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>or smooth.</li>
      <li>It also didn&#x27;t straighten because it does not even grip your hair because the brush part is so cheap.</li>
      <li>Convinced her that this ISO model was far superior.</li>
      <li>Worth a try if you have straw hair like me!</li>
      <li>get the original instead ( the instyler).</li>
      <li>I love how hot this item gets, but, I can&#x27;t, for the life of me, figure out how to turn off the rotation.........</li>
      <li>Because the spinning cylinder only spins in one direction, it is great if you are right handed.</li>
      <li>It does a good job especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t get that hot to smooth out my hair.</li>
      <li>I finally decided to buy one and love it!  </li>
      <li>I have natural wavy hair and when I used the ISO to straighten or curl my hair, it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and not dry, which is great!</li>
      <li>importand, first users get used to this item, you can burn your self very easy, but really no big deal at all, it&#x27;s just get used to handle it, but the moment you have the practise, works fine and fast results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick texture wise and needs a lot more heat.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give this more than three stars because I think there could be BIG improvements on these type of items.</li>
      <li>You can set the tempature so it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns you.  </li>
      <li>She liked it, but told me she bought another one that worked with wet hair, drying as it curled.</li>
      <li>If you must buy this product,DO NOT buy the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; in the stores-that product is made cheaply and costs far too much money.</li>
      <li>If this and other items like it could reverse spin, they could really be more useful.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it drys my hair without over drying and it works fast.</li>
      <li>Came fast and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does give it a fuller feel.</li>
      <li>I have been using a light heat protecter prior to ironing my hiar.</li>
      <li>haha  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like the way my hair looks and feels after i finish doing my hair with this thing, I tried returning this item</li>
      <li>The roller no longer turns and it is becoming increasingly harder to turn on the unit.  </li>
      <li>The only reason it may leave others&#x27; hair soft is because you are technically brishing your hair more with it.</li>
      <li>This one is only rarely used.  </li>
      <li>Only down fall is that it dosen&#x27;t lay flat very well on the counter, which makes the hot roller hit the counter top.  </li>
      <li>It is loud and it does nothing!</li>
      <li>and it completely went.  </li>
      <li>I wanted one that would not just straighten but curl which this seemed like it could, in soft natural curls.</li>
      <li>(I have long straight hair</li>
      <li>Seriously I cannot believe it is even on the market and that the original price is what it is and that I even paid $55 for it!</li>
      <li>For straightening, a normal temp control flat iron beats this in every aspect.</li>
      <li>This item is OK, but not particularly great.  </li>
      <li>They are advertised for use by one person fixing their own hair - sorry, it just isn&#x27;t like that.</li>
      <li>I received the product on time and when I got it the item was kinda dusty, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>When using a normal straightener, My hair feels dry and the ends never seem to hold their style..</li>
      <li>The rotating iron seems to have totally no advantage over normal flat irons.</li>
      <li>As I now look back at the bad reviews and reread them I am finding with many products and especially this one that what others gave me the heads up on was completely accurate.</li>

<li> I did like the temperature control feature and that you can choose to use the roller or just use like a flat iron, but it doesn&#x27;t clamp down very well on your hair and the job is just average.</li>
<li> I only have used it on dry hair.</li>
<li> This item took a long time to reach me, but upon receipt, it was a winner.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have dry, curly/wavy hair.  </li>
<li> I am right handed and the way the roller works I can use it on my left side but its difficult to reach across.</li>
<li> you can use it with wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> A regular straightener always made my hair feel a little dry.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as this worked great in my hair.</li>
<li> you can go to bed with wet head and curl it in the morning.</li>
<li> It does not hold hair well and has no real advantage in hair styling.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t use for curls unless you want very loose curls.</li>
<li> I would recommend it to anyone who has trouble with flat hair.  </li>
<li> The plastic brush also tangles in your hair and it is just not a very smooth working implement.   </li>
<li> I previously had an Instyler</li>
<li> (Black or Black/green)]]this is a mear identical item to the Spin-It.</li>
<li> Within two months I started having trouble with the on/off button.  </li>
<li> what a way to treat your customers, don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
<li> BUT trying to fix the back or left side of my hair was impossible.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
<li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time on this product!</li>
<li> The roller is very uneven when rolling.  </li>
<li> You would think the least they could do is brush it off before packaging it!</li>
<li> It also came dented from the poor packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The brush is awful and it does not hold your hair, there is absolutely no possible way to curl your hair with it.</li>
<li> It has an awful design and does not sit on the counter as the picture shows like every single hair styling tool I have ever owned.  </li>
<li> so disappointing!</li>
<li> but my 15 days were up, but the worst part is the Customer service for this company they ARE SO RUDE!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think the product is good its just not for my hair. My hair is very thick texture wise and needs a lot more heat. This didn&#x27;t get that hot to smooth out my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this iron as a gift for our daughter-in-law, who was looking at one from a shopping channel.  Convinced her that this ISO model was far superior.</li>
    <li> As I now look back at the bad reviews and reread them I am finding with many products and especially this one that what others gave me the heads up on was completely accurate.This product is a piece of junk! Seriously I cannot believe it is even on the market and that the original price is what it is and that I even paid $55 for it! There is nothing good about this! It has an awful design and does not sit on the counter as the picture shows like every single hair styling tool I have ever owned.  It is loud and it does nothing! The brush is awful and it does not hold your hair, there is absolutely no possible way to curl your hair with it. (I have long straight hair so I wanted a flip or curls). It also didn&#x27;t straighten because it does not even grip your hair because the brush part is so cheap. I am not even sure why it spins and what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing?? Not to mention the directions that come with it are horrendous! The only reason it may leave others&#x27; hair soft is because you are technically brishing your hair more with it. Please don&#x27;t waste your time on this product! Not to mention since I&#x27;m sure practically no one buys them amazon has them sitting on a shelf collecting dust just as someone else said I recieved mine covered! You would think the least they could do is brush it off before packaging it! It also came dented from the poor packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So so disappointing! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> You can set the tempature so it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns you.  I used to have the InStyler but would burn myself all the time.  Does a great job at curling.  The plastic teeth on the brush can get caught in your hair sometimes but everything else is great.</li>
    <li> I have dry, curly/wavy hair.  When using a normal straightener, My hair feels dry and the ends never seem to hold their style.. my hair ends up looking like straw.  I have used this twice and both times I have not had to use any skinny/straight produts.  I have been using a light heat protecter prior to ironing my hiar. This product makes my hair feel silky.  I love it.  Only down fall is that it dosen&#x27;t lay flat very well on the counter, which makes the hot roller hit the counter top.  Worth a try if you have straw hair like me!</li>
    <li> This item is OK, but not particularly great.  The roller is very uneven when rolling.  It has starts and stops.  The plastic brush also tangles in your hair and it is just not a very smooth working implement.   I did like the temperature control feature and that you can choose to use the roller or just use like a flat iron, but it doesn&#x27;t clamp down very well on your hair and the job is just average.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used a similar model on me and I really loved how it made my hair feel.  I finally decided to buy one and love it!  A regular straightener always made my hair feel a little dry.  The rolling iron gives that silky feel to my hair and I like that I can turn the rotation off if I so desire.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time and when I got it the item was kinda dusty, but that&#x27;s okay.  Overall, I tried the product and it did what it was suppose to do.  I have natural wavy hair and when I used the ISO to straighten or curl my hair, it leaves my hair shiny, soft, and not dry, which is great! Time to say goodbye to my flat iron! haha  Well, I&#x27;m happy that I bought the ISO and it takes time and practice to get the perfect results.  Thank you Iso International!</li>
    <li> Came fast and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My wife and sister are happy and contented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Every Saturday, there&#x27;s a party in my house .. and they spend the most beautiful day jejejej&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my daughter. She liked it, but told me she bought another one that worked with wet hair, drying as it curled.</li>
    <li> This is great. you can go to bed with wet head and curl it in the morning. It will make your hair look fuller. or smooth. you can use it with wet or dry hair. I only have used it on dry hair. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the way my hair looks and feels after i finish doing my hair with this thing, I tried returning this item but my 15 days were up, but the worst part is the Customer service for this company they ARE SO RUDE!!!! they told me that they would not accept my item and that if i din&#x27;t like it that WAS MY PROBLEM!!! what a way to treat your customers, don&#x27;t waste your money on this get the original instead ( the instyler). DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!! PLEASE!!</li>
    <li> The issue I have is the roller. It only rolls one direction. I am right handed and the way the roller works I can use it on my left side but its difficult to reach across. I wish in the had a setting to change what way it rolls. I usualy have to turn it off unless I want to put up with the hassel. Otherwise it drys my hair without over drying and it works fast.</li>
    <li> I love how hot this item gets, but, I can&#x27;t, for the life of me, figure out how to turn off the rotation.........Otherwise; GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> This is a well built, sturdy looking item. It is very heavy - heavier than my large blow dryer. Because the spinning cylinder only spins in one direction, it is great if you are right handed. I wanted one that would not just straighten but curl which this seemed like it could, in soft natural curls. BUT trying to fix the back or left side of my hair was impossible. There was NO way I could get it to work properly since it was backwards and even trying to get my hand holding it so it would spin the correct way - which was like being a contortionist, didn&#x27;t do the job. I can&#x27;t give this more than three stars because I think there could be BIG improvements on these type of items. If this and other items like it could reverse spin, they could really be more useful. They are advertised for use by one person fixing their own hair - sorry, it just isn&#x27;t like that. Someone else doing my hair could have used it while I couldn&#x27;t. FYI [[ASIN:B003039YG0 Iso Digital Ceramic Tourmaline Rolling Styler Rotating Iron Rm-20 (Black or Black/green)]]this is a mear identical item to the Spin-It.</li>
    <li> If you must buy this product,DO NOT buy the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; in the stores-that product is made cheaply and costs far too much money. This product is put together with daily use in mind and is 30$ cheaper.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product.  It makes her hair fuller and more managable.  I would recommend it to anyone who has trouble with flat hair.  It really does give it a fuller feel.</li>
    <li> They sent me the iron that wasn&#x27;t digital. This also didn&#x27;t have a way to turn the rotating on and off. Returned. The description isn&#x27;t what you get. If you want to curl, there is no way.</li>
    <li> It does a good job especially for the price.  I previously had an Instyler and it was better, but also $30 more.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This item took a long time to reach me, but upon receipt, it was a winner.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was very happy with the performance and the results that this product gave her.&lt;br /&gt;Very importand, first users get used to this item, you can burn your self very easy, but really no big deal at all, it&#x27;s just get used to handle it, but the moment you have the practise, works fine and fast results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Within two months I started having trouble with the on/off button.  Once I would get it to turn on, the heat would take a while to come on, sometimes having to unplug, wait and restart it.  I purchased this product in August - it is now February and it completely went.  The roller no longer turns and it is becoming increasingly harder to turn on the unit.  I&#x27;m very disappointed as this worked great in my hair.</li>
    <li> The rotating iron seems to have totally no advantage over normal flat irons. This one is only rarely used.  It does not hold hair well and has no real advantage in hair styling.  Don&#x27;t use for curls unless you want very loose curls. For straightening, a normal temp control flat iron beats this in every aspect.</li>
    <li> This product was received in great timing and in great condition.  I have used it and love it.  My hairdresser suggested it so I was glad when I saw it on amazon.</li>
