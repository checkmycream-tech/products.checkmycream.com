      <li>It also works wonderfully for the hair, when the tips are a bit coarse.</li>
      <li>Keeps it moist for most of the day.</li>
      <li>it was ok.</li>
      <li>It is a great conditioner but you will need to wash your hair frequently as it can make it look greasy.</li>
      <li>(I have fine caucasian hair that is dual processed at the roots once a month</li>
      <li>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted that it&#x27;s so natural and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great knowing that I am not using any preservatives or convoluted ingredients - just pure and natural shea butter.</li>
      <li>This is a smooth, easily absorbed cream for heels, elbows, any place that needs TLC.</li>
      <li>It worked quickly and calmed the burning feeling.</li>
      <li>and it liquifies..or softens quickly and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>The Shea butter has a very natural earthy smell , which I love, and I use it to seal moisture into my hair</li>
      <li>I actually scrape the desired amount, then rub it quickly between my fingers to warm it up.</li>
      <li>I use the de-luxe 100% pure shea butter with lavender oil and Palmers Shea Butter with vitamin E, so I am familiar with the texture and odor of shea butter.</li>
      <li>That being said I know exactly what my skin will do as I age</li>
      <li>I was reluctant at first to purchase it</li>
      <li>I always get dry hands in the winter and this product has been great at keeping them from cracking and getting super dry.  </li>
      <li>I have to be super careful about ingredients because so many cause me to have reactions.</li>
      <li>It healed my chapped hands, and I love the deep, rich natural scent.  </li>
      <li>This is favorite shea butter of mine, mild without being stripped of it&#x27;s natural properties entirely.  </li>
      <li>Great for our very cold climate...Softens everything so nice.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really</li>
      <li>This Shea Butter has been very beneficial to my skin.</li>
      <li>Then it applies much easier to my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very calming and soothing.</li>
      <li>Once it melts in the palm of your hand it spreads really well.  </li>
      <li>Non-irritating in itself, but the act of distributing it by pressing and smoothing, even after warming the butter and keeping her hands warm by friction, takes a few minutes</li>
      <li>This is readily available at Whole Foods near me, which is why I picked it up when I found out that Now Foods makes only refined shea butter.</li>
      <li>Although shiny at first, it absorbs well and leaves no tight feeling areas.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s white with a vary mild scent and it comes in a glass jar.</li>
      <li>I would recommend highly and would purchase is as gifts as well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>High Quality</li>
      <li>BUT, Vitacost uses huge amounts of plastic wrap and an oversized box to get it to the customer, no regard at all for using our planet&#x27;s resources widely.  </li>
      <li>This is great for hard dry cuticles also - put it on them and overnight they are soothed and moisturized by morning.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, dry flakes lifted up many hours later and were easier to remove.</li>
      <li>But the instant moisturizing and protecting this offers , is sooo worth it.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that runs in my family, particularly on my father&#x27;s side.</li>
      <li>Makes it very soft.</li>
      <li>My skin soaks it up and it does not feel oily or greasy at all, just very soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard, which unrefined shea butter is supposed to, dark yellow/tan, and melts beautifully into skin.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at that at 1st.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I had been looking for a natural moisturizer for my face</li>
      <li>and it is naturally</li>
      <li>The unscented does have a scent, like natural shea butter.</li>
      <li>I wish it would come in a large size since I use it as daily on my entire body.</li>
      <li>We have oily/ dry combo skin that is very prone to breakouts (even into adulthood) and rashes.</li>
      <li>I have relaxed african american hair and it is also much softer, but not oily at all</li>
      <li>I usually use shea butter on my clean feet, before bed and then wear socks to bed.  </li>
      <li>But I have had to adjust the usage and dosage a million times because if I use it too often I break out and if I leave too much time in between usages I breakout due to dryness.</li>
      <li>She uses it on her face, which is dry and sensitive.  </li>

<li> I discovered this butter  after I&#x27;d started a new baking job, and my hands were cracked and raw.</li>
<li> Next, I&#x27;m gonna try the African Black Soap.</li>
<li> , I have noticed that the dry patches on my face from eczema are clearing up.  </li>
<li> As for my skin - I use it on my extremely dry hands and feet and my face.</li>
<li> Frequent reapplication or a heavy coat gave her milia and pink &amp;#</li>
<li> BUT before applying a tiny less than a pea size amount I need to wash, exfoliate, and apply a sulfur mask.</li>
<li> only need a little bit..</li>
<li> my skin was raw and red and flaky ...</li>
<li> I little goes a long way , so don&#x27;t let the price scare you...</li>
<li> Also for whoever suffers from dandruff this the right cure for it........</li>
<li> This product lasts for ages, has little to no smell, and no harmful additives.  </li>
<li> and a little bit goes a looong way.</li>
<li> It is very thick, so I tend to only use it at night.  </li>
<li> It melts with the warmth of the hand and then just slides over skin like butter, leaving it with a sof feeling which is not at all greasy or heavy.</li>
<li> I use a small amount on my face and hair both morning and night.  </li>
<li> If you plan to use it for your HAIR, also use a small amount.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviews saying that it smells awful, it smells like shea butter is supposed to - nutty, sweet, and smokey.</li>
<li> So basically if you have skin like me, you just need to really watch your skin and adjust accordingly as annoying as it might be.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick, but does absorb.</li>

    <li> Very good product and coming in a glass container is a plus!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have been using it for about a week.  I bought it from Outpost Foods in Milwaukee, WI in the Savanna Spice scent.  I bought it because I had been looking for a natural moisturizer for my face and I&#x27;d read lots of great things about Shea Butter.  Well, in the five days that I have been using it for both my face and hair, I have noticed that the dry patches on my face from eczema are clearing up.  I have relaxed african american hair and it is also much softer, but not oily at all and my scalp stopped itching.  I use a small amount on my face and hair both morning and night.  A tiny bit goes a long way.  Once it melts in the palm of your hand it spreads really well.  My skin soaks it up and it does not feel oily or greasy at all, just very soft.  My husband loves the Savanna Spice scent on me, too.  It smells yummy once it&#x27;s warmed by your skin.  Try it!  Next, I&#x27;m gonna try the African Black Soap.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have two 2oz. jars...the unscented and the ylang ylang scented. The unscented does have a scent, like natural shea butter.Smells like tire rubber/nutty. I was surprised at that at 1st. But the instant moisturizing and protecting this offers , is sooo worth it. I put this on the ends of my hair , also. (I have fine caucasian hair that is dual processed at the roots once a month and it is naturally wavy)This shea butter helps control fly-aways and dryness...and it adds shine and softness...my hair seems to absorb it...much like using coconut oil,but lighter feel. As for my skin - I use it on my extremely dry hands and feet and my face. This helped when I had rosacea! It was a life saver...my skin was raw and red and flaky ...I bought this as a last resort , before trying a dermatologist. It worked quickly and calmed the burning feeling. I mostly use it on my cheeks and under-eyes. This is great for hard dry cuticles also - put it on them and overnight they are soothed and moisturized by morning. I little goes a long way , so don&#x27;t let the price scare you...it&#x27;s like a paste and you warm it up in you hands and it liquifies..or softens quickly and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shea butter nightly for 3 months. I have to be super careful about ingredients because so many cause me to have reactions. I like this one, because it is literally 100% shea butter. It&#x27;s very thick, but does absorb. I actually scrape the desired amount, then rub it quickly between my fingers to warm it up. Then it applies much easier to my face. It&#x27;s great knowing that I am not using any preservatives or convoluted ingredients - just pure and natural shea butter.</li>
    <li> I always get dry hands in the winter and this product has been great at keeping them from cracking and getting super dry.  The smell of shea butter isn&#x27;t what you would expect but it works so I don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;I heard that shea butter can sometimes contain contamination so I wrote the company and this is what they responded with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your support in Alaffia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Unrefined Shea Butter is tested for unsafe bacteria, lead and mercury prior to export in Togo, West Africa. Once our shipment has arrived to our facility in Tumwater, WA, we do have an independent lab perform testing on the Unrefined Shea Butter before using in our products. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter has been very beneficial to my skin. Keeps it moist for most of the day. Pure Shea, it doesn&#x27;t have any additives which makes it especially good. I wish it would come in a large size since I use it as daily on my entire body. A 2oz jar lasts me for only a week.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this. Makes it very soft. Tried it on my face...it was ok. I&#x27;ll stick to using it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife at her request.  She uses it on her face, which is dry and sensitive.  Non-irritating in itself, but the act of distributing it by pressing and smoothing, even after warming the butter and keeping her hands warm by friction, takes a few minutes and *that* leaves red areas.  Although shiny at first, it absorbs well and leaves no tight feeling areas.  May need to reapply later.  Frequent reapplication or a heavy coat gave her milia and pink &amp;#34;pre-zits&amp;#34;.  Interestingly, dry flakes lifted up many hours later and were easier to remove. She has not worn make up with this since it takes a while to absorb and feels it would be too greasy to hold the make up or may cause blotching.  Maybe someone else can comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s still on the line about whether to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great for our very cold climate...Softens everything so nice.  I like the smell.  I have ordered more !!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> love this product.. I was itntroduced to it by a friend in AZ who used it on his hair... I was sneaking some of it and using it on my face and scars I had from breast cancer surgery.. works beautifully on both.. I was reluctant at first to purchase it thinking oh its only 2 oz for 10-12 bucks plus shipping.. but that 2oz lasts forever.hardly have a dent in mine and I use it daily..only need a little bit..it is great on hair and skin.. you will be so pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This product smells awful, just nasty.  I usually use shea butter on my clean feet, before bed and then wear socks to bed.  The odor from the shea butter lingered on the socks and I could smell it when I was sorting the dirty laundry.  I threw the unused portion away.  I have used shea butter for years.  I use the de-luxe 100% pure shea butter with lavender oil and Palmers Shea Butter with vitamin E, so I am familiar with the texture and odor of shea butter. BTW, the Palmers product and the de-luxe product are both excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this product!. I use it on my hands, elbows, knees, face and even hair every morning. I&#x27;m delighted that it&#x27;s so natural and even more so that it&#x27;s fair trade! I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends and gifting it to family.</li>
    <li> This product lasts for ages, has little to no smell, and no harmful additives.  It is very thick, so I tend to only use it at night.  It is the ONLY moisturizer that seems to work through the winter - I use it on my hands, lips, face, everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a smooth, easily absorbed cream for heels, elbows, any place that needs TLC. Shea butter is wonderful and this is the best form of it I have found.</li>
    <li> I work with my hands, and they are always in water.  I discovered this butter  after I&#x27;d started a new baking job, and my hands were cracked and raw. It was the miracle I was looking for.  It healed my chapped hands, and I love the deep, rich natural scent.  I&#x27;ve gone through several jars.  I use it on my hands, my feet, and lips.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> High Quality but you can find better for cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is favorite shea butter of mine, mild without being stripped of it&#x27;s natural properties entirely.  It mixes well with jojoba and is great for skin and hair.  BUT, Vitacost uses huge amounts of plastic wrap and an oversized box to get it to the customer, no regard at all for using our planet&#x27;s resources widely.  Get the product, and complain to Vitacost to make some changes.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. I love it! The quality is amazing and I love that it is a fair trade product. I would recommend highly and would purchase is as gifts as well.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It melts with the warmth of the hand and then just slides over skin like butter, leaving it with a sof feeling which is not at all greasy or heavy. It also works wonderfully for the hair, when the tips are a bit coarse.</li>
    <li> I really like this company and this shea butter is wonderful quality. It&#x27;s white with a vary mild scent and it comes in a glass jar. I have extremely sensitive skin that runs in my family, particularly on my father&#x27;s side. That being said I know exactly what my skin will do as I age LOL. We have oily/ dry combo skin that is very prone to breakouts (even into adulthood) and rashes. One good thing is that we do not scar easily and do not get many wrinkles... the only plus side. With that being said, shea butter actually worked rather well. But I have had to adjust the usage and dosage a million times because if I use it too often I break out and if I leave too much time in between usages I breakout due to dryness. What I have found works for me is to use this product only at night... and a little bit goes a looong way. It&#x27;s very calming and soothing. BUT before applying a tiny less than a pea size amount I need to wash, exfoliate, and apply a sulfur mask. (I recommend Vic&#x27;s washcloths and De La Cruz sulfur ointment 10%) So basically if you have skin like me, you just need to really watch your skin and adjust accordingly as annoying as it might be. Be sue to use a toothpick to remove the shea butter from the jar so as not to contaminate it with your fingers. Then rub it between your fingers so it melts before applying it to your face. If you plan to use it for your HAIR, also use a small amount. It is a great conditioner but you will need to wash your hair frequently as it can make it look greasy. Also, I do plan to experiment with sulfur powder and will try mixing a tiny pinch of it with the shea butter to see if I can skip the sulfur mask step. Best of luck to all!</li>
    <li> Great product! The Shea butter has a very natural earthy smell , which I love, and I use it to seal moisture into my hair</li>
    <li> This is great stuff....This prevents you from getting wrinkles of so reason.  Also for whoever suffers from dandruff this the right cure for it........</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviews saying that it smells awful, it smells like shea butter is supposed to - nutty, sweet, and smokey. It&#x27;s very hard, which unrefined shea butter is supposed to, dark yellow/tan, and melts beautifully into skin. This is readily available at Whole Foods near me, which is why I picked it up when I found out that Now Foods makes only refined shea butter.</li>
