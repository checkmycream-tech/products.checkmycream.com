      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ok but probably will not buy it again.</li>
      <li>Both my friend and I love this product.</li>
      <li>If your in it for the long haul to be rewarded with amazing results, this is it!!!</li>
      <li>The pump on top makes it easy to use.  </li>
      <li>as in you &#x27;look at me I bruise easily&#x27; :) ...</li>
      <li>Good product it really works well.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things!</li>
      <li>and of course tanning beds and the beach have &amp;#34;ruined&amp;#34; my skin ... I surface bruise easily ...</li>
      <li>I love the clean feeling of this fragrant-free lotion.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t bruise as easily  </li>
      <li>Love it, so far so good.</li>
      <li>Lo and behold, after a minute or two (kind of a while, really) or working it into my hands and onto my stomach, I was pleased to find my skin was baby smooth and silky but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It hydrates my hands very well and there is nice firming effect.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only ever experienced this with clinque&#x27;s moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This stuff makes my face really smooth.</li>
      <li>I used this on my arms just once yesterday morning and this morning, my arms still feel smooth and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>It is light enought to wear under my makeup.</li>
      <li>to dispense and great for dry, wintery skin without being greasy.</li>
      <li>nothing special full of chemicals</li>
      <li>Now i will order it later on since collagen is good to help skin aging</li>
      <li>but I guess I&#x27;ll keep shopping for a good basic collagen.</li>
      <li>No bad smell at all.  </li>
      <li>i love the product and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>I like how quickly the skin absorbs it.</li>
      <li>When I use this they seen to clear up quicker and not so brilliant red.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly and not greasy.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>This is the very first thing I put on my skin after cleansing.  </li>
      <li>This product is super soft with a very light if almost no scent.</li>
      <li>At first it goes on nicely, absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling soft</li>
      <li>Very soothing after a derma roller session or exfoliation, although it uses mineral oil i do believe the ingredients are of high quality because it really has had an affect on my skin in a positive way, also its an amazing deal, will be repurchasing!</li>
      <li>Now, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that I do quite a bit of exercise and have a high-protein high-fat diet, so that is probably synergistically working with the hydrolyzed collagen to help heal and synthesize proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ve read the reviews about how effective this product is but after using daily (twice or 3 times a day)</li>
      <li>I have my own regimen for cleansing my face, which contributes to the overall process of my skin clearing up; adding this into my cleansing routines has been the X factor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>But if you want to save some money Jergens makes a collagen lotion too that is just as good and half the price, they call it skin firming lotion.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipment and delivery.</li>
      <li>Smooth, not a strong smell, feels great and soaks right in with no residue left.  </li>
      <li>I love that it comes in a pump but reading the description as a &amp;#34;post treatment&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin rescue&amp;#34; is highly inflated as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re obsessed with keeping your skin &#x27;s health and beauty as I am , it&#x27;s a great product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product it really works well.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday... It makes your face so soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night on my face I&#x27;ve noticed a difference so far but I think it&#x27;s really too soon to know if its really working let&#x27;s give it a few more weeks</li>
    <li> It was just ok, I prefer the coconut lotion</li>
    <li> Really like this PRODUCT. Good</li>
    <li> This product feels great and it has a thickness to it that stays on all day.  I use the lotion twice a day and I use a needling roller twice a week after the product has been applied.  I am looking forward to seeing my results!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My husband uses it on his arms for bruising and it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This lotion give me the worst skin reaction ever! I have no allergies, never in my life I have had an allergic reaction to anything but Once I used I broke up in hives they where so itchy, I couldn&#x27;t find the expiration date anywhere so I found that very suspicious.</li>
    <li> I mix this with the same brands CoQ10. It absorbs very well and isn&#x27;t heavy, greasy or makes your skin oily. I&#x27;m 27yrs old and noticed a few wrinkles coming in and uneven skin time. I wanted to take some preventive measures and after month of use my skin is SUPER soft, even completion, and those wrinkles almost don&#x27;t exist. If your looking for a skin &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; for more mature ladies with instant gratification, this isn&#x27;t for you. If your in it for the long haul to be rewarded with amazing results, this is it!!!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, too soon to really see a difference but I like the way it makes my skin feel so I give it 2 thumbs up 👍👍😃</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY TRY IT OUT YET, BUT I DID PUT IT ON MY HANDS THAT WERE VERY DRY AND IT IS VERY SOOTHING TO THE SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> a good lotion...feels very good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! My skin feels amazing after I apply. Not greasy and no scent which I prefer. Not sure on the long term effects yet but seems promising that it will make a difference with sun damage that I have from tanning in a tanning bed for years.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  Love it!!  Smooth, not a strong smell, feels great and soaks right in with no residue left.  I feel great using it and will continue to order it and use it happily.  Great price too for the size.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I use this all over after my shower. My skin feels tighter than ever. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on this product but the brand because I had order it by mistake.  I mean to order coconut oil which was great.  Now i will order it later on since collagen is good to help skin aging</li>
    <li> Just plain moisturizer, nothing special because I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. .</li>
    <li> not sure if working. purchased for belly to tighten skin after kids</li>
    <li> So happy with this cream.  My skin is thin on my arms, I get bruise like places  reddish blue splotches.  When I use this they seen to clear up quicker and not so brilliant red.  This also helps my nails to look better.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipment and delivery. Thank you! Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> Just started using it and see results</li>
    <li> Very soothing after a derma roller session or exfoliation, although it uses mineral oil i do believe the ingredients are of high quality because it really has had an affect on my skin in a positive way, also its an amazing deal, will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I love this.  It isn&#x27;t greasy. I feel like I can actually tell it is seeping into my pores and moisturizing. I&#x27;ve only ever experienced this with clinque&#x27;s moisturizer.  It is light enought to wear under my makeup. Can&#x27;t say enough good things!</li>
    <li> I have yet to see a change in my skin. I have been using this over a month and it&#x27;s ok but probably will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This has worked really well for me.  I don&#x27;t use this product for my face, but for my body, since I&#x27;ve recently had a significant weight loss and was worried about loose skin.  Thankfully, I can actually notice the difference in firmness in some of my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells nice, but not overpowering.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, either, which makes it a nice change from some of my previous lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor problem I had with it was getting the pump to work, but that only took about six minutes to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this product again and recommend it to anyone looking to firm up the skin of their body.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Working well.</li>
    <li> No noted difference in firming but it does keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I buy this lotion regularly...that says a lot!</li>
    <li> I ve read the reviews about how effective this product is but after using daily (twice or 3 times a day) I didnt see any visible results, waste of  money, any cheap cream at the dollar store would do the same.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. I used this on my arms just once yesterday morning and this morning, my arms still feel smooth and hydrated.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Big Lots for $5.50. This stuff makes my face really smooth. I wash my face at night before bedtime and I apply this lotion and my skin has been smother than usual. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a very good cream.  My skin feels softer and look healthier. With no doubt I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my face and it broke out. This is unusual as I am 66 and don&#x27;t have particular sensitive skin. I use it on the rest of my body with no problems.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased w/collagen skin rescue product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has a noticeable change.  Leaving a much smoother, softer feel.</li>
    <li> It comes with the dispenser broken</li>
    <li> Just started using but my skin looks and feels softer</li>
    <li> i was looking for something to help firm my skin.  i love the product and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> it makes my face feel great.</li>
    <li> If I could give this cream a half a star less, I would give it a 2.5 instead of 3. It came promptly and no probs with the shipping and the jar was perfectly sealed. However, I&#x27;m more than a little disappointed that this cream is NOT all that hydrating or firming. At first it goes on nicely, absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling soft but that&#x27;s where it ends. After a short while my face felt irritated, less moisturized and somehow drier. I&#x27;m also applying it to the backs of my hands and like my face, soft at first but very quickly, loses any hydration it briefly has. I love that it comes in a pump but reading the description as a &amp;#34;post treatment&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skin rescue&amp;#34; is highly inflated as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I wanted and need a cream that moisturizes longer and truly firms the skin. For me, this definitely isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Good lotion. Does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is fragrance free!!!  It is nice and thick and smooths on well!!  This is a standing order for me, but will definitely check with my local Big Lots.</li>
    <li> Not seeing a lot of results yet, but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over how great this stuff is. My hands look brand new and my loose skin on my stomach is healing faster than ever. Now, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that I do quite a bit of exercise and have a high-protein high-fat diet, so that is probably synergistically working with the hydrolyzed collagen to help heal and synthesize proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, after 7 years, I&#x27;m making real progress on my loose skin, and my apparently hydrophobic hands are much healthier than they have been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression upon application was that it was going to be too greasy and leave a residue, but my confidence was bolstered by the memory of other reviews that said it absorbed very well. Lo and behold, after a minute or two (kind of a while, really) or working it into my hands and onto my stomach, I was pleased to find my skin was baby smooth and silky but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far. I did notice that my face seems to turn red whenever I apply it there, so there may be potential for skin reactions in some people. I never got anything worse than a slight warm feeling and flushing, and that may have just been from the rubbing.</li>
    <li> normal everyday lotion nothing special full of chemicals</li>
    <li> It really works and I highly doubted it would make a difference. Problem is it has a Big Lots 5.99 price on it and I paid double than that.  Went to Big Lots and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
    <li> I am 59 and saw results in 1 day!  My face looks fuller.  My sister also tried it and saw results in 1 day.  Best skin product ever!</li>
    <li> This is a great skin maintenance lotion. If you are not getting any younger and wants move forward gracefully with youthful skin or simply maintain what you have this lotion should be on your dresser or on your list to purchase. ( :</li>
    <li> Great for difficult dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Especially since it has the pump.  I mix other stuff in it sometimes, just because I need to use something else also. And it works great.  No bad smell at all.  I hate perfume in anything I use.  This fits the bill!  Seller is great and FAST!!</li>
    <li> Generous size and fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to dispense and great for dry, wintery skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  still ashy some times</li>
    <li> Beware!  This product is made with cheap, counterproductive and potentially harmful ingredients - Mineral oil is the second ingredient, which stays on the skin surface and impedes proper oxygenation and penetration of other ingredients.  And an $80.00 retail price??</li>
    <li> Love it I cant believe it works so fast!!!!! Stretch Marks GONE !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product and over time the results are observed</li>
    <li> I live this cream and will buy it again</li>
    <li> Pump arrived damaged. Not using it as much because it&#x27;s a pain to use without a functional pump.</li>
    <li> Been using this for two weeks now and am finding it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin enough. It feels good, not to greasy but after it settles my skin is crapey and dry looking.</li>
    <li> Love it! Absorbs quickly and makes your skin crazy soft! But if you want to save some money Jergens makes a collagen lotion too that is just as good and half the price, they call it skin firming lotion.</li>
    <li> Not good for the face at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out so BAD after two uses.  I was hopeful but I guess I&#x27;ll keep shopping for a good basic collagen.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice! I&#x27;m using this on my post-partum skin and its bouncing back nicely after my c-section and sudden 40lb weight loss, lol!</li>
    <li> This is a great lite moisturizer. It dries quickly and not greasy. I did not give it 5  stars because I thought it would be a bit heavier. I have very dry skin so this absorbs fast and after a couple of hours it feels like I need to apply more. This would be great for someone with oily skin to use. But for the amount you get you can&#x27;t beat the price and the pump in the jar makes for great application.</li>
    <li> Top ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
    <li> ok .... just not magical ... ha</li>
    <li> This is the very first thing I put on my skin after cleansing.  And...I am using it on my arms and neck, too.  It is a collagen builder, and does a great job of protecting my skin.  Love it.  The pump on top makes it easy to use.  My husband has begun using it, too!  :)</li>
    <li> Love it, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I like how non greasy it is.</li>
    <li> Product received sealed in package and delivered with 2 other items but the top of the pump is broken.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  After a recent visit to a Dermatologist I was told my &amp;#34;exposure&amp;#34; to the Sun ... and of course tanning beds and the beach have &amp;#34;ruined&amp;#34; my skin ... I surface bruise easily ... as in you &#x27;look at me I bruise easily&#x27; :) ... Dr. said there is nothing I can do to reverse this.  I then did a bit of research and it seems Collagen was recommended a lot.  I ordered this product and Collagen Pills ... I don&#x27;t take the pills as prescribed but I USE this EVERY NIGHT .... FIRST my &#x27;bruises&#x27; have almost gone away SECOND I don&#x27;t bruise as easily  THIRD my skin is not dry and flaky as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a &amp;#34;standing order&amp;#34; for me.  LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 55 year old male, living on an Island and working outside at an Airport so I get A LOT of exposure to the Sun.</li>
    <li> It is a nice and makes a hand smooth beautiful</li>
    <li> I used this product on a daily basis and didn&#x27;t see results....</li>
    <li> Non greasy and my results were noticible after one week. If you&#x27;re obsessed with keeping your skin &#x27;s health and beauty as I am , it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Nice feel and no funny smell. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference, I will most likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Good skin cream.. Works well to soften skin</li>
    <li> Best costumer service! Best product!!!!</li>
    <li> Ugggghhh was excited to try this lotion cause the reviews were so good but the pump wont dispense lotion...what a pain!! Idk whether to send back and replace or just deal with it....decisions decisions. First product ive bought from this particular company kinda bummed</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought,  and it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like it was $80 before don&#x27;t be fooled by Mark downs on here</li>
    <li> Both my friend and I love this product.</li>
    <li> I like how quickly the skin absorbs it. I have sun damage and am noticing an improvement.  Ann</li>
    <li> The size of this lotion is great for the price and it works well. It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. I plan on buying the AHA version of this as well.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t diminished the creepy skin on my arms at all.  No better than any other lotion I have tried.</li>
    <li> love it a must have for the weather we are having this works great</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t review products because I doubt their effectiveness. I&#x27;ve been using Collagen Skin Rescue for about a month now. Words cannot describe what a godsend this product is - still using it; I apply after I wash my face, in the mornings before work, and evenings after a shower. I consider myself to have very sensitive and dry skin. This product simply works. I have my own regimen for cleansing my face, which contributes to the overall process of my skin clearing up; adding this into my cleansing routines has been the X factor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Collagen Skin Rescue from Concept Laboratories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Your experience from mine and I&#x27;m honestly not getting paid to write any of this.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for any collagen cream with affordable price, and this product was perfect!  Its jumbo size makes me happy.  I have started to use it as hand cream and I feel great!  It hydrates my hands very well and there is nice firming effect.  I love the clean feeling of this fragrant-free lotion.  Someone was mentioning about broken dispenser but, try twist it to opposite way couple of times.  It works great!</li>
    <li> This product is super soft with a very light if almost no scent. Not sure if it&#x27;s helping yet but I&#x27;ll update when I am a couple of weeks into using it.</li>
    <li> It just seems like lotion. I ordered one of each product, Collagen, Retinol and AHA. They all smell the same and feel the same and dont seem to be any different except that one of the jugs pump does not work</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m a convert - I will be living in this stuff.</li>
    <li> TIGHT, FIRM and smooth skin. My tone over all is lighter and clear</li>
    <li> ❤ Wonderful Product ❤</li>
