      <li>I love TIGI S factor Shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling moisturized and healthy, plus it&#x27;s sulfate-free.</li>
      <li>: I wish Amazon was more diligent when it comes to listing ingredients of all products.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, my hair is time and frizzy</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It would cost a lot more if one was to buy it at a beauty shop.</li>
      <li>I love it and will buy it again...</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s more drying</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells fantastic (sweet, kind of like a strawberry popsicle)</li>
      <li>Overpriced and nothing special!</li>
      <li>I love the rich texture and pleasing scent as well.</li>
      <li>I bought it because of paraben, sulfate free but may try another brand.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth as silk and shines and has body.  </li>
      <li>I loved this shampoo, it leaves my hair (which is fine and oily) feeling SO soft and it smells like sweet strawberries.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very good for colored hair, and after using hotel shampoos which were supposed to be from spa&#x27;s, my hair was becoming limp.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this shampoo/conditioner in my saloon for $27+ each.</li>
      <li>A few years ago stylist said don&#x27;t use conditioner...was great, able to style, etc.</li>
      <li>I make sure to really work this into my hair and rinse well.</li>
      <li>I know other people have had great experiences with this shampoo, so maybe it&#x27;s just my hair (fine, straight</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I bought at store!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for sending so quickly!</li>
      <li>(I agree that it isn&#x27;t the biggest bottle in the world but still is worth it and</li>
      <li>It not only smells great but definitely helps my hair to stay under control.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works wonderfully for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
      <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t really need to flat iron it when I use this, as I mostly did that to get rid of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
      <li>As with the Smoothing Lusterizer that S Factor sells as well, you can really get a grip on your hair.</li>
      <li>These products really work to fix all that as well as boosts my hairs shine.</li>
      <li>But really made no difference.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, short blonde highlighted hair but lots of it.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable to me as I dont use much even w/ my long hair.</li>
      <li>but I was really surprised.  </li>
      <li>I have long fine loose curly hair and this shampoo along with the conditioner work wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>Hoped this would help smooth and tame the frizzies.</li>

    <li> I have very fine, short blonde highlighted hair but lots of it. A few years ago stylist said don&#x27;t use conditioner...was great, able to style, etc. but when I started using this my hair was frizzy after one bottle. Maybe it&#x27;s more drying and I need the conditioner, idk. I bought it because of paraben, sulfate free but may try another brand.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo--sweet and fruity. It leaves my hair feeling moisturized and healthy, plus it&#x27;s sulfate-free. It&#x27;s a little pricey so I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> My hair-stylist recommended this shampoo and I have used nothing else since. Absolutely great product.</li>
    <li> I love TIGI S factor Shampoo &amp; conditioner. I just wish they sold it in a larger size with a pump.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonderfully for my thick, coarse hair. We have had a lot of humidity lately and my hair frizzes. With this shampoo, my problem is under control. I love the rich texture and pleasing scent as well.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner set! It not only smells great but definitely helps my hair to stay under control. As with the Smoothing Lusterizer that S Factor sells as well, you can really get a grip on your hair. I have really bad static in the winter as well as flyaways, split ends and dryness. These products really work to fix all that as well as boosts my hairs shine. Get these! (I agree that it isn&#x27;t the biggest bottle in the world but still is worth it and way cheaper @ Amazon then it is at the salon!)</li>
    <li> Hoped this would help smooth and tame the frizzies. But really made no difference. Average shampoo. Hard to squeeze out. Won&#x27;t buy again, will try something else.</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Is a good shampo, but not for my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle.  It&#x27;s really, really difficult for me to squeeze out the shampoo.  So I bought the larger bottle with pump.  This shampoo is very good for colored hair, and after using hotel shampoos which were supposed to be from spa&#x27;s, my hair was becoming limp.  So I went back to this shampoo and my hair has gotten back its life.</li>
    <li> My product was expired based on the date printed on the bottle.  It does not seem the same quality as what I buy at my salon.</li>
    <li> I have long fine loose curly hair and this shampoo along with the conditioner work wonders for my hair. My hair is soft, my naturals curls perfect and flyways are at a minimum.  I make sure to really work this into my hair and rinse well. The price is reasonable to me as I dont use much even w/ my long hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this shampoo/conditioner in my saloon for $27+ each. What a great deal online.  This is my sister&#x27;s and my favorite shampoo/conditioner set.  We also love the illuminizer product.</li>
    <li> When I wash my hair with any other shampoo, it&#x27;s frizz city.  I mean no two hairs go in the same direction, and little frizzes stick out all over my head.  It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t even want to leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wash my hair with this, there is not one frizz in site.  My hair is smooth as silk and shines and has body.  It&#x27;s almost like I flat-ironed it.  In fact, I don&#x27;t really need to flat iron it when I use this, as I mostly did that to get rid of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they put in this shampoo but it works.  I am wondering what to do with all my other shampoos, now that I&#x27;ve found this.  I don&#x27;t want to use anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well too.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I was really surprised.  My hair is totally different when I use this.  It&#x27;s like I had a Brazilian almost.  Love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edt: I wish Amazon was more diligent when it comes to listing ingredients of all products.  This has an incomplete list.  The descripton says it contains pro vitamin B5, jojoba and avocado oil.  But when I looked at the ingredient list, it&#x27;s like it got cut off before the end.  These ingredients aren&#x27;t mentioned here.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over three years and it never disappoints. I buy this size for travel and the larger size for at home</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo, it leaves my hair (which is fine and oily) feeling SO soft and it smells like sweet strawberries. However it was supposed to arrive on a Wednesday and didn&#x27;t arrive till the next Monday which was much later than the conditioner.</li>
    <li> It made my hair rough like a torn rope. Used it couple of time and had to throw. Won&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo! Probably the best I&#x27;ve found. The conditioner that goes with it.. is perfect also. Does wonders on my dry, thin, brittle hair. Thanks for sending so quickly!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I bought at store!  Works great and makes my hair silky smooth!!  Yes, I would recommend purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, my hair is time and frizzy Ann&#x27;s this shampoo helps a lot. I love it and will buy it again...</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone with hair that is highlighted or bleached.  It would cost a lot more if one was to buy it at a beauty shop.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and nothing special!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells fantastic (sweet, kind of like a strawberry popsicle) but unfortunately it ended up drying my hair out.  I know other people have had great experiences with this shampoo, so maybe it&#x27;s just my hair (fine, straight, highlighted) but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, depending on where you store this in your shower, the top collects a lot of water.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have used this stuff for a while now. Definitely beat other brands, especially ones that are twice the price.</li>
