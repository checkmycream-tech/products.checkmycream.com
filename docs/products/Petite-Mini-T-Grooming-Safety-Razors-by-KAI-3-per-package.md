      <li>It is super easy to cut  yourself.  </li>
      <li>My heavy, greasy Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream works great with these razors.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really effective for tiny areas.</li>
      <li>I tried them dry and scratched my brow line pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size.</li>
      <li>I use it for upper eyelids and eyebrows, and my friend said it&#x27;s also great for facial hair.</li>
      <li>Good for edging and provides better control when trimming at angles than a larger conventional razor does.</li>
      <li>They dulled out very fast and didn&#x27;t work as well as another brand I found.</li>
      <li>These are wonderful for face hair especially eyebrows as they are a small size and manueverable..  </li>
      <li>But once I stated using soap they worked really well!</li>
      <li>I expected something better for my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>And she wants me to order them for her.</li>

      <li>I had high hopes for these for bikini line areas.</li>
      <li>These are definitely for shaving very small areas only, but for eyebrows, they&#x27;re fantastic and I am delighted to see them on Amazon Prime.  </li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;ve ever shaved with a normal razor, you can handle these.</li>
      <li>Got these to shave under my nose, trim my eyebrows, and keep my unibrow away, sinve my razor is too big to get those areas very well.</li>
      <li>Now I do have sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>The razor seems pretty thin and delicate so if you have thicker hair to shave, especially if you&#x27;re going for the bikini line or just some general manscaping these might not be the best thing for you.</li>
      <li>These razors really live up to their name of &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;... they&#x27;re a single blade, and super tiny (maybe 9 mm?).</li>
      <li>She likes them although they become dull pretty quick.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to hold, and don&#x27;t block the area you&#x27;re trying to get to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be getting these over any other eyebrow razor!</li>
      <li>I have been using this Japanese razor since high school back in China.</li>
      <li>Not as effective as I hoped, a little dull.</li>
      <li>The same rules apply (like, clearly, no dry shaving allowed unless you want scrapes and razor burn...).</li>
      <li>other razors, you need to prepare/calm your skin to prevent razor burn, and no, you don&#x27;t shave your dry skin or keep a razor in the bathroom for a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> These razors really live up to their name of &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;... they&#x27;re a single blade, and super tiny (maybe 9 mm?). This being said, I was kind of petrified to use them. However, if you&#x27;ve ever shaved with a normal razor, you can handle these. The same rules apply (like, clearly, no dry shaving allowed unless you want scrapes and razor burn...). They&#x27;re really effective for tiny areas.</li>
    <li> These eyebrow razors are amazing and make quick work of taming my unruly eyebrows. They shave close enough that it looks like my eyebrows have been waxed, and all with no nicks or cuts. They&#x27;re easy to hold, and don&#x27;t block the area you&#x27;re trying to get to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be getting these over any other eyebrow razor!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what I was taking for granted until the set of these razors that I brought from Asia had to be replaced and I tried using the Personna razors  [[ASIN:B002RD182M Personna Eyebrow Trimmer and Shaper for Men and Women]]) and ended up screwing up my eyebrows and cutting myself.  These Kai T razors are small enough to get into delicate spaces like the upper eyelid, and the T design makes it easy to maintain a safe angle and good skin contact without much effort and without getting in the way.  These are definitely for shaving very small areas only, but for eyebrows, they&#x27;re fantastic and I am delighted to see them on Amazon Prime.  Also check out the straight version ([[ASIN:B000FQN0KQ Petite Mini-L Grooming Safety Razors by KAI - 3 per package]]) which are nice as well.  I only wish Amazon would offer the set of one T and one L razor that we had in Asia.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Japanese razor since high school back in China. Our local cosmetic stores sell it for about a third of this price. It was so cheap so I just kept changing it every month or so. Anyway, it&#x27;s great to find it online now. If you&#x27;re not sure of normal size razors for face, try this one. I use it for upper eyelids and eyebrows, and my friend said it&#x27;s also great for facial hair. It only has one blade but I don&#x27;t think you need three/four-blades for facial hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other razors, you need to prepare/calm your skin to prevent razor burn, and no, you don&#x27;t shave your dry skin or keep a razor in the bathroom for a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when using it on eyelids. I don&#x27;t use soap when shaving around the eyes. My heavy, greasy Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream works great with these razors.</li>
    <li> They get dull after 1 use</li>
    <li> Great razors, but it is easy to cut oneself with these.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for face hair especially eyebrows as they are a small size and manueverable..  I took a chance that they existed and bought these.  I have been very satisfied with the result.</li>
    <li> Now I know where to but these!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these for bikini line areas. Not what I expected. They dulled out very fast and didn&#x27;t work as well as another brand I found. Hate is a strong word which might go a little far but they are not good. Try &amp;#34;Noxzema Bikini Plus Shave and Trim Disposable Shavers, 3 Count&amp;#34; instead!!</li>
    <li> I expected something better for my eyebrows. I don&#x27;t think they stay as sharp as they should. That&#x27;s all I have to write.</li>
    <li> Got these to shave under my nose, trim my eyebrows, and keep my unibrow away, sinve my razor is too big to get those areas very well. These work perfectly, not a single cut from them, but if you are buying these for shaving somewhere other than your face I can see how they might not perform all that well.

    <li> Not as effective as I hoped, a little dull.</li>
    <li> Great razors. I use it for personal grooming. Stay sharp and have a small cover to protect blade when not in use. Just the right size.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for trimming eyebrows and around mouth.  I also like the safety feature.  They can be resuse several times.</li>
    <li> I like these razors but am only going to give the a 4 because the description should state use soap or lotion!  I tried them dry and scratched my brow line pretty good.  Now I do have sensitive skin...so those of you that do beware!  But once I stated using soap they worked really well!</li>
    <li> Good for edging and provides better control when trimming at angles than a larger conventional razor does. The only drawback is that the razors are very sharp and usually leave the user with small cuts the first handful of times they are used.</li>
    <li> It is tiny but not safe.  Be careful!  It is super easy to cut  yourself.  It makes my skin red and puffy.  I don&#x27;t like it but I did not find other better products yet.  Well, I will not buy it again.  It is just one-time lesson.  It is cute but it doesn&#x27;t work well.  The good comments misled me.  Thus, I only gave 2 stars to warn other buyers.  For this price, this razor is not safe at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised on Jan.29.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate likes them. And she wants me to order them for her. I guess I need to update my comments. She uses them for her chin. She likes them although they become dull pretty quick. Anyway, wish the shipping cost can be lower. Anyway, I ordered some for her. I guess they are not for everyone but for some people. They are great!</li>
    <li> Not great. Not horrible.</li>
