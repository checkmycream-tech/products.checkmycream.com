### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
      <li>Great price, easily ordered, thank you!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nicely lifted at the roots creating volume.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product also has a  bit of a hair (not the cosmetology term ) stiffener effect, kind of like how hair spray works but not as pronounced or sticky, etc.  </li>
      <li>I know people that this worked for, but I lost more hair when I used it.  </li>
      <li>ok I used this kit system 6.</li>
      <li>I have been using Nioxin for maybe 15 or more years.  </li>
      <li>A bonus for me was the sunscreen in the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product since the top of my scalp has thinned a lot and the sunscreen makes a difference..  </li>
      <li>I have used Nioxin shampoo for many years and that wasn&#x27;t Nioxin shampoo in the bottles I received.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started rogaine, but it takes a while for growth, so I bought Nioxin after reading many reviews.</li>
      <li>&amp;  I don&#x27;t see my scalp like I was &amp; people are commenting on how healthy my hair is looking again.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34; works the best for actually promoting new hair growth, but it is no silver bullet.  </li>
      <li>Already, hair shedding reduced significantly.</li>
      <li>It clean my hair and scalp and leaves no residue, which limits hair growth on my thinning scalp.  </li>
      <li>Nice starter set, on my fourth week still waiting to see results.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;system 6&amp;#34; is my current favorite.  </li>
      <li>I have white hair, thinning on the top, with some curls.  </li>
      <li>This is my first day using the product</li>
      <li>Im thinking pretty positive about it.</li>
      <li>My scalp feels refreshingly clean and my hair soft like cotton</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t have 80s hair today, just soft full curls.</li>
      <li>I began again two years ago and some of my all white hair began to return more color as well as the incremental increase in new hair growth.  </li>
      <li>Straight up hoax</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much fuller my roots look.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>One more point, the products don&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these products to anyone experiencing hair thinning or loss.</li>
      <li>The conditioner uses ingredients which leave my hair soft and manageable but also promotes cappillary blood flow to promote new hair growth.  </li>
      <li>I definitely will continue to use &amp; very excited to see what my hair will look like in a few months.</li>
      <li>Its not a super fast process, but progress is being made!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been experience hair shedding due to high stress.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I know people that this worked for, but I lost more hair when I used it.  Went back to my Pantene and hair loss was minimal again.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  My hair is looking fuller and I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 3 months.  There seems to be some improvement, but I think it is too soon to judge.</li>
    <li> I believe this helped stopped my hair from shedding. I recently had a child and my hair was falling out pretty bad. It did however make my hair really really dry. I would suggest only using this once a week. It hasn&#x27;t been enough time to tell if my hair is growing but Im thinking pretty positive about it.</li>
    <li> It sucks don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!! Straight up hoax</li>
    <li> Very poor! I have used Nioxin shampoo for many years and that wasn&#x27;t Nioxin shampoo in the bottles I received.  I will never order from there again.</li>
    <li> My scalp feels refreshingly clean and my hair soft like cotton but im not sure if it&#x27;s promoting hair growth. Only been using it for about a month. He does seem to reduce shedding a little. Washing once a week vs daily.</li>
    <li> It is supposed to help with thinning hair so I keep using it but the scalp treatment dries out the hair.  I do like the shampoo and conditioner but cant say that it is doign what it is supposed to do.  And it costs a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This is my first day using the product and I gave it a five star rating for now, I&#x27;ll try to update in a month. I&#x27;ve been put under general anesthesia four times in past three years, my hair just keeps getting thinner with every surgery. I&#x27;ve started rogaine, but it takes a while for growth, so I bought Nioxin after reading many reviews. I can&#x27;t believe how much fuller my roots look. I can&#x27;t see my scalp. I&#x27;ve got long curly hair and I&#x27;m in my 30s and I&#x27;ve been proofing my hair to cover how thin my hair is, I don&#x27;t have 80s hair today, just soft full curls. I&#x27;m so happy! Hope it lasts..</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for a week. Already, hair shedding reduced significantly. There is barely anything on the brush while before I would loose lots of strands every time. I&#x27;ve been experience hair shedding due to high stress. I use all three products every time I wash my hair. I wash my hair almost every day. I&#x27;ll keep using it and will try to remember to update my review. One more point, the products don&#x27;t weigh down my hair. It&#x27;s nicely lifted at the roots creating volume. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Nice starter set, on my fourth week still waiting to see results. still not sure why shampoo bottles are larger than conditioner bottles...???</li>
    <li> I have always been a Nioxin fan.  After a couple of months of use my stylist said she could see some hair thickening.  Its not a super fast process, but progress is being made!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month and have not seen a difference.  Also sometimes I find my where my hair line and forehead meet it gets extremely irritated. .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to help with &amp;#34;chemo hair&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Due to hormonal changes my hair had started to thin &amp; noticeably falling out to the point of being very upsetting to me. I have only used this system for about 2 weeks now &amp; I have noticed drastic changes in my hair &amp;  I don&#x27;t see my scalp like I was &amp; people are commenting on how healthy my hair is looking again. My hair looks &amp; feels thicker, healthier &amp; has a lot of body &amp; volume. I would highly recommend these products to anyone experiencing hair thinning or loss. I also like buying from Amazon because the product is half the price of the salon. I definitely will continue to use &amp; very excited to see what my hair will look like in a few months.</li>
    <li> Great price, easily ordered, thank you!</li>
    <li> ok I used this kit system 6. after taken the only test.  My wife use system 2 and she said it work</li>
    <li> I have white hair, thinning on the top, with some curls.  I have been using Nioxin for maybe 15 or more years.  This &amp;#34;system 6&amp;#34; is my current favorite.  What I like about the product:  It clean my hair and scalp and leaves no residue, which limits hair growth on my thinning scalp.  The conditioner uses ingredients which leave my hair soft and manageable but also promotes cappillary blood flow to promote new hair growth.  Although my experience is this is minimal.  The &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34; works the best for actually promoting new hair growth, but it is no silver bullet.  There is limited scent with these products which I prefer. I have notice across time that the increase is small but noticeable.  In recent years I stopped using the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; because it is expensive.  I began again two years ago and some of my all white hair began to return more color as well as the incremental increase in new hair growth.  A bonus for me was the sunscreen in the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product since the top of my scalp has thinned a lot and the sunscreen makes a difference..  The &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; product also has a  bit of a hair (not the cosmetology term ) stiffener effect, kind of like how hair spray works but not as pronounced or sticky, etc.  I recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works yet, but the shampoo is a little drying for me.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  This is my second order and I will probably continue to order it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the thickness of my hair or any difference in the amount of hair falling out.  There isn&#x27;t enough conditioner to last as long as the shampoo, and the spray stuff is just like putting gel in your hair...dumb.</li>
    <li> Since I got these babies, my hair stopped falling off. Read the instructions carefully and when you apply it as it says on the box. You will see the difference in a few weeks.</li>
