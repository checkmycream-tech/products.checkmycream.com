### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This is the best brand of adhesive strips I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Best bandaids in the world.</li>
      <li>Coverlet makes the best band-aids ever!</li>
      <li>they are the best</li>
      <li>Coverlet was and is the best bandage on the market!</li>
      <li>They are the greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
      <li>These are a perfect size for the &amp;#34;owies&amp;#34; my hubby gets when he is working in the yard.  </li>
      <li>They breathe, they protect, and they&#x27;re possessed of the best adhesive in the business.  </li>
      <li>Great service and price.</li>
      <li>Adheres good and can do activities and work without</li>
      <li>This is a good quality procuct.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>My doctor always uses these adhesive strips and I liked the way they stayed on and their size.</li>
      <li>Plenty in the box which makes them a nice value.</li>
      <li>These are probably the most effective bandages I&#x27;ve ever encountered; they are flexible and they stay adhered to the skin until it is time to change dressings.</li>
      <li>great bandages, stick very well</li>
      <li>They do what they&#x27;re supposed to, and do it better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are okay.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d always remarked how much better at staying on these bandaids are than the BandAid brand ones are.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t better known or available.</li>
      <li>They stick well, peel off easily, the center does not adhere to the wound and best of all stretch.</li>
      <li>These are the most comfortable and easy to remove bandages you will ever encounter.</li>
      <li>Adhesive works fine.</li>
      <li>They are fantastic and stay until pulled off.</li>
      <li>So I was happy to finally find them here.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are probably good bandaids, but the description needs to clearly state that they are latex free vs. hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>Great band aids that adhere for a long time..</li>
      <li>These are absolutely the best adhesive bandages for small wounds, burns, abrasions.</li>
      <li>Far superior to standard brands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although they&#x27;re slightly more costly, the outperform competing products several times over.</li>
      <li>I pretty much use only Coverlet unless there aren&#x27;t any available at the time I need them,</li>
      <li>Hypoallergenic and &#x27;latex free&#x27; are two different things-</li>
      <li>They are large enough to cover a small to medium sore and do a good job at it.</li>
      <li>These bandaids are fantastic and stick to your skin while other&#x27;s come off .....</li>
      <li>After not healing well after a small surgery I had to wear a bandage to cover the wound for greater than a month.</li>
      <li>So beware sensitive skin folks!</li>
      <li>They are extremely comforftable and very conforming to irregular skin surfaces.</li>
      <li>I developed a terrible blistering allergic dermatitis in the perfect size and shape if the bandage needing corticosteroid treatment - and now that is still healing.</li>
      <li>Until I thought to do a search on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t think the general public could get this brand.  </li>

    <li> great bandages, stick very well</li>
    <li> i only use coverlet strips they are the best</li>
    <li> NOTHING works like a Coverlet bandage.  They breathe, they protect, and they&#x27;re possessed of the best adhesive in the business.  Will withstand several showers, don&#x27;t come off in dishwater, and don&#x27;t slip away when working hard.  Despite tenacity, when the strip is removed, there&#x27;s no problem with residual adhesive.  They do what they&#x27;re supposed to, and do it better than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they&#x27;re slightly more costly, the outperform competing products several times over.</li>
    <li> These are the most comfortable and easy to remove bandages you will ever encounter. After not healing well after a small surgery I had to wear a bandage to cover the wound for greater than a month. The doctor gave me these and I found them so soothing and comforting I searched them out here. Nothing compares. However, after long term exposure (1-1.5months on and off) I developed a terrible blistering allergic dermatitis in the perfect size and shape if the bandage needing corticosteroid treatment - and now that is still healing. So beware sensitive skin folks! For that reason they get only 3 stars rather than 5.</li>
    <li> I also like the smaller adhesive strips.  They are large enough to cover a small to medium sore and do a good job at it.</li>
    <li> These bandages are terrific. They stick well, peel off easily, the center does not adhere to the wound and best of all stretch. They are the greatest thing since sliced bread. I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t better known or available.</li>
    <li> I bought these because these are the brand that my doctor uses.  I&#x27;d always remarked how much better at staying on these bandaids are than the BandAid brand ones are.  Until I thought to do a search on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t think the general public could get this brand.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> the bandages do not stay down</li>

    <li> These are okay.  Pad is really small. Adhesive works fine. Plenty in the box which makes them a nice value.</li>
    <li> Coverlet was and is the best bandage on the market!</li>
    <li> My doctor always uses these adhesive strips and I liked the way they stayed on and their size. So I was happy to finally find them here. I used to carry one with me and show them to different pharmacies but no one ever carried them.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect size for the &amp;#34;owies&amp;#34; my hubby gets when he is working in the yard.  They cover a lot of &amp;#34;territory.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product! Adheres good and can do activities and work without the bandage fall off.  Is flexible and durable</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best adhesive bandages for small wounds, burns, abrasions. They are extremely comforftable and very conforming to irregular skin surfaces.</li>
    <li> had a allergic reaction to the adhesive.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality procuct. I have purchased other sizes by Coverlet and they are also second to none.</li>
    <li> These are probably the most effective bandages I&#x27;ve ever encountered; they are flexible and they stay adhered to the skin until it is time to change dressings.</li>
    <li> Hypoallergenic and &#x27;latex free&#x27; are two different things- I am allergic to the adhesive on the tape- our local drug store was out of the hypoallergenic bandaids so I bought these on line as I was running out while dealing with a wound-- sadly, I can not use them, even though I need them urgently, I will have to drive around tomorrow to find bandaids that I can use without my skin falling off.&lt;br /&gt; The box looked like someone re-taped it shut after being opened...&lt;br /&gt;They are probably good bandaids, but the description needs to clearly state that they are latex free vs. hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> Great service and price.</li>
    <li> Coverlet makes the best band-aids ever!</li>
    <li> Great band aids that adhere for a long time..</li>
    <li> The coverlet bandages worked quite well on the wounds after my husband&#x27;s biopsies were done on three lesions in April.</li>
    <li> Far superior to standard brands. Coverlets actually stick.</li>
    <li> These bandaids are fantastic and stick to your skin while other&#x27;s come off ..... You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am allergic to this adhesive...severe rash.  I understand from our dermatologist, this is not unusual.</li>
    <li> Best bandaids in the world.</li>
    <li> I pretty much use only Coverlet unless there aren&#x27;t any available at the time I need them,</li>
