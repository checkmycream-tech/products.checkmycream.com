<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s hair for 7 years now.  My hair stylist has been using it on my hair for the past 15 years. It is the best conditioner for permed or unpermed african american hair.  I have used it for both.  To retrieve the best results, you should apply the conditioner generously, comb it through, put on a condtioner cap and sit under a dryer for 15 minutes.  Then rinse out. If you do not have a dryer, just leave the conditioner in for an addtional 15 minutes before rinsing.  Be sure to still use a conditioner cap to capture the heat from your body.  Your hair will be soft and silky. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was a steal on Amazon!  Price right and they offered a much larger bottle than I can find in stores.</li>
    <li> One of the best products on the market. Received super fast.</li>
    <li> Everyone of all ethnicities knows that ALL KeraCare products are exceptional!!! Everyone would love to go to there local beauty store and purchase this line of products but unfortunately it is not available to us folk that do not have the gift of being a licensed beautician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that I did not recieve the product that is posted in the picture.  I received the tan bottle.  When I purchase something, I expect to receive what I paid for!!!! Thank you for your time.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very good, no matter which shampoo I use it makes my hair feel soft and managable. I have used Keracare for a while and had never used this particular conditioner and after hearing wonderful things about it, I am happy I did.</li>
    <li> Never a problem - And it is soo much cheaper to order through Amazon than buying in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hydrating &amp; moisturizing conditioners!!!!!!! I have been using &amp; purchasing this for about 7 years!!!!!</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling very soft and light.</li>
    <li> It is a  strengthening conditioner.  It did not make my hair soft. It made it hard. It works better for already naturally straight hair. I needed a softening conditioner for my course dry natural  African-American hair.</li>
    <li> Our beautician recommended this product line and I could not agree with her more.  It does what it promises to do.  Buy it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> Like how it my hair feel, smell nice also</li>
    <li> I love keracare hair products, they are great at nourishing and giving the hair the protein it needs to stay healthy and my hair always look great after using their hair products.</li>
    <li> great conditioner I mix it with coconut oil and honey together to  moisturizer my hair. leave hair soft and silky. would recommend to others</li>
    <li> This is not bomb!  It&#x27;s so thick that i can&#x27;t comb it thru my hair.  I put some Aussie Moist on it to comb thru it.  I&#x27;m going to use this up and stick with my 3 Min Aussie and Queen Helene Cholesterol.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my relaxed hair. The consistency is thin but it&#x27;s highly effective.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff the first time I used it. then it made my hair crazy greasy! I had to stop using it. I now just use the Avlon KeraCare Detangling Conditioning Mist.</li>
    <li> Will have to get used to the smell.  Smells a little like mango and musk, but I like the way it makes my hair feel.  Will probably buy again.  The only drawback is having to wait the minimum of 15 minutes.  Directions say to wait 15 to 30 mins with a plastic cap before rinsing.  Sometimes this can be inconvenient when you&#x27;re a busy mom on the go.</li>
    <li> This product compares to a leading creme conditioner in my opinion. Mu hair is on the dry side and this product worked very well leaving my hair soft and managable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it does a great job of adding moisture to my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d repurchase, because there are so many other deep conditioners that are also effective, but I may. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> GREAT DEAL! Will order again as needed!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair when I started having major shedding issues.  I love it.  I ordered it for my home use and have been completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> ALTHOUGH MY PRODUCT CAME TWO WEEKS LATE - IT WORKS GOOD TO HELP MY HAIR FROM SHEDDING. THE COMPANY ADDRESSED MY CONCERNS QUICKLY AND EVEN SENT ME FREE SHAMPOO.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is very good for my hair. My hair smell good and is not heavy but light and manageable.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this creamy conditioner. I&#x27;m a believer in the Keracure line of products especially for curly and unmanageable hair.  It really does help defining your curls, making your styles last longer and keeping you with great smelling hair.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE STUFF!!!  It smells awful and does NOT work!!!!  Also this retailer and the company that makes this expensive product would not take it back even though it has a money back guarantee!! ridiculous!!  the company would not take it back because I did not buy it directly from them, wow, what a great way to guarantee your product (sarcasm)!!</li>
    <li> this conditioner is just ok to me it kinda of smells to me but moisture wise it is ok. i have to add oil,honey,and other deep conditioners to make this work for my hair. by it self it is just mediocre. i love keracare products but this is not for me. i now use keracare dry and itchy scalp conditioner and it makes my hair feel soft and tingly.</li>
    <li> Every since I saw a lady review this conditioner on you tube, I&#x27;ve been in love with it!  Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anywhere...bu as long as there&#x27;s internet, we&#x27;ve never left in the dark!  This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used quite a few...my &amp;#34;african american&amp;#34; (4c) hair loves this!  I use it as a regular conditioner and a deep conditioner with steam.  Hope this review helps answer someone&#x27;s question!</li>
    <li> Love this product and just realized that I could order this through Amazon and will continue to order from now on.</li>
    <li> The Keracare does not look like any that I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t know if it really is Keracare conditioner.</li>
    <li> I just love this conditioner!  It makes my dry, brittle hair so soft and easy to comb thru after shampooing.  I will continue to be a faithful user.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for maintaining moisture to natural African American hair.  I use it, and the Kera detangling shampoo on my daughters hair with excellent results</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this conditioner. Perfect for relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and recommended this product due to my dry scalp and hair breakage, and from the time I started using the product about a month ago my hair has improved 100%, I really don&#x27;t have to flat iron it any more. I not only ordered the shampoo and conditioner also ordered the masque and I could not be more satisfied for a black ethnic person.</li>
    <li> Very happy with Keracare products</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse hair. I have used this for 10 years on natural and relaxed hair and it softens and detangles the hair very very well. Smells great as well. This item came packaged tight and the cap was sealed. May be a little pricy , but a little goes along way and it does the job.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great! It leaves my hair so soft and easily manageable. I would definitely recommend this product to people who use color, relaxers, or any other chemicals in their hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works miracles ladies! I always use the keracare products for exactly what they are intended. Now, you could use this conditioner with a different shampoo, however, you will not come up with the best results. I use all keracare products and then I used this conditioner. I especially love using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because her hair has a very thick texture. I normally leave this conditioner on for 30 to 45 minutes then rinse. The hair is very very soft without using silicones. It is definitely worth its weight in gold the only negative that I can say is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger bottle than the 16 ounce</li>
    <li> worked very well. Very happy</li>
    <li> Great product!! Shipped on time!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. My hair remained healthy as I used this product. I switched to Moroccan Oil products for a while, but now I&#x27;m back (AA with relaxed hair).</li>
    <li> great for permed hair</li>
    <li> Provides great condition, shine and slip (detangles). Only downside is product buildup but most product similar have the same issue. I use a clarifying shampoo every other wash and this works fine.</li>
    <li> Keracare Humecto Creme Conditoner - great product. Make my hair soft, smells great and looks healthy!,,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve been sleeping on this conditioner! I&#x27;ve seen this around forever on different hair boards and never tried it until today! Omg this suff is ridicilous! First it smells amazing and the freaking slip is unreal! I can&#x27;t wait to buy the 5 pound bucket of this conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> Type 3C/4A low porosity dense natural hair. I wish this came by the gallon. Worth the money! I hope to buy again from the same seller. Great price and I can&#x27;t find it on the ground</li>
