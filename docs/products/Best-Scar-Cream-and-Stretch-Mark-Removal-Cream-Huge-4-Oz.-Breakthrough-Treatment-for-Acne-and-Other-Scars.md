      <li>I got this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>A LITTLE.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
      <li>However,  I  use this cream,  and when I put on makeup, it covers the scar nicely.</li>
      <li>This cream is wonderful in just one week of use my skin is much softer and my stretch marks are disappearing</li>
      <li>To be honest, when I got offered to try this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I was sceptical that it would work</li>
      <li>Love love love!!</li>
      <li>Feels silky smooth and applies very nicely.</li>
      <li>My opiions are 100 percent my own, and my preggo friend :)</li>
      <li>I will give the 5 towards the attentiveness to the customer and the very detailed email I received upon receiving my order.</li>
      <li>I will keep using this cream and see where it goes, but the early results look very good.</li>
      <li>The dog bite scar on my face is the one that bothers me the most.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
      <li>but I am really happy that they are so much lighter now.  </li>
      <li>My stomach stretch marks are also more pliable and look lots better than they have.</li>
      <li>it is nice and make the skin so smooth</li>
      <li>A scar gel can even skin tone and make more even the height difference between healthy skin and some raised scars.</li>
      <li>I think I actually am able to notice a difference in acne scars.</li>
      <li>She uses it twice a day, she says its smooth, absorbs quickly and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Which is great considering the high price tag.  </li>
      <li>The 5 for the beautiful label and the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I do love the smell, easy to apply and no greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>This cream has a pleasant smell and very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I can not give this product a full 5 because I have not used it more than three days.</li>
      <li>I gifted this to my pregnant friend to help her prevent stretch marks.</li>
      <li>It does not leave an overpowering smell either, which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>Already working on a huge scar on knee.</li>
      <li>She loves the light scent, how well it absorbs into her skin, and any stretch marks she has are fading.</li>
      <li>This cream goes on very creamy but not greasy, it has a nice fragrance</li>
      <li>The cream leaves a sticky and light heat feeling on skin.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>She told me that so far so good.</li>
      <li>This cream feels good and appears to be working on  my old scars on  my legs.</li>
      <li>This product was sealed perfectly for shipping, a heavy creamy texture, and absorbed with ease leaving no oily feeling.</li>
      <li>My 5 star worthy was that this product was fragrant free.</li>
      <li>It so nice and makes skin soft !  </li>
      <li>What I can say so far is that it&#x27;s a great, high quality lotion.</li>
      <li>However, this is such a good moisturizer, that the skin and scar area have softened and the prominence of the scars have reduced in appearance.</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>Very large tub!</li>
      <li>I will mention that this cream leaves my skin feeling really, stinking soft, and that it smells so good that my cat decided to try a taste.  </li>
      <li>Product shipping was fast and easy but just started using the cream two days ago</li>
      <li>/&gt;*this product was purchased using a coupon and my review is that of my own personal experience</li>
      <li>So far I Love it ..</li>
      <li>This is amazing, I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long</li>
      <li>.. I am using this product for the First Time ..</li>
      <li>and I like that because I don&#x27;t have to worry about any overpowering or funny scent when I use it.</li>
      <li>With a product like this, we need more time for a proper review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how well it will work with extended use.  </li>
      <li>The cream is thick, goes on easily, and has a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>Smells really good jar is small but don&#x27;t need to use a lot all.</li>
      <li>I really like that it has Shea and Cocoa Butter in it.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a friend whose acne scars really make her self-conscious.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>plus it really helps moisturize my skin.</li>
      <li>But this time really unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t really have a scent</li>
      <li>I got it today, and I&#x27;m very disappoint about the package of this product.</li>
      <li>It worked very well.</li>
      <li>I have been so selfconscious over these for years and have tried many things to get rid of them with no success.</li>
      <li>I have given this to my sister who is currently pregnant, she can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
      <li>The scar seems a little thinner and lighter,so I will continue to use and hopefully will see even more improvement</li>
      <li>but, I am happy to say I was wrong.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was that it came in a big 4 oz container.</li>
      <li>I have old and new stretch marks that I used my cream on and the way I do mine</li>
      <li>Just started using been using for a little over a week and making my keloid s smooth out.</li>
      <li>This surprised me on it effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>so far i see no improvement while using this product.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve taken pictures, which I&#x27;ll have to post later, since my cell phone is acting funky right now.)  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of stretch marks from being pregnant and a few scars from having surgery.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any result yet. Been using twice daily for 2 weeks. The cream leaves a sticky and light heat feeling on skin.</li>
    <li> Already working on a huge scar on knee. It so nice and makes skin soft !  It is great for skin. !</li>
    <li> What I can say so far is that it&#x27;s a great, high quality lotion. Any stretch mark removal cream is going to take a few weeks before the difference becomes noticeable, so I&#x27;ll update my review in a few weeks with the results.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful in just one week of use my skin is much softer and my stretch marks are disappearing</li>
    <li> This cream has a pleasant smell and very moisturizing. It is a little thicker than lotion, so you have to rub it in well. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say if it improves stretch marks and scars, but I will update once I have.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! I use it on my face to help with hyperpigmentation. I have noticed a small improvement since using it a few weeks ago. It smells delicious- like oranges! I love the ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Product shipping was fast and easy but just started using the cream two days ago so haven&#x27;t see anything yet but I will after a while of seen results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scar gel on my incision on my knee,which is an ugly scar. The scar seems a little thinner and lighter,so I will continue to use and hopefully will see even more improvement</li>
    <li> I got it today, and I&#x27;m very disappoint about the package of this product. The cream flow out everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I&#x27;m not picky about things buying on line. But this time really unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let&#x27;s see whether it works.</li>
    <li> it is nice and make the skin so smooth</li>
    <li> My stretch marks are starting to disappear. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical because my scars are old and still prominent. However, this is such a good moisturizer, that the skin and scar area have softened and the prominence of the scars have reduced in appearance. The dog bite scar on my face is the one that bothers me the most.  However,  I  use this cream,  and when I put on makeup, it covers the scar nicely. My stomach stretch marks are also more pliable and look lots better than they have. I will keep using this cream and see where it goes, but the early results look very good. I am glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this scar and stretch mark cream 5 stars because out of all of products I&#x27;ve tried I actually see results. I&#x27;ve tried cocoa butter, shea butter, order products off the tv and even Avon product and they all claimed to work but didnt. I have old and new stretch marks that I used my cream on and the way I do mine is I wait til after my shower then I use it. After I&#x27;ve dried off I massage it on my belly until it&#x27;s all blended in then I get a piece of Saran wrap and lay it over my belly covering all marks the next step is to put a thermal pad(warm towel will work.) over the Saran wrap keep it there for at leat 15 to 20 mins! Do this everyday until you get the results you want!!! I got this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Good luck with you all!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait to see if I saw any improvement before I posted a review. The cream doesn&#x27;t really have a scent and I like that because I don&#x27;t have to worry about any overpowering or funny scent when I use it. I&#x27;ve been using the cream on surgery scars and I&#x27;m beginning to notice a difference! The skin around the scars feels smoother and the scars seem to be somewhat lighter. If you&#x27;re going to purchase this, please note that a little goes a long way! I started out using it at night because I wanted to see how my skin would react to it but I had no reaction so I&#x27;m using it twice a day now. I&#x27;ve tried other products with no results at all after months of use so this alone makes the product stand out for me.</li>
    <li> Good price and think I&#x27;m starting to see some of my dark areas from a few scars looking lighter in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have given this to my sister who is currently pregnant, she can&#x27;t say enough about it. She loves the light scent, how well it absorbs into her skin, and any stretch marks she has are fading. One of the best scar creams out there, I will be buying her another container when this one is gone. It is not greasy, sticky, or thick. Sample received for review.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells AMAZING too!</li>
    <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Does  it have a distinctive smell. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Only had this product for a week, but I can see my old scar is already fading away. Would be happy with these results alone!</li>
    <li> This cream is great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, 2-3 times day and I can already start to notice some changes. Also it has a really great scent. Def a good buy.</li>
    <li> This surprised me on it effectiveness.  Everyday I can see a change.  I really am impressed.</li>
    <li> I USE IT EVERY NIGHT- SEEMS TO B WORKING- I HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in great shape, and my wife loves it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Feels silky smooth and applies very nicely.</li>
    <li> I was looking foward to this product but after using it for about a month now i have to say im not at all a fond of it ...and im only basing it on the fact thats suppose to be a moisturizer as well because after reading it when i received it says it takes monthz to even see results which is understandable but it doesn&#x27;t really compare at all with every other product in the market ...very disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend whose acne scars really make her self-conscious. She loves it and says it seems to be helping. She likes the smell as well.</li>
    <li> This cream feels good and appears to be working on  my old scars on  my legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and I can already see a difference in the quality of my skin on my abdomen from my stretchmarks from having a baby. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily reduced them, but I think it&#x27;s improved their appearance. I would definitely recommend this product to my other mom friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 days and I can already see the difference! My scars, which tend to bump up, are flattening, and they are beginning to fade on the edges!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Had an accident and thought I was going to have a scar up my shin. And barely have a hairline.</li>
    <li> With a product like this, we need more time for a proper review. I do love the smell, easy to apply and no greasy feeling. Will need to update in a few weeks to see how things are progressing.</li>
    <li> I like the quantity and this products seems to be working.</li>
    <li> It worked very well. My Granddaughter is wearing shorts again.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long but I can already see a difference. Not only that the company checks to see how the progress is going and see if I have any questions. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been keeping a eye on the marks on my stomach and they seem to have gotten lighter(more in-line with the rest of my skin&#x27;s color) and smaller over the time it has been used.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me I am so upset that I spent so much money on it seeing that I bought it befor it was on sale for over $50. It has not made any difference on my stretch marks or scars so disappointed.  I took too long to request a refund so now I am stuck with it</li>
    <li> I just got this last week to use for acne scarring, since then I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin each night. I&#x27;ve already noticed great improvement in my scars and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I gifted this to my pregnant friend to help her prevent stretch marks. She told me that so far so good. She uses it twice a day, she says its smooth, absorbs quickly and has a pleasant smell. It has shea and cocoa butter which is proven to reduce and prevent stretch marks and scars because of its amazing moisturizing ability. **I received this in exchange for an unbiased review! My opiions are 100 percent my own, and my preggo friend :)</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stretch marks from being pregnant and a few scars from having surgery. I have been so selfconscious over these for years and have tried many things to get rid of them with no success. To be honest, when I got offered to try this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I was sceptical that it would work but, I am happy to say I was wrong. The first thing I noticed was that it came in a big 4 oz container. The cream is thick, goes on easily, and has a nice smell to it. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of cream so, this will last you for a while. I really like that it has Shea and Cocoa Butter in it. I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks twice a day and have noticed that my scars and stretch marks have lightened up a lot plus it really helps moisturize my skin. I may always have the stretch marks but I am really happy that they are so much lighter now.  It is so nice to look in the mirror and feel good about what I see instead of ashamed of all the marks on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am sooooo happy with this purchase!! This is the best scar cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Scar Cream leaked all over the outter the packaging.  Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This cream goes on very creamy but not greasy, it has a nice fragrance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cream for about a week now, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my scars.  I was in a coma over a decade ago and had a g-tube (feeding tube) placed in my stomach for a couple of weeks.  I wasn&#x27;t at all hopeful that I could ever make the scar go away, but I decided to try this, anyway.  I use the cream to massage my g-tube scar and the scar from my belly button ring closing up while I was hospitalized.  After a week of massaging both scars for two minutes a day, twice a day, Already, the hard scar tissue is breaking up and leaving soft, pliable skin in its place.  The dents aren&#x27;t gone, though they are fading.  I&#x27;ll keep applying this cream, and we&#x27;ll see what happens.  (I&#x27;ve taken pictures, which I&#x27;ll have to post later, since my cell phone is acting funky right now.)  I will mention that this cream leaves my skin feeling really, stinking soft, and that it smells so good that my cat decided to try a taste.  Just once.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now I love it and will continue to buy! I have suffered from acne scars since i was a teen im now 31 I have tried everything pills percription creams &amp;amp; nothing compares to this# I absolutely love it!!! scars are fading as well as stretch marks! Love love love!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing.  It heals my acne scars literally overnight.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, and can be used as a moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t had it very long, but I think it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> .. I am using this product for the First Time .. So far I Love it .. I will add another review after 1 week ..</li>
    <li> I can not give this product a full 5 because I have not used it more than three days. What I like about it and can see it getting a five in the future is it&#x27;s entire package. I will give the 5 towards the attentiveness to the customer and the very detailed email I received upon receiving my order. The 5 for the beautiful label and the natural ingredients. I will caution anyone who is allergic to nuts or Shea butter(which Im learning some are), this is not for you. With that said, the ingredients are those that with known benefits for aiding in scars and stretch marks. This product was sealed perfectly for shipping, a heavy creamy texture, and absorbed with ease leaving no oily feeling. My 5 star worthy was that this product was fragrant free. Overall I am hopeful that I will like this and if the instructions are followed, results should be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product was purchased using a coupon and my review is that of my own personal experience*</li>
    <li> Awesome product wish i had more though</li>
    <li> I love my pets, but unfortunately, they have the tendency to leave scratches on me, either when playing or out of accident.  Due to this, I have a little scaring at times (currently, I have a battle wound on my face from my dog jumping off the back of the couch onto my face!).  That&#x27;s why this product has been awesome.  While using this cream on the scar on my face, I have noticed a decrease in the appearance.  I&#x27;ve only used it a short time, so of course it has not been a miracle worker and made it disappear completely (unfortunately, miracle workers don&#x27;t exist!).  I&#x27;m interested to see how well it will work with extended use.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Very large tub! Which is great considering the high price tag.  Scar and stretch mark creams are always expensive, especially for the good ones. *Sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> The key is not to expect miracles. A scar gel can even skin tone and make more even the height difference between healthy skin and some raised scars. But, this is a product which refines what is there; it is not a quick eraser. The user must accept that the body&#x27;s healing process made the scars, and a cream is not more powerful than the human biology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not greasy like other scar creams that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt; It does not leave an overpowering smell either, which is a huge plus. The directions are really simply and you get quiet a bit of cream in this jar, enough that you can use it long term on a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking to have your scars fade I think this will do the job as I can tell a difference in just a little over a week. A LITTLE.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Smells really good jar is small but don&#x27;t need to use a lot all. A little goes a long way. Just started using been using for a little over a week and making my keloid s smooth out. Hopefully it will take some of the discoloration. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s removing the acne scars on my face</li>
    <li> I think I actually am able to notice a difference in acne scars. After years, a product that works!</li>
    <li> so far i see no improvement while using this product. I still see the same stretch marks and nothing has happened.</li>
