    <li> I use a lot of Epsom salt -- mostly for bathing but also in my garden. Cost-wise I&#x27;d prefer to buy it in a 50lb bag but as I lack the space in my apartment, this 6lb bag is the next best thing. Add it to a Super-Saver order, and it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick delivery, good price, and Amazon has an amazing selection of products.  The subscribe &amp; save feature is fantastic!  My ache body loves this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good quality for great price. $5 for 6lb bag at the dollar store though</li>
    <li> I did move to the San Francisco Salt company Empsom salt because they offer 40# bags - but this stuff is great. Lightly scented, but dissolves quickly and makes for a delightful bath with relaxed muscles.</li>
    <li> This was nice, but it was expensive for plain old Epsom salt.  Just go to the drug store down the street.</li>
    <li> Epsom salts, are Epsom salts in my opinion. I do love this brand, though, and the fact that they have them in so many lovely scents! I like using this basic one for soaking my feet and use around the house. (You can&#x27;t beat getting this big bag for under $5). I save the scented ones for nights when I need a relaxing soak in the bath or I feel like giving myself a &amp;#34;spa day&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> Great price.  Much cheaper than buying it in the local stores.  I normally get the one with a lavender scent.  I miss that aroma and will probably go back to that next order.  I can always add essential oils until then, so I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> The epsom salts are fine, my baths felt soothing.  However, the individual&lt;br /&gt;bags are not strong enough to contain the salts - some of the bags have&lt;br /&gt;ripped open in different spots - stronger material is needed.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from arthritis and Dr Teals always helps. We have a few &amp;#34;go - to&amp;#34; items when he&#x27;s in pain, and this salt mix is certainly one of them.</li>
    <li> This epsom salt is potent and good to soak sore muscles in. The only thing I disliked about this product was that it&#x27;s unscented. Great for a bath and a soak.</li>
    <li> I used this to soak my sore arm muscle and it really helped. I may try a scented version next time.</li>
    <li> I add a few handfuls of epsom salts to all my baths. It is especially helpful when I have sore muscles.</li>
    <li> I love epsom salts for when I soak in the tub. I have bad joints and what can I say, I feel better after a soak with these. Is it in my head, is it just from the soaking? I don&#x27;t know. All I do know is that these re cheap, and I feel like they make me feel better. So I&#x27;m happy to keep buying this stuff.</li>
    <li> my husband and I both have back problems and like to take baths a lot to sooth our muscles. I love adding Epsom salts to soak in! these are the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve discovered Epsom salt relatively recently, but I love it so much, I&#x27;d have a hard time doing without it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly for relaxation and detoxification - I add 2 cups of Epsom salt to a very hot bath and soak in it for at least 20 minutes.

    <li> Nice product, nothing fantastic I can add. It did the job it was suppose to do. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Dont get me wrong, Epsom salts are epsom salts, they work great. The reason i marked it as &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; is simply because when you use it as part of a liver cleanse and you have to drink a lot of water with a lot of the Epsom Salts trust me, you will hate it! it tastes horrible, but it works great :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bulk size, but I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Would recommend this for a bathtub soak - or just a foot soak.</li>
    <li> Using it for foot soaking, and it is working so far. It doesn&#x27;t smell so that is a plus. I just add my own essential oils to relax me. All in all worth the money</li>
    <li> One of several blends we bought - this is great for muscular aches from bending and lifting - works well for rge whole family</li>
    <li> As a saline laxative it was effective, quite effective in fact. For magnesium sulfate the taste was not too bad either. For baths it relaxes my back, shoulder, and legs well when I use a cup or so. Overall, just good quality magnesium salts for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> whats not to like,soak in hot water,while you detox. very relaxing.This is a treat. makes a great gift for a nervous person.</li>
    <li> I especially like that this is an unscented product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for detox baths, muscle relaxation.</li>

    <li> It really is a great product, I use it weekly in baths, helps tons with my soar back due to work injury, I suggest this to anyone needing to relieve body pains</li>
    <li> What can I say? A giant bag of Epsom salt for cheaper than the dollar store. Very good quality. You will have a return customer!</li>
    <li> Epsom salt - the old standby.  Sometimes, old-fashioned remedies are the best.  I use this once a week for a detox soak in my tub.  I also use it for enemas in my &amp;#34;clinic.&amp;#34;  Try it.  You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Love Epson salt and I am told to add at least 3 cups per tub so sometimes I put some essential oil or other Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt in my bath to get some additional sensory benefits. It really works for aches and pains either from accidents, injuries or working out. I keep a large glass container by my tub filled with it and also looks kinda pretty. Very Functional. I have Prime time amazon so this is a great way for  me to keep stocked up.</li>
    <li> This is a very good salt for my body.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I soak in it before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! And it&#x27;s worth it to get the big size! It soothes my muscles like nothing else.</li>
    <li> We recently discovered Dr. Teal&#x27;s and really enjoy it for a good soak in the tub. We plan on continuing its use.</li>
