    <li> Excellent product and smells great! Received product promptly</li>
    <li> This has to be one of our must-have items.  As a guy, I resist wearing my SPF when I play golf because it just seems to always drip when the sweat starts to roll.  But, I have to say that the Jan Marini is quite a find.  Thanks lovely wife o&#x27; mine.</li>
