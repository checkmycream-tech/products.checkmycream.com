      <li>Bought it for my husband, its not the original one.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s spicy, earthy backgrounds which compliments the more citrusy notes of that scent, and Polo Original is my winter scent of choice due to the nice pine and citrus aroma, fitting for the season.  </li>
      <li>Clean, aquatic, and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve asked several what they were wearing since they smelled soo good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice on nearly everyone..</li>
      <li>Smells amazing last forever so strong you can be smelled from a mile away with just two sprays.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this a a gift for a male friend and I am honestly amazed by how cheap the product was considering it is 2.5 oz.</li>

      <li>I was very pleased with the Blue Polo.  </li>

      <li>the price is right</li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s scent to be crisp and fresh, which works well for the warmer months.  </li>
      <li>Quick purchase, reasonable price</li>
      <li>My man smells delish ;)</li>
      <li>Threw it out the first day.</li>
      <li>Smell is great, and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we wanted</li>
      <li>My husband wore this when we first met.</li>
      <li>Polo Blue is probably my favorite summer fragrance.</li>
      <li>Real deal!</li>
      <li>Also for me, I love RL BLUE for women.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Exactly what we wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying Aqua Di Gio is my go-to cologne for any time of year.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it since college, it works well with my chemistry, and the scent lingers quite a while on me.  I&#x27;d consider it my everyday EDT, as I&#x27;m fine using it any season and in any situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I like to switch it up once in a while, especially based on the seasons.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of scents that I haven&#x27;t stuck with for one reason or another (Kenneth Cole Black was weak, Armani Code/Black Code were a bit too sweet for me), but Polo Blue is a regular in my warm-season arsenal.  I find it&#x27;s scent to be crisp and fresh, which works well for the warmer months.  It&#x27;s not an overly strong scent, but it&#x27;s one that sticks around for a long time.  And all I&#x27;ve ever heard is compliments from ladies and other guys asking what it is.  I like too that it gives off it&#x27;s scent with heat spikes, and smells as it did out of the bottle (I hate colognes that change their scent when it gets hot).  However, I usually put it in the bullpen for fall and winter since it doesn&#x27;t really mesh well with those seasons.  ADG is my fall scent, a season with it&#x27;s spicy, earthy backgrounds which compliments the more citrusy notes of that scent, and Polo Original is my winter scent of choice due to the nice pine and citrus aroma, fitting for the season.  I also use Polo Black, but reserve that for &#x27;going out/special occasions.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, Polo Blue is excellent and I think the scent is stable enough to work with most people&#x27;s chemistry without changing all that much.  But, in the end, it&#x27;s your call and decision.</li>
    <li> Great and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Blue Polo.  I bought it for a gift, and my son-in-law says it is the same as he has used before.  The shipment was received quicker than promised.</li>
    <li> I got this as an impulse buy and I am soooo glad I did. My girlfriend loves it, my co-workers love it and I am sure all the people next to me on the crowded train in the morning love it too. A must have for a man looking to impress.</li>
    <li> the smell of this cologne is awesome. which is why i bought it again. except one problem upon receiving: the scent usually fades after an hour. My original bottle was purchased from Polo factory outlet, and the scent used to last most past of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed from the reseller here at amazon. just be careful and spend extra few dollars.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and great product!</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend as it&#x27;s his favorite and he absolutely loved it. Real deal!</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift. He loved it.</li>
    <li> I always loved this cologne, one of my top 5 scents</li>
    <li> Decent scent that is gone in 5 minutes</li>
    <li> perfume and agraable good and the price is right</li>
    <li> Purchased this a a gift for a male friend and I am honestly amazed by how cheap the product was considering it is 2.5 oz.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing last forever so strong you can be smelled from a mile away with just two sprays.  Love the scent and so do the ladies ^ ^</li>
    <li> So I went grocery shopping. I needed a few things from the bachelor isle (beer, chips and beef jerky). I spritzed a bit on before I went in. As I cruised down the isle, this charming young lady sniffed when I walked by and said \\&quot;You smell wonderful\\&quot;. I smiled, but having a lack of game, only said \\&quot;Thank you\\&quot; and walked my cowardly self away. I listened for the click of her heels signifying that she acknowledged my thanks and went about her shopping, but she stood there. I&#x27;m sure she wondered \\&quot;I just opened the door for this dork and he didnt walk in\\&quot;. I grabbed a big bag of cheetos and headed for the checkout lane.    When I stood in front of the counter person and reached for my wallet. The older (50+) woman working the checkout looked at me and said \\&quot;someone sure smells great, what is that?\\&quot;. I told her \\&quot;Polo Blue\\&quot; smilingly. She looked me up and down as if I were being prepared for cooking over an open flame. I thought, \\&quot;Well, why not? What do I have to lose? She was an attractive cougar.\\&quot; I then ran over the pros and cons in my head before I realized I had walked to my car, got in and started driving.    Forever Alone.    This cologne is wonderful, just prepare your self to be thrusted into a social situation in which you must act! I was woefully (and currently) unprepared. I guess I&#x27;ll play some Black Ops and read FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU comics on Reddit.</li>
    <li> My friend nick named this &amp;#34;lady killer&amp;#34; as I have never gotten more compliments on any cologne I&#x27;ve worn before except for this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne for a 23-year old.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent on this product. It has been out of stock on many sites. Amazon had the best price.</li>
    <li> I have a smaller bottle that I love to spray when I am having a rough day, but comparing the two...the one I bought from Amazon smells a lot different. I hate it. I know the smaller bottle one is real since I got it from the mall in the Polo store. It still smells nice</li>
    <li> the order came very quickly. the product was as described. we were very pleased with the delivery and product.</li>
    <li> I would not really say I like this product.  It was a gift to me some years ago and I have used it for work only.  Usually just one or two quick spray and I am out the door.  Now that I have discovered other brands as well as fragrances, I have to say that I would not buy this particular product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe ole&#x27; Ralphie has other fragrances that I might like but till then, I will pass.  If you want to try before you buy, just try it at the mall a few times or buy a sample bottle and see if you like it.  This one really does gets old fast.</li>
    <li> Nice and Sophisticated</li>
    <li> I love Polo Blue as I have used it in the past and decided to get it again. It has a nice fragrance that is not overbearing. Has a distinct smell that is very masculine. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance but it is just a little bit overwhelming. Either way, I recommend this product a lot.</li>
    <li> fantastic smells great!</li>
    <li> very niche smell...great for summer, warmer spring days. very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smelling if that makes any sense. great after shower cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;genuine product (I checked the batch code)</li>
    <li> Good, clean smell. Perfect for the casual wearer, and goes great with a tie or the t-shirt. Inoffensive and moderately seductive.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;t favorite cologne! His bottle was taken by Customs when we were leaving Kona so of course I&#x27;m replacing it!</li>
    <li> I have not order it yet. !!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband, its not the original one. smells so bad and strong. i ordered the same few months back for $60. now it was $40, i wonder how can it be so cheaper. read reviews before, some time perfumes are not original and i experienced it now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it came exactly as expected. Brand new and smells amazing! He loves it :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Yea, just like all the other one star ratings....this is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars to Amazon on the way they handle it, but just disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, you have to buy this stuff in an actual store.Peroid</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it!! He was so excited when he opened his present.</li>
    <li> I received the package today and immediately opened it and sprayed on my skin and it was not the correct scent!! I wear polo blue on the regular and this was not my scent!</li>
    <li> MY SONS FAVORITE COLOGNE AND AMAZON MAKES IT EASY TO ORDER AND RECEIVE.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Well, Polo Blue is Polo Blue.  If one likes it, then there is nothing more to be said about the product.  I bought this as a gift for a man who regularly uses it.  And I bought from Amazon quite frankly for the price, which is about half what is charged even in Duty Free Shops.</li>
    <li> this was totally worth the price it smells amazing and i am a big fan of ralpg lauren products especailly at this price</li>
    <li> Except for the price, which is expensive anywhere you go, this is a great product. It smells great and the girlfriend loves it. It got here a couple days before they said it would be</li>
    <li> Smelss wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Great Price here!</li>
    <li> my girlfriend loves this cologne !</li>
    <li> this was a refill for a bottle of Polo my husband had used up...he just had to have it again</li>
    <li> Smell is great, and long lasting. Bought this for a friend and couldn&#x27;t get over the nice smell. Sometimes I use it on myself as well. Would recommend for men and women who like the men&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> Love how smells on my boyfriend.Timeless and elegant fragrance for women too. Ralph Lauren&#x27;s absolute best cologne ever. Buy it.</li>
    <li> He has  loved the scent for years.  Also for me, I love RL BLUE for women.  Can,t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Purchased for our nephew. He loves it.</li>
    <li> My favorite everyday wearing cologne. Its good for causal wear and for the night on the town! Whether your going to work or going on a date, this cologne smells so good! Whatever your doing its sure to go in your favor!</li>
    <li> this is my cologne. Its Manly, and still good, and my wife likes the smell. Have used it for roughly ten years, the 2.5oz bottle is good and the price is better than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband, he loves it....not too strong, and not to light.</li>
    <li> this is a classic. worth the money.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent! Got lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> my boyfriend has been using the eau de toilette for years and now he puts it on and minutes later the smell is gone. it seems to be a fake one.   I have waited a week or so after he used it , because it was a christmas present but now not only me who thinks so, he by himself made the remark.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and so do the ladies. Quick purchase, reasonable price and I never left the house to find it.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a gift!</li>
    <li> it is just what my husband wanted good price, I used a gift card I still have money on it but when I tried to use it again it would not go through it kept saying not a correct number I tried putting the numbers on the card in at least 4 times with the same results. my gift card still has over nine dollars on it what do I do with the remainder on my card if I cant use it ?</li>
    <li> Love it smells awesome</li>
    <li> Great price! Would definately order again.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband.  The one he had was almost gone.  He likes it just fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Polo Blue and Green.  The green is unbearable, bad knock off and the blue is okay, I think both are fakes.  Serious issue since this is stocked in Amazon warehouses???</li>
    <li> The fragrance  is unbelievable.  The only problem is the secent doesn&#x27;t  last more then 2 to 3 hours. If you don&#x27;t  mind refreshing  the cologne  3 times a day than this is for you.</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance, I really like, indicated to me</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift for my son.  This is the one he uses all the time and his wife loves it.</li>
    <li> My man smells delish ;)</li>
    <li> The best fragrance on men! I&#x27;ve asked several what they were wearing since they smelled soo good. It&#x27;s almost always Polo Blue! It&#x27;s nice on nearly everyone.. Please please please, men.. at least add 1 bottle to your cologne collection.</li>
    <li> great smelling fragrance for me!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. I love it!</li>
    <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long at the one I purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 20 year old son for Christmas and he loved it. It smells great! Its not too strong like some mens cologne, its light  and fine for day or evening.</li>
    <li> Polo Blue is probably my favorite summer fragrance. Clean, aquatic, and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My son wanted this for a Christmas present and I have to admit it smells really nice. He says this is only what he&#x27;ll wear now.</li>
    <li> Gets no better than this.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my husband for christmas.  He loves it and he smells so good! Strongly recommend this scent!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves when loves when I wear it</li>
    <li> Not a knockoff like other people have said.  My husband loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Polo Blue cologne for my husband. I love the scent! I grew up with the classic Polo Green cologne. Polo Blue is a much more attractive scent!</li>
    <li> Smelled the sample in the magazine. Thought it was great. Bought it here and it stinks. Threw it out the first day.</li>
    <li> My husband wore this when we first met. I purchased it again for Christmas and i remembered why i love it. I like a cleaner not musky smell and this is it for sure!</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy Polo Blue so I found the best price on Amazon.  The quality is good and the smell is not overpowering. It lasts for a few hours and she really enjoys the scent.</li>
