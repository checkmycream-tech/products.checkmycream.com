      <li>It works best of them for me in some key categories:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>For short hair, this shampoo/conditioner is great!</li>

      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s better alternatives out there.</li>
      <li>im glad i bought it</li>
      <li>Cleans and conditions hair and leaves refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>that makes your scalp itch even more.</li>
      <li>I almost did..about two or more times.</li>
      <li>It was perfect for short hair as a conditioning agent, and controlled dandruff</li>
      <li>I like most Suave products, and this works like the rest.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast easy shipping.</li>
      <li>He says it leaves his hair feeling very clean, which is how he likes it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind he can use and was happy with the purchase, shipping and delivery time.</li>
      <li>Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy.</li>
      <li>fresh - has a nice green/slightly fruity smell.</li>
      <li>This is good for teenagers and/or athletes... but may not be good for people with already dry</li>
      <li>HE PREFERS THE MORE, &amp;#34;MANLY&amp;#34; SMELL OVER HEAD AND SHOULDERS ORIGINAL SCENT.</li>
      <li>I have a scalp/skin issue, and when I am able to use a regular, non medicated shampoo this is a great pick.  </li>
      <li>Scent is not overly strong once hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective anti dandruff ingredient that has worked well for us&lt;br /&gt;-Relieves itching, lessens flakes&lt;br /&gt;-Good</li>
      <li>As a man, I&#x27;m not too particular about the shampoo I use, but it always has to have three important components: it has to lather well, it has to smell good, and it has to help prevent my dandruff tendencies.  </li>
      <li>it seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>It is almost unscented and seems very mild, yet my scalp felt clean and itch free.</li>
      <li>I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...</li>
      <li>i would need to finish with conditioner to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>This is a light conditioner, and doesn&#x27;t cause that problem.  </li>
      <li>It is smooth on the hair even after drying it with a towel.  </li>
      <li>The scent for this shampoo is light and manly while it lathers up well.</li>
      <li>It smells better than Head &amp; Shoulders, is effective in keeping my scalp itch-free and clean, and my hair is shiny and soft after using it.</li>
      <li>This does a good job of getting my hair clean and leaving it reasonably soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair and scalp clean without overly drying; the scent is fresh, and hair is left looking good!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s RICH,</li>
      <li>and my hair clean.</li>
      <li>It has a hint of a meditated tang as these shampoos tend to, but nothing overwhelming and overall it has a nice cleanness to it.</li>
      <li>Full on flake fest.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more, but I much prefer it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gets hair clean and helps with mild dandruff.  </li>
      <li>effectively&lt;br /&gt;-works very well for short hair that is in good condition</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and not medicinal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth a try if you are a man who should be using anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>I sure was surprised.  </li>
      <li>The Clear 2 in 1 did seem to moisturize better.</li>
      <li>This 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo is a great alternative to some of the more expensive anti dandruff shampoos.</li>
      <li>So this Suave 2 in 1 Classic Clean Anti-Dandruff shampoo gets a thumbs up from both my son and my husband.</li>
      <li>it was very cheap, but i think id go ahead and try a different brand.</li>
      <li>This works just fine, as far I can tell.</li>
      <li>The price is right, and the bottle is pretty large.  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m trying to get in and out of the shower ASAP, conditioner isn&#x27;t always the first thing on my mind.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Suave for Men!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> go to shampoo for my no fuss husband with a good head of thick, full hair</li>
    <li> my hubby loves the smell and he said it works good with his scalp. no itching at all</li>
    <li> My hair used to be dull, dry, coarse, dingy, funky, frizzy, and generally all-around nasty to look at and it felt like steel wool... then I tried THIS product and it TOTALLY changed.  Like a phoenix rising out of the ashes of a nuclear fire, this shampoo/ conditioner brought my hair back from the brink of a hair stylist&#x27;s Hell and I won&#x27;t use ANYTHING ELSE to wash my hair with today.  It&#x27;s THICK, it&#x27;s RICH, It LATHERS well, IT SMELLS WONDERFUL... and it cleans your hair and gets rid of all the gunk, including that dermatological nightmare known as dandruff.  For the price, I don&#x27;t know HOW OR WHY anybody would buy anything else.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s on the market, cos I finally something that works for me.  Thanks Suave for Men!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I sure was surprised.  Left my hair lifeless!  Oh well.</li>
    <li> My son likes to use this shampoo, but I gave it a 2 because I happened to use it one day when I ran out of mine. It did not do well at all on a female head of long hair! I realize that I&#x27;m not the intended user, but it was like it turned my hair into thick straw that I couldn&#x27;t get a comb thru. If a guy has long hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good thanks works really good for my husband and he said he like it im glad i bought it</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. And it smells so good :) will def order again!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to try he uses it but the smell to me is not the greatest.</li>
    <li> Item as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I don’t really understand how these products work – the chemistry is beyond me.  What I do know is that I have tried the big blue brands, and several smaller off brands.  This one is my favorite.  It works best of them for me in some key categories:&lt;br /&gt;1 – (the obvious) dandruff control, while not 100%, it is the best I have tried&lt;br /&gt;2 – itchiness, no itchy scalp when using this product&lt;br /&gt;3 – doesn’t thin my hair, one other brand in particular makes my hair feel much thinner&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is my favorite anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> To give dandruff shampoo a good chance, you need to use it for a while. Sometimes it can leave a build up behind that makes your scalp itch even more. This rinsed out very clean - no left over residue. Hair is light and fluffy, not dry and brittle or oily. Dandruff is down quite a bit as well. Price-wise it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the other leading dandruff shampoos. I also found the price on Amazon to be comparable to the stores. Amazon packed and shipped it well with plenty of cushioning to keep spillage from happening. All in all a good experience.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast easy shipping.</li>
    <li> Smells great, cleans great, no residue, awesome! Good price usually as well. Best stuff out there.</li>
    <li> My son has dandruff, but doesn&#x27;t like to use dandruff shampoo. He has used dandruff shampoos that smell more medicinal and left his hair dry. I had to convince him to give the SUAVE brand a try. He liked the scent, the great lather and the fact that the shampoo/conditioner made his hair look good. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this shampoo, he likes both the fragrance and the results.  He says it leaves his hair feeling very clean, which is how he likes it.  The fragrance is actually not very heavy, and has hints of apple in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried having my daughters use it a couple of times, because they are both fighting off some dandruff.  Their hair looked truly awful after they used it - completely oily, as if they hadn&#x27;t shampooed at all.  They also both said it didn&#x27;t lather for them the way the shampoos I usually buy for them do, so I had them shampoo first with this, then a second time in the same shower with their usual shampoo to try to at least help with the dandruff.  Unfortunately, we didn&#x27;t see any reduction in the dandruff after using for two weeks, at which point I had them stop using it altogether.</li>
    <li> Love this dandruff shampoo. It smells better than Head &amp; Shoulders, is effective in keeping my scalp itch-free and clean, and my hair is shiny and soft after using it. Though I don&#x27;t really have a flaky scalp, it does itch from time to time, and I&#x27;ve found regular use of Head &amp; Shoulders to be an effective way to keep the itchiness down and my hair clean. But it does have a strong medicinal smell, so I&#x27;m glad I found this alternative which has a pleasant and nice smell. It&#x27;s great and I will use this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Suave is known as an affordable option that still has decent quality. This 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Classic Clean is very similar to Head &amp; Shoulders. It is almost unscented and seems very mild, yet my scalp felt clean and itch free. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that my hair did not feel very conditioned and was less manageable than usual after using it. The Clear 2 in 1 did seem to moisturize better.</li>
    <li> The Suave anti-dandruff combination shampoo and conditioner works exactly as the other popular dandruff shampoo brand.  Just a little blob on my palm produce lots of suds that I don&#x27;t need a second serving.  It is smooth on the hair even after drying it with a towel.  The scent is nothing exciting but it is subtle enough that it doesn&#x27;t bothers me.  Lastly, it is less irritating if it gets to my eyes.  5 stars for combined performance and affordability.</li>
    <li> This works just fine, as far I can tell. I don&#x27;t have dandruff issues, so it&#x27;s hard for me to gauge that. But as a 2-in-1 shampoo it works really well. I like most Suave products, and this works like the rest. No complaints.</li>
    <li> He loved it! Said it controlled any dandruff he had and left his hair feeling soft and natural. Very nice shampoo/conditioner for me.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great</li>
    <li> This is a dandruff shampoo that says it is specifically formulated for men, although it doesn&#x27;t tell the how and why.  It is anti-dandruff and a conditioner. It smells fresh and not medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to apply, rinse and apply again. I have found one application is sufficient and sometimes wonder if these directions are given to help you use the product up more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This does not have the strength and power of Selsun Blue, so if your dandruff situation is extreme, I do not see this being as effective- for mild cases it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> As a man, I&#x27;m not too particular about the shampoo I use, but it always has to have three important components: it has to lather well, it has to smell good, and it has to help prevent my dandruff tendencies.  This shampoo successfully contains all of these must-have components and satisfies me as my shampoo of choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shampoos that force you to fill your hand with shampoo just to be able to lather you entire head of hair.  I don&#x27;t have a ridiculous amount of hair, and one small squeeze of the shampoo bottle should give me plenty of shampoo for my head.  This shampoo does just that and one small drop will really go a long way.  Also, the smell is perfect.  It&#x27;s a masculine clean smell, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering.  In addition, this shampoo really negates all dandruff that I sometimes begin to have.  It can be embarrassing to scratch my head and see white flakes float down onto my shirt.  This shampoo gives me confidence that this will never happen in public.  Finally, I really like that this is a shampoo AND conditioner.  When I&#x27;m trying to get in and out of the shower ASAP, conditioner isn&#x27;t always the first thing on my mind.  It&#x27;s really nice to get the conditioner benefit without having to have an additional container of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this shampoo.  It&#x27;s my first product that I&#x27;ve owned from Suave (I&#x27;m typically a Head and Shoulder kind of guy), but this definitely has me interested in trying some other Suave products in the future.  I highly recommend this Shampoo/Conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of Suave products, but I have to say &amp;#34;Suave Professionals Men 2 In 1 Anti Dandruff Classic Clean Shampoo and Conditioner&amp;#34; really surprised me. For a low cost Suave product, it&#x27;s actually quite good. I have minor dandruff which is mostly caused by dry scalp, this Suave shampoo works as well for me as the most well known dandruff shampoo that costs twice as much. It smells nice, and unlike other Suave shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. I haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes either. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I definitely think that product is better than any other dandruff shampoo on the market. I love how it has the 2 in one feature in it. It makes your hair and scalp feeling moisturized and hydrated. It has a nice scent to it too. A very nice, pleasant, clean smell to it.</li>
    <li> We have been using different variations of Suave products for year in our family. This 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo is a great alternative to some of the more expensive anti dandruff shampoos. It smells great, lathers nicely, and leaves my husband&#x27;s hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Both my 13 year old son and my husband like this Suave 2 in 1 shampoo. My husband is pretty picky about his shampoos and only likes a few kinds, and this is one of them. They both prefer these kinds with conditioner in them since they feel it makes their hair softer, and my son likes the anti-dandruff since when he doesn&#x27;t use a shampoo with dandruff control, he ends up having issues with it. It smells nice but isn&#x27;t overpowering like some men&#x27;s shampoos. It washes hair clean and leaves their hair feeling soft. So this Suave 2 in 1 Classic Clean Anti-Dandruff shampoo gets a thumbs up from both my son and my husband.</li>
    <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t like to smell all froofy.  I&#x27;m a big fan of trying new hair products, so I gave this 2-in-1 a go.  It&#x27;s definitely good.  Many 2-in-1&#x27;s lack the power on the conditioner side, leaving hair feeling stiff and gross.  However, this one worked well on both sides!</li>
    <li> I really like Suave products and this shampoo is no exception.  It smells great and has anti-dandruff properties which I need from time to time...especially during the Winter months.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My older daughter and teenage son both have a tendency toward dry scalp and dandruff.  With thick heads of hair, they can run through A LOT of shampoo.  I found this at a great price and have 2 bottles a month on my subscribe and save order so we never run out.  When they use it regularly, they have no flakes and soft clean smelling hair.</li>
    <li> While this shampoo isn&#x27;t going to replace [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 AntiDandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration, 12.9oz]] as my favorite anti-dandruff shampoo (realy love that stuff), I DO think that this is another good anti-dandruff shampoo that I have no problem recommending. The active ingredients work and the scent is pleasing. It is definitely worth a try if you are a man who should be using anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend who has an allergic reaction to most shampoos. This is the only kind he can use and was happy with the purchase, shipping and delivery time.</li>
    <li> My husband served as my human guinea pig in testing this shampoo.  He said it controlled his dandruff. and he likes that it also has a conditioner so you dont have to use two products.</li>
    <li> My husband has used the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; of this product for many years. It was difficult to convince him to even try this one, but once he did, he gave it a two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is as good or better than the name brand. I like the price tag that goes with it.</li>
    <li> Suave is making some really nice products lately. This does a good job of getting my hair clean and leaving it reasonably soft. Like most 2-in-1 products, it&#x27;s not quite up to the same level as using a separate conditioner. When I really just want to get cleaned up quickly because I&#x27;ve had an exhausting day or something, I&#x27;m more than happy to trade off a little effectiveness for the sake of efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice too. It has a hint of a meditated tang as these shampoos tend to, but nothing overwhelming and overall it has a nice cleanness to it.</li>
    <li> Works great! I started to sprout a unicorn where my bald spot is, once I started using this. Prepare to be forever changed!</li>
    <li> My youngest (17yo) son wears lacrosse helmets most days of the year.  Boy are they sweaty.  His hair gets really sweaty and greasy, every day, but also in the winter it gets dry and flaky at the same time.  I picked this up for him because of the winter dandruff, and he really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;+ Gets sweaty gross hair clean in one wash&lt;br /&gt;+ Helps alleviate flaking&lt;br /&gt;+ Doesn&#x27;t smell like dandruff shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD AND BAD:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little drying.  This is good for teenagers and/or athletes... but may not be good for people with already dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Gets hair clean and helps with mild dandruff.  If your hair is dry this may be too drying for you -- but if you have oily hair or a lifestyle that keeps your hair sweaty or greasy, this should do the trick.</li>
    <li> I haven’t liked the thin shampoos or body washes. And the gels always seem to have clumps that slide off to the shower floor and make it dangerously slick. With this Suave I squeeze out a portion and whatever is left after putting some in my hair, I use as a body wash. I’ve come to like this way of showering so much that I just use Suave as a body wash instead of a separate soap. I’m just as clean and leave smelling great- its as if I used an after shave or cologne.</li>
    <li> The scent for this shampoo is light and manly while it lathers up well. It was perfect for short hair as a conditioning agent, and controlled dandruff well.</li>
    <li> the shampoo was just good. ive used it a month and it has its pros and cons. it does smell okay, but the shampoo leaves my hair feeling dry and clumpy. i would need to finish with conditioner to smooth it out. the price was why i purchased it. it was very cheap, but i think id go ahead and try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have less dandruff from this, but nonetheless I still have dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love Suave products; affordable and effective.  This is a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Good smell and my hair feels clean.</li>
    <li> works extremely well for the price :)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my two sons to use and got their opinions. Both like the way it smelled and the way it lathered up. Both Will and Dan noticed that Suave Professionals Men 2 in1 Classic Clean Shampoo decreased the amount of dandruff flakes as well as the itchiness associated with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I noticed their hair seemed healthier and shinier. And they weren&#x27;t scratching their heads with the resultant flakes falling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shampoo highly.</li>
    <li> My husband swears he&#x27;s not picky about anti-dandruff shampoos- and that&#x27;s really not true. He prefers a 2 in 1 formula that uses pyrithione zinc as the active ingredient, shampoos that are nearly interchangeable with regular 2 in 1 formulas except for being effective against dandruff. So right from the start, a lot of the big name anti-dandruff shampoos are out. It also needs to be gentle enough for every day use because he doesn&#x27;t switch as often as he should between regular shampoos and anti-dandruff formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill nicely. The conditioning is a little on the light side but with his pomades it works. He likes the scent and feel of it. My daughter also likes using this one because she likes the scent.</li>
    <li> All family members tried this. Except for my husband, we - male &amp; female, all have long hair. We did not like it for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Smells fresh - has a nice green/slightly fruity smell. Scent is not overly strong once hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective anti dandruff ingredient that has worked well for us&lt;br /&gt;-Relieves itching, lessens flakes&lt;br /&gt;-Good price on a generous amount&lt;br /&gt;-lathers well IF hair is very wet&lt;br /&gt;-cleans effectively&lt;br /&gt;-works very well for short hair that is in good condition&lt;br /&gt;-does not weigh hair down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-tangles long hair&lt;br /&gt;-leaves dry or long hair feeling like it has not been conditioned when used by itself&lt;br /&gt;-does nothing to smooth hair - leaves fly aways and frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s better alternatives out there. Clear makes a great anti-dandruff that isn&#x27;t so harsh on the hair. It&#x27;s a bit more, but I much prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;We found that we we definitely had to use conditioner with this product, though it is advertised as a 2 in 1. I also had to use smoothing serum. It seemed to strip my hair. I&#x27;d probably still use it now and then because it seemed to act as a clarifier to remove built up hair product. My main criticism is not that it doesn&#x27;t get hair clean, it&#x27;s just a bit too harsh for our long hair.</li>
    <li> For short hair, this shampoo/conditioner is great! It leaves hair and scalp clean without overly drying; the scent is fresh, and hair is left looking good! For longer hair, however, it&#x27;s a little different, since it tends to be dryer toward the ends, so a little conditioner separate from this really finishes things off nicely.</li>
    <li> So I have horrible winter dandruff, every year since I was a kid. Full on flake fest. Hate it but its true.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I have tried many many products over the years and am always willing to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;Truth is most products are a trade off, usually the tea-tree shampoos work by simply making my flakes smaller so they are still there but not as noticeable. The Head and shoulders type products all use the same Pyrithione zinc (1%) as an active ingredient, and you will find it here to. And the Nuke-em product of the dandruff world TAR. (yep I said it tar.) which works in extreme cases but smells like ...well tar..and leaves you with no flakes but hair that hates you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular everyday products seem to help but do note eliminate my dandruff, and worst off they seem to leave my hair scorched and dried out over time (anything more than a week.) I find myself alternating between a dandruff shampoo and a regular shampoo in an effort to have normal looking hair without the dandruff. It works maybe 6 months out of the year...then the cold season sets in and forget it...flake city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 2 products thru a vine trial..and had 2 in my bath already..&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders 2 in 1, Selsun Blue, CLEAR Men Scalp, and this product Suave Pro 2 in 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately this product fell into the regular Head and Shoulders and Selson camp....poor overall performance over time and it leaft me with dried out hair...ugh...but then I tried the CLEAR. WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was different. The CLEAR works on all fronts. I found my hair was great even after 2 weeks of daily use...no need to switch back and forth to avoid dried out look, and the flakes were gone....like totally gone. Ok so I am surprised an perplexed but happy. It has the same active ingredient to start with but whatever comes next seems to work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO in the 4 way test....this Shampoo -Suave Pro was tied with the other standards in the category.  Try the CLEAR Mens scalp for a better result long term...</li>
    <li> I have a scalp/skin issue, and when I am able to use a regular, non medicated shampoo this is a great pick.  The price is right, and the bottle is pretty large.  Not sure way it&#x27;s a mens product, the scent is not particularly strong, and seems pretty unisex to me.  Normally, I avoid the 2 in 1 shampoos, because the conditioners tend to flatten my hair and make it look dirty or greasy quicker.  This is a light conditioner, and doesn&#x27;t cause that problem.  Don&#x27;t need much, a squirt the size of a dime does it for me.  Foams great, and rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> A needed this product and I love the ease of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Cleans and conditions hair and leaves refreshing scent.  I purchased this for myself but wife loves it so much, she stopped using her shampoo and uses mine now.  Instead of buying one at a time, I am getting three bottles now so it does not run out.</li>
    <li> TEENAGER LIKES IT. HE PREFERS THE MORE, &amp;#34;MANLY&amp;#34; SMELL OVER HEAD AND SHOULDERS ORIGINAL SCENT.</li>
    <li> It is shampoo---it cleans your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time. Feels nice on my skin and under my toes. Be careful when using it on your feet though. You might slip and fall in the shower. I almost did..about two or more times.</li>
