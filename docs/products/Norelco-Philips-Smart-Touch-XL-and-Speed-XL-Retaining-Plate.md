    <li> Fit my razor and works as it should. Lost original part while cleaning the heads, so this one allows me to use the razor again.</li>
    <li> received earlier than expected. Perfect would use this vendor again for Norelco parts. I did need HQ9 Replacement heads but more expensive than others by more than 10% otherwise I would have ordered both parts.</li>
    <li> all ok with this purchase, it was the needed part, well packaged and arrived in time. all ok!</li>
    <li> My dad dropped his shaver and one of the rings on this retaining plate was broken, so this replacement was perfect. Fit was perfect and it simply works.</li>
    <li> When removing the retaining plate, the little light colored center locking piece fell off and went down the drain rendering the retainer un-lockable...so I thought.  To my surprise, in looking at the image here, I saw that it too is missing the same little piece.  Now I&#x27;ve come to realize that all I need to do is spin the larger three point black retainer clockwise to lock it.  Hence, the little piece that&#x27;s lost is not needed.</li>
    <li> I already knew the product but I did&#x27;n know I can buy it here.   It take a while to ship it, but not that bad. I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry anyway.  Good experience overall!</li>
    <li> My shaver head opened in my luggage while traveling and the plastic retaining plate broke.  The shaver was useless (except for the trimmer head) and the new retaining plate saved me from having to purchase another shaver.  Delivery to Hawaii was quick.</li>
    <li> After my dog chewed my husband&#x27;s razor, it was convenient to purchase this replacement part online. It was easy to just pop in this piece.</li>
    <li> Original retaining plate broke, bent.  I so mistreat my shavers!  These replacements are better than the original.  Work perfectly.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect replacement for the damaged part on my Norelco 7140xl.&lt;br /&gt;It matched the old one exactly. The shaver works like new.</li>
    <li> This product fits and functions just like the original.  I received it surprisingly fast and it was exactly as ordered and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AAA-1 seller.</li>
    <li> I am from Boston Ma. USA. But live now in the Philippine&#x27;s. During July - August of every year I visit Boston for 1-2 months. While there I replace, buy, or fix what is needed in my Filipino home (Electronics) then bring or ship back with me.&lt;br /&gt;None of the items that I have purchased on line from Amazon or other sellers are available in the Philippine&#x27;s. I have been buying from you for about three years now. I have no problem with the great service that I have received from Amazon and /or other on line companies. I only wish there was online Amazon buying here in the Philippines. To obtain, buy, ship, test, fit, replace is a big hassle for me (Xpats, living in other counties) Thousands living outside USA)&lt;br /&gt;The product works fine.</li>
    <li> My shaver has been broken for a while and I got this and a new head holder for my shaver for a really good price.  All the problems have been fixed with my shaver now.</li>
    <li> Could be of higher quality, it works but doesn&#x27;t latch on all the way so it comes off occasionally.  Overall it was an ok purchase</li>
    <li> Product was received on time an in great shape.  It fit my shaver perfectly and added life to it.  I would order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> my dad has an old shaver and needed this part replaced i sure didnt think we would be able to get it but we did&lt;br /&gt;find it on amazon and the price was great and we received very quickly we were thrilled as always with amazon&lt;br /&gt;service</li>
    <li> This worked great my shaver worked just like new. well worth the money as opposed to buying a new shaver</li>
    <li> Mistaken for a grandcharmers broken toy piece I threw the original retaining plate in the trash, and burned it.&lt;br /&gt; Imagine my surprise when I realized what I had done after searching for the piece for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;*FACEPALM!* UGH!&lt;br /&gt;Now what, NOW WHAT?!&lt;br /&gt;Where do you find bits and pieces?!&lt;br /&gt; Then it dawned on me, *que lightbulb over head*&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has everything. It was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I fumbled for the correct word to describe it, was it a holderthingamajigger?&lt;br /&gt;Oh happy day and happy dance when I could scroll through the \\&quot;other customers bought\\&quot; section and found what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;EUREKA!!! *que eureka music*&lt;br /&gt;Threw that baby in my cart, rounded the corner of the aisle hit the checkout with no waiting and even though it wasn&#x27;t a prime item, it still arrived in lickity split time.&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> A crucial part for my Norelco shaver broke and as the shaver was still in good shape, I wanted to replace the part.  Norelco wanted $29.00 plus shipping.  I found the same part at the Buy-It-Now Store for under $9.00--with FREE shipping.  The part is a perfect fit for my shaver.  Also, the item arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I was cleaning my razor by tapping the razor on the top of the toilet seat &amp; all the guts popped out into the toilet.  Since I was on vacation, I flushed &amp; ordered new blades and this item to lock it into place.  This actually locks my blades in better &amp; I have a razor that is as good as new now.  I&#x27;m glad I did something stupid that forced me to upgrade my razor to new working parts!</li>
    <li> This is an identical OEM replacement retaining plate for Norelco shavers. This it&#x27;s the exact piece that comes as part of your shaver making the shaver work as new.</li>
    <li> As long as you order the right make and model, you should get the right blades and cover you need for your shaver.</li>
    <li> This retaining plate is a lot stronger and stiffer than the original part, and I find it better all around. There&#x27;s not much to say about it: it&#x27;s solid, it works, and it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
    <li> This device is a fragile, flexible but wonderfully designed device that holds the blades in place.  Through some carelessness, I ruined the last retainer and needed a new one for when I replaced the blades.  The device is lightweight, functions beautifully and it working fine.  I&#x27;m very glad I was able to discover the replacement for the one I broke.</li>
    <li> Fit my requirements, exact what i was looking for long time, tried to find this prodcut in several sites with no success,&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was fast as well.</li>
    <li> The old ones finally kicked the can, was able to find replacements  via Amazon, They are exact originals, not knock offs, work and fit fine-------thanks.</li>
    <li> As stated by other reviewers this replacement seems to be even better than the original clip. Combined with the replacement shaver heads I am getting a MUCH improved shave from my four year old razor.</li>
    <li> I was emptying my beard clippings and the original part fell off and was lost.  This is an exact fit for my shaver and  it is like new again.  Thanks for saving me from having to buy an overpriced part from Phillips!</li>
    <li> How does one get excited about a razor retaining plate? What&#x27;s important is the price was great as was the handling of the order. From ordering to using it in my razor was three/four days.</li>
    <li> I was trying to decide whether to spend money on my old razor or buy a new one.  I bought these parts and fixed up my old one.  Everthing fit and worked great.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. I strongly recommend it for others.&lt;br /&gt;Very good for the price. I strongly recommend it for others.</li>
    <li> The retaining plate fixed the loose and rattling rotary head problem.  I love my old Norelco razor again!&lt;br /&gt;It was easy and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, not tampered with in any way. Fit well with my version of the electric razor, and fit the replacement heads I bought.</li>
    <li> I william J Rooney ranked the part.&lt;br /&gt;I rankes it 5 stars because of the fit and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to someone who is in the market for this product.</li>
    <li> Not a lot to say it&#x27;s a 5 star rating because it is exactly as promised, fairly priced and was delivered to our front door within 48 hours of ordering it... Pretty Impressive.</li>
    <li> If retaining plate is damaged this is the product to get.  It holds the shaver heads in place.&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly. When cleaning the razor, clean the retaining plate as well, but carefully.&lt;br /&gt;It appears the retaining plate holds the shaver heads in place, so they can &amp;#34;float&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I searched for the replacement product for a time,  and Amazon.com thank goodness has it.&lt;br /&gt;Remember as well to change shaver heads about once a year to keep the shaver performing well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works better (much better) than the original. It fits the... Let me find my razor, and then I&#x27;ll tell you. But it works great!</li>
