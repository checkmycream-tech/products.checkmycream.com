      <li>I am very pleased to have purchased this product.</li>
      <li>It has so many trimming and shaving options, it&#x27;s great quality, and affordable.</li>
      <li>It does remove hairs effectively under the chin and makes you feel good after shaving.</li>
      <li>It is great, very handy, very easy to use and to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>What I like first best is the close shave it provides without any skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyways, this works great and easy as a beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome shaver, hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>It has a fine trimmer on one end that works great on mustaches.  </li>
      <li>Both are equally effective, but I prefer the Philips&#x27;s implementation since there is no worry of knocking off the cover in the case of the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>ti is so much nice for shaving .it</li>
      <li>Charging stand is nice to have,</li>
      <li>way this is designed is really nice.</li>
      <li>You could trim side burns if you wanted or give yourself a nice trim on your mustache to a goatee or beard to a range of lengths for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>nice appearance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To end the comparison, I actually own a top-of-the-line Braun.</li>
      <li>But if you are wanting a close shave then there is probably better out there as this gets nowhere as good as my razors.</li>
      <li>Lithium Ion batter makes shaving &amp; trimming a very handy accurate system.  </li>
      <li>The razor kind of \\&quot;rests\\&quot; on the chargers, and is very easy to knock</li>
      <li>It charges quickly and holds a great charge.</li>
      <li>The Philips Norelco Styleshaver Pro was very easy to use</li>
      <li>The foil shaver was a nice surprise and works well for touching up in between blade shaves.</li>
      <li>Great that it is water resistant and is easy to clean under the tap.</li>
      <li>not as good as one would have expected for the money; marginal close shave at best.  </li>
      <li>a very clean look and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The included guards are very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I can quickly shape my beard just as I want it and keep it looking good.  </li>
      <li>The sides of my face and neck where very smooth and stayed that way most of the day.</li>
      <li>this has some great attachments and multi-functions to it that work very well.</li>
      <li>What I really love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t take oil; you just turn on the clippers and run them under the faucet.</li>
      <li>Go cheaper and get better quality.</li>
      <li>battery is ok for the price</li>
      <li>This product is finally satisfied my needs.</li>
      <li>There is a light indicator which compensates for the lack of nice click</li>
      <li>/&gt;Battery life was excellent, and despite the large-ish travel bag, you could totally do a week away from home without a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the final analysis, I found the Styleshaver to be the perfect solution for me</li>
      <li>It is up top and presses in and it stays on without accidentally turning off.</li>
      <li>and you have an excellent styling device for facial hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way I can trim my beard to keep it neat and orderly.  </li>
      <li>This thing has the foil rotary blades on the bottom and the goatee detail trimmer and beard trimmer combo on top.  </li>
      <li>The last element that makes the StyleRazor an excellent all in one tool is that it has a shaver built into the bottom of the unit.  </li>
      <li>However this is an outstanding razor.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It was ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d even say you&#x27;re getting more than what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
      <li>I was expecting better</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t sum it up any better than, read the box</li>
      <li>the final analysis, I found the Styleshaver to be the perfect solution for me</li>
      <li>maybe will spend more money overtime, but there is no reason to buy this</li>
      <li>so I seem to be getting more life out of them by using this first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I figured this version would work much better</li>
      <li>All that being said, my favorite is the [[ASIN:</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was expecting better</li>
    <li> I finally found a shaver my husband likes! It has so many trimming and shaving options, it&#x27;s great quality, and affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the third shaver I&#x27;ve tried in the last few months with the one of the others being the MANGROOMER Scruff Sculptor Pro.  I would highly recommend the the Styleshaver Pro with the caveat that the triple action rotary shaver, is pretty much like every other electric razor and won&#x27;t give you anything near the razor blade shave.  With that caveat in mind lets move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is easy to hold and the rechargeable battery is pretty standard (i.e. charges fully overnight and seems to last long enough to take it on a vacation without needing the chord).  This thing has the foil rotary blades on the bottom and the goatee detail trimmer and beard trimmer combo on top.  It comes with an attachment that you clip on the standard \\&quot;adjustment wheel\\&quot; that lets you shave your beard from 1 mm on up.  With the clip off, you get a detail-er blade that lets you have clean lines for your beard and or sideburns if thats your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my conclusion:  If you need really close total face shaves, move on.  If you are looking for something to leave you with permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (which is what I personally do) this is fine but there are better and smaller options at less than half the price.  If you keep your chin music like the guy in the picture with tight clean lines, then this is the shaver for you because it combines two different items into one package.</li>
    <li> I received this item from the Vine program, and I understand that there is not an Amazon price yet, the MSRP looks to be around $100 judging by other sites and the Norelco website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a gentleman that keeps a beard year round, I found this to be quite useful.  I have been using my regular razor blade to trim up my neck (Mach 3 Turbo usually) and since I shave my head I also use the blade above the sideburns and it can get quite tricky in that area.  I have been using a Remington beard trimmer for the length.  So what I love about this razor is that I have all in one now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks odd when you take it from the box.  One end is the standard razor, the other end has the grooming tool.  There are a few attachments included.  The charging stand is wonky and kind of cheap, but it suffices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular trimmer side does give that nice Norelco shave you&#x27;re used to.  But the actual plus is being able to trim and shorten facial fair with the other end of the tool.  It&#x27;s a neat and convenient idea.  If you&#x27;re just trimming down your entire beard but not edging it, then you probably don&#x27;t need this.  If you like to line up and sculpt your beard or goatee then this is a great tool.  It&#x27;s easier to trim around my ears than with the scary Mach 3 bloodletting razor.  So my verdict is: if you want to look like Seneca Crane in Hunger Games, then this is the tool for you.  If you just want a trim, then there are cheaper options: [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] - which is what I have been using until now.</li>
    <li> With short beard hair is not so effective, It&#x27;s hard to trim it. Great power though and good for detailing.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and battery life is good and quick to charge. The foil shaver was a nice surprise and works well for touching up in between blade shaves. The trimmer and combs work well on my goatee and sideburns, seems sturdy and zoom wheel precise. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the metal trimmer could be sharper for detailing but I like the fact this trimmer does not pull or cut like others I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m happy and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like it so much. So easy to be cleaned. doesn&#x27;t take to long to get recharged.</li>
    <li> the good thing is the product is exactly what has been shown in the amazon&lt;br /&gt;no false presentations&lt;br /&gt;i recommend both the product and the provider</li>
    <li> Nice and clean cut,  I like it</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Get a really close trim and the detail trimmer is great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco products for years, and I have long been wary of their trimmers that claim they can shape stubble. In my experience, these kinds of devices simply aren&#x27;t precise enough to give you that level of control. So I have been pleasantly surprised with the Styleshaver Pro, which is wonderfully precise - as long as you know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box, I was quite frankly flummoxed by all the possible positions. I couldn&#x27;t even tell how to put the plastic trim measuring device on! I&#x27;m glad I pressed on, because after a few minutes, it was clear how to insert all the pieces. I have used the device several times, and I really like how the plastic guide is totally clear, which lets me see exactly what I&#x27;m trimming, and gives me a finer level of control than competing brands. So far the blades are very sharp, and trim everything they go up against. I also like that there is a full fledged shaver on the bottom! This has become a one-stop-shop for my facial needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pro-tip: In order to ensure you get the exact measurement you&#x27;ve dialed in, make sure to press the plastic trimmer guide FLAT against your face. If you angle the device, you will end up cutting too much hair off. Lesson learned. RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, SEPTEMBER 2012:  I have decided to go clean-shaven, and so I have been using the shaver side more regularly. Folks, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used! It gets my upper lip area far smoother than a straight blade! It still has some issues with the neck, but no shaver works well on my neck. But overall it&#x27;s FANTASTIC. Highly highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Looked at a lot of options and settled for a Phillips. Hard to switch when you have been satisfied with their products. Feels heavy in your hands compared to the cheaper model and gives a close shave. I also love the charging stand. Haven&#x27;t tried the foil. Had a bad experience with one before but I will give this one a try.</li>
    <li> The Styleshaver Pro&#x27;s shape is ergonomically comfortable.  Trimmer guard system is sturdy, easily assembles, swaps out quickly and adjusts simply.  One issue with the adjustable system is that the guard \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; do not extend very far beyond the edge of the trimmer - so even though you have set the depth to trim to a particular hair length, if you angle the unit while in motion, the trim blade distance from face can vary dramatically.  This design is common, but my old trimmer worked differently. If you&#x27;re changing over from a different style of trimmer and not quite awake your results may end with some areas balder than others (it wasn&#x27;t major - I won&#x27;t even notice in a day!).&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a good, compact unit.  Charging stand is nice to have, even though it initially seemed as possibly frail on visual inspection, it&#x27;s really quite sturdy and folds flat for easy travel.  There&#x27;s also an indicator light more stylish than most for letting you know when full charge has been achieved.  It comes with two different adjustable trimmer guards, and one cover for the reverse micro screen side.  Many beard trimming kits come with a number of additional attachments and specialized bits - this does away with most of that, though it does have a rotating trimmer head for two different trimmer widths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say use with care if you&#x27;re an \\&quot;up-grooming-before-fully-awake\\&quot; user, but beyond that this is a tidy little unit for home/travel needs.</li>
    <li> My friend says it works wonderfully on his beard, but would have preferred a device that stayed attached to the shaver so he didn&#x27;t have to keep track of small pieces which are easy to misplace.</li>
    <li> I have been a blade man when it has come to shaving. Since my days when I joined the Navy and your face had to be clean shaven every day I found to save yourself the grief of trying to say you shaved with an electric razor I stuck with blade shaving. However since those days I have tried the Philips Norelco Styleshaver.  I grow a goatee and keep the side of my face and neck clean shaven. The Styleshaver produced an almost blade like shave. It did not tear my face up like I thought it might. The sides of my face and neck where very smooth and stayed that way most of the day. I was extremely impressed with the beard trimming tools that came with it. You could trim side burns if you wanted or give yourself a nice trim on your mustache to a goatee or beard to a range of lengths for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be using this feature for years to come.  It has a lustrous look and battery charger and stand since I have been using it now for almost a month the battery has not yet died or needed recharging. It also has a carry bag to keep everything in. If you love an electric shave the Styelshaver I think will make you happy if you need something to trim facial hair this has some great attachments and multi-functions to it that work very well. It&#x27;s design sits very comfortable in your and works really well.</li>
    <li> perfect for my needs, I dont have very rough or heavy beard; serves the purpose. battery is ok for the price</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Styleshaver Pro was very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;and worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;It gave a very close and clean shave without any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw my husband after using this, I thought he shaved, it looked and felt so clean, I had to ask him if he used it.&lt;br /&gt;Face looked cleaner than if used an expensive razor and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer worked amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Left a very clean look and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my husbands go to shaver.</li>
    <li> Works well. Big plus..... you can also shave with it</li>
    <li> Oh, i LOVE IT, should have it earlier !</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely fashion. I opened it immediately and since i didn&#x27;t cut the hair off of my face on purpose. I got to use both end. It was an awesome tool. and it wasn&#x27;t annoy to use because the loud humming sound some shavers can have. It left my face soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I will be shaving everyday with this one.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  I was looking for a good quality beard trimmer and detailer that was highly adjustable and could produce a very close trim.  This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and the foil shaver is just an added bonus.  I usually shave with a razor and just use the trimmer for my goatee, but the foil razor gives me the option if I&#x27;m in a hurry, or don&#x27;t need a blade-close shave (I&#x27;ve never found an electric that can shave as close as a blade).  I&#x27;m blonde and don&#x27;t have what I would call a &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; beard, but I don&#x27;t see any fault with this product in terms of it being able to do what it says it will do.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this guy, I had a much cheaper version of the Philips Norelco series that lasted for a year and worked GREAT (and only cost $27). I figured this version would work much better and though it feels a lot more durable, when it comes down to actually cutting hairs, it does an poor and uneven job. I think it&#x27;s because the plastic protective thing is too bulky and the ridges in it are too thin. It can&#x27;t really grab the hairs properly and forces you to go over and over again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this thing at all.</li>
    <li> Foil head portion fine. Clipper side below average. Jack of all trades, and a master of none. Stick to the rule of thumb: right tool for the job theory.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Styleshaver Pro is a prime example of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.  After buying and being disappointed in two electric shavers under $20, using this for the first time was refreshing.  The \\&quot;Triple Action Foil Shaver\\&quot; side of this shaver does not get an incredibly smooth shave like you expect from an actual blade.  However, it does provide a close and good enough shave for when time does not permit a full shave.  In all actuality, it was much closer and smoother of a shave than I expected from any electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories included are helpful, and while I may not keep a beard, the trimmer attachments are nice for cleaning around the ears and back of the neck.  The charger and stand is convenient for keeping everything out of the way but not appearing cluttered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first using this I would suggest not getting too discouraged if you experience slight irritation after shaving.  If you have never used an electric razor before...there will be a certain level of acclimation that your skin will need to experience.  Give it a week and you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase!</li>
    <li> Summary:  An all-in-one shaver and trimmer for your face--whether you want a clean shave, short beard, or few days scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Relatively quiet--which allows one to hear the hairs being cut by the foil shaver (letting one know if there are still hairs being cut or if the area is clean)&lt;br /&gt; - Foil heads do a good job of not uncomfortably pulling the hairs (which I have found other razors, especially on the neck, to do)&lt;br /&gt; - Trimmer rotates to allow quick change from a full-face trimmer to a detailed trimmer&lt;br /&gt; - Lithium-ion battery lasts long and full recharge takes only 1 hour&lt;br /&gt; - Water cleanup&lt;br /&gt; - No oiling required&lt;br /&gt; - Fits comfortable in the hand, despite its long length&lt;br /&gt; - 2-year warranty (extended by six months free if you register)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Cheap stand&lt;br /&gt; - Removing foil head protective cover can also remove the heads if you squeeze a little too hard (this is just a nit-picky comment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closing:  Shaving your face with an electric shaver will always take more time than a regular razor. When using an electric shaver, shaving a few days worth of stubble will usually leave stray hairs.  However, the nice thing about this shaver is that you can quickly rotate it in your hand to trim the stray hairs and then rotate back to finish them off.</li>
    <li> 2 years later it still works great</li>
    <li> Not bad but for 0.5mm you have to trim same place more than once.  ould suggest it only if you face problem shaving like shave bumps. But there should be better alternates in the market.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer is a versatile tool that allows you to shave and trim your beard, goatee or mustache. I liked when I saw it, and it worked fine right out of the box (logically, had to charge the battery first, but it did not take long). I don&#x27;t give it five stars because it did not fully satisfy the needs in my particular case: the trimmer settings allow to cut beard hair to a length of just over half-an-inch long; that is too short for me, as my beard hair is coarse and the beard feels like tiny razor wires. Although the information on the product packaging is correct, somewhere else I had read a product evaluation that stated it would cut beards up to just over an inch long. I wish this trimmer could actually do it. I am keeping it for its other features, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit 2 years ago. It is very under-powered, not giving an even trim. The shaver is very poor. I have to go over the same spot many times, even with very short facial hair. The battery is also pretty much worthless. It stopped holding a charge a little after a year.</li>
    <li> This razor is sharp and can cut your neck and side burns when using it. the shaver blade is plastic under the screen and can break easily and the hair trimmer/cutter gets dislodged and can get lost often. It also does an awful job shaving under your neck and chin. not recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> What a fantabulous shaver. I have tried many other shavers, but none of them cut as close as this one. I am truly satisfied with the performance. I highly recommend that you purchase this shaver.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is nice with all of the height settings and the smaller side for detail trimming.  I&#x27;ve never used a foil shaver before and so far it seems to work well plus the replacement heads are a lot cheaper than the rotary heads</li>
    <li> This is one razor I am really glad to see because it not only puts the trimming and sculpting tool with the normal shaver but also because it also puts it with a normal electric razor. I like the triple spinning heads and all but i like a straight line razor better, especially when I want a shave and the hair on my face is long. I know it is only pain, but having hair pulled along your chin and neck because it yanks it out is not fun and a straight line razor does it a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way this is designed is really nice. You have a button on the back that works as a dual on/off switch. You push whichever side you want to use, the razor or the sculptor, and then push that same button again to turn it off. Simple. The sculptor has two sizes on it, and it has different prefab ends to slide onto the razor to do the cutting. They slide on and off really well and the way it is designed makes cleaning it a breeze. I use the thing without one sometimes if i just want to trim up, but you can put them on and pop them off with little to no effort at all, making it where anyone could use it - even if you had a wrist issue or something. The other side is shown in pictures of the razor and is really good to use and, like i noted before, nice since it doesn&#x27;t rely on all those small spinning pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked a small bag with it or something for the heads, but that is just nitpicking. Really, this is a superb machine and does the job great. It also replaces the use of multiple tools, which is really nice because i get tired of keeping up with them. The battery life is well beyond what i expected too, lasting a long time. I charged it and went out of town last week, and then went again four days later. The shaver was still on the first charge. Can&#x27;t go wrong that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I have had several trimmers in my bearded past and although this one is pretty snazzy the focus definitely wasnt where i felt it should be: ergonomics. Oh well I will continue my search :(</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep things under control during Movember. Used it for about a week so far. No problems with the product or the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It does everything it says it will pretty well. Not perfect, but well. If you&#x27;re not aiming for a just-out-from-the-barber look, you can take care of just about any sort of mo/beard you can grow with this one piece of equipment. I can&#x27;t sum it up any better than, read the box and that&#x27;s what you get. I like that in a product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a little flimsy. Don&#x27;t drop it, be careful when you&#x27;re putting it in the charger or taking it apart to clean it. It&#x27;s not a razor you&#x27;d want to keep in your workshop or your gym bag. It&#x27;s not crappy, just not sturdy. And it&#x27;s not going to give you a professional shave. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, spend the money on it. Or learn to use a blade. People have mentioned that the foil is pretty disappointing. It is compared to a $250 razor. It&#x27;s pretty good for what you&#x27;re paying here. But, yes, you have to be patient and careful and go over trouble spots a few times. I&#x27;ve never had a $50 razor where that wasn&#x27;t true. If you have, please share!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: For the price, this is a fantastic piece of facial cutlery. I&#x27;d even say you&#x27;re getting more than what you&#x27;re paying for. I&#x27;m not convinced it will last forever, but I&#x27;m convinced I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth by the time I need to replace it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. works great. easy to use. nice appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied so far. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. Good power great functionality.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shaver, hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. The one issue that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that when you are using the medium size shaver the size inhibits most small movements. The larger head sticks out away from the body, so it&#x27;s easier to manipulate, the smaller head is almost flush with the main body, it really become uncomfortable. Aside from that one issue, great device, quick charge time, and it&#x27;s a very reliable unit.</li>
    <li> I stretched for this one - it seemed far too expensive for a beard trimmer. However, the extra cash may have purchased me just the product I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head gets very close for the stubble look, and honestly doesn&#x27;t irritate or catch at all without the guard. The included guards are very comfortable. The shaver head obviously wont provide the perfect close shave, but I use it on my neck, and it seems to be a viable substitute for a normal razor when I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it stands the test of time. These things seem to have such a short lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** edit **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve changed my review to three stars. The shaver head just kind of sucks. I&#x27;ve stopped using it altogether, which is a bit of shame. Trimmer still works great, though.</li>
    <li> Great Razor close shave each time, great for skin that likes to produce razor bumps if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Great price when I brought it.</li>
    <li> A great everyday shaver! my second itteration from the same series, and my third Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dual heads,&lt;br /&gt;Available replaceable razors from Philips&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting batteries ( i recharge it once every 3 weeks almost) for a &amp;#60;5 minutes 5 days a week trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of water resistant&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Very neat dock/charger&lt;br /&gt;Travel bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Replaceable razors are like 25% the price of a new one&lt;br /&gt;i wish it had a 0.25 precision trimming</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad that Norelco cancelled this model because it is the only face shaver with a beard-and-sideburns trimmer.  Buy it before stocks run out.  It was a bid mistake for Norelco to cancel this model.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close and has cut me a couple of times.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Go cheaper and get better quality.</li>
    <li> What I really love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t take oil; you just turn on the clippers and run them under the faucet. I can&#x27;t use the foil shaver on my face or neck (I have sensitive skin and tough hairs) but it works fine on upper arm hair. :) I mainly use the clipper/trimmer function. I wouldn&#x27;t use this product as your go-to shaver for your face unless you have very fine hairs and not many of them.</li>
    <li> ti is so much nice for shaving .it has good batrry long life and also beutiful shap modren one . i like it</li>
    <li> I previously owned a high quality Norelco shaver and was very satisfied. Lately I&#x27;ve been sporting the scruffy look so I gave my shaver to my father and purchased this one. I the idea behind the duality of having a beard trimmer and shaver was very appealing but the execution is very disappointing. It is hard to get an even trim with the clippers. I find that the comb for the trimmers does not adequately lift the hair for trimming, long or short hair, and furthermore one of the combs alignment is just plain off in regards to it&#x27;s placement to the blades. Although I have only used the shaver portion a few times, it is far below the quality of my previous Norelco shaver. I regret giving my other shaver away. I think I would have been more satisfied with a set of traditional Wahl clippers. I&#x27;m am dissatisfied enough that I will unfortunately I be obliged to give these away have buy a better set of clippers and a new shaver. Norelco&#x27;s top of the line shavers are excellent and I will probably buy their shaver again, but I would not recommend their beard trimmers.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco All-in-one Styler &amp; Shaver is a high-performing, multi-functional electric shaver with cordless operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, what I like second best about this shaver is that it only takes an hour to charge and then is good to go for 50 minutes or for some 10 shaves. What I like first best is the close shave it provides without any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The triple action, twin foil system provides a close shave without little effort - no stretching of skin or running over the same area twice. While other shavers I&#x27;ve used require an after-shave lotion or cr&amp;egrave;me, the All-in-one cuts close to the skin without irritation. I also made good use of the sideburn trimming feature and found it superior to other sideburn trimmers. The sideburn trimmer, also used for goatees, comes with reversible 5/8 inch and 17/64 inch settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with beard, mustache and goatee trimmers but since I lack all three I cannot comment those functions. The beard-trimmer does come with a zoom wheel of 12 length settings from 1/32 inch to 13/32 inch. The set includes a beard comb and a detail comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The All-in-one is water resistant so it is very easy to clean under the tap. The shaver also is maintenance free - no oiling needed. An LED indicator light shows when a battery recharge is needed. Add to this a two-year warranty that can be extended by six months free when registering and you can shave with comfort and security knowing everything will be taken care of if needed.</li>
    <li> Sometimes when you get a multi-function device like this, each function is only mediocre.  I was pleasantly surprised with this all-in-one electric razor/beard trimmer.  The shave function gives a close and easy shave.  The beard trimmer also works well.  The only minor complaint is that the charger system involves using a fairly flimsy stand--you cannot just plug in the charger.  Otherwise, I found this to be a great all-in-one trimmer and shaver.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> This is an odd little machine that takes a few attempts to become comfortable using. In fact, the first time out, the beard trim was actually a bit closer than expected..nothing critical but closer than anticipated. The shave itself was superb and the closest to manual/safety razor I&#x27;ve encountered to date. Just be warned, start off with a bit more distance especially when trimming the beard etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the actual product itself. This is lightweight yet still feels solid enough when handling. It&#x27;s an odd little shape with both up/down orientation - something new to this old goat. Speaking of goats...I wear what is commonly considered a goatee (although not a true one for all those purists out there) so use both the trim and shave portion. The shave itself was very close - much nicer than expected although not quite as close as manual safety razors. However, on those days when a quick shave is needed...this is the new ticket. Fast, convenient and provides a nice close shave with little/no irritation (it should be noted, I&#x27;m not prone to sensitive skin so others may have a different experience but it is notably less irritating than typical rotary types).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is simple enough and the provided carry case makes a nice addition especially when traveling or just to hold all the attachments. Now, as far as the attachments go - they are a bit of a pain to keep up with but that is to be expected and not limited to this edition alone. One thing I didn&#x27;t like is the recharging stand...it feels cheap and doesn&#x27;t provide a definitive &#x27;lock&#x27; sound or feel nor is it very sturdy. There is a light indicator which compensates for the lack of nice click but overall, the stand is the weak link in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this provides a great shave with more than ample adjustments for both shaving and beard trim/other maintenance. Very nice recharge, comes complete with accessories, travel bag, etc...cleaning and maintenance is super simple and all in all...a terrific product!all in all...a terrific product!</li>
    <li> UNBOXING&lt;br /&gt;The razor does look modern and feels comfortable and expensive. There is a charging stand included (you cannot just plug a wire into it), a carrying case, a trimming comb and a detail comb, and a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TESTING&lt;br /&gt;In the shaving department, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the razor. It just works ok, but if you are used to Norelco&#x27;s foil shaver like this, it should be fine for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for trimming, there is a rotary dial with 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10mm lengths available. At this price point, I was disappointed not to have more choices like on the [[ASIN:B004PXIR1W Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer, Gray]], which has a digital screen and motor to move the comb. When I did choose 1.5mm and trim, the blades don&#x27;t move all that fast, and I need to go over my beard over and over (4-8 times) to get it fully trimmed. The Conair can blast through so much faster. All that being said, my favorite is the [[ASIN:B005GIS3A0 Remington MB4550T Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Mustache and Beard Trimmer with Exclusive Touch Control]], despite its awful ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the charging base to be annoying, especially for traveling since you can&#x27;t just bring the charging cable. I suppose that need to design it without a outlet on the razor since it is \\&quot;water resistant.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, you can run the blades under water to clean them and the trimmer side is very easy to clean with a simple design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t like either side enough to use it regularly, I&#x27;m sticking with my old $25 Remington razor an Remington trimmer mentioned above for now.</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco products are quite impressive, and I have owned several, but the razor cutting just never compares to the good old fashioned razor blade devices.  One always needs to go over and over surfaces to get a clean cut.  And, like the other Norelcos I have owned, they come equipped with a charging stand.  The charge lasts a long time and it is a lithium battery.  The razor comes with 12 length for various sizes of beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to pack up for quick trips.  It is light, looks good, and The product is well made, but as others might agree, these shavers don&#x27;t compare to the good old fashioned blade.  The good news is it comes with a 2-year warranty.  These little shavers offer many choices, and it is not that difficult to figure out.  It also comes with a user guide, so hang on to that.  .....Rizzo</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re travelling and space is at a premium, this is a brilliant product. Beyond that... well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a beard trimmer / groomer, this model is pretty decent. It keeps the arched ergonomics of Philips trimmers going back to the 90&#x27;s. In the hand, it feels totally solid, almost upscale. Unfortunately, Philips-Norelco just can&#x27;t seem to let go of using chintzy hair guards, and it&#x27;s maddening. The flimsy plastic guards make something that feels quite expensive in to something very cheap-feeling, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another ergonomic quirk: the open-air charging base looks very cool, and would be fine standing alongside the sink if you lived alone, or were in a hotel room, but in a family bathroom, forget about it. The razor kind of \\&quot;rests\\&quot; on the chargers, and is very easy to knock down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shaving quality, the beard trimmer is very good. I&#x27;m accustomed to the \\&quot;twist-a-number\\&quot; guard settings, and shave consistency is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the razor side, it&#x27;s not as good. My go-to razor is a [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7]], which in its own right, isn&#x27;t the most comfortable razor around. The one on the Styleshaver, however, is pretty bad. It seemed to me that it was continually pulling hair, rather than cutting it. The razor burn was something awful, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life was excellent, and despite the large-ish travel bag, you could totally do a week away from home without a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a trip, or in a pinch, this is great. I just can&#x27;t fathom having to use it every day.</li>
    <li> I handed this to my brother for his use and evaluation. This shaver charges within an hour, giving you about the same amount of shaving time. Great that it is water resistant and is easy to clean under the tap. In addition, it is portable to bring this along on travels. It does remove hairs effectively under the chin and makes you feel good after shaving. Overall, this product is recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a hairy face. A 2 1/2 inch beard, sideburn/chinstraps that are thick. This was the best rated shaver that wasn&#x27;t over priced. It was ok, it just could not give me a close shave at all. I had to revert back to the old one I had that gave me skin burn, and it still gave me a closer shave. If you have soft hair it might work for you, just couldn&#x27;t do that job for me.</li>
    <li> Yes it is a bit pricey &amp; the trimmers are not so hot. However this is an outstanding razor.  With the Lithium Ion battery it last and is easy to recharge.  Lithium Ion batter makes shaving &amp; trimming a very handy accurate system.  Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Used it a few times and stopped working. The shaver side still works but the trimmer/clipper side will only work if I mash the power button down and hold it that way until it locks. I went back to using the set I got 10 yrs ago for 12 dollars.</li>
    <li> I love the way I can trim my beard to keep it neat and orderly.  I used to attempt this with scissors but ultimately have never been successful. Now it is easy to do and painless.  I can quickly shape my beard just as I want it and keep it looking good.  I am excited.  I am not used to shaving with a electric razor and do not get the same results as I do with a soap and a sharp razor.  Nonetheless, I am happy with this item that will keep me from looking like a dishelveled old man.</li>
    <li> The product in question arrived at my house brocken. I did attempt to charge and use the opposite end which did work. Ultimately I did return the product for a full refund.</li>
    <li> The Norelco SyleRazor Pro is a very effective all in one tool for anyone that has facial hair.  It has a fine trimmer on one end that works great on mustaches.  It also has a  larger clipper on the other side that works equally well with thicker beards.  I occasionally like to grow out a thick stubble or a goatee and this razor allows me to perfectly trim and style without having to pull out an arsenal of trimming equipment.  The last element that makes the StyleRazor an excellent all in one tool is that it has a shaver built into the bottom of the unit.  This allows you clean up the areas you don&#x27;t want hair to grow in without having to fiddle with another device.  The results I get from an electric shaver are not as clean as what I get with a normal razor but the fact that everything is included in one device make this a great travel companion and excellent for getting styling your face without having to fuss with multiple razors.  Add to this excellent battery life and you have an excellent styling device for facial hair.</li>
    <li> The Style Razor is not any better than the Braun or other Norelco products I have tried.  The shaver function is not very good, it leaves a lot of uncut hair on my neck.  The beard cutter works as well as the others but no better.  The battery does charge in one hour and lasts about two weeks in normal use.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this razor, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t settle this razor is easy to use, works great and has given me zero issues thus far. Holds a charge well, and the length options are very helpful. I have noticed that sometimes it has trouble cutting longer hairs on my face/neck that I have to go back with a wet razor. Overall this is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again without question.</li>
    <li> This razor works well, BUT, be very careful in the beginning, if tipped wrong, the razor WILL remove your beard in a heart beat.  Took a couple of weeks to get used to, and now I use it regularly.  The foil razor it is terrible, unless you use it daily, which I don&#x27;t.  It pulls the stubble badly!</li>
    <li> I already wrote!excellent seller, excellent product!)</li>
    <li> This product is finally satisfied my needs. I have recommended it for all my friend they bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I keep my neck skin smooth but keep stubble on my face. Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t do a great job on my cheeks. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong but it simply doesn&#x27;t do a good job lifting the hairs to cut them. Other than that it&#x27;s great. Super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor. I&#x27;m able to clean up and keep a short beard with a weekly trim and clean up the neck stubble as needed with this. Travels well and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> not as good as one would have expected for the money; marginal close shave at best.  bought it to replace a braun, but need both to do the job.  bummer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a full beard for more than 35 years. In that time I&#x27;ve shaved using various razors and electric shavers. I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard using scissors or electric trimmers. The bottom line has always been at least two different devices to do the job. After giving the Philips Norelco Styleshaver Pro a two week tryout I can officially cut that number to one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with two trimming combs (one open and one closed), an AC adapter, a charging stand, cleaning brush, shaver cover and a case to carry it all in. The device is fairly large and has a good heavy feel in the hand. The shaver is located on one end, the trimmer on the other end. The Styleshaver is well balance and the weight sitting on the ends allows for the area held in the hand to act as a pivot point. This makes the device easy to maneuver around tight spaces and facial contours. The Styleshaver Pro is easy to \\&quot;drive\\&quot; and light on its feet for a device of its size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shaver it works well. I&#x27;ve always found that how well electric shavers work depends, in large part, on the type of beard you have. My whiskers are coarse and thick. So it takes some work for an electric shaver to get the job done. Electric shavers work alright for me, but I&#x27;ve never considered the finished product to be comparable to a razor. While the Styleshaver Pro fits into that category, it provided a shave as close as any of the dozen or so electric shavers I&#x27;ve used over the years. The shaver powers on with a press of the thumb switch. it has a multi bar LED power indicator similar to a cell phone and my unit came with a full charge. I found the shave to be close and my face didn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;cheese grater\\&quot; sting that comes after tangling with some electric shavers. The blade cover removes easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the Styleshaver Pro really shines as a trimmer. It has plenty of power. The blades are sharp and as I said before, the unit is easy to \\&quot;maneuver\\&quot;. One quick warning: This thing really cuts well. However you plan to use it, take your time and think a minute about what you plan to do. When I first started to trim my beard, I neatly mowed off a big swath of a side burn when I let my attention wander for a moment. The combs clip into a slot in the top of the shaver housing just behind the cutting head. the depth is controlled by a thumb wheel. I really like the way this trimmer feels and cuts. It also works well to even up bangs, and other haircut chores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I found for the Philips Norelco Styleshaver Pro is the little folding recharge stand that comes with it. The stand is designed to hold the unit upright while it isn&#x27;t in use, it also charges the unit via contact points on both sides of the unit. The stand is so light that it hangs onto the shaver when you try to lift it off of it, but this is a very minor drawback for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final analysis, I found the Styleshaver to be the perfect solution for me and I plan to make it a permanent part of my daily grooming routine. I highly recommend it.is thing really cuts well. However you plan to use it, take your time and think a minute about what you plan to do.

    <li> I liked the idea of a real clipper/trimmer on the same product as an electric shaver.  The lenth settings for the trimmer are simple and solid, and it comes with 2 types of guard to choose from to assist in getting the exact lenth needed without &#x27;poking&#x27; sensitive areas if that is a problem for you.  The head swivels to allow for either a standard clipper, or a small width detail trimmer.  Both work excellent, the detail trimmer shaves skin close without cutting or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple and effective charging base is included.  It is strudy and well balanced, folding neatly for storage or travel.  This unit charges very quickly and retained its charge for over a week of my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for this product came with the electric shaver.  It simply was not made to cut the hair on my face.  Maybe it works great for others, or the testers must have had thin, brittle whiskers.  I had to go over, and over, and over, and over the same area so many times before any sort of shave was performed that the razor burn actually darkened and would have scabbed over if I had not kept product on it.  After a couple weeks of effort, I determined if you do a quick shave twice a day, it works acceptably, anything more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and it doesnt work.  The other option is to use the detail trimmer to reduce the length to the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, then use the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a great idea.  The clipper portion is excellent.  The shaver portion, at least for me, was worthless.  It may work great for others, but it didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I still had to try it since it sounded so good and it was time for something new :)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t add much that has not been said but here is my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foil shaver (7/10)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; closest I got was that &#x27;1 day after&#x27; look only typical areas (jaw bone and cheeks) would get a close shave after some persistent passing. Neck/throat...forget it, irritation galore but might might work for those with thinner beards. Beats the purpose if it takes longer than a razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer (9/10)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; very nice but guard can be tricky and you can create patches even though the guard stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styler/Detailer ? (3/10)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;  it is just a smaller sized trimmer without ability to style anything that has not been styled with a razor, pointless since you can not get down to 0.0mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is nicely designed and ergonomic, solid feel in hand, potentially frail stand/charger and rotating heads mechanism - overall not worth the cost for the function. If they just made a trimmer/detailer out of this that can drop to 0.0mm trim and priced at $20-$30 I would reconsider.</li>
    <li> This I good trimmer/razor, I bought this to replace the last one of the same model because the trimmer head got lost while traveling.</li>
    <li> Only used it once, both cutters works well and it will suite my needs</li>
    <li> poor quality, it doesnt do the job. i will stay with gillette razors. maybe will spend more money overtime, but there is no reason to buy this</li>
    <li> My husband, who has a beard, has always complained about trimmers and shavers, just trying to find a quality product.  He was very impressed with this styler and its versatility and quality.  We recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very bad experience as machine was not powerful, had to cover the same area many times. Shaver is useless. Poor.</li>
    <li> Side note, I almost entitled this \\&quot;Great for bears!!\\&quot; but caught it before submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this works great and easy as a beard trimmer. It did take me a little bit to figure out how the attachments go on, but once you figure it out this works quite well on beards (or in my case, goatees) and trimming around those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t so great as a shaver. It seems like no matter how much I shave with this I can never seem to get close enough for me to be happy. I find I use the shaver as a way to get my stubble so it isn&#x27;t so thick and then I have an easier time with my razor. But the nice thing is that my razors don&#x27;t have to work as hard so I seem to be getting more life out of them by using this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something for trimming, I highly recommend this. But if you are wanting a close shave then there is probably better out there as this gets nowhere as good as my razors.</li>
    <li> This stylerazor pro performs like a champ.  It never pinches and always has cut clean.  It is perfect for trims of both the beard/mustache and sideburns.  I have even used it to trim my eyebrows using a comb to help so it&#x27;s not too short.  Overall this has performed great and has always exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> the trimmer is nice the shaving side is ok but still does not do a perfect job. I still need to use a disposable to make it a perfect job</li>
    <li> Great battery life,  good trimmer, the shaver part can be better...</li>
    <li> This is a comparative review of the [[ASIN:B007VB50JW Philips Norelco QS6160/50 StyleRazor Pro]] vs. [[ASIN:B008KEJ1US Panasonic ES-Sl41-W Shaver]]. I received both through the Amazon Vine program and have used the former for over two months and the latter for the last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they are not at the same price point, with the former being almost double the price. So the question is: is the Philips really better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give you the punchline first: yes, the Philips does give me a closer shave. This is done by a simple test: shave with one first, and listen carefully while shaving with the other. If you ask me, this alone settles the discussion since the Philips also does the grooming better and can thus justify the extra cost. However, I think it is still worth comparing them so that you know the tradeoffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving, the Philips foil is noticeably thinner. This is why it gives a closer shave, but the foil is also more fragile (so don&#x27;t drop it). The Panasonic boosts wet/dry shaving capability. What that means is that it has a switch/door that allows water to come out and carry the debris away from the bottom of the chamber through the door when you rinse it. If you do this with the Philips, the water will just fill up the chamber. Whether wet shaving is important to you is quite personal. For the record I did try shaving wet a few times with the Panasonic, but the Philips always pick up some afterwards. To end the comparison, I actually own a top-of-the-line Braun. I can tell you that you really need to press very hard on the Braun to pick up anything after the Philips. Kudos to Philips for matching Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of grooming, the Panasonic is pretty basic. There is just a trimmer that you pop up. In comparison, the Philips have two attachments with 10 height settings. The trimmer also has a small size that can be used alone, giving you a lot of control on where to trim. I use it on the sideburn all thetime. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of battery, both are excellent off the box. In fact, I was able to get over ten shaves with each. Bear in mind that these are new shavers and so the battery life should be pretty good. I will come back and revise if they fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of charging, both comes with a charging station that are fairly big. The Philips seems pretty fragile and I am afraid of breaking it when I use it. But it folds and so it is acceptable. The Panasonic is rock solid and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of traveling, the Philips comes with a snap-on foil cover and has a lock mode (hold the power button for a few seconds), whereas the Panasonic has a snap-on foil cover that extends to cover the power button. Both are equally effective, but I prefer the Philips&#x27;s implementation since there is no worry of knocking off the cover in the case of the Panasonic. The Philips is a lot heavier than the Panasonic one though. At least 1.5 times heavier, if not twice. (But once you factor in the weight of the charging station, the two are quite equal.) The Philips does come with its travel pouch and a small cleaning brush, so I guess they assume you will travel with it. The Panasonic does not come with any accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottomline is: unless wet shaving is important to you, I think you should shell out for the Philips. The Panasonic is a decent shaver, but frankly, it does not seem wise to spend half of what you can use towards a shaver that gets you a closer shave, is it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of guy who can grow a full beard in a few days, and trust me, I hate shaving. So, when I do get around to shaving, it usually takes me a good half hour with just a razor. With the trimmer on this though, it takes only a few minutes. The actual electric razor part of this is okay, average at best, but the trimmer is great for getting rid of thick beard hair, and trimming my gottee down to a more... manageable size.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this razor simply because I&#x27;ve never used one from this manufacturer nor had I met anyone who had.  I was also concerned that a multipurpose type of razor wouldn’t perform well either.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the trimmer head adjustments are consistent and it leaves a nice even cut.  I would like it to operate at a higher speed, I believe it would not pull as much if it would.</li>
    <li> It is great, very handy, very easy to use and to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual is kind of too simple for n00bs like me though.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I think the offical commercial video explains better than the instruction sheet.</li>
    <li> works well and gets plenty of shaves</li>
    <li> Amazing piece of machinery! However it needs practice to get the full hang of it.</li>
    <li> I recently got a new phillips hair/beard trimmer 7000 series, cause I needed longer length options for my beard. I wanted to write a review for this product because I have used it for around 3-3.5 yrs and will stIill use it for other parts of my beastly body that needs to be maintainted lol.  It is strong, fairly quite, light weight, easy to use and clean. Its sharpness has just recently began to dull out, occasionally pull hairs, but I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and have never sharpened or properly maintained the blades so I&#x27;m surprised it lasted this long. I am very pleased to have purchased this product. And recommend anyone who is looking to maintain a short beard to grab one.  I do want to point out that I barley used the shaver side of the unit, I prefer rockin a beard. However, I have used it against my neck and it didn&#x27;t shave close enough to not have to use a razor. To me that eliminates the purpose of the shaver. That&#x27;s the only reason I rated it a 4/5. But the trimmer alone is worth the price for sure.  I&#x27;m happy to have bought this product, if it had longer length options, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a new one. Thanks Phillips.</li>
    <li> I am the caretaker of my sick father. I kept this at my house so he could use it when he needed to be taken care of. This is the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is well made with a good weight without being too heavy. It charges quickly and holds a great charge. The low battery light has not been on yet it seems to hold a good charge. The charger has a small and light footprint. The light can be a con though as when pulling the razor out, the base has to be held to get the razor out of the whole charger comes up.  It feels really good in your hand, a lot are not comfortable but this one is. It is really easy to clean, just pop the top off and shake it out. Power button is conveniently located. It is up top and presses in and it stays on without accidentally turning off. Trimmers are at the bottom and they are held in very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After shaving a day and half later, you have to shave again where other razors you could go up to three days. Other razors would pull it from the roots where this one just seems to go lightly across the face and not pull the hair from the roots. The numbers for the closeness do not seem to matter. You can have it at the lowest to the highest and it does not seem to matter too much. Shaving and trimmers should not be together, one is not going to be what you want and you will only be using one.  Using it primarily for the shaver because it does not last long on facial hair, you may end up going back to your older razor.</li>
    <li> My husband found this very difficult to get the hang of for trimming is goatee - twice he made a mistake and took a chunk off and then had to just shave it off altogether.  He finally gave up and went back to his old school beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
    <li> SHOULD&#x27;VE BOUGHT ONE A LONG TIME AGO!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!</li>
    <li> This does not work properly. Its cutting my skin while trimming and the size numbers does not work too. it does not matter which number you put it, it always trims to size zero.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Styleshaver Pro is an excellent hair trimming product. I used the trimmer to cut my beard and the attachments were easy to use, with little fuss involved. The razor on the other end was useful in trimming down a few days stubble. Charging is easy with the stand and the razor itself comes apart easily for cleaning. This is an affordable all around beard trimming kit, and I would highly reccomend this for anyone needing such a product.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product twice, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric razor portion gave me an EXTREMELY close shave, while clipper portion along with the beard guard allowed me to bring down the brush on my face to a more acceptable length without investing an inordinate amount of time into the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should there be no issues of longevity with the product, I see this being a purchase that I will not regret!</li>
    <li> Great razor. The shave is smooth and easy and the trim is easy and precise.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick stubble, so I usually wet shave. I thought I would give electric shavers another try, but was disappointed. It took forever to shave my face and neck, I kept having to go over the same areas again and again, till finally I gave up and just busted out the old shaving cream and razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the trimmer to trim down my goatie every week or so, but I don&#x27;t really have a use for the electric shaver.</li>
