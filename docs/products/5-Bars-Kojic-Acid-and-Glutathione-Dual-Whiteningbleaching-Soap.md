<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product delivered in 2 days as promised.  This soap will fade age spots but don&#x27;t try to leave it on your skin because it can break down your skin that way.  Wash for 30 to 60 seconds daily for a whiter, clearer complexion.</li>
    <li> Omgosh!!! Works better than just the kojic acid soap alone.  I&#x27;m a brown skinned blk woman and I&#x27;m really getting lighter and I do it on my skin for 30 minutes before washing it off. No side effects for over a month now. Works quick too. I have to slow down use to not go too far. I also use a fade cream along side but the soap works better.  WARNING THOUGH IT FRIED MY NIPPLES AS THE SUDS WASHED OVER THEM.  BUT THEY TOO ARE 3 SHADES LIGHTENED.  bought large packages again for maintenance of my new glowing lightened complexion.  THIS IS AN HONEST REVIEW GOOD LUCK.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works and works fast I had to slow down because skin turning light too quick I am now working on neck left face alone I am ordering a new pack of soap and this time cream to go with it. My knees are the same complexion as my thighs now it is very pretty I am so happy I found this.  .</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago and I&#x27;ve only used the soap three times, and all I can say is this is some strong stuff! Be careful using it on your face! I burned my cheek and lip but it peeled within two days. I&#x27;m noticing a change in my skin just from the peeling. I can see this a strong whiting agent, and must not be used more than once a day! The first two days the dial left mg skin really itchy. The third day nearly killed me because it burned and I had to stand under the water for ten minutes longer. After I shower, I need a good moisturizer but nothing you use will stop the irritation for first hour. After that your fine and the next morning my skin feels great. If you develop a rash on your face, just leave it alone but add moisturizer like olive oil. Great product and I will reorder!</li>
    <li> Help permanently lightens skin.a very excellent soap.but not intended for people w/ sensitive skin..it burns a little on the bony area of  the body where there&#x27;s little meat ...</li>
    <li> Bought five bar pack and diligently  used all over.  No results after finishing three bars.  Skin did not get an even tone or even a shade brighter. Instead, it darkened.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It is fake.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the delivery of this item, however, it was worth the wait.  I finally got it and used it immediately and it took about two weeks to notice any change. Now, everyone keep asking me what am I doing differently because my face look so bright and I look well rested, I laughed and just say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s my new soap&amp;#34;.  And it really is.  My face is not so dull and blotchy looking it looks as everyone say, bright and well rested.  I will definitely place another order and hopefully I won&#x27;t have to wait too long this time.</li>
    <li> The bars took longer than expected  to get delivered. Packaging was alright just a standard usps box. No cute wrapping or anything. Unfortunately, the soap is FAKE and most of these reviews are not genuine ! I&#x27;ve had REAL kojic soap that tingles and sorta burns when you use it &amp; REAL glutathione has a particular scent. It appears to be just a regular orange and white colored soap. Coulda saved $$$ and time a got Koji Sans but, this was a good deal and wanted to try something new. Guess I&#x27;ll just stick to what I know works. Too many fake reviews on Amazon 😞😞😞</li>
    <li> Excellent it arrived as advised.</li>
    <li> I hate this product it&#x27;s say watch out for fake ones in it and I&#x27;m pretty sure that was the fake it didn&#x27;t do anything thing to my skin at all it works for 3 minutes and then you go back to your original shade I really want my money back please</li>
    <li> Bought this product based on the reviews. These people must be working for the company or its distributors .Same misguided concept that this product will work . A waste of money .it just strips my skin of its moisture . Each time I used it my skin feels and looks like crumpled paper. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> Have not notice any changes in my skin . Maybe need more</li>
    <li> burns the hell out of your face didnt use it enough to see a change in my skin</li>
    <li> All this soap does is DRY your skin so a waste of money and would never buy it again nor recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product...works like a charm!!! Smoother skin and lighter. Does a great job removing dead skin cells</li>
    <li> It softens skin after just one use. It improves the texture of skin. It really really lightens the skin well.</li>
    <li> Good service I like it</li>
    <li> Great service!! Love the soap!!!</li>
    <li> Works to even skin tone but melts quickly</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Love it! Highly recommended thank you !</li>
    <li> Great product!!! It does what it said that it would do. It lightens and softened my skin, and I started to see the results in only one week.</li>
    <li> It brings back the glow of my natural fair skin color from the everyday exposure to the sun..Now I have lighter flawless skin..It really works!!!</li>
    <li> Consistently Outstanding Quality/Service. Received within two days. Soap is genuine therefore it works extremely well. Light to no scent. I lather up then apply body scrubs later rinse. Keep my KP at bay. This is my only go to shop for this soap.</li>
    <li> I have battled with acne and excessive oily skin for a longtime now since I&#x27;ve used this soap it has tremendously help to balance my skin type. My makeup stays on longer and oil is under control.....I use minimal moisturier along with Vit C SERUM, before bed. My skin looks feel and is better.</li>
    <li> I like it! it leaves my skin soft. I think it&#x27;s too early to really say much about a product I just started using .</li>
    <li> I luv the soap. It tends to render the skin dry but I luv it! As long as it is not aggressive it is gud for me. Any marks of lightening so far but I will give more weeks</li>
    <li> Im enjoying this so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using different whitening soap for years. But when I tried this soap I am very amazed. It&#x27;s only been a week now I can see the result. My skin complexion is now getting lighter. Leave the soap in your skin at least 5 minutes before rinsing. You will see the best result. Now, guys it works on me okay. so there&#x27;s no harm of trying. So I recommend this for those who are welling to try.</li>
    <li> I have not used it long enough to determine the  full effect.&lt;br /&gt;But I did notice that it finishes pretty quickly, in other words the soap is very soft.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a month but I have noticed improvement.</li>
    <li> OMG, this soap does wonders to my skin. It lights my skin and exfoliate my skin also, just make sure u use a good MOSTURIZER AFTER U USE IT.. But I loooovvvveeee it</li>
    <li> Great soap love it, you will see results in a week</li>
    <li> I love it thank you amazon</li>
    <li> These soaps have a nice lather. My skin is feels smooth and soft after using. The jury is still out as to whether they are actually effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still observing the results.. So far no noticeable things yet. Hopefully it&#x27; ll do justice on the price of paying it.</li>
    <li> this soap is very great,first I receive it at time it really works.It clear up my skin and my skin is so soft, I love it and I will keep it forever.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome.</li>
    <li> Its definitely strong than the other brand I used before. It burns but it works. My skin is not sensitive so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For people with sensitive skin shouldn&#x27;t try this go for a different brand that is not that strong like this one. Over all its doing its job!</li>
    <li> Have been using the soaps everyday since i got them. They dry my skin but havent seen any whitening or bleaching effects.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for me.  No drying of the skin.  I saw my elbows clear up in two days.  Not to sure about lighting my face.  Will keep using it and I will stay out of the sun.</li>
    <li> Great product makes skin smooth, supple, it brightens skin. It made my skin lighter but that shouldn&#x27;t be expected it works differently on different people.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I asked for and the bars are nice size.!</li>
    <li> 1used 1 month i see little result</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It has brightened my skin and made it look flawless.  One must use a good moisturizer  as it will dry out your skin.The only downside is that it is very messy and does not last long.</li>
    <li> The bars are packaged nicely as pictured.  Bars melt easy so don&#x27;t hold them under warm or hot water long.  I use daily and 2 bars lasted me almost a month.  I keep them in a soap container with lid.  They can get a little messy and you will see orange spots and drips from bars on your tub or sink.</li>
    <li> Starts off not too bad....although you would have to keep it air tight in an container or soap dish after each use to keep ingredients fresh....would like to purchase a higher dosage amount, as a soap  form  like this, of main ingredient.</li>
    <li> from 13 dollars to 22 dollars wow!</li>
    <li> every pinoy wants to be white this helps....i guess.......</li>
    <li> No changes yet. I&#x27;m still exfoliating and getting my skin prepared for lightening. It&#x27;s becoming fall and I have a better chance of it doing right. I&#x27;m still in the sun a lot with outdoor activities so I can&#x27;t blame the soap for not doing what it&#x27;s supposed to when I&#x27;m not doing my part by staying out of the sun. I&#x27;ll update later if/when I&#x27;ve seen changes.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin smooth and feeling clean.  No irritation.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! This soap really works! My skin had changed in every aspect due to a long term illness. After using this soap only twice, my skin became soft and my complexion seems to be returning back to normal. I feel more confident.  Great product!</li>
    <li> So far so good, I have been looking for something to correct the blotches in my face and this works like magic. I cut it into 6 pieces to keep from melting the entire bar. I leave on my face 5 min morning and night and in a week my skin is showing amazing results.</li>
    <li> It does not work at all</li>
    <li> works well to tone and brighten your skin........i can&#x27;t complain.  in three days i saw the change and no longer use face wash....yes it&#x27;s that good</li>
    <li> I got the product cant wait to use so i can have more even clear skin.i will keep imformed of progress right now im excited thankyou</li>
    <li> Did not like at all.  Product has no instructions what so ever and did not do what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping. Like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this soap for two weeks and I must say that it works well. I&#x27;ve noticed improvements to my skin. I&#x27;ve gone a slight shade lighter. Skin is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side it dries out the skin. So you need a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> VERY UPSET!&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT I ORDERED!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT IS ALSO  SUPPOSED TO COME WITH 5 BARS AND MINE CAME ONE SHORT!! I DONT THINK ITS TOO HARD TO COUNT FIVE BARS!&lt;br /&gt;IF THERE WAS A WAY TO GIVE ZERO STARS, I WOULD! I DEFINITELY WANT MY MONEY BACK</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Works very well. I noticed improvement in dark marks within 2 weeks. This soap is real strong. It left my skin feeling soft, but you definitely will want to use a moisturizing lotion afterwards because your skin will become real dry and itchy if you don&#x27;t. Will order again very soon.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Use wisely and only on the area of your body that needs treatment!</li>
    <li> This soap is very strong,  it burns my skin and I don&#x27;t see it improving skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change.</li>
    <li> I got these on my nipples and it stung for about 12 hours. I had to put a bandaid on.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my dark marks and scares on my legs from ants and mosquitoes bites. Love it. Will  order again.</li>
    <li> Week too. Still waiting to see results</li>
    <li> Meh. Save yourself the time and buy kojie san or something.</li>
    <li> All I&#x27;m saying is this soap is really good</li>
    <li> it work like it says it would</li>
    <li> satisfied customer. Evens out skin tone and you get a real clean feeling without drying out your face. Only negatives is that it runs out pretty quick and the smell is neutral.</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned Afro-American with a couple of childhood scars on my legs, I have been using this soap for a week and they&#x27;re  already fading away, I am also getting a nice healthy glow, I will be re-ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> Using this a week along with Amlactin Moisturizing Body Lotion and the results is AMAZING!!!! My outer arms are usually darker and now I see drastic lightening and toning I will definitely purchase again until I arrive at my desired color. I leave to dry on skin for half and hour then rinse off. Please note this works for me but everyone is different with different skin types. I also use on my face I leave on for 5 mins and rinse off with warm water. Acne scars are fading and I no longer wake up to an extremely oily face :) I really recommend this product. safe to use on butt breast nipples and bikini line etc. I will not advise to use on genital area as it has acid do not think it will be a good idea! Good Luck everyone.</li>
    <li> Not good got a contact dermatitis. Too strong</li>
    <li> Shipment took 4 days. Reasonably priced well and good product.</li>
    <li> Best!  I used it for a week, all over my body including my face, and my skin looked a tad brighter! I do leave it on my skin for about 1minute as that is all I can take.  There is this &#x27;acid&#x27; sensation when you leave it longer, but - this is the effect of the bleaching properties.  If you don&#x27;t use sunblock, try to stay in the shade when its sunshiny bright outdoors as you can burn quickly.  Otherwise, VERY pleased, this is now part of the recurring items on my shopping list!</li>
    <li> I still using it, I notice my skin getting whiter for couple days now</li>
    <li> It worked as promised.</li>
    <li> Like I said all this whiting stuff not working for me.i still black so for me it don&#x27;t work.maybe it make whitey more white</li>
    <li> Wasted my money.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 bars twice and I must admit that I have noticed a modest change in the tone of my skin. Its a little more even and bright. I&#x27;m pretty sure if I ordered the 5 bar pack 2-3 more times I could have perfect skin but I&#x27;m not willing to spend that much more money so I just purchased lactic acid instead for a day peel. This is a good gradual product. Slow but you will get results over the course of 3-4  months of daily use.</li>
    <li> It didnt do anything to my skin except for being so dry! I didnt get the skintone i was expecting... the dark spots still the same</li>
    <li> It does lighten your skin as long as you use it everyday.  I use it on my hands, face, and legs to even out my skin color.  I leave it on for 20 minutes before I wash it off.  I noticed my skin evening out by the end of the first week.</li>
    <li> I just try this soap and buy at amazon.i was really surprised when I start using it. It&#x27;s really awesome and it works to my skin. perfect choice. .</li>
    <li> I am using the soap. thus far no results, I expect the results will come in time.</li>
    <li> This stuff DOES work. It won&#x27;t turn you white/pale if you have dark dark skin but it will color correct and brighten. It did turn my skin a few shades lighter though. From a tannish color to a pinkish light beige color.</li>
    <li> Using it every day. Very good.</li>
    <li> So far, I see a little improvement</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it every morning and evening and I leave it on my body for 5 minutes for faster result. Also very affordable.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.. waste of money for me</li>
    <li> Great soap love the way it Laders especially the unscented part my skin is very sensitive so this is perfect</li>
    <li> Fastest shipping ever, this soap is awesome it lighted my dark spots, darkness on my female parts. Tightened my pores and got rid of blackheads. This soap did not irritae me at all, make a paste on your hand and apply to face, for body use like regular bar soap just dont leave it on your face too long or you will get dry skin. U can use moisturizer after application. Dont scrub with the soap use your hand and pat dry</li>
    <li> I did order twice already this product i like it my skin lighter than before you can see the improvement in second time to using it.i wanna see the next step if still completely good and let see!so far the price is resonable and the first shipping is faster your are not expected the exact date but the second time is normal date that they given.it is not bad they still deliver good. Gud luck!!</li>
    <li> I have a hyperpigmented patch under my right eye and a smaller elongated patch under my left ---I was using hydroquinone for  7 months but stopped because of possible health concerns. My skin had started to darken again so I wanted to try a home remedy supported by the soap.  my concern was it might of darken the condition and new dark spots appeared near the slop of my nose. I used it for over 40 days. I woke up one day and had a strong intuitive sense to stop using it and I did. At best I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.  I also used it on my arms which the forearm has been darken by the sun. I haven&#x27;t seen improvement in 2 months. I will continue to use it on my arms also knees until i use up the final 2 bars but I won&#x27;t needless to say reorder.</li>
    <li> Great for bathing and clarifying the skin from head to toe.</li>
    <li> The Best among the rest of whitening bar soap. Way better than kojic and papaya soap. I just used it for two days now. The result was amazing. I tried papaya soap and recently and still using kojic soap. But this one was way more effective tHan kojic and papaya soap. Just don&#x27;t forget to used moisturizer after. Goodluck.</li>
