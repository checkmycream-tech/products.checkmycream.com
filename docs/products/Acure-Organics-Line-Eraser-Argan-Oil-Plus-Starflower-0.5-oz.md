### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And the best thing of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome!</li>
      <li>The scent of this product is very pleasant, and the texture is...different.  </li>
      <li>Very good product.  </li>
      <li>Bought everything they offer, happy as a clam.</li>
      <li>What it is great for is scars.  </li>
      <li>Yet I had read another reviewer claim that this line eraser works great as a lip balm.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT!!  </li>
      <li>It feels a bit greasy which isn&#x27;t a problem when used as it&#x27;s meant to be; I wouldn&#x27;t use this all over my face, but it feels very nice at the corners of my mouth and under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Just started using product very nice feeling.  </li>
      <li>lavender and rose help give it a very nice Spa aroma but the texture of the product counteracts the pleasent experience of usinging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it a better star rating if it were meant for that!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing on lines and even more amazing on scars.</li>
      <li>I used it alot in the winter - more sparingly now that the weather is warm.  </li>
      <li>If one puts it over eye cream, the effect is even better.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>I love it but not for wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>(It might be the Beeswax or the Carnauba ingredient which is usually more of a wax than oil.)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m changing all my skincare over to organic and safe products and love this line by Acure.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love.</li>
      <li>I do still LOVE it though.</li>
      <li>It does work very nicely under your eyes as cream if you are in your 30s or older...</li>
      <li>Good products, very agreeable and efficient to use at night for better results.</li>
      <li>Wonderful balm for lips &amp; any rough patches, too.</li>
      <li>This is the first product that has been a truly effective lip balm for me, even though this product is not marketed as a lip balm.  </li>
      <li>The fine lines around my mouth are diminishing.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a great moisturizing lip balm, look no further.</li>
      <li>Great solution for problem areas where daily moisturizer needs assistance.  </li>
      <li>Just a light dab of this ointment does the trick.</li>
      <li>All natural - also good for cuticles and hands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a good nourishing skin balm, most beneficial for healing dry and/or irritated skin or softening the superficial texture but not as effective as it could be on the claims of a particular remedy for fine lines and treating scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The emolliency is great for dry patch areas but to oily for my already oily skin.</li>
      <li>I do think it softens the wrinkles, smells nice, and skin feels very soft in the morning.  </li>
      <li>This works great around my eyes during this incredibly dry northeast winter we are having!</li>
      <li>The oils in the balm are very softening and it does seem to help more with dry patches and is even very effective and nourishing on overly chapped lips.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it to help with smile lines</li>
      <li>I am using them on the lines around my mouth and a couple mild lines on my forehead.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I mainly purchased it to help lighten a scar on my forehead and to assit with the laugh lines around my mouth and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much more than what my night cream/treatment oil does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Acure is my new favorite skincare line.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit greasy at first but a light patting with a Kleenex takes the shine right off.</li>
      <li>but then they do seem to eventually get absorbed or just drop off.</li>
      <li>Although I am 40, I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or anything because I have been so fastidious about using sunscreen for most of my life and always wear wide-brimmed hats if I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time.  </li>
      <li>As you rub it into the skin it almost feels like you are using an exfoliator at first</li>
      <li>will know more in future.</li>
      <li>It has really greasy consistency.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;INGREDIENTS: Organic Safflower Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Carnauba, Organic Starflower Oil (Borage), Organic Essential Oils of Bulgarian Lavender and Rosewax, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Carnauba, Organic Starflower Oil (Borage), Organic Essential Oils of Bulgarian Lavender and Rose</li>
      <li>The grainy texture also came to bother me more over time, so I&#x27;ve moved on to experimenting with other products.</li>
      <li>I like this very much for putting around my lips and mouth lines especially at night.  </li>
      <li>In trying to use it on my laugh lines I found that it somehow lightened and sped up healing of acne marks, strange</li>
      <li>As far as erasing lines I don&#x27;t think this product does anything.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would lighten my scarring, but so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.</li>
      <li>So NOT good for wrinkles, but AMAZING for scars and minor cuts/scrapes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a lip balm, and it really keeps them moist and staves off dry, peeling skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little grainy at first, but the little specks/beads melt into the skin quickly.  </li>

<li> My lips get very dry year-round, but especially in the fall and winter.</li>
<li> Wash with simple/pure face wash and apply this after dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even used it on small cuts and you can instantly see it soothes the skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, so I will update after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is a very small jar with only half an ounce of product but considering it is a balm over a wrinkle creme it has lasted quite a bit longer than I thought it would.&lt;br</li>
<li> I apply it before bed and take the time to rub in any of the grainy pieces that will absorb but have found little change in the softening of the wrinkles.</li>
<li> It is expensive for what you get the jar doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> It comes in a small, carmex looking container</li>
<li> I bought it before and was amazed at how a small film of this balm kept the skin around my eyes moist.</li>
<li> has the consistancy of a lip balm but has some wierd small chuncky pieces in it.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m debating about whether to try microdermabrasion to help minimize the scars, but I&#x27;m afraid that that procedure might aggravate my seborrheic dermatitis; also, some people who&#x27;ve had the procedure claim that it caused them to develop cystic acne---the last thing in the world I want or need.)  </li>
<li> I probably wouldnt buy this anymore, since it is very small for about $18....</li>
<li> Goes on very thinly so its not greasy or heavy.</li>
<li> I have dealt with mila (difficult, under the skin acne) for years.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, there was no discernable difference made.  </li>
<li> I was really disappointed with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is amazing on lines and even more amazing on scars. I will definitely  stick with it!</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is very pleasant, and the texture is...different.  It&#x27;s a little grainy at first, but the little specks/beads melt into the skin quickly.  It feels a bit greasy which isn&#x27;t a problem when used as it&#x27;s meant to be; I wouldn&#x27;t use this all over my face, but it feels very nice at the corners of my mouth and under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, so I will update after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I used this for four months, at both corners of my mouth and only under one eye, so as to make a semi-scientific analysis.  Unfortunately, there was no discernable difference made.  The grainy texture also came to bother me more over time, so I&#x27;ve moved on to experimenting with other products.</li>
    <li> I love it but not for wrinkles.  I originally purchased it to help with smile lines but I don&#x27;t think it has helped for this.  What it is great for is scars.  I&#x27;ve even used it on small cuts and you can instantly see it soothes the skin.  So NOT good for wrinkles, but AMAZING for scars and minor cuts/scrapes.</li>
    <li> I bought it before and was amazed at how a small film of this balm kept the skin around my eyes moist. Just a light dab of this ointment does the trick. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit greasy at first but a light patting with a Kleenex takes the shine right off. All that&#x27;s left is moist, supple skin. If one puts it over eye cream, the effect is even better. And the best thing of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a very small jar with only half an ounce of product but considering it is a balm over a wrinkle creme it has lasted quite a bit longer than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistancy of a lip balm but has some wierd small chuncky pieces in it. Almost like one of the ingredients didn&#x27;t emulsify with the rest of the products. As you rub it into the skin it almost feels like you are using an exfoliator at first but then they do seem to eventually get absorbed or just drop off. (It might be the Beeswax or the Carnauba ingredient which is usually more of a wax than oil.)&lt;br /&gt;The lavender and rose help give it a very nice Spa aroma but the texture of the product counteracts the pleasent experience of usinging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results - I have less than 1/3 of the jar left and feel like my lines have not diminished. I am using them on the lines around my mouth and a couple mild lines on my forehead.  I apply it before bed and take the time to rub in any of the grainy pieces that will absorb but have found little change in the softening of the wrinkles. (The product takes some time to absorb so it is not something I would apply in the day time under makeup.) It does improve the overall texture of your skin. The oils in the balm are very softening and it does seem to help more with dry patches and is even very effective and nourishing on overly chapped lips. So it does seem like my skin has benefited from the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;However, I mainly purchased it to help lighten a scar on my forehead and to assit with the laugh lines around my mouth and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much more than what my night cream/treatment oil does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good nourishing skin balm, most beneficial for healing dry and/or irritated skin or softening the superficial texture but not as effective as it could be on the claims of a particular remedy for fine lines and treating scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Organic Safflower Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Beeswax, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Carnauba, Organic Starflower Oil (Borage), Organic Essential Oils of Bulgarian Lavender and Rosewax, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Carnauba, Organic Starflower Oil (Borage), Organic Essential Oils of Bulgarian Lavender and Rose</li>
    <li> Just started using product very nice feeling.  will know more in future.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this product. It caused breakouts on my face.  It has really greasy consistency.  I am now using it on my elbows, knees and heels instead.  The emolliency is great for dry patch areas but to oily for my already oily skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. Wonderful balm for lips &amp; any rough patches, too. Acure is my new favorite skincare line. Bought everything they offer, happy as a clam.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I just love it. I can see and feel a big difference in my skin.  I can&#x27;t go a day without it as my skin drinks it in. Wish I had found it a lot sooner! Recommend it definitely!!!!</li>
    <li> Good products, very agreeable and efficient to use at night for better results. Since I use it I can see an improvement</li>
    <li> The Acure line was on sale at the local health food store last month, so I stocked up on different products (my housemate works at the health food store, so I got to use his employee discount in addition to the sale price).  I have had some bothersome acne/dermatitis scarring that I have been wanting to get rid of/minimize, so I thought that I would give this product a try.  It&#x27;s only been about three or so weeks, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement with the scars.  Yet I had read another reviewer claim that this line eraser works great as a lip balm.  I would have to wholeheartedly agree.  My lips get very dry year-round, but especially in the fall and winter. I&#x27;ve been using this as a lip balm, and it really keeps them moist and staves off dry, peeling skin.  This is the first product that has been a truly effective lip balm for me, even though this product is not marketed as a lip balm.  Although I am 40, I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or anything because I have been so fastidious about using sunscreen for most of my life and always wear wide-brimmed hats if I&#x27;m going to be out in the sun for an extended period of time.  Therefore, I can&#x27;t comment on whether this product works well as a \\&quot;line eraser.\\&quot;  I was hoping it would lighten my scarring, but so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement. (I&#x27;m debating about whether to try microdermabrasion to help minimize the scars, but I&#x27;m afraid that that procedure might aggravate my seborrheic dermatitis; also, some people who&#x27;ve had the procedure claim that it caused them to develop cystic acne---the last thing in the world I want or need.)  If you are looking for a great moisturizing lip balm, look no further.</li>
    <li> As far as erasing lines I don&#x27;t think this product does anything. I do still LOVE it though. In trying to use it on my laugh lines I found that it somehow lightened and sped up healing of acne marks, strange but I&#x27;ll take it. I&#x27;d give it a better star rating if it were meant for that!</li>
    <li> I like this very much for putting around my lips and mouth lines especially at night.  I do think it softens the wrinkles, smells nice, and skin feels very soft in the morning.  I used it alot in the winter - more sparingly now that the weather is warm.  All natural - also good for cuticles and hands.</li>
    <li> The skin feels so treated. I wipe off the excess to eliminate the shine. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great solution for problem areas where daily moisturizer needs assistance.  It is expensive for what you get the jar doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I used around my mouth just before I go to bed.  The fine lines around my mouth are diminishing.</li>
    <li> I probably wouldnt buy this anymore, since it is very small for about $18....It does work very nicely under your eyes as cream if you are in your 30s or older...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m changing all my skincare over to organic and safe products and love this line by Acure.  I use this before bed every night</li>
    <li> This product just sits on the surface of the skin and is like putting Vaseline on your face!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with mila (difficult, under the skin acne) for years. Tried everything over the counter before turning to a dermatologist, just to be told she can&#x27;t help me because we were trying to conceive. I was then told by a friend about this stuff and I LOVE IT!!  Wash with simple/pure face wash and apply this after dry. Goes on very thinly so its not greasy or heavy. My mila has almost disappeared on my face and it is GONE from my neck, chest and back. It comes in a small, carmex looking container but I use it daily and it lasts for over 2 months.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> This works great around my eyes during this incredibly dry northeast winter we are having!</li>
