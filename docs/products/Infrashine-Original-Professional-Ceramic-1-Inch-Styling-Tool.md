      <li>That&#x27;s why I had to buy one of my own.  </li>
      <li>This iron rocks... really cannot even begin to tell you that it is the best one I have ever used.</li>

      <li>It does a great job, quickly and the style stays smooth all day...</li>
      <li>I really love this straightener.</li>
      <li>HAPPY WITH PURCHASE, RECEIVED IN REASONABLE TIME.  </li>
      <li>My only thing is that it&#x27;s the one inch which is also great for curls, but the 2 inch is really good for thicker, longer hair.</li>
      <li>I went back to Infrashine and am so happy!</li>
      <li>Also gives the hair a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Infrashine for about 8 years or more.</li>
      <li>Great straightener, really fast and efficient at straightening hair.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>

      <li>but I love mine  </li>
      <li>I feel robbed somewhat but what else am I able to do?</li>
      <li>and I have never been able to get a curl to stay in it, even using a curling iron.  </li>
      <li>Way better than CHI.</li>

      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>and it still going strong (knock wood).</li>
      <li>I usually buy Chi products and straighteners and my stylist suggested trying this, love it even more than my Chi Irons!!!  </li>
      <li>If I could have smooth shiny straight-as-a-board Asian hair I would be a happy camper.  </li>
      <li>All my friends in college would borrow it everyday, so it got A LOT of use, and held up perfectly.</li>
      <li>But if its anything like my last one then its gonna be great.</li>
      <li>It is light weight and comfortable in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
      <li>Getting caught up in all the hype I had forgotten how sleek and smooth</li>
      <li>I bought it at the salon I use to work at because I got such great discounts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Second time purchase. I bought this flat iron at a hair show almost 10 years ago and used it almost every single day, it finally gave out. So I went searching online and was so happy to see that they had the exact one there and I had to get it since the first one was a great purchase all those years ago. I have thick long hair and this iron is perfect. I use it for styling my bangs, straightening my hair, and for curling. All I can say is it is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have a 2&amp;#34; flat iron of the same brand for when I had long hair and loved it.  I bought (a second) 1&amp;#34;  flat iron for my now much shorter hair and love it.  The first 1&amp;#34; iron lasted a few years.  This is by far my fav...  Helps make my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Is my second one and love it. Used my first one for along time, the only reason I need it to replace it is because I drop it and stop working, but this was after 3 years of used.</li>
    <li> I was moderately satisfied with this product until one day it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. I&#x27;ve had it for only about one year. I will NOT buy this product again. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works perfect and it last for 5 years at least! With the proper usage! I would recomend this product</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron ever. It heats up quickly and evenly, has a very long cord and flattens my hair in the first swipe through. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!  I&#x27;ve had it for years. It is better than any $200 one out there. Leaves hair silky, frizz free and straight.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for 12 years and it has finally died. I will definitely be purchasing a new one.  Many of my friends have purchased the Chi and when it died after just a few years have switched over, and not one regret! Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for a few years, my daughter loved it and bought her one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, bought it because it&#x27;s the one my stylists uses on my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this in August and today it now won&#x27;t stay on and flickers on and off each time the cord moves. I would just return and reorder it but I don&#x27;t have that optiion. It works well but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this flatiron.  I have one and bought this one for my daughter!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I&#x27;ve replaced my wife&#x27;s old one and it is exactly what she needed for our family and all the girls.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  Sometimes, I don&#x27;t think it keeps heated enough though. It heats very well in the beginning, but is definitely quite a bit cooler by the time you&#x27;re done using it.</li>
    <li> This is the one that my stylist uses. I replaced my last Infrashine flat iron after 3 years of daily use. Heats quickly, makes your hair smooth and shiny. Good investment.</li>
    <li> - heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t snag hair at all...feels like nothing!&lt;br /&gt;- smooths hair in one pass&lt;br /&gt;This is my second InfraShine flat iron. My first one died after 3-4 years of frequent use. At this price, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Not too large. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener. I was desperate after my hot tools flat iron died when traveling overseas. I ordered before I left so it would be waiting for me upon my return. It came on time as described. The flat iron itself is wonderful. It transforms my hair into a silky, shiny, pretty mane. It doesn&#x27;t pull or break any hair, it&#x27;s a great product. To anyone saying it hurt their hair, try using a heat protectant before straightening your hair!</li>
    <li> I had this flat iron for 5 years before it died on me. I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend the money again and settled for a cheapy at Target. It would not get my hair straight and shiny this my old one. My NEW Infrashine just got delivered and my hair looks fantastic. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is my first choice for a straightener.  This product always straightens my hair smooth and silky.  For the best results, I don&#x27;t put it to full heat.  I&#x27;ve tried other expensive straighteners and I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Mine worked great for about a year, then broke down. I have to hold it a certain way for the light to turn on. It&#x27;s sad because they lady at the hair salon told me it should last years, and the warranty was 1 year only, so I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement. It did straighten my hair perfectly, so I will probably purchase a new one soon. Just make sure you treat it well! Don&#x27;t rap the cord around it or drop it too many times.</li>
    <li> WAS RECOMMENDED THIS FLAT IRON BY 2 DIFFERENT SALONS THAT USE THIS ON THEIR CLIENTS.  HAPPY WITH PURCHASE, RECEIVED IN REASONABLE TIME.  THIS FLAT IRON DOES NOT PULL/YANK ON HAIR WHEN USING.  OVERALL GREAY BUY!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flat iron. I will never purchase anything else. It leaves smooth clean shiny straight hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Infrashine for about 8 years or more. The lady that used to do my hair always used these flat irons and they last a long time. Great purchase for the money. I think they are the best flat irons available. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron you could ever own. I had my other infrashine flat iron for about 4 years, I used it every single day, and it finally went out on me. I bought it at the salon I use to work at because I got such great discounts. I&#x27;m now an RN, so I don&#x27;t get the discounts that I use to and thought I would try another flat iron. Before buying another infrashine I tried the CHI, which I absolutely hated, every time I went over a piece of hair I could hear it ripping and breaking pieces of my hair off, not a great sound! I returned it the next day. I then tried the Sultra Wicked flat iron because it got such great reviews, however it was not nearly as good as the infrashine I had owned. I found the infrashine on Amazon at a great price and bought it right away. The infrashine leaves your hair so shiny and straight you only need to go over the section once and your hair stays straight and shiny all day. I will never buy another flat iron other than the infrashine. I use mine every single day and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s definitely the best flat iron you will ever own. I promise you the first time you use it you will never buy another flat iron for the rest of your life!</li>
    <li> This iron rocks... really cannot even begin to tell you that it is the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener! I have fine thin hair so I needed an adjustable temp setting, the cord is also nice and long and my bathroom doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough plug-ins so I have to stretch from the hall. I also like the slim design as I have pretty short hair. I would recommend</li>
    <li> This seems to work fantastic. I bought it based on good reviews and have to say I haven&#x27;t been let down yet. The only problem I have is it&#x27;s hard to use to curl your hair, although that could be user error.</li>
    <li> This is my second Infrashine flat iron.  My first one lasted a little over a year and now a year later after getting a new one it has died also.  It was a fine iron but should last longer than a year.  I&#x27;m thinking I will try a different brand to see if it lasts longer than a year. Was sent a third iron and it just died after 6 months.  If you are one that uses a hot iron almost everyday I would stay away from this product.  It shorts out quickly and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as others.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Chi products and straighteners and my stylist suggested trying this, love it even more than my Chi Irons!!!  Have been a Chi owner for 10+ years!</li>
    <li> BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER NOW!! I&#x27;ve been using flat irons for about 12 years. I&#x27;ve used Remington, Fahrenheit, Chi, and Ghd until now. I loved my Ghd but when it finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; I decided I was going to find something just as good for less than $100. The performance and price of the infrashine beats anything out there in my opinion. My hairdresser uses the more expensive red-line infrashine and swears by it. My hair is mostly straight, medium thickness, and a couple inches past my shoulders. It takes me no time at all to straighten my hair with this iron.</li>
    <li> This is my second one, first one lasted 10 years. Its heats up fast.  The plates are very smooth and glide over the hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased my previous Infrashine iron in 2003 and it lasted 11 years!!!  During the past few years, it would lose it&#x27;s intensity while straightening my hair so I decided it was finally time to purchase a new one.  This one is perfect!  I can straighten my naturally frizzy/curly hair in 10-15 minutes and it stays silky and straight even in high humidity.  The only downfall to the Infrashine iron is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off.  Otherwise, this is best iron you&#x27;ll find on the market!</li>
    <li> I bought my infrashine 7 years ago. It still works perfectly. It heats up in about 5 seconds and gives the smoothes sleekest shine imaginable. My favorite part of it though is that I use it to curl. A curl on the infrashine lasts longer than any curling iron curl I have ever had. You can create lose wavy curls or tighter springy curls once you get the hang of it. Buy this now.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Chi and Hot Tools appliance owner but when my hair was showing terrible damage, I decided to research a change. I found this infrashine and decided to try it. For the price, I thought there was no way it could compare to the more popular and expensive appliances. Give it a try. Your hair will thank you!</li>
    <li> I went to my salon shortly before buying this and asked her what flat iron she always uses on my hair because I always walk out of there with my hair looking awesome and she seems to do it twice as fast as I can. (I do know that&#x27;s her job, however, it&#x27;s not science for using a flat iron) Anyways, when I asked her what she used, she stated the Infrashine. They said they were looking into carrying them at the salon in the future but not at this time and that they would sell them for $140. So I went home and immediately started looking online. I didn&#x27;t find it anywhere! This should have been my first clue. If I didn&#x27;t find it online, the one on here must not be the real deal.  After looking further into it, I decided to try it and just see. Maybe it would be close to it and then it would work better than the current flat iron I was using. Well, I can say after several months now, I do not like this at all! It makes my hair so frizzy I never wear my hair down as it&#x27;s embarassing. I spent a LOT of money on this flat iron and although cheaper than the $140 they said they would sell it for, I would gladly spend the little extra to have a real one that&#x27;s not counterfeit. I feel robbed somewhat but what else am I able to do? Nothing much. So in order to get my money&#x27;s worth, I feel obligated to continue using this. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or anything like that but I wouldn&#x27;t say it straightens it correctly either. I feel my hair looks nothing like when she uses the real Infrashine and I will no longer be purchasing one online anymore but from a salon. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Have used it for a few months now.  Excellent results.  Totally straightens curly course hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Infrashine fan for about 10 years now- I had a 2 inch flatiron that lasted almost 7 years and worked beautifully up until it died. I tried a couple of other high end brands like Chi and found them to be a bit overrated, for my hair anyway. I went back to Infrashine and am so happy! My only thing is that it&#x27;s the one inch which is also great for curls, but the 2 inch is really good for thicker, longer hair. Awesome purchase and I&#x27;m an Infrashine girl for life!</li>
    <li> I invested a lot of money in a CHI flat iron and it only made my hair look dry and burnt on the ends.  My stylist used the Infrashine on my last visit and it made my hair so silky!  That&#x27;s why I had to buy one of my own.  The salon has them for $150.00 but I found a much better deal on here - Yea Amazon!  You won&#x27;t go wrong on purchasing this.  I was able to tell a big difference in my hair the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the real flatiron.. If you want a good one I would go with the hsi ones.. This one isn&#x27;t real! Returned!</li>
    <li> When you first get the flat iron its great - But as soon as you need a repair do not waste the money and send it in.  They never heat up like they did and two out of my three handles got as hot as the plates I sent them in. Paid shipping and repairs fees to get them back not repaired  and told insulation was put in handles - I opened them up to find no insulation and I was told too bad.  Serious horrible customer service not worth the issues when there are others out there made here in USA</li>
    <li> Exactly as I had expected. I&#x27;ve had a few of these over many years, and they are always the high quality item I keep going back for.</li>
    <li> The last one my daughter had 10 yrs. I hope this one will be another 10.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron, I have purchased one in the past and finally had to replace it.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a professional iron with smooth plates and a heat control thermostat. It&#x27;s the best iron I have used.</li>
    <li> Glides through my hair instead of pulling like some I&#x27;ve had. Great results!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron 7 years ago and it still works perfectly!  I use it almost everyday and love that you can control the temperature. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love these flat irons and received very quickly!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have purchased it in the past and my first one lasted almost 10 years. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second flat-iron of the same brand/style.  One for home, one for work when I bike to work.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. Worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my infrashine flat iron! I have bought others in the past and they have not worked, the first time I used my infrashine I was amazed! It works fast and results last a long time! I love it</li>
    <li> When my stylist used this product on my hair, it made my hair incredibly shiny. Apparently I received a defective iron as all this one does is make my hair look like straw.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas when I was 17, and I&#x27;m now 23 and it just went out. I was very impressed with this flat iron. You can use it to go curly or straight, and it straightens very quickly. I just purchased a ghd to replace it, but if the ghd disappoints I would buy another one of these in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> got 2 duds .... 3rd times the charm.</li>
    <li> Loved at first but after 7 months it&#x27;s busted.  Short connection since the power light goes on and off</li>
    <li> ...some chick wound up stealing it form me.  Since that time I have used CHI, etc. etc.  Getting caught up in all the hype I had forgotten how sleek and smooth this flat iron made my hair.  I have not-quite-curly, kinda frizzy (on a humid day), thick hair.  If I could have smooth shiny straight-as-a-board Asian hair I would be a happy camper.  The grass is always greener I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I read the reviews on this flat iron and decided it was time to come back to my old friend.  I guess when you start off with the best you take it for granted and think there must be something better out there.  Well, there&#x27;s not.  This is the BEST flat iron I have ever used and the last brand I will ever buy.  I was a bit skeptical when I came across a review on here claiming it was counterfeit.  I rarely see them at beauty supply stores and even searching online there aren&#x27;t that many places that carry them.  When I received this one in the mail I immediately plugged it in and gave it a go.  Same results.  It&#x27;s a great flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are worried it&#x27;s a fake or whatever...don&#x27;t.  This iron is a great investment.  You&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best flat iron ever. My friend has had hers for 4 years, and I found myself waiting to do my hair until I got to her place, so I just bought my own. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Great deal on a great product.  This is my third one- as they get better they last longer and my previous one lasted three years even though I used it daily.  I got it for a much better price here on Amazon than I would at a beauty supply store, even with my sister&#x27;s cosmetologist license.  Happy find :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife, on a recommendation from her stylist. I found it here for a price comparable to wholesale. She loves it and uses it every day with terrific results.</li>
    <li> I have gone thru so many cheap ($20) straighteners and they always pull my hair and never leave it as straight or soft as I want. My friend has one of these from 5 years ago and I used it a few times and loooooved it! Totally worth the expense. I wish I would have invested on one of these years ago and saved my poor hairs from All the abuse from inexpensive straighteners.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for over 5 years and I LOVE it. I have used it almost 4-5 times per week in the last 5 years and it still works like the first time every time. Highly recommend...</li>
    <li> Nothing out there like this iron. I&#x27;ve had others that have dried out my hair, &amp; this one miraculously makes my hair shine even though its super hot! Great product I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m back looking at this item because the last one I had broke, and the replacement I got doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this iron. My first infrashine 2 in. iron lasted at least 6 years, and my hair was in great condition. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. For those who have a problem with it going out, you can contact infrashine by email or phone and they will repair it for about $40 without the receipt or box. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Had to purchase another as I Ieft my other one on too long and I guess I must have burned out the system!</li>
    <li> Hello folks, i purchased this thingy for my wife for christmas. It was on her christmas list with amazon written next to it. After locating it on amazon&#x27;s site i bought it. She loves it. She uses it everyday  so all in all score one for the guys</li>
    <li> I love my new Infrashine medium flat iron. It is the perfect size for me to work with. I can get right to my scalp if I need to. It heats up really fast, and has lots of choices for temperatures. It is light weight and comfortable in one&#x27;s hand. I would highly recommend to anyone who is trying to straighten their hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is super straight and I have never been able to get a curl to stay in it, even using a curling iron.  I ordered this flat iron on someone&#x27;s recommendation and love it.  I can do all kinds of hair dos with this flat iron and the curls and waves will actually stay in them, which is amazing!  I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different flat irons, this one by far is the best on my hair!!! Way better than CHI. It&#x27;s a must have and worth every penny! !!!</li>
    <li> Great straightener, really fast and efficient at straightening hair. Best I have ever had as a straightener. Great deal too!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. Requires less heat to straighten my kinky, frizzy hair than other flat irons. Doesn&#x27;t dry out or kill my hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this brand but based on where I purchased and the price, it must have been a counterfeit because when one presses them together, they are not flat across each other which makes that certain sound, muffled.  And consequently, because only the tips meet and the rest does not, you end up pulling your hair as you pull it through.  It should be a nice and smooth experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener a year ago. It all of a sudden quit working the other day. It wasn&#x27;t dropped or damaged, I was using it on my hair and it just went cold and doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I loved it while it was working, but $80 is a little too much for it to only work for a year.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, stopped working in less than a year.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron was recommended to me from my hair dresser.  I love it.  It does a great job, quickly and the style stays smooth all day...even my frizzy hair! My daughter kept taking it from my bathroom, so I bought her one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I got this flat Iron based on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation. I love it, it&#x27;s much better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. It really does get my thick hair extremely smooth and straight.  I can even use it to create curls or beach waves if I twist my wrist, and the curls actually hold for the day without any product or spray, something that does not happen with a normal curling iron on my thick hair. My stylist has used his every day all day during his working hours and his not had to replace it for years. I use mine once a day and it still going strong (knock wood). I have recommended it to two friends who also suffer from the same thick hair as me and they both swear by this flat iron as well. I highly recommend it it is money well spent. (Oh and a tip my stylist told me, you don&#x27;t have to go over a section of hair more than twice.  Just slow down your passes.  Two slow passes over a medium sized section is all it takes to get smooth as  glass hair.)</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping . Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice straightener but you might want to go up an inch to get the full fast straight effect, Makes my hair semi-straight only..</li>
    <li> Straightener works perfectly with even the most unruly curly hair!  Cut my straightening time in half compared to my other, less expensive straightener.</li>
    <li> I have used this iron for over 11 years. It is the best iron ever. I have used my family&#x27;s other brands and they all love mine. The only reason I have to buy another is because it has bee dropped a million times. I would leave it on the counter and it would get knocked off. So one side of the plastic broke. It still heats up fast and fine. But one of the plates falls out. But I can not say enough about this iron. They have a little bit of a new look. But if its anything like my last one then its gonna be great. I would highly recommend this iron. I know that every one may get a lemon every now and then but I love mine  and if it would not have been dropped so much it would still be going strong. And that&#x27;s an 11almost 12 year old..</li>
    <li> It works great.  Because of the temp guide, there should be no reason that you burn your hair, unless you turn it up too high.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Infrashine Flat Irons for years and no damage to my hair at all.  Great price for a great product.  Ordered my 2nd one as my 1st one finally konked out after daily usage for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I am replacing this from a previous infrashine flatiron.  I traveled a lot with my old one and it survived my travels but as I&#x27;m told by professional stylists, &amp;#34;They only last so long&amp;#34; so I was forced to buy a new iron.  I had to go with what I new was quality and this is an average price for a good flat iron.  It heats up fast, it makes the hair shiney and it&#x27;s lightweight and slim.  I love his flatiron and it is good for curling too.</li>
    <li> I have owned two Infrashine&#x27;s in the last 10 years.  Each one lasted me about 5 years. All of my friends spend so much money on other straighteners that don&#x27;t work half as well as this one. I have thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this is the only thing that has worked for me.  It heats up in literally seconds, and gets the job done quickly. All my friends in college would borrow it everyday, so it got A LOT of use, and held up perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than my last flat iron.  Gets my hair flat in way less time.  My hair is sleeker, and not nearly as frizzy with this flat iron.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a flat iron under $75 that flattens as well as I want it to. I have found this to be true even with the irons that claim to rise to above 400 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using the infrashine for about 5 years now and I love it. I recently bought a 40 dollar one from a discount retail outlet that claimed to reach the same temperature as my infrashine. After I straightened my hair with it, I had to go back over with the infrashine. For note, my hair is naturally ......lets call if fluffy.....after dried.</li>
    <li> Had one previously &amp; still works great on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> daughter loves it. she is the one who will let me know if it is any good. my wife has one and loves it</li>
    <li> Flat iron purchased from recommendation of my hairdresser. Flat iron does a good job, but only lasted about one year. LED light went off and will not heat up. For the price, should last longer than one year. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kind of flat iron for years now and have never been disappointed. My first one lasted around five years and so did the second one. It&#x27;s totally worth paying a little more to get a good tool! I was excited to see that Amazon had this flat iron and especially for the price I paid!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to spend this much money on a flat iron but I just love it!  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s still working great!  While traveling, I used my old Conair one and I could tell the difference... I was missing my Infrashine for sure!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Well worth the money. Heats up nicely and does a wonderful job of straightening even the most difficult hair. U could also use it to give soft curls to ur hair. Also gives the hair a healthy shine.</li>
