### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They worked perfectly!</li>
      <li>Perfect size, but leaves indentations all over face.</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>The clamp itself is very good</li>
      <li>It really is a great forcep, it does</li>
      <li>Great for belly and lip piercings.</li>
      <li>But great quality and would reccomend.</li>
      <li>cuz i sterilize all my stuff per use anyway but a great product for a great price and does its job</li>
      <li>but these are good forceps</li>
      <li>It wasnt a good experience for me.</li>
      <li>Is great if your doing your own piercings as well.</li>
      <li>Would not be good for nipple, navel, septum, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
      <li>Got them quick and are a great product</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and a great product, sterilized but not hermeticly sealed which is ok</li>
      <li>I guess they are okay ....</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t use it, when there was tissue between the top part</li>
      <li>love them, they numbed the area</li>
      <li>I love these clamps.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>If you purchase these make sure</li>
      <li>This really is a great pair and it has amazing grip, it&#x27;s just the texture of the pieces that grasp the skin are quite rough and may make your client wince.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to control.</li>
      <li>all in all i think they will get the job done fine.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>These things are huge, and clamp way tighter than needed for my purposes.</li>
      <li>They are huge</li>
      <li>so the needle would go in smoothly.</li>
      <li>Durable and nice for professional and home use .. love it</li>
      <li>And was very useful for my piercing.</li>
      <li>Very solid and good quality.</li>
      <li>For a septum piercing, you would want septum forceps and for other piercings you would want a needle receiver or Pennington forceps.&lt;br /&gt;These are great otherwise.</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased until just now when I seen it looks like it comes with 2 extra pieces...</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re pretty comfortable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and is very useful.</li>
      <li>They got here on time, but I needed a different kind.</li>
      <li>Actually works nice for holding some electronic parts.</li>
      <li>, I have not used them to actually pierce anything, I tried but I wasn&#x27;t in the right mindset to shove a needle through my own body, but they hold the skin in place and all you need is a rubber band to make them hold still</li>
      <li>They came in super early and were clean and came with a bag to keep them clean when not using them.</li>
      <li>I know there has to be friction so the skin is fastened right</li>
      <li>Just be aware it may cause a but of pain for the piercee.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These, like most of the surgical instruments nowadays, is probably made in Pakistan/India/China and not in the USA, but they seem to be alright and work well for me, only time will tell if they hold up under use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you know exactly what six inches looks</li>
      <li>Good quality but very tight and arrived unsealed.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking or smaller, you might not want to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;- is only good for piercings that already &amp;#34;have&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Just something to keep in mind if you dont have a large ultrasonic or autoclave</li>
      <li>(engaging the lock would only work on a sponge or paper).</li>
      <li>(the picture /might/ make you think it comes with more, not really</li>
      <li>Pinches the skim a little hard but perfect for getting piercing straight.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, a little sharp</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these forceps for a few piercings now and they&#x27;ve made the process a lot more helpful.</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;ll have to use a rubber band as they r very tight :)</li>
      <li>But other then that, they&#x27;re gonna be very useful for when I pierce my vertical labret</li>
      <li>but they weren&#x27;t sealed so i wouldnt say they r completely sterile</li>
      <li>You will need a different pair for piercing nipples, but this worked just fine and gets the job done on other piercings.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m NOT going to write a review for ALL the items I buy related to the Piercing trade, I just don&#x27;t have the time, so for this item and all other Piercing related items, THIS item and other related items are a good buy for the money spent, it was packed well and arrived quickly, thank you for your understanding.  </li>
      <li>, it couldn&#x27;t lock closed, so it was kind of pointless.</li>
      <li>Other than that very recommended.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a little tight to the skin, but work just fine.</li>
      <li>the edges are a little sharp and might need filed down a bit; no problem and most forceps are like that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

<li> , it couldn&#x27;t lock closed, so it was kind of pointless.</li>
<li> Other than that very recommended.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re a little tight to the skin, but work just fine.</li>
<li> the edges are a little sharp and might need filed down a bit; no problem and most forceps are like that.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> Came 5 days earlier then the earliest estimated date, they were in a padded envolope and then in a little plastic clear bag</li>
<li> these are great, yet they hurt so bad!</li>
<li> They are allot bigger then I expected.</li>
<li> and if you hold it on the skin for long it can cause some bruising.</li>
<li> /&gt;- is a little big, so understand how big 6&amp;#34; is.</li>
<li> ; long!</li>
<li> Only let down is it leaves marking on the skin</li>
<li> I do not like the locking mechanism, because it clamps down too tight and leaves marks on the skin or could bruise sensitive skin.</li>
<li> the &amp;#34;right amount&amp;#34; of skin and just need a little pressure (as I would say), such as ear and lip piercings.</li>
<li> However, the end was a triangle shape, not the circular shape I expected.</li>
<li> Just have to be careful not to lock it.</li>
<li> it closed</li>
<li> but this texture is a bit sharp.</li>
<li> and i didnt recive the other set of the end of the clamps...</li>
<li> Very rough and hurt to wear for a while,</li>
<li> I had to file it down</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet because I&#x27;m still waiting on the arrival of my piercing needles but tested them out and had to use a rubber band because the self lock was way too tight.</li>
<li> And (although probably not their fault) having them clamped was impossible, it would simply pierce your skin, it would be far too tight.</li>
<li> but you just push the handles together and bend them apart a little to &amp;#34;unlock&amp;#34; them.</li>
<li> They kinda hurt a little when trying to pierce my lips</li>
<li> It runs a little longer then 6&amp;#34; .</li>
<li> You get what you pay for, so you won&#x27;t want to close these hard as the ridges are sharp, but they hold the flesh in place well.</li>
<li> The locking device is not to be used on skin and if so, could cause skin breakage, bruising, discoloration, small bleeding, etc.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I can not fit them in my case.</li>
<li> so you can see what the inside of the clamp looks like so don&#x27;t be disappointed if you didn&#x27;t get a second pair of clamps, there&#x27;s a locking device that seems to be confusing some people</li>
<li> The forceps are way to tight and painful to use!</li>
<li> They hurt worse then the piercings themselves!!</li>
<li> Very difficult to use them for piercings because of the length, but they will do the job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality but very tight and arrived unsealed.</li>
    <li> These things are huge, and clamp way tighter than needed for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Not as shown. I can&#x27;t even get them to open.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and a great product, sterilized but not hermeticly sealed which is ok cuz i sterilize all my stuff per use anyway but a great product for a great price and does its job</li>
    <li> This really is a great pair and it has amazing grip, it&#x27;s just the texture of the pieces that grasp the skin are quite rough and may make your client wince. I know there has to be friction so the skin is fastened right but this texture is a bit sharp. It really is a great forcep, it does it&#x27;s job and it does it well! It&#x27;s easy to control. Just be aware it may cause a but of pain for the piercee.</li>
    <li> Very rough and hurt to wear for a while, and i couldn&#x27;t clamp it closed so i had to use rubber bands. But great quality and would reccomend.</li>
    <li> It runs a little longer then 6&amp;#34; . Just something to keep in mind if you dont have a large ultrasonic or autoclave</li>
    <li> Great for belly and lip piercings. I do not like the locking mechanism, because it clamps down too tight and leaves marks on the skin or could bruise sensitive skin. Just have to be careful not to lock it. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed and is very useful.</li>
    <li> When they arrived, they were in a plastic bag, however it was not sealed. When i took then out, they had finger prints all over them and they are scuffed and use.&lt;br /&gt;0/10 would not recommend</li>
    <li> Came 5 days earlier then the earliest estimated date, they were in a padded envolope and then in a little plastic clear bag but they weren&#x27;t sealed so i wouldnt say they r completely sterile but i will soak them in rubbing alcohol.. all in all i think they will get the job done fine. Also I&#x27;ll have to use a rubber band as they r very tight :)</li>
    <li> Pinches the skim a little hard but perfect for getting piercing straight. Is great if your doing your own piercings as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even get these to open! They are stuck shut!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing mini about these things. They are huge</li>
    <li> You will need a different pair for piercing nipples, but this worked just fine and gets the job done on other piercings. I had to file it down some, no hassle at all. I recommend this for any self-piercer, but note, it is not for all piercings.</li>
    <li> love them, they numbed the area i was piercing and i didnt feel a thing</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it, when there was tissue between the top part, it couldn&#x27;t lock closed, so it was kind of pointless.</li>
    <li> They got here on time, but I needed a different kind. They&#x27;re a little tight to the skin, but work just fine.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet because I&#x27;m still waiting on the arrival of my piercing needles but tested them out and had to use a rubber band because the self lock was way too tight. But other then that, they&#x27;re gonna be very useful for when I pierce my vertical labret</li>
    <li> Durable and nice for professional and home use .. love it</li>
    <li> The clamp itself is very good my only problem is that it keeps getting stuck. Other than that very recommended.</li>
    <li> Great! Got them quick and are a great product</li>
    <li> Ordered these as an addition to my piercing tool set. Unfortunately I can not fit them in my case. The listing says 6&amp;#34;, but the forceps I received are 10&amp;#34; long! Very difficult to use them for piercings because of the length, but they will do the job.</li>
    <li> Actually works nice for holding some electronic parts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its supposed to leave marks but it did to me and i didnt recive the other set of the end of the clamps... It wasnt a good experience for me.</li>
    <li> The forceps are way to tight and painful to use! They hurt worse then the piercings themselves!!</li>
    <li> Years ago, I worked in the OR as an OR Tech, assisting the Nurses and Doctors and these Forceps are just like the ones we used in the OR, they&#x27;re chrome plated SS metal and can be autoclaved/sterilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These, like most of the surgical instruments nowadays, is probably made in Pakistan/India/China and not in the USA, but they seem to be alright and work well for me, only time will tell if they hold up under use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m NOT going to write a review for ALL the items I buy related to the Piercing trade, I just don&#x27;t have the time, so for this item and all other Piercing related items, THIS item and other related items are a good buy for the money spent, it was packed well and arrived quickly, thank you for your understanding.  :)</li>
    <li> They came in super early and were clean and came with a bag to keep them clean when not using them. They don&#x27;t come with a second set of tips, that&#x27;s just the picture so you can see what the inside of the clamp looks like so don&#x27;t be disappointed if you didn&#x27;t get a second pair of clamps, there&#x27;s a locking device that seems to be confusing some people but you just push the handles together and bend them apart a little to &amp;#34;unlock&amp;#34; them. Haven&#x27;t got to use them yet but they&#x27;re pretty comfortable and I can&#x27;t wait for the rest of my piercing kit to come in so I can pierce mine and my friend&#x27;s belly buttons!</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Perfect size, but leaves indentations all over face.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. And was very useful for my piercing. However, the end was a triangle shape, not the circular shape I expected. And (although probably not their fault) having them clamped was impossible, it would simply pierce your skin, it would be far too tight. I had to use a rubber band.</li>
    <li> I love these clamps. I use them allot for every piercing that I can do with them. I&#x27;ve done 3 lip piercings with them. 3 ear piercings and to get the proper placement of a jestrum. Very solid and good quality. They are allot bigger then I expected. If you purchase these make sure you know exactly what six inches looks like cause these clamps are big.</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t anything like I thought they&#x27;d be</li>
    <li> Is everything it said it was.thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these forceps for a few piercings now and they&#x27;ve made the process a lot more helpful. They look nice and numb the skin after putting just enough pressure on it so the needle would go in smoothly. It does what it was made to do. Only let down is it leaves marking on the skin and if you hold it on the skin for long it can cause some bruising. Be safe✌</li>
    <li> Pretty good, a little sharp but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I guess they are okay .... They kinda hurt a little when trying to pierce my lips</li>
    <li> Does the job it needs to do. Obviously, you won&#x27;t be locking these on flesh (engaging the lock would only work on a sponge or paper). You get what you pay for, so you won&#x27;t want to close these hard as the ridges are sharp, but they hold the flesh in place well. Did not come with extra pieces.</li>
    <li> these are great, yet they hurt so bad! I recommend getting plastic forceps!!!</li>
    <li> You get what was said and what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Some discretion:&lt;br /&gt;- the edges are a little sharp and might need filed down a bit; no problem and most forceps are like that.&lt;br /&gt;- DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE THE LOCKING DEVICE! The locking device is not to be used on skin and if so, could cause skin breakage, bruising, discoloration, small bleeding, etc. You should use a rubber band looped around the handles 2-3 times depending on the pressure needed.&lt;br /&gt;- only comes with one piece (the picture /might/ make you think it comes with more, not really sure).&lt;br /&gt;- is a little big, so understand how big 6&amp;#34; is. If you&#x27;re looking or smaller, you might not want to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;- is only good for piercings that already &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;right amount&amp;#34; of skin and just need a little pressure (as I would say), such as ear and lip piercings. Would not be good for nipple, navel, septum, etc. For a septum piercing, you would want septum forceps and for other piercings you would want a needle receiver or Pennington forceps.&lt;br /&gt;These are great otherwise.</li>
    <li> I cant&#x27;t say anything for or against the price but these are good forceps, I have not used them to actually pierce anything, I tried but I wasn&#x27;t in the right mindset to shove a needle through my own body, but they hold the skin in place and all you need is a rubber band to make them hold still</li>
    <li> They work...and I was very pleased until just now when I seen it looks like it comes with 2 extra pieces...I just received the 1 pare...so if it isn&#x27;t supposed to come with the extra clamps I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
