      <li>5 stars for sure though.</li>
      <li>I seem to brake most of them after a month.  </li>
      <li>my life is so much better now that this is brush</li>
      <li>more compact version might be a nice-to-have for traveling, but youi&#x27;ll find no complaints here.  </li>
      <li>Buy it. :-)</li>
      <li>My stylist used a curved brush on my hair during my last visit and I was determined to find one because it just felt wonderful!  </li>
      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a couple more for my family.  </li>
      <li>Love this brush, it&#x27;s a scalp massage every time I brush my hair.</li>
      <li>still use this brush, but it&#x27;s no longer as pleasant as when I first received it.</li>
      <li>There were a couple of options available on Amazon and this one was the most affordable.  </li>
      <li>Best brush to use on wet hair!</li>
      <li>I liked this brush at first, but after a couple of months of use all of the balls on the end of the bristles had come off.  </li>
      <li>Other than that a good price for a good product.</li>
      <li>This brush is my go to for blow drying my hair and helping it to look smooth.</li>
      <li>It was a fabulous brush from them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Seems cheaply made with lightweight plastic....</li>
      <li>I always get complements on my hair and how smooth it looks; they think a beautician has done it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The rubber on the handle is cheap and moves a bit when I am using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush after trying my mom&#x27;s (she has the original &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; pricier version).</li>
      <li>Ergonomic, feels great on your scale, doesn&#x27;t pull or break my long hair, great for combing out wet hair, too!</li>
      <li>This brush is GREAT for combing out wet hair after showering, and also for heat styling/blow drying.</li>
      <li>and I kept borrowing it until I finally ordered one of my own.</li>
      <li>I love the vented brush, I know it is initially used for brazilian keratin process, however it dries my hair in ten minutes and it looks good.</li>
      <li>This brush broke right off the handle right after one month.</li>
      <li>My sister had a similar brush that I loved and borrowed frequently, but I could not find it online.</li>
      <li>The product, which advertises &amp;#34;Soft Tips - gentle on scalp&amp;#34;, was true, but without some of the tips, the brush causes a less than pleasant sensation against the scalp -- not at all the massaging, gentle experience from before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The last one lasted about 5  to 6 months, so I was hoping to get more mileage off of this one.</li>
      <li>the larger size is even BETTER</li>
      <li>I have long hair, lots of it and very fine.</li>
      <li>Very non willing to help.</li>
      <li>I still get the occasional and very minimal static but for the most part this works like a charm.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a large vented brush for my hair for awhile now.</li>
      <li>offer the massage affect on scalp because it covers a large area.&lt;br</li>
      <li>much of a comfort grip when using it.</li>
      <li>Makes brushing so much easier.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will just be more careful next time....</li>
      <li>The problem is, about 4 weeks after I got it, it broke - the top half of the brush literally flew off in the middle of brushing.</li>
      <li>I have medium length thick black hair and for a while, the brush was great</li>
      <li>I have had it for a few weeks and it is fine so far.  </li>
      <li>Man was I surprised-  </li>
      <li>It really does feel like a message on your scalp and to blow dry while using, much faster than using regular hair brushes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not worth $8, not even worth $1.</li>
      <li>I used it for only about one month and it just broke clean in half.</li>
      <li>Great for blowing out hair I have really thick wavy hair, this brush straightens and smooths, my thick hair drys quite a bit faster with this type of brush too,</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very sturdily made.</li>
      <li>I love this style of brush, but can&#x27;t use it, this is the second one that has broken in this manner.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s a little too large for my short hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s brush developed a loose handle that had to be glued (twice!)</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts.</li>

    <li> my life is so much better now that this is brush is a part of it.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is my go to for blow drying my hair and helping it to look smooth. I always get complements on my hair and how smooth it looks; they think a beautician has done it. But  it&#x27;s just me, my blow dryer, and this awesome brush!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a large vented brush for my hair for awhile now. I have long, thick, wavy hair so I need a good brush. I seem to brake most of them after a month.  This feel so good and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag. Makes brushing so much easier.  I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Have had a countoured brush for years but lost it recently on a business trip.  Had a really difficult time replacing it, Finally found this one, but it was significantly larger than the one I lost so had my reservations. Man was I surprised-  the larger size is even BETTER and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  In fact, writing this review reminds me I want to buy a sparem just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more compact version might be a nice-to-have for traveling, but youi&#x27;ll find no complaints here.  Loving the brush.  It rocks.</li>
    <li> My stylist used a curved brush on my hair during my last visit and I was determined to find one because it just felt wonderful!  I couldn&#x27;t find one in-store, so I of course turned to Amazon.  There were a couple of options available on Amazon and this one was the most affordable.  Since I couldn&#x27;t see the brushes in person I chose to go with the cheaper option in hopes it will be just what I was looking for.  Overall this brush fits my needs, but I gave it a 3 star because I probably would not purchase it again if I had a do over.  I think I would opt for a more expensive version in hopes of finding a sturdier brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Large/wide bristle head&lt;br /&gt;Does offer the massage affect on scalp because it covers a large area.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it feels good on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Seems cheaply made with lightweight plastic....I have had it for a few weeks and it is fine so far.  I am just wondering how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber on the handle is cheap and moves a bit when I am using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not much of a comfort grip when using it.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush I will use. A persons head is curved so it makes sense to have a curved brush. I have thick hair and this is the only brush that can get to my scalp and give it a massage when I brush</li>
    <li> Seen this on YouTube .someone was using it and I looked it up and got one...soooo good..happy happy..thinking about getting another one</li>
    <li> I bought this soley on the reviews, well and the price, plus the added bonus of free-shipping, very nice!  It really does feel like a message on your scalp and to blow dry while using, much faster than using regular hair brushes.  I&#x27;ll probably get a couple more for my family.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This curved brush is so Nice, but  in two times this  brush arrival brocken. i live in Sud América, and return this productos is complicated</li>
    <li> Saw a girl using one in a Youtube video. I have long hair, lots of it and very fine. This brush is GREAT for combing out wet hair after showering, and also for heat styling/blow drying. Therefore, this is a excellent brush for travel as it serves two needs in one item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Buy it. :-)</li>
    <li> My sister had a similar brush that I loved and borrowed frequently, but I could not find it online. Instead, I found the Curved Contour Vented Brush, and placed an order for it instead. Unfortunately, after only a few months of use, some of the tips have fallen off. The product, which advertises &amp;#34;Soft Tips - gentle on scalp&amp;#34;, was true, but without some of the tips, the brush causes a less than pleasant sensation against the scalp -- not at all the massaging, gentle experience from before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this brush, but it&#x27;s no longer as pleasant as when I first received it.</li>
    <li> Best brush to use on wet hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for a replacement brush for my ancient curved contour vented brush. This is the ONLY one I could find. Unfortunately it&#x27;s a little too large for my short hair. Other than that a good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> Horrible brush. Has ripped my hair out because the balls on the tips of the bristles are rubberized. I had this brush from a different seller and it fell off my counter and broke in half. It was a fabulous brush from them. This sellers version was a rubberized terrible brush. Very non willing to help.</li>
    <li> A hair brush is a hair brush until you try this one with the perfect contour to glide over the top of your head. My son borrowed it and won&#x27;t give it back so I am buying another one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself and everyone in the family wanted to use it. Now everyone has their own. Great comfort grip &amp; good quality</li>
    <li> I liked this brush at first, but after a couple of months of use all of the balls on the end of the bristles had come off.  Then this morning it broke in half while I was brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I can blow dry my hair in minutes.</li>
    <li> It was far too wide...did not feel well described.&lt;br /&gt;I will just be more careful next time....Among the few things&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased with Amazon....this was my only disappointment.</li>
    <li> Ergonomic, feels great on your scale, doesn&#x27;t pull or break my long hair, great for combing out wet hair, too!</li>
    <li> I still get the occasional and very minimal static but for the most part this works like a charm. 5 stars for sure though.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! My hair dresser recommended it and i ordered it while still in her chair.&lt;br /&gt; The open curvy shape helps me dry my hair faster because it lets the air go through. It does a great job detangling my hair too!</li>
    <li> Great for blowing out hair I have really thick wavy hair, this brush straightens and smooths, my thick hair drys quite a bit faster with this type of brush too, LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after trying my mom&#x27;s (she has the original &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; pricier version). I have medium length thick black hair and for a while, the brush was great - it felt great on the scalp and did a great job detangling. The problem is, about 4 weeks after I got it, it broke - the top half of the brush literally flew off in the middle of brushing. I&#x27;m disappointed. Will not purchase a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little bit torn, here. On one hand, I  love how this brush feels on my scalp! My husband bought it for our teenage daughter and I kept borrowing it until I finally ordered one of my own. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very sturdily made. For this price I expect a brush to last a while. My daughter&#x27;s brush developed a loose handle that had to be glued (twice!) and a few days ago the head of the brush broke in half while she was brushing her hair. Beware if you have long, thick hair. We&#x27;ll see how long the one I bought lasts.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy and need to return it.  It fell lightly on the floor and broke in half immediately - poor design</li>
    <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s a scalp massage every time I brush my hair. Be careful though, it will snap in half like glass if dropped onto a hard surface. I&#x27;ve had to replace two of my own, but also gave another three to my daughters a gifts.</li>
    <li> The brush has a great shape and design. Unfortunately the plastic cracked on the side and I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I love the vented brush, I know it is initially used for brazilian keratin process, however it dries my hair in ten minutes and it looks good.</li>
    <li> This brush broke right off the handle right after one month. I used it for only about one month and it just broke clean in half. I had to throw it away. Very disappointed. It&#x27;s not worth $8, not even worth $1. I have medium long blonde hair. My hair isn&#x27;t thin, I have a a lot of hair. I love this style of brush, but can&#x27;t use it, this is the second one that has broken in this manner. The last one lasted about 5  to 6 months, so I was hoping to get more mileage off of this one.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever owned. Very impressed. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my family and friends, some have even ordered them one.</li>
