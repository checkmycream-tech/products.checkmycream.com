      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that there are people writing good reviews about this product as it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
      <li>so I felt good about myself.</li>

      <li>and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>This kit is amazing.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome body wrap and works very well.</li>
      <li>are probably people getting paid to do so because in all honest</li>
      <li>it honestly did not work .....</li>
      <li>I even cranked my heat up to keep it nice and warm.</li>
      <li>was given the opportunity to receive this product for a discounted price in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I believe the skin would have been softer with any warm moisture sealed against my skin in plastic wrap for an hour.</li>
      <li>I did receive this for review but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
      <li>Wraps should be WARM though.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even when you do get it to stay put, the instructions say to keep it warm.</li>
      <li>The clay is good, and mixes easily.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to prepare</li>
      <li>Very easy and lost 2 inches.</li>
      <li>To start - it has a nice scent and leaves my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
      <li>2- I received an email from the seller with better instructions saying to keep the area warm while having the clay on.</li>
      <li>I love the clay it feels nice on the skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried probably all the wraps and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I ordered them but decided to cancel because I am broke as can be and thought the statements were too good to be true</li>
      <li>It all seemed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>The wrap clips didn&#x27;t hold they were very cheap</li>
      <li>If you just want to look great for a certain event, date, etc.</li>
      <li>The bandages don&#x27;t clip on that well and could be better</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting clothes on over top of that.</li>
      <li>Both of us feel better, see fewer stretch marks, and see a reduction in visible cellulite.</li>
      <li>Love this product, but please make the clips better....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this wrap a 5 star mostly for the clay.  </li>
      <li>I just used safety pins instead, and then wrapped plastic wrap over top.</li>
      <li>and she got stuck with a bit of baby fat, but because of work and having to take care of a baby she wasn&#x27;t really able to continue exercising, so we gave this a try.</li>
      <li>I also feel it reduced my love handle area.</li>
      <li>If i get better results i will update.&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
      <li>but after looking at the reviews I saw these wraps had a better rating and a better price.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
      <li>buy again for sure</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get fooled, you&#x27;re better off just rolling in the dirt.</li>
      <li>I LOVE how silky my skin feels after using this.</li>
      <li>maybe l try again another time and hopefully have better luck.</li>
      <li>Be sure to have everything close at hand when you start.</li>
      <li>/&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many wraps you get for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it has worked for most of you, but based on my experience, I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
      <li>5 wrap the area you just did with a cling wrap is better than a towel to keep the area warm which is the most important step 6</li>
      <li>My boyfriend really enjoyed painting and wrapping my tummy</li>
      <li>so make sure you put ample time away to do</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try it again. You have to mix the clay and then wrap yourself up in ace wraps which doesnt even stay on correctly unless you stand still for hours. It was annoying to take off too because now you have to wash mud off of yourself and the ace wraps. Too much work and no results in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Too much trouble. Haven&#x27;t noticed any results</li>
    <li> Just bought this stuff for the first time and I will have it by Tuesday. Hopefully I see good results, by the looks of it it seems like a good product all 5 stars! Can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t believe that there are people writing good reviews about this product as it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. They must have got paid for writing those reviews.</li>
    <li> No weight loss nor inches for me as I read..</li>
    <li> Works AMAZING for stretch marks. I had a 9 pound baby recently so I&#x27;ve for some pretty big stretch marks and this works awesome. It doesn&#x27;t help loose weight but the 4 stars are for what it has done to my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and flaky skin and have to constatly put lotion on myself.  This wrap has really made my skin feel a lot nicer and it has helped me firm up my midsection. I will continue to use and I would highly recommend you purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I was so pumped after reading all the positive reviews. I must have received a dud pack. I followed the instructions to a tee. I measured my abdomen and thighs. Used saran wrap to retain the heat. The clay was of perfect consistency. I set the timer and waited. I did the wraps twice. I measured the same. Lost no inches. I returned for a refund. I&#x27;m glad it has worked for most of you, but based on my experience, I would not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Finally...something that works! I have tried all sorts of wraps &amp;#34;claiming&amp;#34; to help slim and detox. I tried It Works and many others and they most definitely did NOT work.. This body wrap is awesome. I can&#x27;t believe how many wraps you get for the price. I cannot believe the difference this made with stretch marks. What used to make me feel uncomfortable now doesn&#x27;t because I am able to show off my legs and stomach in a swim suit without feeling like there is cellulite and stretch marks all over. I felt the instructions were very straight forward, I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers are talking about about them not being clear. I LOVE how silky my skin feels after using this. I almost hate to rinse off after because I like how smooth my skin feels. On the bright side, the silkiness does last after cleaning off</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first whether this product could possibly work, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I thought it was pretty simple to use and apply.  I also added saran wrap on top of the wrap for extra heat and then wrapped myself in a towel! Worked well and i would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and i have to say this is one product that works. i lost 2 inches after an hour with the clay on....and the next morning i still had a 2 inch loss....i will update my progress. but i have to say that i mixed the mud thick and used an 1 inch paint brush to apply the mud. i think next time i will use press and seal. over all i really like the product. i will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> Very mess and clips on wrap broke</li>
    <li> Terrible.i followed all the instructions. Extremely messy process and useless</li>
    <li> The product was so faulty that i didn&#x27;t even get to see if it could do what it claims.  The &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; was liquid and the clips on the wraps wouldn&#x27;t hold. The instructions were poor at best. Ugh, I hate getting ripped off.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!! It&#x27;s a waste of money I have finished my whole box safe to say nothing has changed &amp; to be honest idk why cuz I&#x27;m already a small girl just with few problem areas but it did absolutely nothing people claim to see life changing results are probably people getting paid to do so because in all honest I followed every instruction watched videos and all that and I look the same stretchmarks and all big let down never again will i buy from this company they&#x27;re fake and laugh when we spend our money on something that they know will never work</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use these body wraps weekly. Our local spa recommended them. We are true believers in their effects. Both of us feel better, see fewer stretch marks, and see a reduction in visible cellulite. The wraps are easy to apply right out of the box. With proper preparation, there is very little mess.</li>
    <li> I have left reviews for a few products and none have been negative, but this one is a complete waste of money. They should give me my money back AND pay to have everything cleaned. I followed the directions. I even did the suggested plastic wrap over it and wrapped myself in a towel too. I even cranked my heat up to keep it nice and warm. It does not work at all. My skin was slightly softer but was not any tighter and I was not any slimmer at all. I believe the skin would have been softer with any warm moisture sealed against my skin in plastic wrap for an hour. It had nothing to do with the clay or the bandages. They are completely worthless and a waste of time, a messy waste of time. It drips grey, hard to clean up, ashy looking stuff all over and leaves a film in your sink when you rinse it out. Also left stains on my towels. I had to wash them a few times to get it out. I don&#x27;t leave this review to be a nasty person, I just hope I spare someone from making the same mistake I did.</li>
    <li> In my personal opinion is not worth the money. Its messy, and the wrap wont stay at least that you actually put a plastic wrap around it.</li>
    <li> Did not work, no change at all, this product is garbage!</li>
    <li> Its messy and not sure if it even works I think I will try again but another product.</li>
    <li> Didnt make a difference at all</li>
    <li> I thougt it was hard to use and  did have the best directionsand didnt see any results I like the it wprk wraps alot better</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the amount of work for this wrap. Way too much work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and I did everything correctly and tried it numerous times... Even tried keeping a heating blanket on me to keep it heated and still no results :(</li>
    <li> thought the clay would be thicker</li>
    <li> this was a waste of my time</li>
    <li> Bought it recommended from a friend to lighten up strech marks! Liking what I see will be posting pictures!</li>
    <li> Would not purchase again, waste of $$.</li>
    <li> Very very messy, it makes your skin smooth, but that&#x27;s about it, and the wraps are surely made for a slender female. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Ill probably buy this again. It does make me look great, Its always hard for me to keep my tummy area looking good and since ive used this I look awesome</li>
    <li> Disappointing results.</li>
    <li> My sister started using these wraps a couple months ago and recommended that I try them. She let me use some of hers and I noticed a difference right away. I ordered my own box and am happy with the results. My stomach was flatter and skin feels good.  It is kind of messy, but that can be dealt with easily and it’s definitely worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all! Used this product on two clients at my spa. Followed directions, I&#x27;ve done body wraps successfully for years. This product makes no difference! Very awkward for me as a the owner.</li>
    <li> These worked really well. I lost inches off my tummy after just one use. I will use these anytime I have something coming up that I want to look slimmer for!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I will admit I was skeptical. I thought this possibly couldn&#x27;t work... but I still thought about giving it a try. Each time I use it I shrink an inch around my waist line. It tightens my skin, tones it and my stomach looks flatter and flatter. I have even tried this on my legs... and it drastically has helped flatten and smooth out my cellulite. This stuff is awesome. Worth the price. You have to try it to believe it. You will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> Very messy and the wraps were very cheap and flimsy</li>
    <li> Love this product, but please make the clips better....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy.  Cannot believe that this actually works.  Lost about 1 inch immediately and my skin feels clean and awesome.</li>
    <li> I followed instructions and it doesnt work !!!! Dont buy I didnt lose no inches and im skinny i was just trying to get rid of the tiny jelly fat i have</li>
    <li> This is really a waste of time. I followed the directions perfectly and saw no results, sometimes even poor results.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Seemed to help tighten things up, maybe helped a little on the stretch marks. For the price it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> READ THE DIRECTIONS FULLY BEFORE OPENING ANYTHING INSIDE THE BOX!  With that said, I completely, ruined the first 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;However, sure enough after I read a few more reviews I saw immediate results! Starting out at about 38in, my first application left me with 37 in my stomach right around the belly button!&lt;br /&gt;Fool Proof Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;This process can be messy the first time around.&lt;br /&gt;*Have a paint brush (or similar), a friend, and towels ready and throw away the clips provided*&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to take pictures and measurements!&lt;br /&gt;1. Fully immerse wraps in a pot of water at low-medium temp and then go on to mix the clay.&lt;br /&gt;2. Add a packet of clay to an extra small bowl then add 1 TABLESPOON of hot water and stir.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the clay to desired area with the paintbrush.&lt;br /&gt;4. Remove the pot with the wraps and to avoid scorching your hands, run A LITTLE  cool water over them as you wring them out as much as you can. Wraps should be WARM though.&lt;br /&gt;5. Have a friend wrap your muddy area snug and you hold the end piece in place.&lt;br /&gt;6. Have friend begin to  wrap saran wrap over your wraps.&lt;br /&gt;7. Now wrap yourself in a towel or robe and LIE DOWN or do nothing for an hour that requires you to move much.&lt;br /&gt;8. Take a shower to remove the excess clay. Why not end your spa with one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I find this tedious process totally worth it! My boyfriend really enjoyed painting and wrapping my tummy and he&#x27;s even surprised by the results! I just finished my second application and I&#x27;m down to 36 inches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I&#x27;d love to make this a regular thing with my exercise and diet routine. I will be ordering this again! I wish I could post my pictures!</li>
    <li> I love wraps!  I buy the name brand ones for the same price at wraps.howtonow.org.  These are my personal results from just 1 wrap - I still have 3 more in the box!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to prepare and you wear it on you for an hour.  I had a friend put it on me we used a back support to hold it in place securely. The next day we both lost 5 lbs and she had to weigh in for surgery in June and lose 2 lbs a month. So it worked out perfect for her.</li>
    <li> I am really surprised by how much this product works. I used it just as the instructions indicated and lost 1 inch off around my belly area. I also feel it reduced my love handle area. In addition to helping reduce the size of my waist I felt it improved the texture of my skin to make everything look smoother. My skin feels a lot smoother too. I think with exercise and consistent use this could be the boost you need to feel better in that tight dress or bikini.  I did receive this for review but all opinions and experiences are my own. I can give an update on how I feel after using all of the wrap packets.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and I would like a refund but don&#x27;t know how to get one</li>
    <li> The wrap clips didn&#x27;t hold they were very cheap</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this during a promotional offer in exchange for my honest feedback whether it was positive or negative.I am a first time Mom and well lets face it pregnancy sure did put some damage on my body.Even though I have worked out and got my body back to pre pregnancy I still have those stretch marks from pregnancy and my stomach is still not the same.So I was very happy to try this detox body wraps.After my first use I immediately saw results.My stomach was more sucked in than it was prior.I would recommend getting a measuring tape to measure yourself first.I do not have one so I was not able to measure and tell you how many inch was lost after the wrap.It definitely helps retone your body and everything seems to go in.I do not know what it is about this method but it works.I love the clay it feels nice on the skin but I definitely have to agree with the other reviews this can get messy but did take in the tips to wrap yourself tighter that seems to keep it less messy.You get 8packs of 15grams of clay mix &amp; 2 body wraps.(they are like the ones you use for wrapping ankles and such but much more sturdier and made for the purpose of this kit)This also takes some time to do and not just a quick throw it on and take it off kind of thing so make sure you put ample time away to do it.&lt;br /&gt;Process:&lt;br /&gt;1 boil water 2 Open your wraps put in bowl pour boiled water on wraps to cover them.Soak for 10-15mins. 3 Open one package of powder mix with warm water stir until smooth clay forms 4 apply on desired areas then wring out wraps that were soaking and wrap yoursefl firmly.If water is too hot you can add cold water to make it warm 5 wrap the area you just did with a cling wrap is better than a towel to keep the area warm which is the most important step 6 leave on skin for an hour 7 unwrap and wipe off excess clay no need to shower after 8 wash your bandages and dry in medium heat 9 all done as I stated before they recommend you measuring yourself before and after which I will be doing next time I do this.I need to purchase a measuring tape.I definitely notice a big difference in physical features and the texture of my skin was smoother after using this and am very pleased that it works.I am excited to continue doing this to get the maximum results.Great way to detox wrap &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Volcanic ash,magnesium sulphate,magnesium cloride,sodium chloride,zinc oxide,aloe vera leaf extract,herba leonuri extract,sfron extract,allantoin,tocopheryl acetate, phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;Product of China if you are wondering.e and after which I will be doing next time I do this.I need to purchase a measuring tape.I definitely notice a big difference in physical features and the texture of my skin was smoother after using this and am very pleased that it works.I am excited to continue doing this to get the maximum results.Great way to detox wrap &amp; effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Volcanic ash,magnesium sulphate,magnesium cloride,sodium chloride,zinc oxide,aloe vera leaf extract,herba leonuri extract,sfron extract,allantoin,tocopheryl acetate, phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;Product of China if you are wondering.</li>
    <li> First off it&#x27;s a shame i have to give it at least 1 star to review it. I&#x27;m not a big woman I just have a flabby stomach from having a child. I should have decided not to get it when I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews for it online anywhere other than Amazon.  When I searched for this particular product all I saw was pics, videos, and reviews of It Works body wraps which I really wanted but I couldn&#x27;t afford it at the time. I had high hopes for this wrap because of all the good reviews I read (only on Amazon). It took forever to get here. When it did come it took a lot of prep and trouble to get it on. No matter how  much I squeezed the wraps out and how tight I put the saran wrap my pants always looked like I peed myself. I always had to change my pants and underwear afterwards. I drink only water all day so it was no problem for me to increase my intake while the wrap was on. Once off I saw no difference and after 3 days there was still no difference. I did it 2 more times afterwards and the same, nothing. Feeling discouraged, I was just gonna leave it in my closet until I read one of the comments that a customer said that they returned theirs. So that&#x27;s what I did. At this moment I&#x27;m waiting for the wraps I should&#x27;ve gotten in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I have more confidence that they work overall because of all the evidence I have seen in still images and video. It might have really worked for some people or it could be a scam. Just know that it can be returned. That is all folks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was a little skeptical about these types of wraps. It all seemed too good to be true. After using my first wrap I noticed some pros and cons of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not ridiculously difficult to use. I noticed reviews saying how messy it was, but if mixed right it seems to be pretty easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is pleasant, but not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;-I did notice a difference in my body after using just one wrap (see pictures)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit time consuming. Everything was simple, but there were a lot of steps.&lt;br /&gt;-The clips that come with the bandages are basically useless. Saran Wrap helped hold everything together, but the clips broke while applying them for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;-You may get water all over yourself. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me, but wear things you don&#x27;t mind getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really look forward to seeing if future wraps help improve. I think that with improved clips and an addition of a brush for application these could be great. They&#x27;re not going to completely transform your body, but nothing besides a lifestyle change can really do that.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to receive this product for a discounted price in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> it honestly did not work .....bought if for my wife did not work ....</li>
    <li> I used to pay ridiculous amounts of money for my girlfriend to do this at a spa once a week. I had the opportunity to review these at discounted price so I jumped on it. The disappointing part was that they&#x27;re not ready to use, you have to mix the clay and thats a little messing. But the results are there. Check out the other reviews there is plenty of pictures. My girlfriend refused let me take hers. I highly suggest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a spa body wrap so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare, but really like the way my skin feels and looks after using this product.</li>
    <li> Being Type 1 Diabetic taking insulin in the abdominal area for the past 13 years, I had two large insulin bumps for the past 2-3 years and yellowish skin. I would tell my doctor about them and he said the only thing to do was not use the area. Injecting an average of 4 times a day, I needed the areas greatly. I was actually looking for something to lose weight and was looking at it works wraps but after looking at the reviews I saw these wraps had a better rating and a better price. I ordered them but decided to cancel because I am broke as can be and thought the statements were too good to be true but my cancellation did not go through because it was in the process of being shipped so I decided to try the product. Day 1-I boiled the water and soaked the bands and used a bit of the boiling water to do the clay. I just put the clay and band on with the plastic wrap for an hour (not included on). Results: softer skin Day 2- I received an email from the seller with better instructions saying to keep the area warm while having the clay on. This time I microwaved the band for 2 minutes, put it on top of the clay, bought two towels, which I wet as you do with the band, and my mom microwaved them for 2 minutes each alternating them on top of the band. We did this process for an hour and left the clay on for another 20 minutes before washing off. Results: 40% reduction of yellow skin and 20% reduction in the bump. I have used five of the eight packets in the same way, as day 2 and 60% of both the insulin bump and yellow skin are gone. My clothes are looser but I have been eating healthier and added about 2 hours of exercise a week so I do not know if I could say the clay had anything to do with the looser clothes. I will definitely tell my Dr. of the insulin bump reduction.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like enough clay. The clasps for the bandages are horribly made. The process turned my skin red and I had to literally scrub the clay off of me. Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, we had our daughter 2 years ago and she got stuck with a bit of baby fat, but because of work and having to take care of a baby she wasn&#x27;t really able to continue exercising, so we gave this a try.The treatment really IS easy to apply, and these words are coming from a pretty lazy guy so anything that isn&#x27;t quick and easy I won&#x27;t do. My wife shrunk a couple inches on her tummy area after just a couple uses, we couldn&#x27;t be more happy about purchasing this item!</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried one other brand that did zilch for me. The results are immediate and they last. Whether you&#x27;ve wrapped before or this is your first time, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Too time consuming</li>
    <li> This makes your skin feels good but does not work as described and it cost so much</li>
    <li> Way overpriced for what u get. You can buy this type of clay in bulk from amazons and use ceran wrap instead. Try Moroccan clay and french green clay. Mix it with some coffee grinds and loose green tea leafes. Store it in a ball jar. Add a little boiling water when ready to use to make a paste.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only used 2 I cant wait to see the final result.</li>
    <li> It was messy, and it didn&#x27;t work on me. Sorry, but I will not endorse this product.</li>
    <li> I really love the clay.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  like it.  I thought  they are parches</li>
    <li> This honestly had a higher hype than what I saw as results. I rated it a three as it did make my skin soft but in regards to inch loss or toning I did not see any difference. I am a small figured woman, size 6 in jeans, only wanted to loose my post  baby belly. Did not do that... however it did give me a super soft tummy.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried body wraps and this Detox Body Wrap Brazilian Silky n&#x27; Slim Volcanic Clay Organic Body Wrap is pretty amazing. So far I&#x27;ve only used it once since it&#x27;s a one time a week application but even after that one time I&#x27;ve seen a difference. I am bigger than most people and this body wrap did a pretty good job for just one application. I&#x27;m definitely not saying that it took a bunch of my fat away but it did visually look different after the wrap. My stretch marks were also not nearly as dark as they were before hand. This body wrap is pretty easy to use as long as you read the instructions but you definitely need to allow yourself the time since you need to get the wrap and clay ready and then leave it all on for an hour. I also would suggest using saran wrap as well since it seemed to help hold everything together better. I can&#x27;t wait to use the other applications and to see the results that gives me but as of right now I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Terrible. They didn&#x27;t work at all. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not sure if these do anything.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin soft but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> The wraps did not work after I washed them</li>
    <li> Not satisfied at all. Wonder if i can even get my money back. I used at directed but did nit work for me at all. It is messy and you really have to be patient since the bandages do roll but I beleive does not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> So I am actively using the product and this is my second time attempting to apply it  and actually this is bogus those pin are not suitable for someone with a belly they popped off and the wrap itself did not cover my whole entire belly. If you are suppose to use plastic they should have also added it to the kit. I am not liking this product so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;It Works&#x27; products and thought this clay would be a nice alternative because of the price, I was wrong. There&#x27;s so much mess using this. The wet bandage wrap are so uncomfortable and hard to wrap around. Even when you do get it to stay put, the instructions say to keep it warm. Mine was cold before I could even get it to stay on, and every time it popped off, it took all the clay off with it...so fustrating!!!</li>
    <li> So, this product is an adventure. To start - it has a nice scent and leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I think that it does do a moderate job of reducing the look of stretch marks. Not sure if that&#x27;s a long term thing or not.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely drippy. I suggest putting the bandages in a stopped up sink and pouring your boiling water over them. Make sure to measure the right amount to make the mud. My first mud got a little too much water which made it a mess to put on. I used a new basting brush to brush on the mud. I stood in the tub for application and it made for easy clean up. While you wait plan to wrap yourself in a towel or heavy robe to keep the drippys from getting all over the floor. Be sure to have everything close at hand when you start. Didn&#x27;t really see a reduction in inches. I waited 24 hours to measure because compression alone can create the change in inches.&lt;br /&gt;It says on the package you don&#x27;t need to bathe afterwards.  Ummm, no. You have dried mud all over the section you&#x27;re working on.. I think you&#x27;re going to need a shower. I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting clothes on over top of that.</li>
    <li> It was really messy and I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> Try it for yourself....... Works for some better than others but an overall great product</li>
    <li> Did everything exactly as instructed and did not work at all, repeated a few days later and still no difference.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what I was doing n gave it away</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Way too messy and hard to use, zero results.</li>
    <li> Messy, dirty, gets everywhere and does nothing else!!  I&#x27;m still trying to clean up mud.</li>
    <li> These wraps are such a huge money saver! These kinds of wraps are really really popular in my area and go for between $80-$100 (plus tips) at the local spas. I know because my sister and I go about once a month. This box has enough for 8 wraps for HALF the price I was paying for one! Ridiculous, makes me mad at the spa I go to lol. These detox wraps work just as well the only difference I saw was convenience because they ARE time consuming and messy (do it standing in the bathtub, it makes for easier clean up.) and maybe a little bit of a pain in the butt to apply but it&#x27;s definitely worth the $750 I&#x27;m saving doing it myself! I love the fact too that since I&#x27;m doing it at home I&#x27;m able to customize the formula some by adding an essential oil to the clay. I already use a bentonite clay mask weekly on my face to help detox my skin but being able to do it on a larger scale and lose the extra flab is great. Set aside about 2 hours to do the wrap, longer maybe the first time and give it a go. You&#x27;ll love the results. You do have to do it fairly regularly to keep the results up but I lose at least one size every time I do it. I invited my sister over for an at home spa night and we had a blast. It is definitely easier with a partner but seriously you can do it alone too, it&#x27;s not That hard. These are perfect if you have an upcoming date or event that you want to look your best for. I received my first box free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using the product and the results I got. Fantastic and I&#x27;m telling everyone I know! These are so great!</li>
    <li> No results. Very messy</li>
    <li> This item arrived as described...very good product. I agree with the other reviews the connectors are not good at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work out the wa I thought it would. Saw no results and I got this based on the  good reviews that I saw.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work . Just stop eating pasta, white rice and drinking coke you will see a results in two weeks..</li>
    <li> i do 3wrap but didnt see any result. the first 2times at home with plastic wrap around but the last one at a sauna. so disappointed!</li>
    <li> Payed lots of cash and didn&#x27;t see any type of result???</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 140 lbs, just have a bit of a baby belly. Was hoping for something that could help along with diet and exercise for the summer. Maybe my fat cells don&#x27;t need detoxing???</li>
    <li> I just got the product yesterday and tried it today. I did it after a run so I felt good about myself. I got to admit that I felt like my belly did feel firmer just after the first use. I have twins and had the third one a year after so my stomach has a lot of stretch marks and excess skin. I know the skin wont go away but if this can make it firmer without going under the knife I am all for it!</li>
    <li> Works fast, huge results in a week</li>
    <li> Messy. I dont see the point in putting wraps in boiling water if by the time you get them on right, they are cold! Have used twice. First time i felt my belly area much tighter. And had 1 inch improvement. On second application. No change or improvement whatsoever. The clips that come with the wraps are completely worthless. I feel product is over priced for what you get. I may get 4 total applications out of this product. If i get better results i will update.&lt;br /&gt;Tips when applying&lt;br /&gt;I use seran wrap and a muscle shirt to keep in place&lt;br /&gt;Since application process is messy, i suggest you apply in the shower with no clothes on so they dont get dirty.</li>
    <li> Worth a Try! Spa day in my house for 10% of the price! I can see improvement on my skin especially my postpartum belly!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I noticed results after the first wrap! I literally cannot believe it. LOL&lt;br /&gt;I wrapped my stomach first night, Easily lost half an inch. Wrapped  both my thighs second night, cellulite was gone, and less visible in more troublesome areas. Smooth tummy and thighs. I love it.</li>
    <li> This actually works i wish my photo would upload but i lost 2 inches in 3days!!! Im so happy i brought this product!!! Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> My skin is so smooth love this product and it smells amazing. But it is messy and you do need a shower after.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Very messy. Too complicated to mix and then wrap yourself in soaking wet ace bandages. The clay gets everywhere and no results. Spend the money on pre made wraps.</li>
    <li> I have used these once so far.  I measured before and afterwards like it suggests, no difference afterwards:(&lt;br /&gt;It also turns everything black, my palms and thighs were stained.  I had to scrub and scrub to get it off!  There is no way you could use this and not shower afterwards.  Unless you want to walk around with gray skin!</li>
    <li> Can breastfeeding moms use this?</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  thanks.</li>
    <li> Terrible product! Such a horrible mess and not helpful at all!!!</li>
    <li> I have done these types of spa wraps in the past with some success. I was skeptical of this product but it had good reviews so tried it.  Saw no difference in inches, smoothing of skin nor any claims that it made.  The clips that came with the ace wrap to hold in place are useless, If you buy it go to the pharmacy and buy a real ace wrap with proper clips or Velcro.  Personally I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Did not work at ALL. I followed the directions perfectly and even used Saran Wrap on top of the clay. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Did not think it was worth price</li>
    <li> I will start with the fact that these type of products everyone will react differently.&lt;br /&gt;I did not enjoy this product at all. It was messy and complicated. The clips they provide you to secure the wraps broke when I first used the product, the clay recommended a small of amount of water and I ended up using more and there was no difference in the way my skin looked or felt. I would not recommend this product nor would I repurchase. Severely disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product works great. This body wrap has healing powers and i believe so. It reduced my stretch marks in 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;This comes with 8 pouches containing clay and 2 wraps. All you need to do its soak the wrap in boiling water for few minutes. Mix one pouch of clay in another bowl with water and apply it to your stomach. One pouch makes enough quantity for covering the stomach. the clay applies smoothly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;Then wrap around the wrap and leave for about an hour. You can remove the clay with a wet cloth. I prefer taking a shower after. Its a great product and will continue using it. I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product and like others have said, it was messy. However, I took my measurements before I wrapped and after and there was absolutely no change. I will try again, but so far no good.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Instructions clear, emailed with instructions on how most users like to use the product. The only complaint I have is that the hooks that hold the wrap together are very flimsy. They bend very easily and don&#x27;t work very well. I just used safety pins instead, and then wrapped plastic wrap over top.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised no one mentioned the mess!  What a project.  You have to wet heat the wraps for 15 minutes, make clay and apply it - no applicator included, wrap yourself in the moist warm wraps - that turn cold almost immediately after leaving the water.  If you don&#x27;t wring them out good - and you wrap yourself, you will have grey clay running down your body making a total mess on your floor.&lt;br /&gt;Then you have to wrap yourself in saran wrap so that it stays warm (still not warm for me) - so I wrapped a heating blanket around myself too.  Then leave it on for an hour!!!!  Really.  And there are people who have reviewed they did this three times per week.  Who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars for now and that&#x27;s generous - unless when I take this off I see a miracle.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to update...</li>
    <li> I say to anyone if its in Stock buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It works...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I epected at all....very small starter kit..not like the picture..you will be fooled..</li>
    <li> its too complicated! I tried to used it but i gave up and put in a box.</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wrap is really good, the clay runs smooth on your skin and covers it all really well. It smells good and treats the skin. This is now part of my weekly skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Clay was a little messy and the provided clasps did not stay in place. Did not notice any difference after using wraps inch wise either.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know why the call this a tea, it&#x27;s a wrap. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I&#x27;m going to try the entire box then I let you know the results. Hopefully it&#x27;ll be positive.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with my results. I decided to try out the It Works body wraps and I purchased 4 for $59 through a distributor I found on Instagram kmstarks,myitworks.com . The wraps have really helped firm up my mid section after having my 2nd baby. I&#x27;ve also wrapped my legs and my cellulite is diminishing. Just in time for shorts season.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions that were emailed to me.. Not really happy with the product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything after one session.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of spa treatments, and besides the mess, this is a great product.  The clay is good, and mixes easily.  Leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> Not only does this not work but its messy and takes way too long to get on with the mixing and the wraps dripping and worst of all they don&#x27;t stay on. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> The bandages didn&#x27;t stay warm long enough to wrap them the clasps to hold them on didn&#x27;t it was to frustrating didn&#x27;t even get it on to find a result maybe l try again another time and hopefully have better luck.</li>
    <li> After you apply the clay Do you wrap yourself in the Seran wrap first then the cloth wraps?</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all!!! I get better results from wearing a trash bag than this!!</li>
    <li> I think the wraps from It Works do a better job. And smell better! lol. They are all natural and they really do work! Hints the name it works! People selling on Amazon have them a little too high priced though. I found a friend that sells them for $59 a box of 4 at brittcanwrap.myitworks.com. She helped me with tips and recommendations to maximize my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- quick and easy in 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-you see immediate results and they keep working for 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-super easy to apply yourself&lt;br /&gt;-you can use them anywhere on your body&lt;br /&gt;-they are made with botanical ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper than going to the salon for a body wrap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- sometimes you have to complete 2 before you see the results.</li>
    <li> It does not  work  and its  very messy!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I read reviews and for the most part they were all positive. It&#x27;s such a hassle to use the wrap. And the clay is s joke, it&#x27;s a waste of money. I gotta say their customer service is great though. I reached out because it&#x27;s not clear on how often to use it and they get back to you very quickly. Save your self $50 it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Just tried my first one. Very easy and lost 2 inches.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this body wrap. I&#x27;ve tried to use several different body wraps because my waistline is my most problematic area and I&#x27;m always looking for something to improve it! And this worked amazing!! I absolutely loooove the way it feels on my skin, it is super silky and smooth and I almost want to leave it on forever!! After one treatment I could already feel slimmer and smoother and as soon as I took it off I felt so great, it truly does feel like when you exit the spa haha!!! Definitely buying again!!</li>
    <li> Did not help with lightening any kind of stretch marks or loosing weight!</li>
    <li> So like most of y&#x27;all, I was skeptical about this item. Shouldn&#x27;t have purchased it, definitely not worth $50. It comes with two ace bandages and the clips were already broken so it doesn&#x27;t even stay on. I even emailed Brazilian Slimming Tea customer service and they are so incompitant they they didn&#x27;t answer any of my questions, they just basically repeated everything I wrote to them. I&#x27;ve asked for a refund and haven&#x27;t heard anything back either..</li>
    <li> Works alright, I got this for my stretch marks and after two wraps my stretch marks have gotten lighter but as far as weight Mmm no change..</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  It was very messy and the medal clips are useless, pop right off.  I left it on for several hours and put plastic wrap over it as well and saw 0 change.  I thought after one use I would at least notice a small change.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome body wrap and works very well. The instructions are easy to follow and you get great results. After the mud went on and I was wrapped in the wraps I used syran wrap and wore a tight cami and a compression shirt with it. I hung out for an hour or so and took it off and hopped in the shower. I could feel that my stomach was smaller already and the next morning it seemed even smaller it helped with cellulite as well. I had at least a 2-3 inch difference with my first wrap and it is simple to do at home. I love how it tightened my skin after my weight loss so far. I cant wait to keep using them with my weight loss goals. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all. Feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> it works its not a miricle worker but it does work</li>
    <li> Awesome detoxifying mud body wraps. Great DIY at home alternative to the spa for a fraction of the cost. These wraps are simple to mix and apply. I have noticed a visible reduction in cellulite and stretch marks since using them. The box comes with 8 applications. I am happy to recieve thsee wraps to review. Great value!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Will update once I have done a full box.</li>
    <li> This is the biggest waste of money and time. I am so upset at myself that I wasted money on this product. The clay stained my skin, and took about 3 showers to get rid of the color.  NOTHING about this product was useful.  It made a mess in my bathroom and kitchen, was uncomfortable and a complete hoax. Don&#x27;t get fooled, you&#x27;re better off just rolling in the dirt.</li>
    <li> Only had it on for about 3 hours (it is kind of uncomfortably drippy) but omg the next morning i could barely see some of my stretch marks! Ive had dark red stretch marks going from 4 o&#x27;clock to 8 o&#x27;clock (referencing where on my body they stretch) on my abs and sides and now they are barely noticeable. Only tried it once so far but i definitely recommend this for anyone with stretchmarks.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the detox treatments working, but I was curious and tried a sample I received for quality evaluation and review purposes  This detox was amazing. It really does work! Can’t believe it! Lost 3 inches after 2 applications. If you just want to look great for a certain event, date, etc. then one wrap will do. This isn’t a weight changer it’s a life changer.  Will definitely buy this product again and would recommend it for anyone on a budget and can&#x27;t afford the salon version.</li>
    <li> Uh, this didn&#x27;t work? I am thin with just a small amount of stretch marks and a tiny tiny bit of loose skin when I bend over and it did absolutely nothing..</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and had no negative reaction from the treatment and my skin feels noticeably smoother.  I also lost over an inch after the first application.</li>
    <li> Very messy and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me !!!!</li>
    <li> So ready to bring my wraps love this product. Received a promo code for a review!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy! will buy again</li>
    <li> Great product. I definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably all the wraps and this one is by far the best.  I&#x27;m giving this wrap a 5 star mostly for the clay.  The bandages don&#x27;t clip on that well and could be better but I just used seran wrap and the problem was solved.  I would highly recommend especially for people who have sensitive skin like me.</li>
