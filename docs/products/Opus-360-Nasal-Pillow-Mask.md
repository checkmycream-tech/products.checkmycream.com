### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Fits perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Now that&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
      <li>The construction is good and it came with three nasal pillows.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t get good sleep and woke up with a sore spot on my head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this mask.</li>
      <li>More freedom during sleep.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, for a quality mask, you need to pay more.</li>
      <li>For me, this works so much better than the Swift FX.  </li>
      <li>but when you look at what you get for your money you see why Medicare fraud is much more of organized crime than the Mafia.</li>
      <li>CPAP masks are a very personal and subjective decision - this one works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have ordered a nose mask to see if that is any better.</li>
      <li>Plus the tube resting on the top of my head gave me a sore spot.</li>
      <li>Products delivered quick and it&#x27;s a perfect replacment to my old one.</li>
      <li>I sleep pretty good with this mask but those darned lines are a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the one I find more comfortable and easier to sleep with.</li>
      <li>It is the lightest and most comfortable that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the full face.</li>
      <li>i like this much better than a over nose or full face.</li>
      <li>Better than Nasal Mask or Full Face Mask.</li>
      <li>Works fine with no leaking.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair, I felt that the headgear on the Swift was a little more comfortable, but that was more than offset by the leaking that would wake me up 5 times or more per night.  </li>
      <li>This is the primary reason I docked the Opus one star.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve fount the one to be particularly comfortable.</li>
      <li>I disconnect the tube from the head band so it is free to swivel as needed.</li>
      <li>Maybe if I have another large pillow I may be able to use it more and could give a more positive feedback.</li>
      <li>The mask is very comfortable and exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
      <li>that I&#x27;m sleeping better, maybe I can lose some weight and pack the whole thing up again!</li>
      <li>In the store it seemed to fit well, but the true test was in bed, and it passed the test.  </li>
      <li>I have a large head, and my hat size is at the top of the \\&quot;off-the-rack\\&quot; size range, but the strap fits, though it is close to the limits of the available adjustment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using different versions of CPAP masks, this one has been the best so far.</li>
      <li>I was looking primarily for a comfortable fit and theis mask works really well.</li>
      <li>It introduced me to nasal pillows as opposed to full nose mask.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a CPAP for a couple of years now and started with a full nasal mask.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not bad</li>
      <li>It is by far the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Both the medium and large ones are comfortable and seal well for me.</li>
      <li>The fit was great, sealed up nicely no leaks.</li>
      <li>When I was first diagnosed, I was given a full nasal mask that rubbed against the bridge of my nose and caused bleeding.  </li>
      <li>It also took a few nights of experimenting with the Large and Medium pillows to see which one fit me best, and more than a few nights to adjust to having the hose go up and over my head, but that is no longer an issue.  </li>
      <li>have purchased this mask multiple times because I haven&#x27;t found any that were better.  </li>
      <li>I bought this unit thinking that it will be better than my current system.</li>
      <li>The whole thing is very lightweight and the headset is simple and easy to put on and adjust.</li>
      <li>Met all expectations, reasonably priced and no RX required.</li>
      <li>The wraps have really improved the Opus&#x27; comfort in that area.  </li>
      <li>Then I tried the Swift FX nasal pillow, which was an improvement, but still very prone to leaking when I moved my head in the slightest.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>Really needed a new mask,  and found this one at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I can sleep better on my side but the nose pillows seem to be alittle to tight .</li>
      <li>Or maybe this is normal to getting used to using a cpap device.  </li>
      <li>I still have to adjust it once or twice most nights, but far less frequently that the Swift.  </li>
      <li>This design does allow for more movement but the cheap foam padding and plastic frame/supports made it uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>After some 3 months I&#x27;m already gerry-rigging the headgear as I&#x27;ve pretty much stretched it to the max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first (large pillow) did not fit well</li>
      <li>The short hose can also be disconnected from the main CPAP hose, so you don&#x27;t have to remove the headset then rearrange everything every time you go to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does tend to compress the cheeks a bit and leave you with wear marks for the first few hours of the new day.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quick, came in OEM type sealed plain bag with instructions.</li>
      <li>Covers less of your face and does not feel so intense.</li>

<li> exhaust on the old one chilled my arms, but with this it&#x27;s much less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;About a year ago a person at the local CPAP store spent an hour with me trying different types of masks and nasal pillows until we landed on the Opus 360.  </li>
<li> They last a really long time before the straps and adhesives start to wear down.  </li>
<li> Works as expected.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m careful now not to press the hoses together too hard, because I&#x27;m afraid the swivel won&#x27;t stand up to being taken apart many</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, this is my first cpap mask</li>
<li> Not quite five stars due to the hose joint popping lose sometimes.</li>
<li> Seek out other sources for quality CPAP masks.</li>
<li> I have worn it extremely loosely, and even then if it started to leak, I could just shift it a little to seal it again.</li>
<li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headgear with this mask is poor quality and frays early.</li>
<li> I had issues with it&#x27;s use in less than week.</li>
<li> It takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s less cumbersome.</li>
<li> Every little movement would cause the mask to shift, leak, whistle, and wake me up.</li>
<li> It has never caused any bleeding and aside from a little bit of redness around the nostrils and where the straps touch (which goes away soon after taking it off)</li>
<li> Note that I did need a hose wrap to complete that transition, for every time the unwrapped hose touched my ear or shoulder, it felt cold and would awaken me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I suspect that this may be a weak point, as my CPAP hose has a rubber end that grips tightly, and the swivel came apart once when I was disconnecting it.</li>
<li> I only  used the nasal mask then, because the pillows had to be strapped so tightly to seal that it was painful to wear.</li>
<li> That didn&#x27;t work, as I am a side sleeper with bad hips and have to shift position frequently during the night.  </li>
<li> have an ancient CPAP that I packed away over 10 years ago, when I lost some weight, but mainly because it was excruciatingly awkward, leaky and uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Unless I am very tired it is hard to fall asleep with anything on my face</li>
<li> I sleep on my side and if you turn onto your face at all this pokes into your nose and after a while is painful.  </li>
<li> Both were uncomfortable and terrible to</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this better than the full face. I still cant get through the night without taking it off but that isn&#x27;t a problem with the product.</li>
    <li> These things do work but when you look at what you get for your money you see why Medicare fraud is much more of organized crime than the Mafia.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement. I tried a LOT of nasal pillows, before I found this one. It is the lightest and most comfortable that I&#x27;ve found. I disconnect the tube from the head band so it is free to swivel as needed.</li>
    <li> This is my second Opus 360 Nasal Mask. It&#x27;s the one I find more comfortable and easier to sleep with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this mask. After using different versions of CPAP masks, this one has been the best so far. Not quite five stars due to the hose joint popping lose sometimes.</li>
    <li> Better than Nasal Mask or Full Face Mask. More freedom during sleep. Covers less of your face and does not feel so intense.</li>
    <li> Not made well. I had issues with it&#x27;s use in less than week. Through it out within two weeks. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Leaves deep lines on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits snugly in your nose but the lines left on your face take a long time to wear away. I sleep pretty good with this mask but those darned lines are a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s not bad but, if you sleep with your mouth open, this mask will not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headgear with this mask is poor quality and frays early. After some 3 months I&#x27;m already gerry-rigging the headgear as I&#x27;ve pretty much stretched it to the max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this mask will serve you for a short time. It introduced me to nasal pillows as opposed to full nose mask. I prefer nasal pillows and for that, I give this mask 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for a quality mask, you need to pay more. Seek out other sources for quality CPAP masks.</li>
    <li> Really needed a new mask,  and found this one at a reasonable price. Products delivered quick and it&#x27;s a perfect replacment to my old one.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly.  It keeps tubing above you and out of the way.  I have tried a number of the type set-ups and I&#x27;ve fount the one to be particularly comfortable.</li>
    <li> Been trying to get my &#x27;CPAP supplier&#x27; to order one for me for 6 months. Been jumping through Obamacare hoops till it just fell apart. Thankfully, I found the entire mask and had it delivered to my front door - Now that&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
    <li> Met all expectations, reasonably priced and no RX required. Every place I searched were wanting an RX or would not supply headgear with mask. Thanks to Amazon I&#x27;m getting my desperatly needed sleep!!!</li>
    <li> The fit was great, sealed up nicely no leaks. Wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, this is my first cpap mask so it took some time to get used to it... still not totally there I think.  Unless I am very tired it is hard to fall asleep with anything on my face still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each night I have used this I either threw it off in my sleep or woke up with a pain on my nose.  I sleep on my side and if you turn onto your face at all this pokes into your nose and after a while is painful.  This could just be me.  Or maybe this is normal to getting used to using a cpap device.  I have ordered a nose mask to see if that is any better.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;Saved a lot with this purchase.  Works as expected.  Shipped quick, came in OEM type sealed plain bag with instructions.</li>
    <li> When I was first diagnosed, I was given a full nasal mask that rubbed against the bridge of my nose and caused bleeding.  The second mask I tried did the same thing to my forehead in multiple places.  Both were uncomfortable and terrible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Opus 360 solves that problem.  It is by far the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve used.  It has never caused any bleeding and aside from a little bit of redness around the nostrils and where the straps touch (which goes away soon after taking it off), it&#x27;s flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this mask multiple times because I haven&#x27;t found any that were better.  They last a really long time before the straps and adhesives start to wear down.  I definitely recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> I can sleep better on my side but the nose pillows seem to be alittle to tight . I tried  to loosen the straps they are making my nose bleed</li>
    <li> The mask is very comfortable and exactly what I hoped it would be.  I was looking primarily for a comfortable fit and theis mask works really well.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit thinking that it will be better than my current system. I am not happy with it because it is not as comfortable as I thought it would be. The construction is good and it came with three nasal pillows. The first (large pillow) did not fit well and it keep coming off until I finally lost it in the motel room when I was traveling. Maybe if I have another large pillow I may be able to use it more and could give a more positive feedback.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask for the design. I use the standard nasal pillows which can lead to a sore back since they reduce movement when I sleep. This design does allow for more movement but the cheap foam padding and plastic frame/supports made it uncomfortable. Plus the tube resting on the top of my head gave me a sore spot. In the end my back wasn&#x27;t sore when using this product but I didn&#x27;t get good sleep and woke up with a sore spot on my head.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mask and recommends it to everyone who has a problem using a CPAP machine.  It makes all the difference for him.</li>
    <li> CPAP masks are a very personal and subjective decision - this one works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a CPAP for a couple of years now and started with a full nasal mask.  That didn&#x27;t work, as I am a side sleeper with bad hips and have to shift position frequently during the night.  Every little movement would cause the mask to shift, leak, whistle, and wake me up. Then I tried the Swift FX nasal pillow, which was an improvement, but still very prone to leaking when I moved my head in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago a person at the local CPAP store spent an hour with me trying different types of masks and nasal pillows until we landed on the Opus 360.  In the store it seemed to fit well, but the true test was in bed, and it passed the test.  For me, this works so much better than the Swift FX.  I still have to adjust it once or twice most nights, but far less frequently that the Swift.  It also took a few nights of experimenting with the Large and Medium pillows to see which one fit me best, and more than a few nights to adjust to having the hose go up and over my head, but that is no longer an issue.  Note that I did need a hose wrap to complete that transition, for every time the unwrapped hose touched my ear or shoulder, it felt cold and would awaken me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I felt that the headgear on the Swift was a little more comfortable, but that was more than offset by the leaking that would wake me up 5 times or more per night.  The Swift also comes with fabric wraps for the portion of the headgear that touches your cheeks; they fasten with Velcro.  After about a month with the Opus, I dug the Swift out of the closet and pulled off the fabric wraps for use on the Opus.  The wraps have really improved the Opus&#x27; comfort in that area.  This is the primary reason I docked the Opus one star.</li>
    <li> The description does not say so, but this unit comes with 3 nasal pillows, small, medium and large. Both the medium and large ones are comfortable and seal well for me. The whole thing is very lightweight and the headset is simple and easy to put on and adjust. I have a large head, and my hat size is at the top of the \\&quot;off-the-rack\\&quot; size range, but the strap fits, though it is close to the limits of the available adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature that is not mentioned is that the hose swivels at the point where it meets the nasal pillows, so you don&#x27;t have to go cross-eyed looking at a hosed strapped between your eyes if you don&#x27;t want to. Because of the swivel, I can simply drape the hose over my shoulder. The short hose can also be disconnected from the main CPAP hose, so you don&#x27;t have to remove the headset then rearrange everything every time you go to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a swivel at the end of the hose where it attaches to the CPAP hose. I suspect that this may be a weak point, as my CPAP hose has a rubber end that grips tightly, and the swivel came apart once when I was disconnecting it. I&#x27;m careful now not to press the hoses together too hard, because I&#x27;m afraid the swivel won&#x27;t stand up to being taken apart many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an ancient CPAP that I packed away over 10 years ago, when I lost some weight, but mainly because it was excruciatingly awkward, leaky and uncomfortable. I only  used the nasal mask then, because the pillows had to be strapped so tightly to seal that it was painful to wear. Not so with this one. I have worn it extremely loosely, and even then if it started to leak, I could just shift it a little to seal it again. I lie on my side and this doesn&#x27;t disturb the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exhaust on the old one chilled my arms, but with this it&#x27;s much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m sleeping better, maybe I can lose some weight and pack the whole thing up again!</li>
    <li> i like this much better than a over nose or full face. It takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s less cumbersome. It is especially helpful if you are a side sleeper.</li>
    <li> Replacing a similar unit after extended use.  Works fine with no leaking.  Does tend to compress the cheeks a bit and leave you with wear marks for the first few hours of the new day.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
