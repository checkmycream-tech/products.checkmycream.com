      <li>Glad I had a couple back-up.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll take more work for a lather</li>
      <li>Love this thing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;May have to abandon my bottle shampoo.  :-)</li>
      <li>Overall I was very impressed by this, and look forward to using it as an easy carry-on item during an upcoming trip abroad.</li>
      <li>I was impressed at how Liggett controlled my oily hair, and it did not cause my scalp to become dry or itchy.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of a bar shampoo, so I found this fun to try out! :)</li>
      <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>Yes, I know they are smaller and for traveling, but the great thing about Liggett&#x27;s is that it is a shampoo/body bar.</li>
      <li>I also am able to share one bar easily with my daughter as she is interested too.  </li>
      <li>The small size, soap saver and travel pouch make this the perfect travel item.</li>
      <li>one thing you&#x27;re going to notice is that your hair is not getting &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;.</li>
      <li>While I will continue to buy this product, I will just buy full size.</li>
      <li>Used to wash my hair and it came out nice and soft.</li>
      <li>These mini travel bars just go way too quickly.</li>
      <li>Women: you are much better off ordering Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, they lather better &amp; smell better.</li>
      <li>After the first use, my hair felt soft, looked shiny and nice, and styled well.</li>
      <li>And the soap dish, which I thought was kinda dumb, was really awesome.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t foresee that being much of an issue, but for my fine hair I appreciate a product that leaves it with some body.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Lather is fantastic, I really feel as if my hair is getting cleaned.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that the more oily and/or the more product buildup my hair had, the harder it was to get the bar to lather</li>

      <li>a guy whose hair doesn&#x27;t like getting washed/stripped of natural oils often, this product was top notch.</li>
      <li>:  For me, more than 2 days use caused my hair to develop some build-up that left me feeling like it wasn&#x27;t totally clean.</li>
      <li>I wound up having to scrub and rinse 2 or 3 times to really feel like it was clean.</li>
      <li>I wound up having to scrub and rinse 2 or 3 times to really feel like it was clean.</li>
      <li>This stuff, however, doesn&#x27;t really lather up well, and my hair is still kind of flat and greasy feeling after washing with this.</li>
      <li>It works for handwashing and for just about anything any other bar soap is good for, but I really like it as a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure fashion purists would look down on a bar shampoo, but, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>The small sizes are perfect for traveling, with enough bars to throw in an overnight kit and a carry on bag, keep one in your gym tote, and use another for a weekend of camping.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve use 2 of the bars so far the original and the peppermint, and in terms of my hair, I can&#x27;t tell any difference.  </li>
      <li>Extremely clean without ripping out your natural oils.</li>
      <li>I love solid shampoo because it is so much easier to travel with than the liquid stuff.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair and would never have been able to get a comb or brush through it without conditioner after using the bar soap.</li>
      <li>and so naturally they go quite quickly.</li>
      <li>and so naturally they go quite quickly.</li>
      <li>A nice little kit for travel</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a nice little travel pack.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something cheap and simple to shower with, this it it.</li>
      <li>I really do like it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the unscented bar but the results were fantastic.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>All in all, I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical because, well, if bar shampoo is so great, why isn&#x27;t everybody using it, right?  </li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t really get my hair clean enough.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s also very fine in diameter which makes it look like less.</li>
      <li>I have written elsewhere that I discovered this Liggett&#x27;s soap shampoo recently, and I just love the fact that it is not damaging to the environment, and my hair is better than it ever has been - it actually SHINES now, and has a nice soft curl - not dry and straw-like as usual.</li>
      <li>:  It smells good, lathers up well, and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling overly dry (though I&#x27;d still recommend a little conditioner on the ends if you have long hair and plan to use it more than a day or two in a row).</li>
      <li>It tends to get oily within 24 hrs, but is dry at the ends, so I&#x27;m a daily shower + conditioner kind of gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>what about this particular product, the variety pack of mini bars with a travel pouch?  </li>
      <li>I particularly like that it does not leave any residue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the smell is not so great, at least to my female nose.</li>
      <li>Love these little travel soaps.  </li>
      <li>This soap does seem to leave a little residue on the hair and it is a lot more noticeable on longer hair.</li>
      <li>I only use solid-type products, and was surprised how well these travel-size bars clean like soap and shampoo your hair.</li>
      <li>I have long thick hair and this shampoo soap works amazingly well, and it smells, well, clean.  </li>
      <li>use these normally for my day-to-day hair washing only but was not disappointed when using these for both hair and body wash on a recent trip -- it didn&#x27;t lather a whole lot, though, but that could have been from the water..</li>
      <li>it lathers up really well and feels like real shampoo, and I have hair several inches off my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>These are small soaps to be sure.  </li>
      <li>I want &amp;#34;bar shampoo&amp;#34; to work in the worse way but so far it&#x27;s leaving my hair dry &amp; fly away.  </li>
      <li>And this is a very nice little package you can use to take a tiny little bar for traveling.</li>
      <li>I am completely sold on bar shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Plus my hair doesn&#x27;t finished soft</li>
      <li>The pouch really too big for the soap</li>
      <li>This has completely revolutionized the way I travel.</li>
      <li>I travel frequently and this is a must.</li>
      <li>So far I have only used the original formula bar, so I will only speak for that specific soap in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these for a trip to Aruba.  But then decided to just buy a small plastic bottle and put my regular shampoo in it.  But it&#x27;s a nice little travel pack.</li>
    <li> Love these little travel soaps.  Used to wash my hair and it came out nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I have written elsewhere that I discovered this Liggett&#x27;s soap shampoo recently, and I just love the fact that it is not damaging to the environment, and my hair is better than it ever has been - it actually SHINES now, and has a nice soft curl - not dry and straw-like as usual. Non-detergent shampoos are the way to go! And this is a very nice little package you can use to take a tiny little bar for traveling. AND it&#x27;s not liquid, so no problem getting it through airport security! Love this thing.</li>
    <li> I hate TSA&#x27;s little bottles rules, and I only fly with a carry-on. I only use solid-type products, and was surprised how well these travel-size bars clean like soap and shampoo your hair. I only wish the coconut came in this travel size packet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the full size bars in past. Thought this would be nice for travel, but the small bars were so small i ended up taking the one larger bar rather than deal with a sliver during travel.</li>
    <li> Worked well for my trip. Though, I would suggest using a leave in cionditiioner if you have long hair.</li>
    <li> I love solid shampoo because it is so much easier to travel with than the liquid stuff. This stuff, however, doesn&#x27;t really lather up well, and my hair is still kind of flat and greasy feeling after washing with this. Also, the smell is not so great, at least to my female nose. Guys might like it.&lt;br /&gt;I will use the rest of the travel bars as recommended in Liggett&#x27;s ads for the shampoo: as hand-wash soap, or dish-washing soap, on travels. Women: you are much better off ordering Lush&#x27;s solid shampoos, they lather better &amp; smell better.</li>
    <li> I am going to SouthEast Asia for 3 weeks and I wanted to try a sample of this product out before I committed to buying a bigger bar.  I am backpacking through Indonesia, and I have to pack my liquids sparingly in my carry on luggage (I need to save my liquid space mostly for sunscreen &amp; bug spray).  I showered with this product and to my surprise it lathers up really well and feels like real shampoo, and I have hair several inches off my shoulders.  I am going to purchase bigger bars before my trip now that I know these work.  I was skeptical because the &amp;#34;shampoo sheets&amp;#34; I bought a few weeks ago did not work a bit, but these bars are an awesome travel secret and I&#x27;ll use them for all my future trips! They smell great too!</li>
    <li> A nice little kit for travel</li>
    <li> this contains a carrying pouch, a &amp;#34;soap dish&amp;#34;, and 4 mini bars of soap.  I recently went on a short trip and took this with.  Based on other reviews I took 2 bars of soap for a 3 night stay.  For just using this for hair on my long (6&amp;#34;past shoulders) hair I still have some left from the first bar and never broke into the second.  The pouch was just convenient.  Period.  And the soap dish, which I thought was kinda dumb, was really awesome.  It helped the soap not get all melty on one side and/or dry up and stick to the side of the tube.  In the future I will probably just use a regular bar and slice it into smaller pieces to save $$ but the pouch and soap dish were worth this purchase.</li>
    <li> I want &amp;#34;bar shampoo&amp;#34; to work in the worse way but so far it&#x27;s leaving my hair dry &amp; fly away.  I received the product promptly and the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size is the perfect way to try these products.  I also am able to share one bar easily with my daughter as she is interested too.  I haven&#x27;t given up...I love the comcept!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I only cared about one thing when I purchased this product.. Getting down to no liquids/gels while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy whose hair doesn&#x27;t like getting washed/stripped of natural oils often, this product was top notch. I&#x27;ve only tried the unscented bar but the results were fantastic. I actually think I can start shampooing my hair during nearly every shower with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather is fantastic, I really feel as if my hair is getting cleaned. If you&#x27;re used to shampooing your hair one thing you&#x27;re going to notice is that your hair is not getting &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;. When your hair squeaks, that means all of the oil is gone. Your hair will feel dirty in the shower after two shampoos, but give it a chance. Get out, dry your hair and give it a feel. Extremely clean without ripping out your natural oils. The package says that because of the product leaving your oils in, conditioner isn&#x27;t necessary. Though, as a man I&#x27;ve never even cared about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap also boasts being an all-in-one for soap, shampoo and shaving and I could see that for sure.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently and this is a must. The bars do get messy when wet, so this is a MUST for traveling.</li>
    <li> If you like the JR Liggett shampoo, you&#x27;ll like this. The pouch really too big for the soap and I&#x27;m not getting why it&#x27;s shaped the way it is. The soap saver is a nice touch and this sampler pack lets you try the different variations of the Liggett shampoo. I&#x27;d get it once and save it, and then just shave blocks from the big soap for future uses. I do wish that there was a hard case instead of that pouch though.</li>
    <li> if you like j r liggett bar shampoo, than this for you. just don&#x27;t go away for more than a week.</li>
    <li> Neat idea. No problems. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Is too mini small for me that I have long hair doesn&#x27;t work... Plus my hair doesn&#x27;t finished soft</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a quality bar shampoo that I can keep on hand for travel and in my emergency car kit bag (as opposed to a liquid so it won&#x27;t freeze/melt, leak, or be an issue with TSA carry-on guidelines). I decided on the mini travel pack so that I could sample the 3 varieties that come with it (4 bars total) and see which I prefer before I purchase full-size. I love the idea of a bar shampoo, so I found this fun to try out! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  This kit comes with 2 original formula, 1 tea tree/jojoba, and 1 peppermint, as well as a little zippered pouch to hold them in and a small plastic &amp;#34;bar saver&amp;#34; that you attach to the bottom of the soap to keep it from sliding around or dissolving too quickly. The small sizes are perfect for traveling, with enough bars to throw in an overnight kit and a carry on bag, keep one in your gym tote, and use another for a weekend of camping. The smell is very pleasant and neutral and the ingredients are high quality. So far I have only used the original formula bar, so I will only speak for that specific soap in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may help to know my hair type for those thinking of purchasing this; I have long, colored, naturally wavy hair. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s also very fine in diameter which makes it look like less. It tends to get oily within 24 hrs, but is dry at the ends, so I&#x27;m a daily shower + conditioner kind of gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  It smells good, lathers up well, and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling overly dry (though I&#x27;d still recommend a little conditioner on the ends if you have long hair and plan to use it more than a day or two in a row). After the first use, my hair felt soft, looked shiny and nice, and styled well. It was pleasant to use and rinsed out easily. It also works as an all-in-one soap for use on body and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  For me, more than 2 days use caused my hair to develop some build-up that left me feeling like it wasn&#x27;t totally clean. I could tell my hair became a little weighed down and somewhat more difficult to style (not horrible, but noticeable nonetheless). If you have super thick hair I wouldn&#x27;t foresee that being much of an issue, but for my fine hair I appreciate a product that leaves it with some body. I also noticed that the more oily and/or the more product buildup my hair had, the harder it was to get the bar to lather and so as the days went on I wound up having to scrub and rinse 2 or 3 times to really feel like it was clean. I&#x27;m guessing if you have super thick hair it&#x27;ll take more work for a lather also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE:  The other thing I should mention is that these bars are very tiny and so naturally they go quite quickly. They are comparable in size to what you see at hotels. I&#x27;d say with average hair-only use you&#x27;ll probably get 4 or 5 showers out of each one. This is especially applicable if you lather them up considerably for oily and/or extra thick hair. I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; simply because they are, after all, a travel sized product, but just keep in mind that if you&#x27;ll be using one mini-bar for longer than a few days you&#x27;ll want to invest in the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy sudsing! ;)ir became a little weighed down and somewhat more difficult to style (not horrible, but noticeable nonetheless).

    <li> Soap and shampoo in one, what&#x27;s not to like? I&#x27;m sure fashion purists would look down on a bar shampoo, but, it works just fine. The small size, soap saver and travel pouch make this the perfect travel item.</li>
    <li> This product works quite well.  Cleans and leaves hair smelling fresh.  I particularly like that it does not leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May have to abandon my bottle shampoo.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and this shampoo soap works amazingly well, and it smells, well, clean.  We were in Hawaii for 10 days and this is what we used!  I will definitely buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> I remembered this stuff from when I was a kid so decided to see if I still like it.  It is awesome.  I really do like it.  I do not like the smell, but that can be covered.  It leaves my hair feeling awesome.  It works for handwashing and for just about anything any other bar soap is good for, but I really like it as a shampoo.  My hair is thinning and this seems to make it relax some.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for a bar shampoo to use while traveling; I don&#x27;t want to risk having a bottle of liquid shampoo leaking in my suitcase.  I was skeptical because, well, if bar shampoo is so great, why isn&#x27;t everybody using it, right?  Wrong!  I am completely sold on bar shampoo.  My hair is on the thin/fine/oily side, and I have always shampooed every day.  Since using bars, I&#x27;ve found that I can skip a day.  Using this for the first time was a bit of an emotional rollercoaster; first I was skeptical, then pleased with the rich lather, then worried that the squeaky-clean feel of my hair meant that it would be tangled and snarled and impossible to brush, then pleased again when the brush went through it like I had used conditioner. All in all, I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about this particular product, the variety pack of mini bars with a travel pouch?  Well, I haven&#x27;t used the pouch yet, but it looks like it&#x27;s up to the job.  I&#x27;ve use 2 of the bars so far the original and the peppermint, and in terms of my hair, I can&#x27;t tell any difference.  It comes with a little plastic wafer that you stick onto the bar and acts as a soapdish, and that works well.  My only picky little complaint is that if you are going to sell me a variety pack of 4 bars of soap, why not make it 4 different bars instead of giving me 2 bars of the original?</li>
    <li> I cannot help but to give any shampoo bar from Liggett&#x27;s 5 stars. Performance/scent/cleansing all great. These mini travel bars just go way too quickly. Yes, I know they are smaller and for traveling, but the great thing about Liggett&#x27;s is that it is a shampoo/body bar. After a couple days of showering twice, one bar was gone. Glad I had a couple back-up. While I will continue to buy this product, I will just buy full size.</li>
    <li> Awesome design. Easy to travel with. This has completely revolutionized the way I travel. No need for separate shampoo, soap, or shaving cream. Works great and is Airline safe.</li>
    <li> Great for the minimalist traveler</li>
    <li> Great product for travel!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great product. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Tried this last month in Africa.  It works just as good as any liquid shampoo..  Plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about any liquids when flying.  Just bought more ( I prefer the small bars) for trip to SE Asia.</li>
    <li> Great product; bought the sample size to give it a try and have used it at the gym and on some budget travel. It works very well.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something cheap and simple to shower with, this it it. You can wash your hair and body with this shampoo bar. You can also use it as shaving soap, but it doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shaving soaps. I would recommend this to anyone with short hair. This soap does seem to leave a little residue on the hair and it is a lot more noticeable on longer hair.</li>
    <li> I try to avoid packing liquids when I fly so I don&#x27;t have to pay to check a bag. I use this as body soap, face soap, shampoo, and even to  shave my legs! It doesn&#x27;t lather up on my legs, but it still works great for shaving.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these soaps yet. I bought them because they come with 3 flavors and I wanted to try them all and figure out what works best for my hair before I bought a full size bar. I have uploaded a pic of this item with a matchbox in the pic for scale. These are small soaps to be sure.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about buying bar shampoo, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try this travel pack of small size bars. I am so impressed! The only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I had a hard time feeling like I had worked up enough lather, so I just kept lathering, so it took longer to wash my hair, haha. I have shoulder length, very oily, brunette hair, and a slightly itchy scalp. I was impressed at how Liggett controlled my oily hair, and it did not cause my scalp to become dry or itchy. It smells great and rinses out nicely, but I did think that after rinsing, my hair felt kind of like I had been using very hard water. Not a big deal for me though. Overall I was very impressed by this, and look forward to using it as an easy carry-on item during an upcoming trip abroad.</li>
    <li> It works ok but it leaves a squeaky, weird residue on hair just like other castille-type soaps. If you follow it with regular conditioner the residue is removed, but I would never use this alone. I have very long hair and would never have been able to get a comb or brush through it without conditioner after using the bar soap. After a few days of daily use my hair smelled like it needed to be washed, so maybe this is ok for short hair but it didn&#x27;t really get my hair clean enough.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I use these normally for my day-to-day hair washing only but was not disappointed when using these for both hair and body wash on a recent trip -- it didn&#x27;t lather a whole lot, though, but that could have been from the water..&lt;br /&gt;(The only drawback for me was being a little concerned I would drop or loose the plastic &#x27;stand&#x27; that you attach to each bar, but that&#x27;s me, so</li>
