### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best eye creme ever.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say it is one of the best.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used some of the best (Kiehl&#x27;s, Lancome, etc.).</li>
      <li>Once again, I must rate another item from the NZ Fusion Botanicals line as top-notch.</li>
      <li>I just need a non-irritating, moisturizing cream for dryness, and this fills the bill beautifully.</li>
      <li>It is plenty moisturizing without being greasy, so it makes a great daytime eye cream.</li>
      <li>my eyes never got irritated and my eyeshadow looks great now when applied hope</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair</li>
      <li>Feels good to know I have something good on my skin.</li>
      <li>Good luck, everybody.</li>
      <li>Great company--I have bought many items from them and have had no issues.</li>
      <li>I love the way it hydrates under the eyes!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results from the excellent Skin Clear Cream by NZ Fusion, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot.</li>
      <li>My skin absorbs it nicely and my eye makeup stays intact from morning to night, unlike my experience with a greasier eye cream that I had been using.</li>
      <li>This cream seemed great at first.  </li>
      <li>I will order again and will try more products from this company.</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
      <li>This is relatively inexpensive and does feel wonderful.</li>
      <li>This cream is very very moisturizing, love it!</li>
      <li>, almost makes me want to request it back from her, but nevertheless it is a good product for her skin, her face now looks amazing.</li>
      <li>This product was very good and it has lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>I have over the years purchased many, many creams but this is one of my favorites so far because it makes the skin around the eye area feel soo nice, it firms, helps with the puffiness.</li>
      <li>If I want to de-puff, I just use ice from the freezer - works wonders and it&#x27;s free.</li>
      <li>This eye cream goes on so smooth and it is moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is a rich, moisturizing eye cream.</li>
      <li>Whle I use Manuka honey regularly, this  eye cream didn&#x27;t do any good.</li>
      <li>not bad stuff,</li>
      <li>Could not find any until rooibos, by the time I&#x27;d found it my eyes were very wrinkled like alligator eyes, well after 3 days of use my eyes were smooth no wrinkles as if I&#x27;d had a procedure or something.  </li>
      <li>And the ingredients are all natural, which is why I prefer it over many others since this stuff is going into my eyes (whether I want it to or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the idea of using natural products for the gentle skin around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps this would be better for someone without such challenges.</li>
      <li>This is my first time to try this eye cream</li>
      <li>Super light but moisturizing at the same time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this eye cream and a couple other creams by NZ Fusion Botanicals, and so far so good.</li>
      <li>The cream is very runny and greasy.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing</li>
      <li>my beautician said my skiin looks and feel more moist than before when i used other brand.</li>
      <li>If you need more moisture, I suggest using a dab of Argan oil or some other quality oil underneath</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried enough eyes creams that have mostly irritated my eyes, but this one actually produces results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a mild fragrance which reminds me of custard; the texture is similar to custard as well.</li>
      <li>you have the same success.</li>
      <li>Seems to keep my eye area hydrated, and I love that it is natural, but it may be a bit heavy for my 25 year old skin.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my old and some new scars</li>
      <li>I had been searching for an eye cream that was natural because of my eye surgery.  </li>
      <li>natural eye cream.</li>
      <li>grat for sensitive eyes too</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  Vendor recently sent me another container to try due to melting issues with contents in first container (contents melted due to hot weather).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll cut application down to every other day as I do enjoy using this eye cream.</li>
      <li>Its a little greasy, but I already have oily skin, so I don&#x27;t care very much.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, bags or dark circles.  </li>
      <li>If I put too much, it does burn a little.  </li>

<li> skin around eyes is still extremely dry even after using product.  </li>

<li> , I have very sensitive, delicate, pale skin.</li>
<li> After about 4-5 days the cream began breaking down.</li>
<li> I have been using it for about two weeks and have lately noticed a little milia (I think that is the name for the tiny bumps under the skin) around the corners of my eyes.</li>
<li> After less than 1 week of use I had to throw it out because it was clumping around the edges and separating.  </li>
<li> While the newer contents is much less runny, I&#x27;m still dealing with cream seeping into my eyes and burning them.  </li>
<li> I attempted to mix it up again, but it would separate  in just a few hours of sitting.  </li>
<li> It looks like I have been crying heavily and not sleeping for about 2 years.  </li>
<li> Skin Around My Eyes: Extremely dry, thin and is prematurely aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It provides very little moisturizing.</li>
<li> I think the vendor is honourable, but the product is simply not good for me.  </li>
<li> I have tried dozens of creme, some quite expensive.  </li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> It has an awful smell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> grat for sensitive eyes too</li>
    <li> Once again, I must rate another item from the NZ Fusion Botanicals line as top-notch. I&#x27;ve been looking for another eye cream and I&#x27;ve used some of the best (Kiehl&#x27;s, Lancome, etc.). Since I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results from the excellent Skin Clear Cream by NZ Fusion, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot. I was somewhat skeptical because of the low price; what can a $9.95 skin care product really do? Answer: moisturize! I used it last night and this morning. It is plenty moisturizing without being greasy, so it makes a great daytime eye cream. It is not firming, lifting, or de-puffing, nor does it claim to be. My skin does not react well to products that do all that anyway. If I want to de-puff, I just use ice from the freezer - works wonders and it&#x27;s free. But I digress. I just need a non-irritating, moisturizing cream for dryness, and this fills the bill beautifully. It has a mild fragrance which reminds me of custard; the texture is similar to custard as well. My skin absorbs it nicely and my eye makeup stays intact from morning to night, unlike my experience with a greasier eye cream that I had been using. If you need more moisture, I suggest using a dab of Argan oil or some other quality oil underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your needs are simple, this is the stuff you want! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only ten bucks.</li>
    <li> This is a rich, moisturizing eye cream. Seems to keep my eye area hydrated, and I love that it is natural, but it may be a bit heavy for my 25 year old skin. I have been using it for about two weeks and have lately noticed a little milia (I think that is the name for the tiny bumps under the skin) around the corners of my eyes. I&#x27;ll cut application down to every other day as I do enjoy using this eye cream.</li>
    <li> Whle I use Manuka honey regularly, this  eye cream didn&#x27;t do any good. I had a reaction after each use and after w week stpped using it.</li>
    <li> I am trying to get some of the chemicals out of my bathroom vanity.  I&#x27;ve tried this eye cream and a couple other creams by NZ Fusion Botanicals, and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my old and some new scars and I just could not handle the smell, so I gave it to my daughter who was in need of something for her acne prone skin she is 16, she started using this and it has worked wonders for her skin, almost makes me want to request it back from her, but nevertheless it is a good product for her skin, her face now looks amazing.</li>
    <li> This product was very good and it has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Super light but moisturizing at the same time. All of the benefits of a salve but in a lightweight cream.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.It is amazing! I have seen a difference around my eyes since I started using it.</li>
    <li> not bad stuff, but I wish it was a bit thicker. I find I need to add some thicker stuff after putting this on as winter approaches. Great company--I have bought many items from them and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for an eye cream that was natural because of my eye surgery.  Could not find any until rooibos, by the time I&#x27;d found it my eyes were very wrinkled like alligator eyes, well after 3 days of use my eyes were smooth no wrinkles as if I&#x27;d had a procedure or something.  Anyway ladies my eyes never got irritated and my eyeshadow looks great now when applied hope you have the same success.</li>
    <li> This cream is very very moisturizing, love it! I will order again and will try more products from this company.</li>
    <li> This eye cream goes on so smooth and it is moisturizing. I love the way it hydrates under the eyes!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye creme ever.  I have tried dozens of creme, some quite expensive.  This is relatively inexpensive and does feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried enough eyes creams that have mostly irritated my eyes, but this one actually produces results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Latina in my mid thirties and I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, bags or dark circles.  I use this cream as a de-puffer (when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, which is often) and as an emollient for the dryness around my eyes. If I put too much, it does burn a little.  But I usually use a  tiny bit in the morning and reapply throughout the day and even use before I go to bed at night. Its a little greasy, but I already have oily skin, so I don&#x27;t care very much. Besides, dryness causes wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I like it and I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;m ordering another jar after 3 months. Great product at a great price. And the ingredients are all natural, which is why I prefer it over many others since this stuff is going into my eyes (whether I want it to or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. It does work for pimples. I&#x27;m still acne prone at my age and I&#x27;ve used it to treat breakouts and it works to help minimize the inflammation and the pimple gets smaller.</li>
    <li> This cream seemed great at first.  It has an awful smell so I could only use it at night, but it worked well to moisturize.  After about 4-5 days the cream began breaking down. It was oily and separated. I attempted to mix it up again, but it would separate  in just a few hours of sitting.  After less than 1 week of use I had to throw it out because it was clumping around the edges and separating.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try this eye cream and I have to say it is one of the best.  I have over the years purchased many, many creams but this is one of my favorites so far because it makes the skin around the eye area feel soo nice, it firms, helps with the puffiness. LOVE!</li>
    <li> my beautician said my skiin looks and feel more moist than before when i used other brand. i do not use other than NZ Fusion Botanical anymore now.</li>
    <li> Skin Around My Eyes: Extremely dry, thin and is prematurely aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Eye Cream\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;Very runny and OILY! I have to shake the container of product to ensure all contents are properly mixed so the oil doesn&#x27;t separate from the rest. The cream is very runny and greasy. It provides very little moisturizing. It has seeped into my eyes and irritated them. Not sure what could have caused the seeping, other than blinking, being in minimal wind and just being a moderately active normal human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin around eyes is still extremely dry even after using product.  Every wrinkle and flaw seems to be amplified. It looks like I have been crying heavily and not sleeping for about 2 years.  My eyes are constantly tearing up and the skin around eyes has puffed up.  I am extremely disappointed. I love the idea of using natural products for the gentle skin around the eyes.  Yet, seems like I&#x27;ve purchased a terrible product after hoping for a great one. Won&#x27;t buy again or recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I have very sensitive, delicate, pale skin. Perhaps this would be better for someone without such challenges. I am extremely let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Vendor recently sent me another container to try due to melting issues with contents in first container (contents melted due to hot weather).  While the newer contents is much less runny, I&#x27;m still dealing with cream seeping into my eyes and burning them.  I think the vendor is honourable, but the product is simply not good for me.  I&#x27;m revising rating from 1 star to 3 based on customer service. Good luck, everybody.</li>
    <li> natural eye cream. It is very moisturizing so i use it at night. Feels good to know I have something good on my skin.</li>
