      <li>I will be buying more for my friend this Christmas.</li>
      <li>Love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll start this review by saying that in all fairness, many body products disagree with my skin.</li>
      <li>Good price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok nothing special tho</li>
      <li>Love the sweet scent and the moisture it provides</li>
      <li>This hand lotion is very good for eczema and dry skin.</li>
      <li>like that it is Paraben free and 90%</li>
      <li>The packaging is cute so makes a fun gift.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite hand cream!</li>
      <li>Farm House Fresh have high end spa quality products,  Great price and fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I was originally given one as a gift and ran out.  </li>
      <li>love this smell and a spa close by sells it for about double! : ) try it!</li>
      <li>as rich as I would expect from a hand cream.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle vanilla/cake type smell- not too strong or over powering.</li>
      <li>Last, the scent of this is amazing.</li>
      <li>My kids always comment on how it smells like vanilla frosting for whatever that is worth.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy and is absorbed well into my skin.</li>
      <li>Feels great but smells too sweet and a little too much like actual cake icing...if you like that, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>Absorbs right in to my skin and has already improved the severe dryness I was experiencing with my hands.</li>
      <li>it really does smell like buttercream frosting!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, once I applied the lotion to my skin, within about 10 seconds the scent went from delicious to plastic.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hand cream, and I have repurchased multiple times now and also got some for mom who loves it too.</li>
      <li>Not fake.  </li>
      <li>It smells &amp; feels amazing, left my skin feeling soft &amp; smelling yummy.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is a nice cream but has a slightly off-putting smell.  </li>
      <li>find that the product goes on slightly sticky at first but then quickly absorbs into the skin leaving a nice, soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the packaging - it is cute &amp; trendy but lacks functionality.  </li>
      <li>This really leaves absolutely nothing but super soft skin, no greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>It was certainly moisturizing, and you really can&#x27;t beat the scent.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing but not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon FarmHouse products at a local boutique near my home a couple years ago and really fell in love.</li>
      <li>This stuff leaves my hands so silky, and really helps with cracked and splitting cuticles.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>but I wish the makers would reconsider the packaging to something a little more user-friendly without sacrificing the style.</li>
      <li>My hands were dry and peeling but now soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall if scents usually smell identical on your skin as they do in the bottle, you will probably love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I wish I could just &#x27;pop&#x27; the top of the tube to dispense the cream instead of having to take the small lid all the way off.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out just a little.</li>
      <li>If they offered a reasonably priced candle in this scent, I would totally go for it.</li>
      <li>I really dislike hand creams that feel like they leave a sticky/greasy residue, even if it is just a tiny bit.</li>
      <li>It absorbs completely.</li>
      <li>Dont be surprised if you catch yourself constantly smelling your hands!!  </li>
      <li>Its smells subtle, but fantastic.  </li>

<li> It has left my rough and dry hands very soft!</li>
<li> , if you squeeze the tube the wrong way while the lid&#x27;s still on, too much of the cream comes out when you remove the lid leaving a slight mess (while also wasting some of it).&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this moisturizer is definitely worth the investment</li>
<li> I&#x27;m hard to please when it comes to hand creams and lotions, and I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t reorder due to the scent.</li>
<li> Whenever I put it on in public someone will usually remark, &amp;#34;I smell cake.&amp;#34;</li>
<li> Looking forward to trying other scents from F.H.F</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this lotion fell under that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This hand cream isn&#x27;t sticky, liquidy or anything bad.  </li>
<li> However, if you&#x27;re like me and often experience a scent changing when it hits your skin, you may be disappointed in this product like I was.</li>

    <li> This hand lotion is very good for eczema and dry skin. I have eczema and it is the best  moisturizing cream I have tried.  This hand cream does not leave your hands greasy. It absorbs completely.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff. It smells great and it is non-greasy. Whenever I put it on in public someone will usually remark, &amp;#34;I smell cake.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hand cream! It is not greasy and is absorbed well into my skin. It&#x27;s a gentle vanilla/cake type smell- not too strong or over powering. It has left my rough and dry hands very soft!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is Paraben free and 90% natural.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not as rich as I would expect from a hand cream.  I honestly would have given this another star, but just did not care for the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I carry this in my purse and use it as needed when out and about.  My kids always comment on how it smells like vanilla frosting for whatever that is worth.  Looking forward to trying other scents from F.H.F</li>
    <li> I think the hand cream is good, but I like the scent of the Whoopie Cream in the jar better.  The scent is what sold me on this product to begin with.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how good the hand cream is, as I gave it as a gift.  The packaging is cute so makes a fun gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start this review by saying that in all fairness, many body products disagree with my skin. Often times the perfumer fragrance used goes from delightfully scrumptious in the tube to  \\&quot;it smells like plastic get it off of me\\&quot; once I apply it. Unfortunately, this lotion fell under that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells absolutely delightful in the tube. It made me hungry for cakes and whoopie pies and delicious desserts, and I would&#x27;ve loved to have smelled like exactly what was in the tube. If they offered a reasonably priced candle in this scent, I would totally go for it. Unfortunately, once I applied the lotion to my skin, within about 10 seconds the scent went from delicious to plastic. I think the cinnamon in the lotion may have been what disagreed with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if scents usually smell identical on your skin as they do in the bottle, you will probably love this lotion. It was certainly moisturizing, and you really can&#x27;t beat the scent. However, if you&#x27;re like me and often experience a scent changing when it hits your skin, you may be disappointed in this product like I was.</li>
    <li> Love the sweet scent and the moisture it provides</li>
    <li> Best product for keeping cuticles soft.</li>

    <li> Feels great but smells too sweet and a little too much like actual cake icing...if you like that, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Is greasier than I would like. Smells ridiculously amazing...</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  It smells &amp; feels amazing, left my skin feeling soft &amp; smelling yummy.  Highly recommend and I would purchase again as well.</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell of this lotion. So creamy, too!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon FarmHouse products at a local boutique near my home a couple years ago and really fell in love. I love dessert! and smelling like frosting is always a treat :)</li>

    <li> Handcream is great.  Received this item expeditiously.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a nice cream but has a slightly off-putting smell.  It was packed well and not smashed in shipping.  I won&#x27;t reorder due to the scent.</li>
    <li> This shea is light, not greasy, smells good and most of all comes in an easy to use tube.  I keep mine in my purse, it&#x27;s easy to squeeze out just a little.</li>
    <li> And make rough hands soft</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells like a cupcake in a bottle; the scent is absolutely delicious.  I&#x27;ve received several compliments!&lt;br /&gt;I find that the product goes on slightly sticky at first but then quickly absorbs into the skin leaving a nice, soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the packaging - it is cute &amp; trendy but lacks functionality.

    <li> The best smelling thing ever!!</li>
