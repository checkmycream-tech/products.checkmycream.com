      <li>Amazon always offers the best deal</li>
      <li>None of the body washes ever did this kind of magic</li>
      <li>I love this body wash for me it is the best on the market, no other bodywash comes close to this product.</li>
      <li>My skin is aging well and for some time I was able to just get away with washing and moisturizing with cocoa butter.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>The scent is more feminine.</li>
      <li>and I do love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Well after trying the Olay Total Effects, I was overly impressed.  </li>
      <li>I use this product the appearance of my skin look much better.</li>
      <li>my husband agrees :-)</li>
      <li>People with skin like mine will definitely love this as well.</li>
      <li>and I am glad that I decided to purchase it.</li>
      <li>This body wash keeps me smelling wonderful and extra moisturized as well.</li>
      <li>I love Olay products.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>My skin is moisturized and soft and looks great.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s not always easy to find in the store.</li>
      <li>It showed its magic the very first time I tried.</li>
      <li>With one wash, I didn&#x27;t feel the effect immediately, but as the day proceeded I noticed that my skin didnt lose moisture and it remained as smooth and supple as it could be.</li>
      <li>This is a really great body wash and the one I am currently using.</li>
      <li>and this both cleaned me with a pleasant scent and was able to help my dry skin in no time at all.</li>
      <li>Nice body wash... Keeps ur skin soft and smooth</li>
      <li>OF COURSE, YOU CAN APPLY ADDITIONAL SERUMS AND LOTIONS AFTER BATHING, BUT YOU&#x27;RE GOOD TO GO AFTER USING THE OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS BODY WASH.</li>
      <li>I love this product and use it all the time, it leaves my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin looked and felt better after just a few uses (i&#x27;m only 23, but i&#x27;m hoping it makes it look great for years to come!)</li>
      <li>Love the soft soap.</li>
      <li>My skin is healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it.  </li>
      <li>Normally when you use a shower wash, your skin feels great until you dry off</li>
      <li>We all need to shower right?  </li>
      <li>It overall leaves my skin feeling really nice, soft, and smooth.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend tries to get in on the action, but I tell him to leave me alone (LOL).</li>
      <li>Make sure you get the Total Effects that wash, exfoliate and replenish.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time using this item.</li>
      <li>Better do a regular exfoliatior then a hydrating soap afterwards...</li>
      <li>I really made the purchase because of the Deep  Penetrating  wash, which I have used and love the way my skin feels and smells afterwards.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling super soft and I can skip lotion after my shower if I am in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for a few months now and can not believe how much better my skin looks!  </li>
      <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
      <li>I can really see a difference</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>But, the container leaves much to be desired.  </li>
      <li>The body wash is very gentle and it smells terrific but the smell is not overly powerful.</li>
      <li>As for all of the age-defying claims, I&#x27;m not too sure about those because I&#x27;m only in my early twenties and have relatively young skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It takes a few months but you will notice a more even skin tone and diminished age spots.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it is good for a male though.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>Whether you are young old this bodywash is a must have.</li>
      <li>It helped clear up the skin on my chest and back.</li>
      <li>and I swear these products have changed my skin from dry to normal.  </li>
      <li>My skin is always dry, I have to lotion at least twice or more daily.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s no long that dewey, supple feel.  </li>

<li> This body wash not only exfoliates all the lotion and dead dry skin off, but it also moisturizes my skin very very well.</li>
<li> I surely have the world&#x27;s driest skin and very sensitive one at the same time :(...</li>
<li> However, this product kept my skin so soft and supple long after I had showered and dried off, that I was left stunned.  </li>
<li> But no matter what, you can always count on DRY air here; which means dry skin.</li>
<li> I use this with the lotion as well and haven&#x27;t suffered from itchy dry skin at all.  </li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> With all this dry air this winter my skin was very dry.</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t lather the way I expected.</li>
<li> As for the exfoliating, I will have to wait and see if my skin tone improves, but I have a feeling that I won&#x27;t be disappointed :).</li>
<li> but it is pretty expensive for soap</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other soaps but always return to using this.</li>
<li> WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCTS FOR A FEW YEARS, NOW, AND WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER BODY WASH.</li>
<li> A little too thick and not enough esfoliator...</li>
<li> However, I started to notice little blotches and a lack of luster to my skin tone.      </li>
<li> used it a few times.</li>
<li> Also, a few ladies in my office as well.</li>
<li> I remembered reading an article about an actress who said that one of her few splurges are trips to the spa for body treatments.  </li>
<li> The exfoliated beads help to slough off dead skin.</li>
<li> and I am not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
<li> I live in Las Vegas, the weather here is known to change at random times and find no happy medium, either severely hot or severely cold.</li>
<li> I tried a few Olay products in the past, but my skin didn&#x27;t react too well to them.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little too thick and slimy for my taste.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a body wash to moisturize and lightly exfoliate and this works great. My skin looked and felt better after just a few uses (i&#x27;m only 23, but i&#x27;m hoping it makes it look great for years to come!). I couldn&#x27;t find this stuff anywhere and it was a great price for a two pack as well. Highly recommend. I love Olay products!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now and will not use anything else. My skin is healthy and soft. It looks and feels amazing! This body wash keeps me smelling wonderful and extra moisturized as well. I exfoliate often and this product seems to help my cause. Amazon always offers the best deal so I always buy it here. Not to mention, it&#x27;s not always easy to find in the store.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with Olay Total Effects Body Wash, Moisturizing.  I start with this, the exfoliating wash and then, in the same shower, use the moisturizing one.  There is also an \\&quot;in shower lotion,\\&quot; which I use when I want my body super-moisturized.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use after-shower lotions since I started using these products.  I am in my late 50s and I swear these products have changed my skin from dry to normal.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Okay, The product is great, noticeable difference.  But, the container leaves much to be desired.  The top splits open making it difficult to squeeze product out.  Inconvenient, yet the product is great.  #Improve container</li>
    <li> Awesome product that improves skin tone! I&#x27;ve tried other soaps but always return to using this.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. It takes a few months but you will notice a more even skin tone and diminished age spots. Your skin will be softer as well. I am posting this under my husbands account but I am a female and do recommend this product. Not sure if it is good for a male though. The scent is more feminine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick and slimy for my taste. It seems to exfoliate but the ingredients are not that great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now and can not believe how much better my skin looks!  Make sure you get the Total Effects that wash, exfoliate and replenish.  It works unreally well with me.  I have it in my shower so I use it practically every day.</li>
    <li> I tried a few Olay products in the past, but my skin didn&#x27;t react too well to them.  Therefore, I was a bit hesitant to try another of their products.    My skin is aging well and for some time I was able to just get away with washing and moisturizing with cocoa butter.  However, I started to notice little blotches and a lack of luster to my skin tone.      I remembered reading an article about an actress who said that one of her few splurges are trips to the spa for body treatments.  It reminded me that while I could use a good spa treatment, why not exfoliate with a cleanser at home?  I used to use an exfoliating cleanser all the time, but I switched to Ivory bath soap because of its purity.      Well after trying the Olay Total Effects, I was overly impressed.  Normally when you use a shower wash, your skin feels great until you dry off and there&#x27;s no long that dewey, supple feel.  However, this product kept my skin so soft and supple long after I had showered and dried off, that I was left stunned.  My skin is so soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it.  My boyfriend tries to get in on the action, but I tell him to leave me alone (LOL). Kidding.  But this product truly works and, OH, it smells AMAZING.      As for the exfoliating, I will have to wait and see if my skin tone improves, but I have a feeling that I won&#x27;t be disappointed :).</li>
    <li> I surely have the world&#x27;s driest skin and very sensitive one at the same time :(... but this product was made for people like me, I suppose.. It showed its magic the very first time I tried. With one wash, I didn&#x27;t feel the effect immediately, but as the day proceeded I noticed that my skin didnt lose moisture and it remained as smooth and supple as it could be. None of the body washes ever did this kind of magic and I am glad that I decided to purchase it. People with skin like mine will definitely love this as well.</li>
    <li> This rich, creamy body wash is the best choice you can make! It leaves my skin hydrated and soft. I can&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it all the time, it leaves my skin really soft and smooth. The only thing is that I can&#x27;t buy it on Amazon UK and have to get it from the Amazon usa I wish it was sold over here</li>
    <li> I have been using this bodywash for about 6 mos now and I&#x27;ll never go back.  My skin is moisturized and soft and looks great.  I use this with the lotion as well and haven&#x27;t suffered from itchy dry skin at all.  I can really see a difference and so can my husband.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash and lotion ever.  I have all of the girls in my family using it!  Also, a few ladies in my office as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Yes its a bit pricey but well worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff gave my skin life again... I will NEVER stop using, this is the best body wash ever!</li>
    <li> Nice soap. It helped clear up the skin on my chest and back. Would be five stars but it is pretty expensive for soap and I am not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> I dont normallly go in for things like this, but this product is great. I have dry skin and this both cleaned me with a pleasant scent and was able to help my dry skin in no time at all. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> A little too thick and not enough esfoliator... Better do a regular exfoliatior then a hydrating soap afterwards... But good as soap</li>
    <li> This product eliminates the need to use lotion because it is so moisturizing.  The exfoliated beads help to slough off dead skin.</li>
    <li> Love the soft soap. With all this dry air this winter my skin was very dry. Olay you make a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great body wash and the one I am currently using. The body wash is very gentle and it smells terrific but the smell is not overly powerful. It overall leaves my skin feeling really nice, soft, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Nice body wash... Keeps ur skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash.  It leaves my skin feeling super soft and I can skip lotion after my shower if I am in a hurry.  I am using it in conjunction with the Total Effects body lotion and I think my skin looks great- my husband agrees :-)</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this item. I really made the purchase because of the Deep  Penetrating  wash, which I have used and love the way my skin feels and smells afterwards. The Exfoliate does not feel as silky on the skin, but it is not abrasive as you might think from the name. Probably will not purchase again. That is not a reflection on the seller, I just prefer Deep Penetrating.</li>
    <li> We all need to shower right?  :)  I love Olay products.</li>
    <li> This smells good and all but it didn&#x27;t lather the way I expected. I want to give it a higher rating because I usually like Olay products but I just can&#x27;t on this one.....just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Total Effects Body Wash, Exfoliate and Replenish.&lt;br /&gt;I used it a few times. I am allergic to something in the Olay. Smells very good.  Sorry, I cannot use it.</li>
    <li> I use this product the appearance of my skin look much better.I will continue to using Olay total effect it works</li>
    <li> I love this body wash for me it is the best on the market, no other bodywash comes close to this product. Whether you are young old this bodywash is a must have.</li>
    <li> WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCTS FOR A FEW YEARS, NOW, AND WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER BODY WASH. IT CLEANSES AND MOISTURIZES IN ON STEP.  OF COURSE, YOU CAN APPLY ADDITIONAL SERUMS AND LOTIONS AFTER BATHING, BUT YOU&#x27;RE GOOD TO GO AFTER USING THE OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS BODY WASH.</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas, the weather here is known to change at random times and find no happy medium, either severely hot or severely cold. But no matter what, you can always count on DRY air here; which means dry skin. My skin is always dry, I have to lotion at least twice or more daily. This body wash not only exfoliates all the lotion and dead dry skin off, but it also moisturizes my skin very very well. As for all of the age-defying claims, I&#x27;m not too sure about those because I&#x27;m only in my early twenties and have relatively young skin. But regardless, this is a great product and I do love the smell of it.</li>
