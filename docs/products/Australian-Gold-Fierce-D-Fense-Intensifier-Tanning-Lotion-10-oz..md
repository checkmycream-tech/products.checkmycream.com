<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The lotion smells great and I developed a base time 5 times faster than without anything. It was a smart purchase and worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a hardcore Designer Skin fan. But, after smelling this lotion at my local salon, I couldn&#x27;t help but try it! It is without a doubt one of the best smelling tanning lotions that I&#x27;ve ever had. Like the other reviewer said, it is very thick and very moisturizing. I saw immediate results within the first few times of using this, and I already had an amazing base tan. I highly recommend this product. The smell alone is worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It feels very nice on my skin.  The price is fantastic, my salon asks $60 for this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great lotion and it works!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. I was darker after one use and I continue to get darker after each additional use. The smell is amazing. I have never found a tanning lotion with a smell better than this one. I def would recommend this lotion for anyone who would like to try an intensifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also shipping was fast. I ordered it on a Friday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday!</li>
    <li> I recently started tanning indoors for the first time. I bought several tanning lotions to try them out. This one is my favorite so far. It seems to be working after two weeks of using it exclusively. It&#x27;s starting to develop a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having a bit of tingling. I realize this lotion is not supposed to contain tingle or bronzers, so maybe that&#x27;s just me. I get a heat rash on tropical vacations which is the reason I&#x27;m tanning. I&#x27;d like to develop a base tan to maybe avoid that this year. I might just be pushing it a little too fast. The smell is nice and doesn&#x27;t get strange after tanning. It&#x27;s kind of tropical smelling. It leaves my skin nice and soft. It&#x27;s not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and it&#x27;s smell. Super hydrating and no bronzing like most all the other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended (I&#x27;m a dude)</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome. It tans well and keeps you hydrated. The smell is amazing and the price is great. They wanted $75 on sale for this bottle of lotion and I got it for $30.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others and I don&#x27;t tan often, but this is my favorite.  Does what it says it will and it always smells good, never weird before or after a tan.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using it for over a year. Moisturises well, helps to develop good color. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I will always have this on hand. Not only is it one of the best moisterizers I have ever used, but it is the only tanner that helps give me a golden brown tan while other products leave me skin looking red. I have very fair skin and this accelerated my tan 1 to 2 shades darker after one session and continued to accelerate my tan with each use. I did not burn using this lotion and my skin stayed moisterized well after it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick lotion, where a little goes a long way. It is not sticky, but it does take some effort for it your skin to absorb. The smell is pleasant, tropical, and leaves very little of that bad aftertan odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one suggestion in application- if you can spare 10 minutes to let it absorb thoroughly, the results are even better.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that I will always have on my shelf. It gives long term moisterizing effects and will help give even the fair skinned a beautiful golden brown tan.</li>
    <li> I will not purchase this item again.  It&#x27;s OK for a lotion but it is not worth the retail price.  Thank goodness I got such a good deal or I would feel so ripped off.</li>
    <li> i have YET to come across an accelerator that beats the results of this....even the tingles i have dont rival this stuff! it&#x27;s thick like a moisturizer (and in saying that, it IS very moisturizing) so you have to rub it around some, but it DOES absorb well so no greasy feeling here. the scent is very fresh and fruity, little summery...but not overwhelming by any means...i can&#x27;t tell you how much i love this stuff, you will NOT regret buying this!</li>
    <li> Love the feel and the smell of this one. Me and my daughter would fight over using this one at the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> As always - a great product for the sun worshiper.  we have been purchasing it for 3+ years</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and it works great. I am super pale white and only tan in the warmer months and it is amazing how quickly I go from pale to tan with this and another lotion (I&#x27;ve heard it is best to alternate lotions so you get the best tanning results). The price on Amazon beats my tanning salon&#x27;s prices, even with their half off sales so this is the place to shop.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I&#x27;m somewhat new to tanning and have tried out a few different lotions: bronzers, accelerators, intensifiers. This is my favorite of all. The lotion is thicker and creamy. The smell is amazing and not too strong. It kept my skin moisturized and healthy looking. I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle.</li>
    <li> Works well! I didn&#x27;t use any kind of lotion and wasn&#x27;t seeing results than I got this product. I&#x27;m getting a nice tan and I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times! The smell is amazing too. It&#x27;s not to powerful so I can wear it longer in public places without being embarrassed of the intensity of the smell. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I was using a different product at the tanning salon and I noticed that my skin was a dirty brown color and very dry.  Saw that they had the God D Fense but the price was high so i checked Amazon and was happy with the price so I decided to give it a try.  My tan suddenly looked more natural and my skin was less dry.  The smell was very faint and I did not notice it after a few times using.  All in all this is not a very girly tanning lotion and as a man it worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Love it and use it not only to tan but great as a lotion and smells great</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Goes on well,isnt greasey. Smells good and isnt strong. Last but not least this product tans you very well.</li>
    <li> Works great and much cheaper than buying at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I love this because there is no bronzer so it won&#x27;t stain your clothes. Nice, soothing mild coconut smell. Moisturing too.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a tanning lotion WITHOUT bronzers - this is the one to get.  Smells good, works great!  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> ...what exactly am I paying for? I mean... who do I have to kill to get some legitimate information on this product? How can I learn about the effects of this product without made-up phrases like \\&quot;Vitamin Drink\\&quot; or \\&quot;Tanfresh Blend?\\&quot;    Try Googling this product. I dare you. You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed (if even able) to find a review containing information about physiological reactions, catalysts, or even referencing aminos or enzymes in a reasonably respectable manner. Instead I&#x27;m told, over and over, that I&#x27;m lusciously moisturizing with \\&quot;lotus flower water.\\&quot; WTF?!?    Look, I&#x27;m fine with the product. I can accept that I paid seventy dollars for a ten-ounce tube of goop. But c&#x27;mon! Can the company, or any reviewer, at least respect me enough to explain WHY I should go another seventy dollar round with this product? Can anybody explain THIS SPECIFIC product (yes, I understand how intensifiers work... I&#x27;m talking specifically about THIS product) without attempting to insult my intelligence with more redundant information about thymine?    Anyhow... the product is fine. I just wish that the company respected its consumers enough to give us more information than \\&quot;extreme moisture intensifier with exotic desert blend.\\&quot; I would expect this kind of nonsense from companies like MuscleTech who sell me workout supplements with amazing scientific facts like, \\&quot;University lab studies show this product to be over 150% more Extreme than leading brands due to a proprietary blend of KickButtamine and L-QuantumMucleBuildasome.\\&quot;    Okay... I&#x27;m done with my rant. Hopefully that helps you do the research before doing the math before dumping the cash. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery, arrived in 2 days. Brand new in shrink wrap. Great product, used this after using the Hydration Station at my tanning salon and was 3 shades darker. Awesome results. I use this with my JWOWW bronzer and have a gorgeous dark tan.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty good.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my tanning at all.  I have fair skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a WAY better price than I can get at the salon. I will ALWAYS buy my tanning lotion from here. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> good consistency, not too much smell, and natural looking results.  will continue to only use this product as I have found that I hate the look that instant bronzers give my skin.</li>
    <li> Info: Experienced tanner, male, 33, blond hair, tan easily.&lt;br /&gt;As a male, it&#x27;s hard to find a tanning lotion that isn&#x27;t overly &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  This is one of the few that meets the bill.  It&#x27;s not overly greasy, spreads well, and leaves the skin quite hydrated, not to mention most of the scent disappears post tan.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use the same amount of this lotion, as I do with others in at a similar price point.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has reached a plateau and doesn&#x27;t like to use bronzers.  I think it works well in this scenario.  If I take a tanning vaca, I will certainly update my review with its performance as a new client.  Currently I switch between this and the Venetian by Designer Skin.  Oddly enough, I think it works as well, at half the price. ;)</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was just ok. I have been a big Phoenician user from DS and this was reviewed to be just as good if not better and I must say I don&#x27;t agree with that at all! Its okay and I did see a little difference but by far if it was between this and Phoenician, I would go Phoenician!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion from eBay for a fraction of what the tanning salon was charging, nice to see it&#x27;s sold on Amazon as well. I only use accelerators because I don&#x27;t like the extra bronzers or DHA ones. This is by far the best accelerator I&#x27;ve used! It&#x27;s a little bit on the thick side but by no means greasy. In fact, I usually rinse myself off after a tanning session but with this lotion I didn&#x27;t feel the need to. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a great smell. It definitely deepens my tan, I love it so much!! The next best accelerator would probably be Designer Skin Phoenician.</li>
    <li> Sent as expected and this stuff is great! Smells awesome! Makes your skin feel soft and moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion on the market and my salon charges over 80 bux for it.  Great savings and this lotion stays with you even the next day.  Very good for your skin</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been tanning in years and tried this product when I started back up again. The lotion is a little thicker than your average body lotion, and not greasy at all. It smells good and rubs in well. The salon I go to charges the MSRP of $75, but I could not justify spending that kind of money for something that I&#x27;ll use two or three times a week, if that. I bought a few of the packets they had and liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get that tingly feeling when you put it on and get into the bed. It keeps your skin moisturized and gives you a healthier looking tan than using a body lotion or no lotion at all. I tried a regular body lotion thinking it would work just the same, it dried out my skin and made my tan flaky. I like this stuff, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay the $75 for the 10 oz tube at the salon. I&#x27;ve seen it on Ebay and on here for 1/3 the price. It&#x27;s good stuff. Makes your color stay longer and have a softer richer feel to it. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite tanning lotion.  You can use it in the tanning bed or just outside.</li>
    <li> Ive tried just about everything this summer and nothing gave me a better tan than this lotion (not even tingles or bronzers!)</li>
    <li> I like this product - it is a good accelerator, leaves no streaks, and it has a pleasant scent on top of it all</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, seems to help get a darker tan</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite accelerators, and it always gets me super dark. It smells really good (fruity/coconut scent), and it&#x27;s very moisturizing. It is a pretty thick lotion, so I don&#x27;t use it much in the summer, but you could.</li>
    <li> This lotion ran out fast. It didn&#x27;t spread well, so it took a lot of lotion to cover my body. I guess it&#x27;s an okay lotion for people starting out, but I bet there&#x27;s a better brand out there.</li>
    <li> It smells like pineapples is very thick, &amp; seems to work great.  You will love this product &amp; it makes your skin so soft.</li>
    <li> love it! its the only lotion that work on my skin and the tanning salon never has it in stock. recommend ordering and will order again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of the best I\\&quot;ve ever used! Normally, I purchase a bottle and when I&#x27;m done with it want to try something new but NOT with this lotion. It is one of those I will keep buying over and over. The smell is very nice, a little fruity but not over powering by any means. It is VERY moisturizing, there for you do have to rub it in very well. It&#x27;s think too, like body creams from Bath &amp; Body Works. I get amazing color from this stuff each and every time I use it, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great price. Palm beach tan charges, with tax, 60 bucks for this lotion.. and that&#x27;s with a discount apparently. I love the smell and texture of this lotion. I also like that it can be used indoor and outdoors. It gives me a very nice tan and it doesn&#x27;t make me smell gross after going tanning. This is and always will be my favorite lotion to use. Its perfect for beginner tanners and experienced ones as well. I got some for my parents who were pale as can be and had just signed up for a membership at a tanning salon. They had to prepare for a trip to Belize in two months and this seemed to do the trick. They loved it and their in their mid 40s!</li>
    <li> I am a tanning addict, and a product junkie. Dangerous combination. I have tried almost everything out there, and prefer bronzers and tinglers for instant results because I get impatient. I rotate my lotions though, for best results. This is my go to lotion! I have been buying it since it first came out, and since I discovered amazon, I have been getting my lotions through here instead of salons since. Never had any problems and always lower priced. The fragrance in the lotion is to die for. Very fruity and tropical and no ATO. Smells absolutely delish. It is a thicker lotion but it melts into your skin and leaves you moisturized for hours! A little goes a long way, or you can spoil your skin and lather up. I usually don&#x27;t see a difference in lotions without bronzers or tingle, but this lotion gives me amazing results just by itself, and is a great starter lotion to build a base tan. I have let a lot of friends try mine out and they are always bugging me to get them more! I definitely recommend! Probably more towards females due to the perfume-like smell, but still an amazing lotion.</li>
    <li> Used this product last year and fell in love with it and I&#x27;m using it again this year</li>
    <li> I used the Australian Gold cream years ago to tan and it is the reason I primarily purchased it again. I tanned for a week and received a nice olive color tan. It smells sweet and beachy.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t tan easily or fast this is perfect for you. I needed an accelerator not a bronzer and that&#x27;s exactly what I got! Smells awesome too!</li>
    <li> I used this and liked that it was thick with moisturizers and I loved the after smell so originally i gave it 5 stars. However, the next day I noticed that my skin was a bit irritated which is odd because I can use a strong tingle bronzer like bombshell and my skin is fine. I&#x27;m going to use it a few more times and see maybe if it was a fluke then I will update this accordingly . I don&#x27;t believe I received a fake product</li>
    <li> What more could a girl ask for in a tanning lotion, right?  A little goes a long way, which I like.  The fragrance is nice and light, so applying, tanning and then heading out on the town is great with this lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;m 26 years old. My whole family is Irish, pale, sensitive skin and freckles!!!. Always spent so much time trying to tan for the last 5 years. I&#x27;ve been with multiple tanning salons with many many lotions!. As well as laying out in the sun of course. I used to have to dedicate a good amount of time to tanning and it would take up to 6 weeks or more to even attempt a good base tan! But what I consider &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; otherwise who can get dark in one day would still consider me &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34;. But it&#x27;s all good. So I had given up the last whole year and have been exactly as white as a sheet of paper this whole summer to be honest. Signed up at now Palm Beach and have this lotion now and wow it&#x27;s only been 3 sessions at not even the max time allowed. And I already look and feel great. First one I&#x27;ve ever used with no bronzer and I already like it so much better and the smell is definitely great for a male or female and it has No shimmer-I always didn&#x27;t like that. And my friends noticed my skin without even telling them I signed back up, and they thought I got this on my recent vacation. Nope! I recommend this for any naturally fair skinned people who usually burn and go right back to being pale. Trust me the Irish gals don&#x27;t lie! :)</li>
    <li> Just okay, I don&#x27;t really see the difference in this and any other tanning lotion. I did like that it had a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Nice,light, tanning lotion for indoor or outdoor tanning. Has a very nice scent and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> It smells great before and after tanning. Some lotions leave you smelling funky after you&#x27;re done tanning. This one you could go about your day and not worry about being stinky. Does what it is suppose to do. I&#x27;m not a fan of lotions with bronzers and this lotions has none :) It&#x27;s an amazing product and I&#x27;m really sad it&#x27;s getting harder to find. Get it while you can :)</li>
    <li> Fierce D Fense has always been my Go To Intensifier. I am so pale naturally and this  lotion does wonders for my skin and tan. I used to work for LA Tan as well and this was always a best seller among our clients and employees. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get a nice tan and showers/works out right after. It smells amazing too :)</li>
    <li> Best beginner lotion! Very moisturizing! Bought this to use to get a base tan after not tanning for almost a year! Love this lotion!</li>
    <li> having very dry skin that is sensitive to certain additives this lotion is the best i&#x27;ve tried for tanning &amp; moisturizing to date, and it smells awesome even after the heat.  love it.</li>
    <li> I love the product so far, I have even used it as just lotion because i love the smell. It does seem to be thicker and yet not too greasy or oily. It also helps with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer ever!  It is rich and creamy, and it smells wonderful!  Better than ANY other moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve tried numerous other brands.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and had amazing results.  BTW, I do not use a tanning bed, I just use it for regular moisturizing, but it will help you keep your tan if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and the smell</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have used tanning beds before with all kinds of $100 lotions and have barely seen results. I&#x27;ve used this four times and I&#x27;m so many shades darker! Well worth the money. I&#x27;d still buy it if it&#x27;s twice the price. My pic was taken right after my fourth tan. Seriously, you can&#x27;t beat it.  PS, the pic looks like</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if its doing anything, but the smell is okay.</li>
    <li> No complaints. No streaks or orange discoloration. Even works well outdoors.</li>
    <li> Good value and quality. I was looking for something similar to AG Promised that has been discontinued. I&#x27;m light skinned, German/Irish background and burn easily but I ran moderately too. Within about 10 sessions I have started to develope a good base and my skin feels very smooth which is great because I have naturally dry skin. I think this bottle is enough volume to last and pretty good given the relatively low price for quality. It smells lovely. And if definitely buy it again. Just a straight forward nice tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and was as stated</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful and will get you over a plateau!  Its way cheaper on amazon. It goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. This is an intensifirer so there is no bronzer But it will help you get darker. I use it in the lower level beds then the next day i will use liquid  assests in a higher level bed and you will definitely  be darker. Fast shipping by seller also..thanks!</li>
    <li> It is actually for my wife. My red hair does not go well with tanning. She, however, looks great. The tan is very naturally looking and getting darker. She has no problem with drying and her skin is silky smooth. It also smells like summer, which is great. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; a super price! I&#x27;ll be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I got this really fast and I love the product. Great price for a quality tanning lotion! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying that I&#x27;m extremely pale. I&#x27;ve been going to the same tanning salon for the last couple of years and have tanned nicely enough to have a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; When I saw a YouTube video on this lotion I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and I am forever grateful and in debt to the girl who recommended it. I am tanner than I have ever been in my life and people actually complement me on how dark I am! It only took me 2 weeks of tanning to achieve what usually would take me 2 months! For the results you get, the price is fantastic and the lotion smells so good! Not going to lie, it has an after tan smell, but that is just standard for tanning, no matter the lotion. It is very moisturizing and just such an amazing product. If you are thinking maybe, just bite the bullet, you&#x27;re great tan is worth it! Btw, this is only the second review I have written about a product on amazon....that&#x27;s how great I think it is! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I Love this tanning lotion. Goes on smooth. Very thick and very moisturizing. Good color. Better than others I have tried.</li>
