      <li>It was AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>A good choice for cracked heels.</li>
      <li>perhaps they&#x27;ve never tried a really good cream.</li>
      <li>By using Nordic Care I can skip a day (or two) and still feel good about my feet.</li>
      <li>It smells good, too.</li>
      <li>I purchased it (even though it was fairly pricey IMO) and began using it.  </li>
      <li>I was delighted I could find it here in the US instead of having to have</li>
      <li>I tried this cream for 2 weeks, and most of my cracks had disappeared!   </li>
      <li>This is the best food cream I have ever used, highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
      <li>However, it is definitely my favorite lotion for the feet.</li>
      <li>Have recommended it to many others.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>I tried many others creams but my feet were always cracking</li>
      <li>and I love this cream.</li>

      <li>This product is absolutely fantastic!</li>
      <li>since recommend it to many friends.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>This cream has taken dryness away and my feet are so healthy.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many and nothing worked.</li>
      <li>In fact, I think even the Healthy Feet brand from O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s is better than the Nordic Care.  </li>
      <li>My feet are in much better shape and the skin isn&#x27;t cracked like it used to be.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for dry feet.  </li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found for dry cracked heels.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, covers well and does the job of repairing cracked heel skin.</li>
      <li>, I had feet worthy of a foot model :-)  </li>
      <li>It kept my feet smooth.  </li>
      <li>but I put a light coat on my face at night too.  </li>
      <li>but the cream keeps it all smooth in between.</li>
      <li>just remember to apply it at night before bed, and wear some light socks to help it penetrate as you sleep.  </li>
      <li>Guy&#x27;s, if you want to show your wife how much you love her, tell her to order some of this cream or just man up and order it yourself, then tell her to lay back, put her feet up and take her stress away with a great foot rub.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for dry cracking feet.</li>
      <li>It is great for rough heels.  </li>
      <li>Great lotion for dry hands and feet!!!</li>
      <li>I really like this foot cream because it is not too greasy and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>With a smile on my face</li>
      <li>worth the money!&lt;br</li>
      <li>On the whole, I think it is better than most other things available in the US right now, but \\&quot;this is not your mother&#x27;s CCS....\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance, it just smells nice and clean.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
      <li>I started getting pedicures periodically to try to deal with the problem and they helped for the first week or two</li>
      <li>I used the foot cream faithfully and as it promised my feet were smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>And try not to skip one single night, or you will notice the difference right away :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thoughtful and useful present for anyone--especially for me!</li>
      <li>I apply after my shower daily and have smooth, soft heels so important in sandals.</li>
      <li>Nordic Care is virtually fragrance free (there&#x27;s a slight scent when you&#x27;re first applying it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant), but this stuff lasts!  </li>
      <li>Nothing better than this to keep dry feet from cracking</li>
      <li>BUT it&#x27;s not nearly as thick as the original, and takes twice as long to work as the original.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often take time to write my opinions on products, but Nordic Care is much better than I ever expected.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
      <li>but they charge too much.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very condensed</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend it to anyone --</li>
      <li>Very helpful for dryness and spots.  </li>
      <li>I purchased some Essie foot cream at Target and it is amazing - at half the cost!</li>
      <li>This is great if you&#x27;re not into grooming daily or have a hard time reaching your feet.  </li>
      <li>If I use it religiously right after getting out of the tub or shower, it REALLY makes a big difference.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>use it twice a day until your feet are normal then just once a day to maintain...</li>
      <li>Good product for dry, cracked feet, although a little pricey.</li>
      <li>I have very soft feel and just need something heavier and creamier than a body lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just not sure why people are so in love with this product ...</li>
      <li>I put together a small bag of my favorite things and included this</li>
      <li>I used to have cracks on my heels, even after a professional pedicure was done.  </li>
      <li>like this product so much that I included in Christmas gifts to friends last year.  </li>
      <li>and I like to have soft skin.</li>
      <li>This product makes my feet so soft.</li>
      <li>It softens your feet and keeps them soft  between pedicures.</li>
      <li>I was recommended this product at a professional salon and began to use it on my feet every day when I got out of the shower.</li>
      <li>This is better than all my other more expensive face creams.</li>
      <li>Personally I feel if you put cream on your feet everyday they will be fine.  </li>
      <li>This product hasn&#x27;t done much for my dry feet.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even remember having such silky soft feet bottoms when I was a kid.  </li>
      <li>Has helped considerably with dry skin on the bottom of my feet.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and it really works!</li>
      <li>I use this to rub my wife&#x27;s feet down after a being on them all day in high heels.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for dry cracked heels.  Does not have that waxy feeling on your feet :-(.  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product for dry, cracked feet, although a little pricey.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this product while in California from a spa. I used the foot cream faithfully and as it promised my feet were smooth and soft.This is the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. Not greasy and works wonders.</li>
    <li> A friend from work gave this to me after hearing me complain about not being able to wear sandals.  I used to have cracks on my heels, even after a professional pedicure was done.  I seriously had one crack in the same spot for over 10 years.  I tried everything from the pedi-egg to an automated filer, along with Neutrogena&#x27;s foot cream and I still had cracks on my heels and the end of the balls of my feet.  I tried this cream for 2 weeks, and most of my cracks had disappeared!   It&#x27;s been about 8-9 weeks now, and I have the smoothest crack-free feet I&#x27;ve ever seen on myself.  I can&#x27;t even remember having such silky soft feet bottoms when I was a kid.  Like the other reviews, a little goes a long way.  I am probably overdoing it, but in the beginning I used it at least two, if not three, times per day.  Now I still use it two times a day (morning after shower, night before bed).  Sometimes I even use a pair of socks with silicone inside overnight if I&#x27;ve skipped a treatment.  I&#x27;ve got the 5.9 oz bottle, have used it at least twice daily for 2 months, and I still have half a bottle left!  I&#x27;m buying this cream from Amazon&#x27;s affiliate since it&#x27;s the cheapest I&#x27;ve found online.  I plan to buy a bottle for my father who has psoriasis on his feet, which cause painful cracked heels.</li>
    <li> This the husband here and I love this cream. I use this to rub my wife&#x27;s feet down after a being on them all day in high heels. Guy&#x27;s, if you want to show your wife how much you love her, tell her to order some of this cream or just man up and order it yourself, then tell her to lay back, put her feet up and take her stress away with a great foot rub. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to give lots of kisses afterwards!!!!!</li>
    <li> Being cursed with perpetually dry feet, heels especially, I had tried just about every product on the market to no avail.  While visiting my parents in the UK several years ago, I had run out of my usual cream and my mum gave me a small tube of the one she had been using - CCS cream.  It was AMAZING!  Sooo, thick and after slathering my feet with it for a couple of nights, I had feet worthy of a foot model :-)  Needless to say, I stocked up with several tubes of the wonder cream to bring back to the US with me, and have been using that supply for a couple of years.  From time to time my mum sent me tubes of CCS from the UK, but towards the end of last year, the package she sent me never arrived - probably stuck in snow somewhere!  Uh oh.  What to do?  I Googled &#x27;CCS cream&#x27; and was directed towards Nordic Care Foot Care Cream.  The packaging actually says it was \\&quot;previously known as CCS cream.\\&quot;  I was delighted I could find it here in the US instead of having to have it sent all the way from the UK.  With a smile on my face I ordered a tube and waited anxiously for it to arrive.  Well, it smells the same.....BUT it&#x27;s not nearly as thick as the original, and takes twice as long to work as the original.  I have to say that overall, I am disappointed in this product, and I wanted SO much to like it and recommend it to everyone I knew :-(  On the whole, I think it is better than most other things available in the US right now, but \\&quot;this is not your mother&#x27;s CCS....\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product at a professional salon and began to use it on my feet every day when I got out of the shower. It kept my feet smooth.  The excess I would rub on my knees and elbows.  I had a dry patch on my elbow that I couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything to heal it.  This did the trick.  It smells good, too. I love it and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often take time to write my opinions on products, but Nordic Care is much better than I ever expected. I&#x27;ve been spending three times the money on a product whose only difference was a minty smell  when I was applying it. The fragrance didn&#x27;t last and neither did the foot creme - it was gone by morning and I had to reapply. Nordic Care is virtually fragrance free (there&#x27;s a slight scent when you&#x27;re first applying it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant), but this stuff lasts!  I don&#x27;t have cracked and bleeding heels, but I do have some roughness and I like to have soft skin. By using Nordic Care I can skip a day (or two) and still feel good about my feet. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It was and continues to be the product I go to for foot care.  AND, the price from this vendor was excellent.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for dry hands and feet!!!</li>
    <li> I had feet that were in very good condition until I walked a mini-marathon about 7 years ago.  For some reason, after finishing the training and actually doing the walk, my feet suddenly had very dry skin and my heels began to crack.  I started getting pedicures periodically to try to deal with the problem and they helped for the first week or two but then the dry, cracked skin returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, while sitting in the pedicure chair, this product was recommended to me.  I purchased it (even though it was fairly pricey IMO) and began using it.  If I use it religiously right after getting out of the tub or shower, it REALLY makes a big difference.  My feet are in much better shape and the skin isn&#x27;t cracked like it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product so much that I included in Christmas gifts to friends last year.  I put together a small bag of my favorite things and included this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick but not greasy and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product at a local nail salon...but they charge too much.  It&#x27;s excellent for dry feet.  It&#x27;s very condensed so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Does exactly what it says it will.  Keeps my feet from cracking and looking bad.  Would highly recommend.  Can be used daily or as needed.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I developed very dry heels that actually split and make walking painful.  This product was recommended so I started using it.  Three years later I am still using it but I also buy it in the 32 oz pump bottle.  I take the smaller tube with me when I travel.  I have recently started using it on my hands as well.  Very helpful for dryness and spots.  Don&#x27;t be shocked but I put a light coat on my face at night too.  Softens the lines and fades the spots.  This is better than all my other more expensive face creams.</li>
    <li> A good choice for cracked heels. Easy to apply, covers well and does the job of repairing cracked heel skin.</li>
    <li> Nothing better than this to keep dry feet from cracking</li>
    <li> I have been using CeraVe for about a year and have been very happy with it.  But with all the great reviews out here on the Nordic Care, I thought I would give it a try.  Big disappointment after using CeraVe.  In fact, I think even the Healthy Feet brand from O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s is better than the Nordic Care.  I&#x27;m just not sure why people are so in love with this product ... perhaps they&#x27;ve never tried a really good cream.</li>
    <li> This has been my holy grail of foot lotions for well over a decade now. I have strayed from it here and there, but there is nothing that can even compare to this. I use a pumice stone every day in the shower then follow up with this cream. When I am using this, I NEVER have nail techs use those scraper things on my feet because there is nothing to scrape off!  Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend.  Personally I feel if you put cream on your feet everyday they will be fine.  This is great if you&#x27;re not into grooming daily or have a hard time reaching your feet.  WEAR SOCKS if you&#x27;re going to put this on at night to avoid slipping on the floor.</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of foot creams over the years to help with dry heels and callouses, but my manicurist recommended this product to me several years ago and it works! I have never been tempted to change to any other. Just rub on feet every night and I never have to worry about cracks again. I do get an occasional pedicure to eliminate dead skin, etc. but the cream keeps it all smooth in between.</li>
    <li> Great cream for the foot. Has helped considerably with dry skin on the bottom of my feet.</li>
    <li> This foot cream is awesome.  I have tried so many and nothing worked. I have fibromalagyia and your skin gets very dry and splits.  This cream has taken dryness away and my feet are so healthy.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t done much for my dry feet. I use it every night before going to bed yet when I awake you still see the dryness;  my feet doesn&#x27;t have that moistened look and feel. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The only product that I have ever found that cures cracked feet within a few uses. Don&#x27;t hesitate because you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> When your skin is so dry it hurts and can&#x27;t breath this lotion s so great to use and it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
    <li> this product should be recommended by all doctors as a help for psoriasis...I have psoriasis on my feet and nothing has helped since this was recommended by a nail salon in florida.  excellent</li>
    <li> I really like this foot cream because it is not too greasy and is easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance, it just smells nice and clean. It also makes my feet feel the way they usually do after a professional pedicure. I think it is helping, but I have a lot of problems with my feet, so it&#x27;s going to take some time. However, it is definitely my favorite lotion for the feet.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and will probably order some more today.  It softens your feet and keeps them soft  between pedicures.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry cracking feet. use it twice a day until your feet are normal then just once a day to maintain...I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Great! Thank You!</li>
    <li> This foot cream does wonders for your hard working feet!  I apply after my shower daily and have smooth, soft heels so important in sandals.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is great for rough heels.  It is a very good lotion for hands as well as feet.</li>
    <li> This is the best food cream I have ever used, highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The only cream that actually works on my dry feet. I tried many others creams but my feet were always cracking</li>
    <li> This product makes my feet so soft.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money.  I have very soft feel and just need something heavier and creamier than a body lotion.  this stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I purchased some Essie foot cream at Target and it is amazing - at half the cost!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. The woman who does my nails recommended this to me and I now always keep it in supply! Have recommended it to many others.</li>
    <li> This is the very best foot cream that I have ever found.  Recommended by my niece, I sent for it and&lt;br /&gt;have since recommend it to many friends.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic! A little goes a long way and it really works!</li>
    <li> The lady that does my pedicures told me about this product, and I am SO happy with it.  My heels have been dry and cracked for as long as I can remember, and this is the ONLY product out there that has helped!!  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone -- just remember to apply it at night before bed, and wear some light socks to help it penetrate as you sleep.  And try not to skip one single night, or you will notice the difference right away :-)</li>
    <li> A good friend of mine gave this to me because she said it was the best foot cream she had ever used and I agree with her!  It works well on my dry heels. It&#x27;s a thoughtful and useful present for anyone--especially for me! Good price, too!</li>
