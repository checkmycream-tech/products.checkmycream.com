      <li>Love the color and that it LASTS!  </li>
      <li>I really love this!</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>If you liked Joan Crawford&#x27;s eyebrows you might like this</li>
      <li>But not THAT nice.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most natural-looking product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s better than this $60 product.</li>
      <li>I love this product . ..  </li>
      <li>Its an ok product</li>
      <li>Pretty good product.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>The brow/spoolie double ended brush is great.</li>
      <li>its applies easily, smooth, just take your time and watch the product set.</li>
      <li>Overall, the fact that it STAYS ON ALL DAY is it&#x27;s best quality by far!</li>
      <li>I have been trying brow fillers for over 30 years and finally this is by far the best around.</li>
      <li>24 hours is right!</li>
      <li>Hard Candy is best.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>These are both good neutral colors no red.</li>
      <li>This by far the best eyebrow filler if have ever used, it stays on for a very long time and the brush is the trick</li>
      <li>on all day and is easy to use and very sanitary locking case!</li>
      <li>It is a &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; like texture to begin with; but the clay hardens rather quickly.....</li>
      <li>Haha, but i liked this stuff enough to spend my money on it all over again since i cant think of anything better to replace it with.</li>
      <li>The brush is perfect (and actually the secret for awesome brows, even if you only have eyeshadow powder).</li>
      <li>It lasts all day even in rainy or hot and humid weather!  </li>
      <li>Product lasts a looong time so price is worth the investment.</li>
      <li>Well, I thought it was worth another try since I need something that doesn&#x27;t smudge off.  </li>
      <li>I wanted something new,the first time I did OK with this product.applied lightly ,outlined then brushed.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you never leave it open....</li>
      <li>UPDATE weeeks later; love this product, will continue to buy again.</li>
      <li>Cause it dries up REALLY fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had this a couple days, but so far I love it!</li>
      <li>You need to clean the application brush frequently.  </li>
      <li>Plus the price is too high for what it is really worth.</li>
      <li>I have been using very inexpensive avon brand eyebrow products &amp; those work 10x</li>
      <li>Able to apply as little or as much as I want with the tapered brush.</li>
      <li>The price is too high for a product that does not work.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product so far.</li>
      <li>If you use it every day and replace it with a new one frequently, the hardening shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  </li>
      <li>stays all day nearly 10 hrs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used much cheaper versions that produced the same results</li>
      <li>I disinfect the brush with rubbing alcohol after each use, cleans the old product off also.</li>
      <li>I work close to 12-15 hour days and it stays on and looks natural.</li>
      <li>Unles youre actually getting ready forthe day &amp; are using it...</li>
      <li>Worth the $30.00 I spent at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My only issue with the product is that it becomes dry and flaky in the container rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>The color is very slightly darker than I expected but the color is fine.  </li>

<li> The color is very slightly darker than I expected but the color is fine.  </li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it sticks to the brush and is a bit difficult to clean off.</li>
<li> The universal brunette has too much black in it.  </li>
<li> However, still gets very dry and flakes when I apply it.</li>
<li> It becomes harder to apply if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> Can layer it, just be careful not to be too heavy handed initially.</li>
<li> I am 52 ,dark brown hair.brows thinning and sparse.</li>
<li> However, reviews said to turn it upside down and that would keep it from drying out.  </li>
<li> But nothing a little makeup remover can&#x27;t fix.</li>
<li> my brows are very dark brown.</li>
<li> Correct use of the double ended brush means no clumping or overly dramatic brows.</li>
<li> Waste of money!  </li>
<li> It smudges off leaving a very uneven looking brow.  </li>
<li> It does not spread easily or smoothly on the brow &amp; its difficult to take off :(</li>
<li> It does not even stay as well as Maybelline brow pencil or Hard Candy Brows</li>
<li> and I received taupe one not happy</li>
<li> I had purchased this once before and was disappointed because it gets so dry.  </li>
<li> Also color looked too fake.</li>
<li> Too bad I received wrong color</li>
<li> Was disappointed, esp.</li>
<li> &#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> Awful.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this. Did not stay on at all. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 52 ,dark brown hair.brows thinning and sparse.I have only used MAC brown shadow with MAC brush to fill in brows. I wanted something new,the first time I did OK with this product.applied lightly ,outlined then brushed. I l like that the box is card board and can b recycled.easy instructions.I really like this product so far. UPDATE weeeks later; love this product, will continue to buy again. it is not drying out at all. its applies easily, smooth, just take your time and watch the product set. stays all day nearly 10 hrs.</li>
    <li> Tried them all...this is the best!!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me @ all. I have been using very inexpensive avon brand eyebrow products &amp; those work 10x&#x27;s better than this $60 product. It does not spread easily or smoothly on the brow &amp; its difficult to take off :( I have only used it twice &amp; it&#x27;s sitting in my junk drawer bc I have no use for it. I&#x27;ll probably just toss it after a while. It&#x27;s a piece of junk &amp; I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow makeup ever! I work close to 12-15 hour days and it stays on and looks natural. I&#x27;ve only ever used this and won&#x27;t change!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple days, but so far I love it! It looks great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works good. Just make sure you never leave it open.... Unles youre actually getting ready forthe day &amp; are using it... Cause it dries up REALLY fast! &amp; then your screwed &amp; gotta buy another one like me. Haha, but i liked this stuff enough to spend my money on it all over again since i cant think of anything better to replace it with.</li>
    <li> this gel,powder pencil and setting wax in one is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;the cashmere clay setting wax makes my brows stay put all day&amp;amp;night. 24 hours is right! I wiped brows with hands and no smudging or smearing,nothing came off on my hand! Amazing! The brow/spoolie double ended brush is great. Worth the $30.00 I spent at Macy&#x27;s. I am NOT sure about the authenticity of the product on Amazon but mine is the Real Deal!</li>
    <li> I found it too heavy,cakey.  It also did not last as told.  Waste of money!  Also color looked too fake.</li>
    <li> I love this product . ..  .stays on all day and is easy to use and very sanitary locking case! The brow brush that it comes with is excellent for application. I have been trying brow fillers for over 30 years and finally this is by far the best around. I mix two colors . .  . . the taupe with the brunette. . .  .perfect every time! It stays on all day even in the warmer months with the humidity. . . . .  it seems to be waterproof!</li>
    <li> I really love this! It&#x27;s the most natural-looking product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This brow makeup is definitely not bullet proof.  I have oily skin and it just melts off.  It does not even stay as well as Maybelline brow pencil or Hard Candy Brows Now.  Hard Candy is best.  The price is too high for a product that does not work.  It smudges off leaving a very uneven looking brow.  The universal brunette has too much black in it.  If you liked Joan Crawford&#x27;s eyebrows you might like this but it won&#x27;t last if you have oily skin.</li>
    <li> This by far the best eyebrow filler if have ever used, it stays on for a very long time and the brush is the trick</li>
    <li> Great waterproof, sweat proof, everything proof eyebrow cake wax. Able to apply as little or as much as I want with the tapered brush. Can layer it, just be careful not to be too heavy handed initially. Best to build the color. Product lasts a looong time so price is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Its an ok product but you have to use a lot in order for it to work. I will definitely not buy it again. Plus the price is too high for what it is really worth.</li>
    <li> Happy with this I purchased this color, brunette and taupe. I have Brown hair my brows are very dark brown. These are both good neutral colors no red. Seems to stay in place and look neutral.</li>
    <li> Too bad I received wrong color I order the brown and I received taupe one not happy</li>
    <li> Not water or rub proog</li>
    <li> Love this product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it sticks to the brush and is a bit difficult to clean off. But nothing a little makeup remover can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Nice. But not THAT nice. I&#x27;ve used much cheaper versions that produced the same results</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply and lasts all day.  Correct use of the double ended brush means no clumping or overly dramatic brows.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I don&#x27;t think my makeup routine can survive without it.  Stays on all day, perfect color.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like liner used to on occasion around my eyebrows. The brush is perfect (and actually the secret for awesome brows, even if you only have eyeshadow powder). I disinfect the brush with rubbing alcohol after each use, cleans the old product off also.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product.But theyre are cheaper products out there.</li>
    <li> Awful. Does not work.  If you do have eyebrows (I loss my eyebrows to Chemo) this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product turns a grayish.</li>
    <li> Best quality of this product is that it does NOT smudge!  It lasts all day even in rainy or hot and humid weather!  My only issue with the product is that it becomes dry and flaky in the container rather quickly.  It is a &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; like texture to begin with; but the clay hardens rather quickly.....after a month or so.  If you use it every day and replace it with a new one frequently, the hardening shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  Love the color and that it LASTS!  The color is very slightly darker than I expected but the color is fine.  You need to clean the application brush frequently.  It becomes harder to apply if you don&#x27;t.  Overall, the fact that it STAYS ON ALL DAY is it&#x27;s best quality by far!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed, esp. considering all the good reviews.  I had purchased this once before and was disappointed because it gets so dry.  However, reviews said to turn it upside down and that would keep it from drying out.  Well, I thought it was worth another try since I need something that doesn&#x27;t smudge off.  However, still gets very dry and flakes when I apply it.</li>
