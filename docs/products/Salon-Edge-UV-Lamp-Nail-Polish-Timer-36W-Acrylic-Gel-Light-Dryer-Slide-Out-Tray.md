      <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
      <li>Bulbs were easy to install once you slide the bottom out.</li>
      <li>Easy to install the bulbs.</li>
      <li>It is really easy to set up and even easier to use.</li>
      <li>Granted, the bulbs weren&#x27;t easy to insert.</li>
      <li>I ended up using a thing strong plastic kitchen knife.</li>
      <li>do like the easy access panel which helped with installing the light bulbs.</li>
      <li>dryer itself seems to work fine...  </li>
      <li>I received Salon Edge UV Lamp and I was super excited to try it!</li>
      <li>value of this is fantastic.</li>
      <li>So that&#x27;s important to note that they take care of issues that may arise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hand with the gel polish came out looking fantastic.</li>
      <li>I ordered this light, it came in a box with 4 bulbs you have to install.</li>
      <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
      <li>The timer does light up and shuts off when it&#x27;s done.</li>
      <li>This lamp helps me get that done quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>It comes with everything you need to get started and the instructions is super easy to follow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m So excited,  </li>
      <li>Its good, is fine for my personal use.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly to smooth out the polish and really work nail gems into the top coat so that they stay on longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also super light</li>
      <li>I love the multiple time increment buttons on the top for easy use.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use Gel Remover after UV flash as always, then the nails would be drying fast.</li>
      <li>and I am by far thrilled.</li>
      <li>Comes with a good timer with 3 different times you can choose, or you can just turn it on and time it yourself.</li>
      <li>but this one is a good size and much bigger than some on the market.</li>
      <li>My nails need the full 3 minutes to cure.</li>
      <li>Super easy to work and is pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>I did a quick manicure on my hands.</li>
      <li>then the bottom where the light bulbs goes in is reaaaaaaaaaaally loose, but hey makes putting in the bulbs easier, then of course i got my manicure done one bottom coat then 2 coats polish and one top coat put it on the highest setting one hand at a time ugh!</li>
      <li>Also this was shipped so fast after ordering!!</li>
      <li>I love this because I&#x27;m a busy gal, and I like to quickly do my nails and be on my way.</li>
      <li>I get a smooth gel surface to paint on, and my nails are so much stronger under a coat of gel polish.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth getting.</li>
      <li>So far OK.</li>
      <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a great size because some of the dryers can be a bit on the small size</li>
      <li>As I said before, I have used this drier with several different brands of polish and it has worked great with every one of them.</li>
      <li>The timer is so handy and really makes it a lot easier when you&#x27;re going through multiple steps.</li>
      <li>It has a very professional look to it which I really enjoy.</li>
      <li>Did dry my nails in a decent amount of time and they looked pretty good.</li>
      <li>First time I got this UV, I did not know what to do for my nails, but my nails still did not dry gel more than 5 mins.</li>
      <li>I finally found a way to get it set up to where if I did not touch the lamp at all, the bulbs would stay on… well for the most part.</li>
      <li>I can get my whole hand in it instead of doing four fingers and then the thumb separate!</li>
      <li>Smudge free and professional, salon looking nails.</li>
      <li>Now that I have this, I really have no use to ever go to a salon again!</li>
      <li>I have used the light once so far</li>
      <li>No noise or anything, which I kind of expected.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants nice nails but doesn&#x27;t want to pay the extra salon money.</li>
      <li>You could say that I have a nail polish addiction, so naturally I was beyond excited to try out this dryer.</li>
      <li>feel badly giving it only 4 stars, but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it was user error or machine error keeping me from being able to get a nice finish and quick drying time!  </li>
      <li>I do my nails frequently and to be honest, i feel naked unless they are done.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would call it travel friendly as another review suggested since it is pretty big, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
      <li>The Salon Edge is easy to use, simply paint and cure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this item in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time doing a gel manicure and as far as I can tell the lamp worked without any issues. The polish cured as expected, so I will call it a success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the easy access panel which helped with installing the light bulbs. This lamp has 3 different time settings: 90, 120 and 180 seconds. That&#x27;s a nice feature if you&#x27;re using different polishes which require differing curing times, or if you just want to cure the polish for a few extra seconds. The timer does light up and shuts off when it&#x27;s done. No noise or anything, which I kind of expected. I think a small beep or something would be a nice improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I love about this lamp is that it is large enough that I could do my entire hand at once. I&#x27;ve seen some lamps which were smaller and you can only do one finger at a time. I&#x27;m not patient enough for that so I appreciate the larger size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I really have about this lamp is that it did not come with instructions, and the light bulbs were pretty tricky to install. They take some effort to get in there correctly.</li>
    <li> This is bigger than I thought, but my wife loves it. She loves being able to do gel nails at home.</li>
    <li> Its good, is fine for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  First time I got this UV, I did not know what to do for my nails, but my nails still did not dry gel more than 5 mins. I did not understand why it did not work. I asked my friend about how to use gel for my nails. Whoops, I did not think if I have to put on my gel after UV with gel remover ( alcohol for gel). Then, it works... Make sure to use Gel Remover after UV flash as always, then the nails would be drying fast.</li>
    <li> The lights are so loose they sometimes don&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly. Used with several different brands and it&#x27;s cures great. Really like the option of having it constantly on or using the timer. Bulbs were easy to install once you slide the bottom out. Nice and lightweight for portability. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Quality is great and works well. Especially for the price. Pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth getting.</li>
    <li> Dries nails fast. Inexpensive but does the job</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! I&#x27;m So excited,  I want to do my nails everyday!!!! I&#x27;ll Never do Another nail shop again!!!</li>
    <li> Works great so far, cheaper than sallys</li>
    <li> works as described. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well and my nails have never looked better! Granted, the bulbs weren&#x27;t easy to insert. But once inserted, I got the product I needed. I would have preferred an LED model, but that would have cost me more than I wanted to spend. So, I wear sunscreen and spend another ten minutes. I can live with that. However, I will definitely follow the reviews to see if my next purchase will be an LED model.</li>
    <li> So far have used it once and it works pretty good.  Did dry my nails in a decent amount of time and they looked pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. My very first time and I am very happy. IT comes unassembled. The bulbs or lights really need a bit of a push to clip into the sockets. I ended up using a thing strong plastic kitchen knife. My nails need the full 3 minutes to cure. So far OK.</li>
    <li> Worked for 2 minutes then stopped I already bought 2 of these are they both suck would not recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect size to be able to fit all 5 fingers to cure at one time. Comes with a good timer with 3 different times you can choose, or you can just turn it on and time it yourself. My only complaint is that properly inserting the light bulbs was a little difficult. I thought the lights were all the way inserted, and I turned the machine on and nothing happened. I ended up using the flat end of a makeup brush to press on the base of the lights and finally they snapped in and now all is well! You just need to press a lot harder than you would think</li>
    <li> I received Salon Edge UV Lamp and I was super excited to try it! As soon as I had extra time, I pulled it out of the box. I had previously purchased gel polish to use with the lamp, so I was prepared in that department. I was surprised at how large the lamp was, but the size is no burden to me. Immediately I did notice, however, that the sticker on the timer lights and buttons was peeling off. That was disappointing. As always, I removed the product and searched for instructions on how to put it together. Unfortunately, there were not any instructions, so I just figured it out myself. I felt as if I was doing something wrong because I could not get the darn UV bulbs in. I seriously spent 20 minutes getting the bulbs in. By that time I was just so frustrated that I wasn’t excited about doing my nails, but I did them anyways! Well, I THOUGHT I had the lamps in properly, apparently I did not because every time I moved the darn thing, some of the lamps would cut off. I finally found a way to get it set up to where if I did not touch the lamp at all, the bulbs would stay on… well for the most part. The UV lamp DID work on my polish and it made my nails looks absolutely beautiful, however the lamp itself was more trouble than it’s worth.  I received this product complimentary to share my positive or negative honest experience.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; around the buttons was flipped up and doesn&#x27;t stay down. Thinking I will have to glue it so it doesn&#x27;t fall off. I have used the light once so far and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to save some money. I was spending way too much at the salons. Shipping was fast. Easy to install the bulbs. Works great</li>
    <li> Works great. Bulbs weren&#x27;t that hard to install. I love it</li>
    <li> This dryer works really well. I have used it with a few different brands of UV gel polish and it dried them all with no problems. It comes with everything you need to get started and the instructions is super easy to follow. I had no problems with setting this up and then using it. I like the fact this has a slide out panel which makes it easier and more comfortable when drying your nails. Also, it&#x27;s a great size because some of the dryers can be a bit on the small size but this one is a good size and much bigger than some on the market. As I said before, I have used this drier with several different brands of polish and it has worked great with every one of them. It&#x27;s also super light and I can move it around with no problems. It&#x27;s a good product for the price because now I can just do my manicure at home.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this is a difficult review for me....  I&#x27;m not familiar with Gel Nails and dryers...  So, it&#x27;s hard for me to know if it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that it took forever to dry my nails...  I used a Gel Polish from Sally&#x27;s not a top tier brand... Mi don&#x27;t know if this islander my troubles stemmed from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself seems to work fine...  It kept cutting off, but am assuming that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel badly giving it only 4 stars, but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it was user error or machine error keeping me from being able to get a nice finish and quick drying time!  So, please keep that in mind when reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service seems to be on point, I had an issue that was resolved within a couple of days!  So that&#x27;s important to note that they take care of issues that may arise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a review sample....  However, the thoughts and opinions are 100% my own!</li>
    <li> i am new to DIY gel manicures. I ordered this light, it came in a box with 4 bulbs you have to install. Just push the bulbs in firmly til they click in, then its ready to use. Works great! Cured my gelish polish perfectly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lamp once so far now and I am by far thrilled. I always end up smudging my nails and after 2-3 minutes under the UV Lamp, they are DRY! Smudge free and professional, salon looking nails. I don&#x27;t know if I would call it travel friendly as another review suggested since it is pretty big, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. It is really easy to set up and even easier to use. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants nice nails but doesn&#x27;t want to pay the extra salon money.</li>
    <li> Lot bigger than I expected.  Use it on my toes too.</li>
    <li> i got this just in time for my manicure and everyone knows us woman HATE HATE HATE waiting for our nails to dry but i was rather disappointed, not completely but somewhat i&#x27;ll explain when i signed up for this i was all excited, i opened the box and the sticker on the top for the buttons was coming up no big deal we just push it back down again. then the bottom where the light bulbs goes in is reaaaaaaaaaaally loose, but hey makes putting in the bulbs easier, then of course i got my manicure done one bottom coat then 2 coats polish and one top coat put it on the highest setting one hand at a time ugh! then if that wasnt bad enough! I use a uv top coat that should work amazing with this product if it stayed on! it shuts off after a certain amount of time and my nails were NOT dry. i had to do it 2 or 3 times per hand because no you can not put both hands in this one together. so my advise is do this on a day you are NOT in a rush and can take that time out to relay and vegetate otherwise your experience will be like mine not that we all aren&#x27;t looking for a quick dry fix for our nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> (I received this for review.  All opinions are my own.  For more information and pictures, see my blog, Lit From Within.)  I&#x27;ve used both a 9w and an LED gel lamp before, and this is a welcome addition to my gel polish game.  The drawer makes it easy to install and change the bulbs, or remove it and give yourself a gel pedi! The timer is so handy and really makes it a lot easier when you&#x27;re going through multiple steps. I like that bulbs and reflective material are positioned such that your whole hand gets exposure to the UV light.  I don&#x27;t have to cure my thumbs separately, like I do with my small LED lamp.  I had no problems curing two different brands of gel, including creating a nail with a tip and building (soak-off) gel.  I love to change my nail polish daily, and I use gel to create a clear boundary between my nails and the regular polish.  I get a smooth gel surface to paint on, and my nails are so much stronger under a coat of gel polish. This lamp helps me get that done quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Salon Edge&#x27;s gel curing UV lamp looks like a professional model. It&#x27;s white, sleek looking, and large enough for a whole hand, but still lightweight. The unit comes with no instructions, but all you have to do is install the bulbs, so that is not a huge drawback. The Salon Edge is easy to use, simply paint and cure.There is one drawback. UV rays can cause skin cancer. My solution to this is simple, but brilliant. I went to the dollar store, bought gloves, and cut the finger tips off so my nails are exposed but my hand and fingers are covered. Problem solved. For someone like me, who is hard on her nails and usually manages to ruin manicures in one day, gel manicures are a lifesaver, and having such a high quality light at home makes it an affordable lifesaver. I fully recommend anyone who likes gel manicures to get a Salon Edge UV lamp! I received this product free of charge for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> You could say that I have a nail polish addiction, so naturally I was beyond excited to try out this dryer. It was a bit bigger than what I was expecting, however it is super lightweight. It has a very professional look to it which I really enjoy. I feel like I am at the nail salon, yet not paying the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this was so simple. Within a few minutes of opening the box, I was ready to use it! I did a quick manicure on my hands. The left hand using gel polish, and the right hand using a regular polish. I wanted to see the results I would get using both types of polishes. The hand with the gel polish came out looking fantastic. My nails looked flawless, and just as if I walked out of the salon with a perfect gel manicure. The right hand with the regular nail polish also looked fantastic, and just as professional. It only took a couple of minutes to cure each hand. I love this because I&#x27;m a busy gal, and I like to quickly do my nails and be on my way. However before this dryer, I would always end up hitting my nails against something while they were still tacky, and there would go my manicure. All that time and product down the drain. Now with this, I can paint my nails, and in 15 minutes be done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of this is fantastic. Start saving your money on salon visits and do your manicures at home! Now that I have this, I really have no use to ever go to a salon again! This is a great product to buy for yourself, as well as a perfect gift for the nail polish lover on your list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> This is great! I purchased this UV light because I got tired of painting my nails in the afternoon, and still ending up with sheet-marks the next morning. This definitely does the trick! Dries both gel polish and regular polish. I use the 180 second setting, alternating hands each time it shuts off, doing this about 3 times per hand for a full 9 minutes each. I can finally give myself a manicure without it taking 4 or 5 hours minimum to dry completely. Wish I had found this sooner!</li>
    <li> This works amazing. You can pay more money for a machine, but why do that when this one is great. I love the multiple time increment buttons on the top for easy use.</li>
    <li> This product is bigger than I anticipated but worth it! I can get my whole hand in it instead of doing four fingers and then the thumb separate! Super easy to work and is pretty sturdy. Appears to be made well and works amazingly! Also this was shipped so fast after ordering!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a salon quality lamp for an excellent price! It cures polish in just 2 minutes! I do my nails frequently and to be honest, i feel naked unless they are done. This lamp allows me to have beautiful salon quality nails at home! It&#x27;s so simple to get ready as well! I love the preset timers so i do not forget how long my hand has been in there. My nails were done myself in less than 30 minutes and completely dey to walk out the door! I love it, my girls love it and a few clients i do from home love it! It works perfectly to smooth out the polish and really work nail gems into the top coat so that they stay on longer. I wish i had got one of these years ago! All of my friends just rave about it when they come over. I&#x27;m thinking they will make perfect holiday gifts this year! I recieved a sample of this product for my honest and unbiast review.</li>
