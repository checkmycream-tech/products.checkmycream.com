<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can not say enough about this sponge!  I have super dry winter skin with some rosacea and dermatitis.  Since I have been using this product my skin is so much better.  I will be reordering more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype about this. It didn&#x27;t do anything. I followed the instructions but perhaps I need a different type of Konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> Is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin</li>
    <li> Love it!! So glad you sell this product.</li>
    <li> This sponge works really well for me. It&#x27;s very gentle while still being effective, I also find it quite soothing to use. I like the shape because it makes it easy to get my eye area and around my nose. My skin is quite dry and can get flaky, especially in the cooler months and it has improved my skin to look more radiant, smooth and has even helped remove blackheads from my nose. I like to use it before applying my make up because it makes a nice smooth base to start with and also in the evening before applying moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So gentle and soft. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference with my rosacea yet, but it has only been a couple of weeks. I am going to get the larger sponge for the rest of me!&lt;br /&gt;Using with Dr Woods Shea Vision Black Soap With Organic Shea Butter and loving this combination so far.</li>
    <li> Provides gentle exfoliation for sensitive skin types. Would recommend for irritated skin that needs weekly exfoliation.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice sponge. I used it a few times, and already it makes a difference. The skin looks more clean and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K.F&lt;br /&gt;Calistoga</li>
    <li> It fell apart within 2 weeks of regular 2xday use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, natural way to clean your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the  Boscia sponge before and much prefer this one.  Great product</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! Wish I would have known about it sooner. I am looking for one for my body now 😀</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. My dry skin on my face is improving so much!!</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my skin. I used it for a month and saw no change in my complexion. Also it dries out and feels like a rock.</li>
    <li> I wear little makeup and don&#x27;t usually use soap or cleansers on my face because they dry it out so much, especially in winter.  The Konjac sponge does a great job of gentle exfoliation and I love the french clay.  I bought another as a backup but I have been using my first 2-3 times/week without any deterioration of the sponge (I do wring it out and keep dry between uses).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is doing anything for my face, its too soon to tell. Feels smooth when I run it on my cheeks, not abrasive at all.</li>
    <li> Great product! A natural exfoliator that leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Konjac sponge . I cleans and exfoliates my face so gently and yet it does a good job. I have sun damaged skin from being on hte beach a lot growing up and this French pink clay works well. There is no soap or cleaners needed with this product.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS SPONGE EVERYNIGHT WITH A NATURAL CLEANSER AND MY SKIN FEELS SO SMOOTH AND CLEAN AFTERWARDS.... I DO NOT USE MAKEUP BUT I DO USE SERUMS AND A NATURAL SPF  MOISTURIZER.. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER ONE SHORTLY FROM THIS SAME SELLER....</li>
    <li> Great sponge that lasted me almost 4 months. I&#x27;ve become addicted to washing my face with it and can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this sponge to people with sensitive dry skin, because my skin doesn&#x27;t tolerate anything and this sponge does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying a new one soon!</li>
    <li> Made no difference to my skin.</li>
    <li> Citing my wife&#x27;s exact words:  &amp;#34; I love it, and it leaves my skin as soft as a baby&#x27;s rear end&amp;#34;....she plans to buy more, for her entire family in Germany, and more for herself, as soon as this one wears off......</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! I just reordered to share with family. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Lovely product &amp; staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge becomes very soft when you soak it and then dries nicely. It&#x27;s very relaxing on the face and always smells nice. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a critical side: instead of needing to replace the sponge every few months; if another more durable and more expensively-made version comes up, that&#x27;d be just perfect. However, this product is still amazing compared to it&#x27;s price and is worth needing to replace it after using it.</li>
    <li> It is both gentle and thorough. Plus the shapSo happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that becomes irritated easily. This is the best natural and gentle exfoliator eve that leaves my skin glowing. I use it about 2x&#x27;s a week with my cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product - really gentle yet exfoliating. I can&#x27;t wait to try others in the line.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive, rather flaky skin (partially due to Differin).  This sponge feels almost like a gel texture against my skin, so it&#x27;s very mild.  It helps get the little flakes from the differin off of my skin without aggravating.  I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got this &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; in one of those subscription boxes, &amp;#34;Fab, Fit, Fun&amp;#34; - and it was hard and unforgiving.  I figured you had to be a bronze statue to use it, but it got soft all the way through after wetting it with warm water.  It feels great, my skin feels cleaner, and it is markedly softer.  This will be my first time with the red for mature skin, as I am 54, and I have sensitive red hair skin.  The white, (Regular?  Traditional?)  I use it with cleanser, and rinse after.  Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going to do without it after this.  I guess I&#x27;ll replace it after two months, but it still looks and feels fine at 1.5 months.  This time I&#x27;m buying them for my daughters, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have used other similar sponges (from different suppliers) and this one is much better for my (very!) mature skin.  It has also lasted a lot longer than previous sponges.  Am off to buy more - for myself and for my DIL to whom I gave one at Christmas and she is also a fan.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the replacement of my previous sponge and find this wonderful product in amazon ! First i am interested because the natural ingeredients on it but after i try it i like the texture of the sponge when applied to my skin . Feels so refreshing . My dry skin also show some improvement after i use this sponge ! Definitely worth a try :)</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  No exfoliating properties in this sponge and honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything remarkable for this price.</li>
    <li> So far it has made my skin feel great and less tired in appearance. It&#x27;s gentle and hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel!  I&#x27;ll be buying more of these for sure.</li>
    <li> I use this with soap but I&#x27;ve heard people using it alone. It&#x27;s very soft in comparison to the charcoal clay one I&#x27;d been using. I&#x27;ve heard this is best for sensitive, dry skin types. It&#x27;s a little tedious to get it saturated with water. It takes over a minute when it&#x27;s completely dry and you have to hang it on something to keep it from turning into a sponge filled with mildew. It doesn&#x27;t deter me from loving it-- just something to bear in mind.</li>
    <li> Perfect exfoliating sponge! Does the job perfectly. Leaves my face so clean. I use it with the Cereve moisturizing face wash since I have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is effortless maintenance and so gentle for my sensitive skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about these sponges and so far I am happy with my purchase. I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge.  I have very mild rosacea and this cleans my face without bothering my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - comes in a version for sensitive/dry ski which is perfect for me.  Recommend it to keep your skin in beautiful condition!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to over-cleanse my face, but I do feel that I need to do something in the morning. This sponge is perfect. It softens more quickly than another brand of konjac sponge that I tried. I feared that the pink clay could be drying, but it is not. I love these sponges for easy cleansing.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial sponge.  It is delicate on the skin.  If you squeeze out the water gently, pressing the sponge between both palms but never wringing it out, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I  recently discovered Konjac sponges, I really wish I had known sooner. My complextion has improved dramatically. Everyone should try.</li>
    <li> This sponge has the strangest consistency when wet, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator, gentle enough to be used every night. I have no idea if the pink clay makes a difference or not; I&#x27;d have to test it against other konjac sponges to discover that. As long as you press it rather than wring it out after use, it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for daily use!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Initially this product did what others claim; however, because it fell apart in one month, it&#x27;s really not worth the price. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sponge! It works wonders and makes my skin feel perfect.</li>
    <li> Fun new sponge for product junkies. Very gentle, perfect for even very sensitive skin. I alternate using this and my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I like the konjac sponge but it is really soft and I don&#x27;t feel like it exfoliates my skin very good. But it is still a good way of washing your face.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I have SUPER sensitive skin and unfortunately even the sensitive brush head for my Clarisonic is too harsh..boo.  THIS on the other hand is fantastic.  It becomes so soft once you soak it in water and my skin feels smoother than ever from using it. It helps clean my pores really well at the end of a long sunscreen covered summer day.  I use it with my face wash.  I will try the charcoal soon for extra help with blackheads. I wish I had discovered these earlier in life</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this little sponge! Using it has caused my skin to clear up drastically! It&#x27;s well worth the price--and saying that it lasted me about a month, I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> Nice sponge, but not really sure the addition of clay makes a difference.</li>
    <li> very gentle sponge! i use it after steaming my face. it is very soft and easy to use. gonna buy more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cleansing sponge that fits well in hand</li>
    <li> Great sponge. It really works. Very soft on the skin, leaves your skin pristine. I ordered all 5 (bamboo, pink clay, green clay, natural, turmeric). Cleanse your skin and wipe off with a muslin cloth. Then soak your sponge in clean water for about 30 secs or so and use the sponge after using your cleanser for a deeper clean. Alternatively, you can add your favorite cleanser to the sponge. Then rinse thoroughly and hang up to air dry. You will definitely notice a difference immediately. It&#x27;s cruelty-free/Vegan, biodegradable and this is definitely a keeper for me. If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing, go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it. I don&#x27;t give 5 stars for no reason and I always thoroughly research products before I buy plus I always read reviews. 👍</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s less scratchy than I thought it would be. It claimed to have something in it, clay or something. I can&#x27;t tell if it is still in there but has been washed/rinsed out after the first few uses.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these sponges for daily face washing. They are very gentle while still exfoliating dry skin. I use my normal cleaner with them and they cleanse perfectly. If you care for your face sponge correctly (rinsing well and air drying after use, soaking thoroughly before washing so soften) then you&#x27;ll be just as happy as I am.</li>
    <li> great sponge, feels wonderful</li>
    <li> This is a bit more gentle than the darker pink Konjac sponge. The Konjac sponges are meant to wash your face alone, or with a facial cleanser. They arrive small and hard and expand when wet to be soft and absorbant. You should only scrub your face with one when it is fully expanded and soft. The Konjac sponges are gently exfoliating, this one being more gentle than the dark pink one, as previously mentioned. I purchased this after feeling my friend&#x27;s face when she used the dark pink one- her skin was incredibly soft and smooth. She has drier skin than I do. Mine tends to be oily. So I thought the French Clay sponge would work best for me, but because it is gentler, my skin doesn&#x27;t get as exfoliated and thus isn&#x27;t as incredibly soft. However, I would have rated this a five if I hadn&#x27;t tried the other one before, because it does work great. I always use it with face wash, because I wear makeup. In combination with face wash this sponge gets every little speck of makeup off. It&#x27;s easy to rinse, doesn&#x27;t retain makeup residue, and leaves my skin literally glowing. It only takes a minute to puff up with water, so I use that time to remove my eye makeup. If kept in a shower or high humidity bathroom, it stays slightly moist and puffed up. After a while of that you&#x27;ll want to either remove it to allow it to completely dry, or microwave it- to remove any bacterial growth that occurred while it was wet. I keep mine out of the shower so it can dry after each use, and it has never had any sign of bacterial growth, mold, or unpleasant scent (and it is not scented, so you would notice). I highly recommend this or the darker pink Konjac for cleaning skin gently and thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Eliminated the dry, flaky skin on my face in a couple of uses. Must never be without it.</li>
    <li> After hearing people rave about this product, I decided to give it a try since I had stopped physically exfoliating, opting instead for the preferred chemical exfoliation method. This sponge is really soft when it&#x27;s wet, making it nearly impossible to over-exfoliate. Konjac gets two thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge after I received one for a gift. I love the gentle exfoliating feature of this product. I find that I can even use it on my eyelids to remove my eye make up. The enclosed information recommends replacing it after three months. I plan on stocking up on this product. Hope they never discontinue making them.</li>
    <li> Just had it for a short while but it seems to be working.  Skin feels better as I&#x27;m prone to breakouts!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:742f47c277cb0bf1f0b8f28fcef1fb25]] I like using sponges to wash my face as well as my body. The sponges I use on regular basis are made from cellulose (i.e. wood pulp). Konjac sponge is made from the root of the Konjac plant (which is a potato-like plant). By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient. I included a photo of the Konjac sponge next to the cellulose sponge in my video, you can see the difference just by looking at them side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge feels very soft when wet and very hard when totally dry. It absorbs quite a lot of water. It suds up fairly well. It takes quite a long time to dry. Out of curious I left one sponge to dry without using it for several days and it took 3 days to totally dry. Each sponge has a string loop that allows you to hang it to dry, which helps to dry it on all sides. Because the sponge is soft it has a fairly limited life span. Based on what I read I expect to get 3 months out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 different sponges to compare them to each other as it was not clear if they would feel significantly different from each other. I they feel quite similar to each other in terms of softness and resilience. I was happy to see that none of them had a scent. The difference in color comes from what the sponges were injected with, but none of them bleed any colors. The water runs clear as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ French Pink Clay Konjac sponge is good for dehydrated skin. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Original Pure Konjac Sponge works on all skin types including very sensitive. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ French Green Clay Konjac sponge is recommended for Oily skin because it absorbs dirt and oil. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Volcanic Scoria Kojac sponge is recommended for mature skin as volcanic scoria supposedly is good for purifying skin.

Size: 4.5\\&quot; x 2.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation. Size: 4\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using two sponges on regular basis for about 2 weeks now. I have to say that other than color I am not able to tell the difference between the sponges by either how they feel or by the effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges feel pleasant and soft. I like how my face feels after using them. If I have some flaking on my face the sponge removes the loose skin very effectively. Does it reduce the appearance of the pores? I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges are very soft, so they do very gentle exfoliation. If you like the feeling of something rough on your skin this sponge is not going to give you that feeling. It is very gentle and soft. I think some of the marketing is just marketing (i.e. is a bit exaggerated). Don&#x27;t expect miracles this is just a nice sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are provided by Konjac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewcoal Konjac Sponge is good at gentle exfoliation.

    <li> Soothing to my rosacea-red cheeks. Cleans effectively and leaves the skin feeling no stress. Will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this sponge but once it touched my face, I was in love!! My skin is notoriously dry. I haven&#x27;t had one facial girl tell me other wise. I have been using the sponge for a little I&#x27;ve a week now and my skin is visibly softer smoother and more  elastic!! This really is a miracle sponge. All the products out there couldn&#x27;t do what this sponge did in a week!! If you have thirsty or neglected skin, this is the sponge for you!!</li>
    <li> I really try and take extra good care of my skin, and did not expect to see any difference, but thought with the clay I should give it a try. I am so happy I did! It is very velvety feeling after using, and a great exfoliator. I hang mine to dry and have used it for a couple of weeks now without any mildew problems others have described. It just leaves your face nice and smooth. I do still wash with my regular cleanser, then buff my face afterwards with this. I don&#x27;t rinse, just dry and apply your moisturizer. I really like this great sponge!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  It really does brighten my complexion.  I am completely happy with the results and will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my sponge for the past few days and love it so far. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel so soft</li>
    <li> Love this!  I mean it when I say my skin looks brighter and clearer!  The sponge is very soft.  I will be buying this product again</li>
    <li> Love using this sponge! It helped with my perpetually dry California skin. Even with the first use it left my skin looking &amp;#34;soft focus&amp;#34; for lack of a better description. I liked it so much I ordered another for the shower.</li>
    <li> I suffer from rosacea, and need a very gentle exfoliant soI like the gentle surface of the sponge. I initially used it daily for about a week, but noticed my skin breaking out a little. So, I  now realize now that once weekly exfoliation is sufficient.</li>
    <li> Feels great.  Just got it and skin feels smoother already</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Shipping was amazingly fast too! Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge, and the seller is fantastic! Will reorder for sure!</li>
    <li> My very sensitive skin loves this sponge! Breakouts are now healing with minimal acne products and dry patches are healing for the first time in years! This sponge may be a miracle product for me!  I&#x27;m feeling more confidence than I have ever had in my own skin.  I am currently using the French Pink Clay version, but I may try other versions, too.</li>
    <li> great way to wash your face. love it.</li>
    <li> Great face. This feels so good. I recommend them to everyone.&lt;br /&gt; Got some for my friends. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial sponge I will ever buy from here on out. I was a bit skeptical when this came out of the package harder than cardboard but as soon as it was wet it has the most amazing texture and I literally did not want to stop washing my face with it. I actually look forward to washing my face now and it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> Really great sponge, just a little soap goes a long way. Leaves skin feeling soft and refreshed. I have both the face and body sponge, I use them everyday. I will definitely continue to use this product, and purchase more. Buy it you will love it!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this but it caused some major breakout on my face.  I have dry and sensitive skin and it seems to dry it more.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Works great for cleansing pores. Can really see a difference in just a few uses&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If you have dry skin it makes your face much drier.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my skin feel nice and smooth</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!  Just after the first use, my face felt amazing.  Will be buying some for my girls.  Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love these new sponges.  Great for all over face and even around eyes.  Delivery was quick. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  I don&#x27;t like high maintenance beauty routines and skin care systems, so this sponge works great for me.  I use it without soap and it leaves my skin smooth, clear and feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> Use of this product caused my skin to break out into full-blown acne.  Nothing had changed in my diet, cosmetic brands, skincare, medications--in short, any of those factors that are known to trigger outbreaks.  I haven&#x27;t had any kind of acne in over 35 years, so, I can attribute it only to the use of this sponge.  I broke out within 12 hours after first using the sponge, and broke out further as I continued to use it for another several days.  It wasn&#x27;t easy to conceal the acne, either, when I went to work; worse still when I had to attend a conference that weekend.  When I stopped using the sponge, the acne went away.  I have since returned to cleansing balms and bird&#x27;s-eye cloth.  I wanted to like this product, but was greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my wifes second order. She also tried the green clay Sponge. They really make her skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product and a fair price. I like it because my skin feels clean after using the sponge, yet the sponge is not abrasive.</li>
    <li> Just awful. Fell apart quickly and did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> You had me at first wash! I love love love this sponge. I now look forward to washing my face. It&#x27;s like getting a beauty treatment every time I wash! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this all natural sponge.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent but due to my old, dry skin I was advised to use the red sponge which is perfecct</li>
    <li> Have been using this for two weeks. Love the way my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after washing my face.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft and hydrated when I use the sponge. I love how clean I feel.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this sponge, it&#x27;s very gentle and soft on the skin. If you have never used a konjac sponge, you will probably be pleasantly surprised and delighted by its jelly-like texture when soaked. The pink clay was a refreshing addition to the common white konjac sponge. My sponge lasted a few months, with only a very tiny inkling of a tear near the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is gentle enough for daily use. If you are exfoliating, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to use a gentle exfoliating cream or gel in addition to this sponge. Because of my good experience with this product, I would now like to try a body sized konjac sponge for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are through using the sponge for your face, you can place it in the bottom of a flower pot. Konjac fibre absorbs water, and recycling this sponge is an easy way to support sustainabile beauty.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It feels great on my face.  Non abrasive, unlike the sonic face machines.  Cleans naturally &amp; my face feels softer. I will definitely buy again.  Follow directions for drying and it does last.</li>
    <li> It has become my beauty regimen staple!</li>
    <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine. I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive. I also have an uneven skin tone.For awhile now I have been using this routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel for a facial toner&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees Radiance Day Cream as a daytime moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil for a night time moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use an Aztec Clay Mask once a week for a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil for an overall body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine. And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is I already owned he Burts Bees Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Black Soap is a castile soap. I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft. The smell is okay. It smells like...well, soap. It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that. I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products. It can also be used to wash your hair, but I have yet to try that. I have however tried it as a cleaner while doing the dishes and I found it worked well as a household cleaner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel. It is a great toner. It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used. But it is better as I feel a sense of joy everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it. If you don’t use toners, I highly recommend it. There are plenty of websites out there that show all the benefits of using a toner between a cleanser and a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burts Bees Day Cream. I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it. I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products so it makes sense that I like this too. I will however attempt to just use rosehip oil as a moisturizer once this cream is gone, simply because it would be more simplistic to just have 1 and it will save me some money. If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products. It has recently gained popularity when model Miranda Kerr admitted to using it nightly on her skin. The smell isn’t good or bad. Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product. If you don’t like the smell of it, don’t worry. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does. It makes my skin so SMOOTH! And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love. I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face. SO it will last quite awhile. I also love all the benefits it has. Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil. It makes a fantastic lotion. My skin has never been more smooth in my life. The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does. So I usually put this on first and let it start to work and then do the rest of my routine( hair, brush teeth, face, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aztec Clay Mask is such a simplistic face mask, yet it works better than any I have every used. It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne. I simply mix it with some Apple Cider Vinegar and put it on. I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry. I wash it off in the shower. Some don’t prefer to do this, but I haven’t had any problems doing so and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion. I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine. They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient. They are expected to last around 3 months. Even longer if you take better care of them. They are so soft! And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth. I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more. I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning. The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone. There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin. I then use the red clay body sponge for the same reasons. I have really dry skin and these help. I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has helped if you are like me and looking to lessen the amount of chemicals you put on your skin. Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.Sponges are a new addition to my routine.

    <li> I love this sponge.  I have very sensitive skin and it feels like I exfoliate without causing any irritation.</li>
    <li> Perfect for daily gentle exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for one week, but already I can notice a difference.  My skin feel really good!</li>
    <li> Came quickly; I like the product</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical. After expanding, it felt too soft to make any difference to my skin. How was this soft sponge going to change my skin for the better?&lt;br /&gt;Within a week or two, I began to feel and see a difference. Now I am a believer of the Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Before, I used to exfoliate my skin once a week with a cleanser like St. Ives. It would leave my skin with red patches because of how rough these exfoliating cleansers are. Now, I use this sponge every night before sleeping and my skin feels AMAZINGLY soft, elastic, and CLEAN. My skin has seriously never felt better. I cannot emphasize how nice my skin feels and how much I love this soft sponge. It really renews your skin. I have normal skin and don&#x27;t usually have acne, but even I can tell this sponge keeps my skin looking perfect! Five stars!</li>
    <li> I love the concept, but the bottom line is, it didn&#x27;t get my face clean. My face milky and smooth after use, which was kinda nice, considering my face is normally very dry. That was totally fine for about a week. Then the zits came..and boy, did they come. Ive gone back to my normal facial cleanser. The zits have cleared up. I know breaking out isn&#x27;t uncommon when switching between facial cleansing routines, but this was a pretty dramatic breakout. I&#x27;ve never had acne problems before. Perhaps it will work for other people with different skin types, but it was definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sea sponges for decades to wash my face, but when I read about this sponge in a magazine, I looked it up on Amazon to see what it was all about. I decided to give it a try,thinking it couldn&#x27;t be any better or worse, and I needed a new sponge. I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with it. Honestly I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d see any difference, but after about 10 days, my skin felt softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve been pretty fanatical since I was a teenager...and that was 50 years ago...about the skin on my face, so I never expect all the proclamations about how much better one&#x27;s face is after such and such a product, but I really can tell a difference! This sponge is so smooth when it&#x27;s wet that I thought the little bit of exfoliation I was getting from the sea sponge would not be a positive thing...amazingly, my skin is smoother than it was. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> This feels so good on my sensitive skin and the customer service is great!</li>
    <li> Great face sponge! Ever since i bought this one i have been using it on my face without any soap. I feel clean right after use, just feel my skin on face so soft. Been over month using this sponge and its still very good.</li>
    <li> My mother is very pleased with this little sponge and much prefers it to a cotton or muslin washcloth.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve tried the charcoal and the normal skin versions of the same konjac sponges, both of which worked very well. But, this one made my skin break out after just a few days of use. If you&#x27;re acne-prone, go with a konjac for another skin type.</li>
    <li> Love the feel on my face and the results are so amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love these! wash my son with them as we&#x27;ll without any baby wash.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for the quick delivery of My Konjac Sponge. Since using it , I have noticed that my skin seems brighter and and cleaner. I love using the sponge with my Philosophy Purity Cleanser. Thanks for a great product. I am sure I will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> Very gentle to the skin</li>
    <li> LOVE this sponge! Soft and really hydrates my extremely dry face! Doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.  Would recommend and buy again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely effective, convenient and hygienic.  I use it in the shower with or without product and massage my face with it in circular motion.  I will order the bamboo one pretty soon.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product...works wonderful expecially with my microdermabraision crystals ...wet the&lt;br /&gt;sponge sprinkle on top ... Wala...</li>
    <li> Terrific natural sponge, very soft after soaking in warm water for a few moments.  Tight corner allows to get in close to the eyes easily.  There is a string for convenience to hang after use.  Very nice present!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Love it. It makes my skin soft and smooth. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> This is a great sponge and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. The exfoliation is very mild and the sponge is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have noticed no improvement tin my skin since using it regularly for a couple weeks. That being said I do like how the sponge feels against my skin. It is gentile and very easy to use. You need no soap with it when you wash which is nice. Also, it feels durable, not like I will need to replace it every week.</li>
    <li> My skin has NEVER been this soft, do not hesitate! buy this product!!!! You will not regret your decision and your face will love you</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Received one for gift and after two weeks I could see and feel the softness of my facial skin.  This product gently exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this after using the original Konjac. I live in Hawaii and I have naturally dry skin that gets more sun than it should so I was excited to see if this is even better suited. It&#x27;s a good sponge, does what it says, but next time I&#x27;ll go back to the original. I just prefer it over this one. I think I&#x27;d like this better for the rest of my body however.</li>
    <li> The product states it is for dehydrated /fatigued skin . Since Konjac soaps is a big thing in Asia ,where I&#x27;m from, I thought of trying this product . I wanted to use the product for a few weeks  before I give a review to be fair. I followed the product&#x27;s instructions and I immediately like the feeling of the sponge in my skin. I gave it only 3 stars because I really didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin after weeks of using, it did not improve my skins elasticity and texture as claimed and had some skin break outs , so I stop using it.</li>
    <li> My skin feels soft....nice addition to my skin are routine! I like that it is a natural product too! Thanks for making a quality product.</li>
    <li> My skin is so very sensitive. . after using this my skin feels so smooth not sore or red love it!</li>
    <li> Super nice on my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been too short a time to tell, but I think I like the product so I don&#x27;t want to write a negative review! I switch between the Clairsonic, the konjac sponge, and nothing at all depending on how my skin looks and feels on a particular day. I like the texture and I think it helps deliver cleansers better with less product. I have a lot of PIH issues so I went with the pink clay. It hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a few minutes to rehydrate if you let it go to long without use is the only thing to note so it could elongate your beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a week, but my skin looks much smoother and hydrated.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am  a new user to the Konjac sponges.This is sponge 1 of 3 I purchased. I adore them! They are perfect and do not make you feel like you&#x27;ve just used sandpaper on your skin. They last for months with proper care and drying. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and refreshing. I tend to use it under running water from the shower without soap.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin silky smooth. Do not microwave for the minute it calls for. I did and burnt the sponge but luckily I had ordered two,</li>
    <li> This sponge is great!!! Read about it in a beauty magazine, and found it here on amazon!!! Bought me and my teenage daughter one. Love how it has made my skin soft! Better than a rag!!! Works with your own preferred skin cleanser!!!</li>
    <li> When you take this out of the package it&#x27;s very stiff and hard, it reminded me of a pomes stone. Once you wet this it turns very soft, this sponge is super gentle on the skin. But don&#x27;t let this fool you, this thing does remove debris, leftover makeup (after a first &amp;#34;thorough&amp;#34; face wash), skin dead cells and everything ugly. You can test this by submerging it in water after using and you&#x27;ll see the ugly stuff. I was looking for an alternative to the Clarisonic, which is not cruelty free, that&#x27;s why I decided not to buy it. In my opinion, this item is much better than the Clarisonic, it&#x27;s cruelty free, vegan, gentle and not as gimmicky and expensive. It&#x27;s also very relaxing to use. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an online review that also helped me to decide against the Clarisonic and go for the more ecofriendly Konjac Sponge: http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/clarisonic/_/Clarisonic-Skin-Care-System</li>
    <li> These sponges are lovely. I am an older woman and I love the results I get on my face from the clay sponge, the charcoal, and the plain white one. I will use them from now on.</li>
    <li> Love the soft feel of this sponge!  I&#x27;ve been using in the shower for a little over a week, and I really like the soft way it leaves my skin.  I will be ordering more of these!</li>
    <li> I am a 72 year old lady with &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin.  I have patches of dry skin on my forehead and I must admit, I was hesitant to try the Konjac Sponge.  I noticed and felt a difference the first time I used it.  I&#x27;m happy to have found this sponge and highly recommend it to other senior citizens.  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> My skin felt really great. Was glowing  for days. Love the product!</li>
    <li> Very very very nice - leaves the faces feeling incredibly smooth  Got one for myself and one for my daughter</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge.  I feel like it does so much more than using my hands.  I do find I need a new one about every month - it starts to hurt around my eyes.  An earlier review suggested that it was because it was breaking down.  I&#x27;ve tried sterilizing it in hot water, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to help.  I switch between the pink clay and grey charcoal.  I can&#x27;t decide which works better.  I still use my clarisonic every other night but the rest of the time I use the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I have no break outs but I do feel like there are less and much much smaller.</li>
    <li> This little sponge is super gentle, yet exfoliating.  When I&#x27;m using it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s rubbing my face raw), but my skin is super soft when I&#x27;m done!  Update 7/10/15: Okay, I love this thing.  I liked it well enough at first, but since I threw away (composted, if you must know, since it&#x27;s made from potato fiber or something), I&#x27;ve missed it like crazy!  I&#x27;m ordering a second one today!</li>
    <li> This is a great Konjac sponge, though I can&#x27;t really attest to the properties of the French pink clay within it. It seems to function as other Konjac sponges do and is great for a gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a few points to note -&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is bigger than I anticipated (it is almost as big as my entire hand), so if you had wanted the pointed tip of the sponge to be very precise, you might be disappointed. The sponge is also thinner than the half-sphere shaped konjac sponges, so it is more floppy. Lastly, it came in sealed pouch totally dry, and had to be rehydrated upon first use. Perhaps this is the standard nowadays, but I recall when konjac sponges first came on the market, they were sold pre-hydrated in sealed pouches.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little large for my small face, but my skin seems to really like the konjac sponge. It&#x27;s also very good at helping me wake up in the morning - far more invigorating than just cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something a lot less complicated and lighter than a battery operated facial buffing system.  I have one and I just don&#x27;t seem to use it.  I have been using this for approximately two weeks and my skin looks a lot better. The most Notible difference is texture and breakouts.  My skin is so much softer and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout for two weeks - which is the first time since I was a teenager.  I use it with a face cleaner and I love it!!!!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I wash my face 2 times a day, with just water and this sponge. My skin feels amazing, I haven&#x27;t had any pimples, my blackheads are fading away, and it&#x27;s only been a little over a week.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this...and my kids too.... I dont understand why but they love it i guess makeup</li>
    <li> I love the konjac sponge. While I don&#x27;t think it will be performing miracles for anyone, it does a great job at exfoliating and keeping my skin looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have such fair and sensitive skin, I deal with a lot of pink/red undertones, but I still want to make sure I&#x27;m exfoliating to get rid of dead skin and makeup residue -- this a great alternative to spending $100+ on an electric exfoliating item like a Clarisonic which would only make the redness worse anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to a friend and already have.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. When you first take it out of the package, it feels like a lava rock - hard, but light.  When you get it wet, it turns into a strange feeling material, almost like gel.  It&#x27;s very soothing on my sensitive skin and seems to work very well.  I like to use it after my cleanser.  It&#x27;s like a mini massage for my face.  I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying more of these, probably in other varieties.</li>
    <li> Excellent skin refresher for this 50-something mom!  I have noticed clearer skin and less flakiness by using daily for only one week.  A definite addition to my skin care routine!</li>
    <li> Nice gentle exfoliater to get off large skin flakes and leftover oil/vaseline residue on face.</li>
    <li> I had read an article and the reviews about Konjac sponges but I was still a little skeptical. I decided to give My Konjac Sponge a try since they were a little cheaper than some of the other brands and they made it easy to figure out which one was best for my skin. I am outdoors a lot and any extra help my skin can get is great. I have been using my sponge for about a week and a half now twice a day and I am so happy with it. My skin tone has evened out and it is so smooth and soft now. I have been getting light freckles and they have even faded to almost gone. I will definitely be buying another one when this one dies. I would recommend giving them a shot!</li>
    <li> THis is a fantastic way to exfoliate your skin on a daily basis.  Inexpensive, all natural, and just the best thing to do in the morning (my routine) to cleanse your face from your nighttime routine to make way for the daytime routine. Just about a minute in the morning of clockwise motions all around your face primes it for the new day.  Feels great (I even scrub around my eyes), and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this sponge - even ordered for my friends as fabulous gifts!</li>
    <li> I really like it, used it for a week skin feels smooth and soft, the sponge is really soft and gentle when it is throughly wet.  I sometimes use it without my cleanser mostly weekends if I don&#x27;t use makeup or go out.  And with a little bit of cleanser on days I have used make up.  Of course make sure you remove your make with a make up remover oil/cream before using the sponge :) I read that it won&#x27;t last very long so I am not sure since it is only a week, but if it last at least a month or two then it would be pretty worth it.  :) I just bought another one as back up.  I haven&#x27;t used my facial sonic brush a version of the mia clarisonic brush since I got this I like this better.  Make sure to rinse off properly after use and hang dry so it won&#x27;t get dirty or moldy etc.  I had 4 stars only because I don&#x27;t know how long this things last and if it has a short life then it can get expensive!  :(</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!!  It&#x27;s like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very sensitive and delicate skin so I have to be very careful what I use on my face.  I&#x27;ve used a buff puff but it was way too harsh.  The konjac sponge made my face feel clean and smooth.  I cannot use it everyday, but every other day is just right.  I really recommend that you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Very soft once you hold it under warm water. My face doesn&#x27;t get irritated, and I use it to clean my face after I use my skin care products. Just make sure to wash it before every use! Sponges can collect bacteria if not taken care of!</li>
    <li> What a great product! I have sensitive skin and this sponge never irritated my skin but always manages to gently remove the impurities and dead skin.  I love it so much that I recommended it two people for whom it didn&#x27;t work out.  I felt bad that they spent the money but if it does work it is the best investment you can make!  I owned a sponge by a different brand and after I came back from a 2 week trip and tried to rehydrate the sponge was crumbling and I had to throw it out.  This never happened with My Konjac Sponge even after 3 weeks of not using it.</li>
    <li> This is my third Konjac sponge one for my body and two for my face,  they feel luxurious, gentle scrub and not too harsh on my skin, great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
