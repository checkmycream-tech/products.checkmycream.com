    <li> So much expensive ewww</li>
    <li> JUST PAID 52.50 WITH THREE FREE SANPLES ON SEPHORA WEBSITE DONT BUY HERE</li>
    <li> I repeat do not buy this item on Amazon. Its over freaking priced! You can buy this at Sephora website for less than this. Whoever brought this Makeup Academy Palette should get a refund. Do not buy this from here. I have this myself and brought it last summer from Sephora website. It can fit inside a bookbag or a overside purse. I love the eyesahdows, the blush, the lipstick, the primer. Its cute. It only shows when you wear the right foundation and primer for your eyelids. But dont get it here ladies.</li>
    <li> This product came damaged.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my makeup lessons and really like it, the eyeshadows are very pigmented and it has a lot of colors you need .</li>
    <li> Great purchase had it for approx 3 months now an it works really well makeup hasnt cracked and all moving parts function well</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 20 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely loves all the products that are in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the primers, and all the different colors.&lt;br /&gt;She highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> In the photo this item looks huge I have to tell you I ordered one and I was very surprised to find how small it really is....I haven&#x27;t used it yet so for quality I don&#x27;t know....I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money....</li>
    <li> A good idea, but honestly, I would just get something cheaper. Eyeshadow pay off isn&#x27;t good after the first few months. The blush in here is great! Lip colors are sheer unless you use up a few of the pans. Cream eyeshadow is super creamy but rubs off easy. It gets messy very easy despite the creams being separated from the powders. Packaging is cute but takes up a lot of room. Honestly, if you want a bunch eye shadow colors to play with, just get a cheap E.L.F. palette. Or, take your money and invest in another quality palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for on sale and still regret buying it. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for the young teenager to experiment with quality make-up.  I purchased it directly on the Sephora website for $50.</li>
    <li> these are actually 49.50 in store. I work for sephora. Save your money and buy this at a store close to you or from sephoras website. just some friendly advice</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these but then realized within an hour that the store was selling for a lower price. The store was selling the same exact gift for 49.00. When I tried to cancel (an hour later) I was told it was already shipped. Once it arrived, there was no paper work in the box or instructions concerning returning. I think the seller knew that it was cheaper in the store because there is no possible way that these items were boxed and shipped within an hour. I lost 50.00. I could have bought 3 if I had just gone to the store.</li>
    <li> You need a magnifying glass to see each color and you need an even smaller  tool to try and work with the product ! Quality not so great either ! Don&#x27;t waste your money ! Just saying</li>
    <li> I got this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. She has told her friends all about it.</li>
    <li> This has made two people happier than I have ever seen in my life...perfect</li>
    <li> Great product and very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s kinda small, my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased Sephora before and found their products to be good quality. This will be a gift for a granddaughter. and I know she will enjoy all the different choices she will be able to make.  Sephora has never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> The make up arrived on time and was given as a Christmas gift to my teenage grandaughter. She was thrilled, however when she opened it, there was some eye shadows shattered inside near the top, black etc. Probably need to package better next time. But besides that, she loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this set its very girly and fun I carry I t every where with me great for party&#x27;s to</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and my daughter loved it!!! Thank you and happy holidays</li>
    <li> That was what my daughter did when she opened the box!!  She was thrilled with the how the make-up is packaged and the convenience of the drawers.  Plus, Sephora is a great make-up.  Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> As others have started, yes you can actually get this from Sephora for a way cheaper price. I actually bought over from Sephora and I love it..</li>
    <li> Got this gift for my brother for his cosmotolegy classes he loves it! Colors are amazing</li>
