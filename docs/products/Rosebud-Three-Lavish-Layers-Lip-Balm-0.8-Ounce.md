<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The strawberry seems messed up and it is nearly impossible to get out of the tin to use and the scent is very Americanized artifical strawberry which I find unpleasant. But the other two work just fine. The mint is best if you have split lips and the original is good for chapped lips. It will stay on all night and is thick enough that I don&#x27;t want to pick my chapped lips. I will definitely purchase the original again, but I&#x27;m not sure about the others. I&#x27;m still glad to have tried them for half the total cost.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it and refuses to anything else. Seems good enough to me!</li>
    <li> I love this Chapstick. My lips get so dry with the heat on. Felt like this was a really good deal for all 3 I especially like the strawberry one</li>
    <li> I have been using Rosebud products for over 30 years and this was a really cool deal with the tin included :)</li>
    <li> I had a friend who bought this initially from sephora so I remembered it being as big as the the burts bees product size. Ha ha I was wrong it was much bigger than that so this for me was a steal, for the price I mean and I love the product as I am always forgetting to bring lotion or to put on extra lip gloss so for this winter I ordered this and it works very well, it softens my lips and occasionally I put it on my elbows and it works very well. I&#x27;m happy it comes in three fragrances and I got more than my friend so I can surely rub that in too. I love the strawberry one particularly more and might go and invest in the mocha one too soon. Its kinda on the soft side of lip balms so you can use it more sparingly depending on your skins needs. Overall its kinda gender neutral as it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell of perfume which I love. In addition comes in a neat tin with a tin box and is sealed overall happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love these items! They smell amazing and keep your lips extra soft. Although it is probably just hyped up vaseline, I would definitely buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I like the lip balms, all 3 flavors.  However, 2 out of 3 tins are way too hard to open.  I almost think these have quality issues.  I can only carry the one which is easy to open with me, and have to keep the other 2 at home half closed.  I&#x27;m afraid   if I closed the lid all the way, i won&#x27;t be able to open it again.  They need to look into the quality of the tins.</li>
    <li> I am a real lip balm fiend, and this cosmetic had me chasing my tail in circles - that is how amazing and moisturizing it is. The Rosebud, Mint and Strawberry are all made with natural, clean ingredients. The strawberry tastes especially amazing, and has just a hint of sweetness. My lips felt so buttery, after application. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I&#x27;ll buy again!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a christmas present for my sister it came well protected, no dents. Perfect :) we love these products. I have rosebud, my sister rose mint &amp; my mom the strawberry one</li>
    <li> Just love the packaging the tins are awesome. The lip glosses and Rosebud salve is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been experiencing severe chapped lips since starting on accutane.  I have tried a lot lip balms! This set is one of my favorites.  Since it gives me slight color, I wear it on my &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; makeup days.  It&#x27;s so much worth it to buy it on Amazon because Sephora sells one tin for like 7 or 8 bucks.  Totally recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for the condition of lips.  It&#x27;s greasy.  Save yourself time and money by purchasing petroleum jelly.  That&#x27;s what this is.</li>
    <li> Definitely will buy again! Great quality!It&#x27;s not silicone-like slippery and silky and it does a good job of moisture. The smell are decent and the strawberry is the lightest.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the strawberry lip balm, so I got this as a stocking stuffer for her this past christmas.  She LOVED it.  The other lip balms are just as good, but with different qualities for either chapped lips or for before bed...  I like the minty one personally.  Rosebud makes some quality product.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t too shiny or sticky, works very well and lasts. I prefer the original but also enjoy the mint. It&#x27;s also very versatile. Not only can it be used on lips but I&#x27;ll use it on my hands, elbows, knees and kid&#x27;s sore nose. There&#x27;s another CO Bigelow lip balm that I love and the Kiehls, good ol&#x27; Blistex (blue container), Burt&#x27;s Bees or Natural Ice Cherry.   My mother swears by La Mer but I&#x27;ll take a big pass on that due to cost.</li>
    <li> The mint and very good use.</li>
    <li> Best lip salve I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t ever choose anything else. Doesn&#x27;t chap up your lips like some chapsticks do and the min or rose kind leaves a nice glossy appearance that isn&#x27;t sticky at all. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite lip balm for several years now and I simply cannot live without.  I use the original Rosebud Balm as a lip plumper and add cinnamon oil.  The little tin the balm comes in lends exceptional handiness to carrying it in your bag or pocket. My lips would be lost without it.  Everyone has a top ten-beauty list and this would be in my top ten.  I highly recommend this.  It would also make a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> Must have!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product! I put a thick layer on my lips at night..Then in the morning I used a wet napkin to swipe it on.. All the dead/dried skin come right off.. Who needs lip scrub if you have Rosebud?? Give it a try ladies..</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT, I ALSO USE THIS PRODUCT ON MY HANDS</li>
    <li> Great great product.  Since I&#x27;ve tried the Rosebud 2yrs ago, I don&#x27;t try any other product like I used to because I found the king of the lip balm.  I also buy many of them to place in my purse, my work desk, in the kitchen, next to my bed etc......</li>
    <li> I was unfamiliar with this product and didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I really enjoy it and like  the convenience of the small containers. I carry one in my purse at all times.</li>
    <li> it was delivered fast and came in a conveniently small tin container.  As for the product itself, it is my absolute favorite lip balm because it keeps your lips moisturized for hours at a time even after eating.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> As always, Rosebud never disappoints</li>
    <li> These lip balms are great.  Very emollient and they smell really nice.  I&#x27;m purchasing these for the third time- my kids love them as much as I do, and I keep finding myself without a lip balm.  This set will be for me- and the kids will keep their hands off!  Oh, who am I kidding- if they know I have a new set, I might not have any in a short while!</li>
    <li> I love the Rosebud lip balms, but BEWARE. This seller does not ship what is advertised. I bought think thinking I would receive three tins of lip balm. Instead, I got ONE .8oz tube of the mint salve. No way i&#x27;m trying to spend $12 for ONE tube of lipbalm. Amazon, of course, is wonderful so they processed me a refund. Still disappointed though. Was going to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Rosebud&#x27;s lip balm is the best I have ever used. Not greasy nor waxy,just right. As an extra touch of class it&#x27;s packaged in small metal tins rather than plastic</li>
    <li> I received  the product super fast and six days sooner than projected! No damages were done to parcel and everything was accurate; the three round balms inside an adorable rectangular  tin case, adorable! My least favorite was the Strawberry Mint 😢. From the reviews I expected a tasty strawberry flavor with rose accent notes. Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the case. Although the smell was divine, the taste was not. So disappointed with it. My second choice was minted rose. Very refreshing and tasty plus tons of moisture. The best was the Rosebud Salve. The color was superb and super moisturizing!! I have tried the balms on dry lips, burns,cuticle softners, stings, chafed skin, ultra dry skin...there&#x27;s NOTHING  these treasures can&#x27;t calm down or smooth down. This will now be a beauty routine staple for me and bragged on FB about it. 😍😘😚😙😗</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. It smells great and makes my lips feel nice and soft. It might be the fact that I use the lip balm religiously and thats why my lips are so healthy. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had this stuff for a while now and i still have enough in each tin to last me 9-12 months.</li>
    <li> I googled best balm for chapped lips and this stuff came up in a top 10 list. This tin includes the original rosebud salve, minted rosebud salve, and strawberry lip balm. Out of the three the minted rose one is my favorite. I carry it everywhere and use it everyday and I no longer have chapped lips. The strawberry one feels a little thick, I don&#x27;t particularly care for it, but it works in a pinch. Overall, love the product, very satisfied. It is a must buy!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the Rosebud lip balm pack of 3. They do a pretty decent job at keeping my lips hydrated however once the balm has faded off my lips (within an hour or two) my lips are back to being red, extremely chapped, and painful. If you live in extremely dry climate such as Utah I suggest purchasing a different type of lip balm to help get you through the lip-destroying weather that occurs throughout the winter. For me, this balm was effective during the Fall and I&#x27;m betting they will be effective during the spring as well. Another con to these balms is that they do not include any type of sunscreen, so if you&#x27;re skiing or sunbathing this is definitely not a product you should be using. Your experience may be different than mine. Overall the balm in and of itself is great but for limited circumstances.</li>
    <li> I bought this not really knowing what to expect, but wanted something that would make my lips feel good. This does that, I haven&#x27;t used the rose salve yet i am trying to save it for this winter, but am happy with the strawberry and the mint. The true test will be this winter when I have massively dry lips, but as of right now I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> i love this lip balm and have used out several boxes. it&#x27;s very good. i buy a set this time for my friends as a gift and myself. i&#x27;ll continuesly use it in the future.</li>
    <li> Living in a dry climate, I use a lot of lip balm and have tried so many different kinds over the years.  My sister introduced me to Rosebud and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  It works immediately on my dry lips and I love it for dry cuticles, hands, etc.  My favorite is the Minted Rose, but they are all great and last a long time.  I&#x27;m no longer interested in trying anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like the way that this balm feels on my lips. I go through lip balm like nobody&#x27;s business, and my lips are always dry and peeling. This stuff makes them really soft and smooth. The strawberry smells great, but the rose and minted rose seemed a little odd. I had to get used to it, but now I love them! And I learned the hard way that less definitely is more with this stuff. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Classic lip balm that lasts forever, tastes great, and makes lips super soft.</li>
    <li> this is the best lip balm in the world, hands down!  I love all of the 3 flavors, but the minted rose is my fave.</li>
    <li> I like the balm and it keeps my lips hydrated. There are three flavors. I like the plain one the best.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user and I have no complaints! Fast delivery. Received all three containers and the one big container to keep it all in. I like the minted flavor best, then the regular flavor and then finally the strawberry flavor. The strawberry taste in my mouth was a bit much though, I don&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
    <li> Such a great deal! I&#x27;m still working through one of the tins, hardly making a dent so to speak. Keeps my lips moisturized and whatever skin dryness I use it for.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS QUITE NICE, AND IT REALLY HELPS</li>
    <li> Fighting my 13 yo for lip balm is not fun.  I&#x27;ll be reordering her her own set. :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tin pack! I&#x27;ve purchased this twice and will continue to do so for as long as it&#x27;s available. I use the Rose Bud daily for my nail cuticles - it keeps them moisturized all day so you don&#x27;t have white/flaky dry looking nail beds - (feels good on lips, just don&#x27;t like the flavor/smell - I know several who love it as a lip balm, it&#x27;s just my preference). I use the Mint Rose for morning and evening moisture on my lips and the Strawberry several times a day.</li>
    <li> Two of them wouldn&#x27;t open .</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff, to get 3 in a tin was effin AWESOME. The Rosebud Salve is great as it can be used all over, lips, hands and face. The Strawberry taste great and the Minted Rose is heaven, freshens the breath and gives a refreshing tingle to your lips. All 3 go on smooth, not heavy, not waxy and not tacky. They soften the lips and work great with my lip stains.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have used it for many years. I shared two of them with my co-workers and they commented how much they loved it, too.</li>
    <li> Ok, believe me when I say I have tried them all. No really, I have tried them all. Now, I&#x27;m not going to say these are the bestest, most awesomest lip balms ever like omg, they&#x27;re up there in that category, but it&#x27;s not the holy grail of lip balms. However, these ARE the bestest, most awesomest lip balm you can find for the price and function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I don&#x27;t like to spend more money than I have to. I don&#x27;t like tiny trendy branded lip balms that come in the most elaborate glass packaging but actually hold like 0.05oz of product for over $15. I usually just end up not using those ones because they were so dear. That defeats the purpose. These tins, however, carry a hefty 0.8oz of product (that&#x27;s a lot!) and are not unnecessarily heavy or elaborate. That means you can just chuck a tin in your bag and it doesn&#x27;t leak or feel heavy. The tins are wide so you can easily scoop up the balm with your finger or brush with no hassle. Sometimes you just want to put on some lip balm, yknow, and not have to fiddle around your purse looking for a tiny pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like fancy things in my lip balm. None of that silly mocha margarita sugar pineapple flavor, or pinks that look good on nobody, or plumping balms that feel like you just put botox on your lips or those weird new lip balms that change color according to your mood or menstrual cycle or whatever. These tins are pretty much no-nonsense, sure it&#x27;s got rose and mint and strawberry but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It&#x27;s still, in essence, a lip balm, instead of a rose/mint/strawberry all up in your face. It does what it should do, which is to moisturize my lips with a little scent to it. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a lip balm it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power. But then again that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a lip balm. It&#x27;s easy enough to reapply if you need to, without remorse unlike the expensive little pots. Sure, it&#x27;s not terribly exciting, but I find that if you layer it over a dark lip stain, it can actuallybring out the color pretty well. The tins are hefty and pretty and seal tight, which is helpful because the lipbalm can kind of melt if you&#x27;re in hot weather. But that&#x27;s the same with other lip products. Don&#x27;t leave makeup in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say these lip balms are like my comfy shoes. Not what I would wear to a fancy ball, not what I would show off but that&#x27;s not its purpose. At the end of the day I just want to let my hair down and put on some moisturizing no-nonsense lip balm and let it get to work without any of the other frills. That&#x27;s why I have these littered everywhere in the house and use them all the time, right next to the expensive silly ones which I never use.</li>
    <li> I live where it&#x27;s cold in CA....it happens.  I rub this stuff all over.  I used to only get the rosebud salve but I find that the mint helps my hands especially when it&#x27;s dry and cold.</li>
    <li> Lips cracking paint, after using a few times, is amazing, very helpful</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why this is a classic.  Makes my lips more chapped and seems just like artificially flavored Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I dont like the strawberry, but the rose is fantastic</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE LIP BALM  .IT GOES ON EASY AND FELLS GOOD ON LIPS.</li>
    <li> Is a very effective product, specially for sensitive skin. I use it every night, some times during the day too. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of Rosebud products I carry a tin with me everywhere I go.&lt;br /&gt;The three in this offer were great. My personal favorite is the Strawberry because I find it&#x27;s firmer and lasts longer on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;The original rose smells so good and is packaged so elegantly it&#x27;s hard not to love it too, but I go through it too fast because it has a more petroleum jelly type texture.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend Rosebud for lip balm.</li>
    <li> it very good,it very effective,i will purchase.</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips moisturized for hours!  The flavors are tasty as well.</li>
    <li> This salve is wonderful.  When I had my first child I found out that its great for diaper rash.  If you don&#x27;t have any Desitin in  your diaper bag, this is wonderfully useful and smells great.  You can put on your hands, your lips, your cheeks when you get windburned in the winter and fingertips when your cuticles dry out.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the tins opened.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant to order this after a couple of reviewers said they got one tube of lip balm versus the promised 3 tins. Took a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I was already in love with Smith&#x27;s Minted Rose lip balm and its many uses. Now I&#x27;m delighted to have the other two products. The strawberry lip balm smells heavenly! The cute little tin they all come in is a nice touch - I&#x27;m already using it to store perfume samples. :-)</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  The first time I ordered a single, to give away, as well as the triple in a tin so I could try all 3 scents.  Actually, the \\&quot;scent\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter to me - I just want to have one close by every day.  I use it in the morning and at night, and it has \\&quot;unchapped\\&quot; my lips better than anything.  One person said it&#x27;s the same as scented Vaseline, but actually it&#x27;s not.  My niece has chapped lips and has a reaction to regular Vaseline.  She had switched to Carmex, but didn&#x27;t like to smell like that!  I gave her a tin of this, and we both agree it works wonders.  I went out of town and didn&#x27;t have access to mine (fell between seat and console in the car) for several days.  After the third day, my lips started chapping.  I had a stuffy sinus problem and was breathing through my mouth half the time.  My husband had Vaseline, but it didn&#x27;t help much.  As soon as I could, I found my Rosebud salve, and within no time my lips were back to soft and gorgeous again!  Love it, won&#x27;t live without it now.  I think it makes a nice lip gloss as well - not too shiny or sticky.  I have one at work as well, and I just tried to open it right after I put lotion on.  I tried using a key, etc.  No luck.  Then I just twisted it open - that seems to work!</li>
    <li> I like the minted rose salve the best.  I want sure I liked the scent at first, but the more I use it, the more I love it. The strawberry one both smells and tastes great. All of them feel great on my lips and keep them from getting dry and cracked.</li>
    <li> Lipbalm is a bit too thick, but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product and good variety in tin package. Has lasted me over a year. Beautiful packaging. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever!  I have a drawer full of different types of lip balms I have tried over the years and this is by far the best I have found.  I can put the Rose balm on before bed and my lips are still soft in the morning.  Great stuff I highly recommend all three!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, for the price, these aren&#x27;t that great. They are in fact, much more messy and don&#x27;t stay on very long. I don&#x27;t see a difference from the other lip balms I use (Burts bees, lip smackers, blistex, etc) and these are more expensive. I was hoping the other reviews would be right and I&#x27;d be amazed, but definitely not the case.</li>
    <li> Terrific! I have used original Rosebud for some time now, and wanted to try others, the Minted Rose ans Strawberry are both really nice. The tin is cute too.</li>
    <li> The lips don&#x27;t peel  I like it very much.I gave it to my sister.She also likes it.Prices are very good</li>
    <li> I have loved Smith&#x27;s for years and years and the original rosebud is the best.  I only tried the other 2 when I purchased this tin.  The strawberry is very nice and the minted rose is a great balm but only for those who don&#x27;t mind mint.  The tin is a cute collectible item.  This set is a great value and if you try it you&#x27;ll know why it&#x27;s in every make up artist&#x27;s/model&#x27;s arsenal for lip gloss, use as a moisturizer, etc. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fourth generation (and my kids are fifth) of our family who ADORE Rosebud salve!  In fact, my 85-year-old grandfather still gets his hand-written order filled directly by Smith&#x27;s.  We&#x27;ve used it for everything from lips to cuts to chapped hands, and it always delivers.  I won&#x27;t go to sleep without my Rosebud salve to keep my lips soft all night, and I never wake up with dry, chapped lips.  Amazon&#x27;s prices are VERY good, especially since Hollywood recently discovered this amazing product so now everyone&#x27;s jacking up the price...  There&#x27;s NO comparison to 99-cent lip balms, not even in the same ball park!  Spend a little extra for time-proven quality and value!  I&#x27;m SO happy to see another generation discovering the wonder that is Rosebud salve!!</li>
    <li> This is good but I don&#x27;t particularly like the mint one. It seems like a completely different product than the other two, it doesn&#x27;t stay on for even 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I was so happy my item arrived early!  the box was a tad to big , but maybe it was the smallest shipping size? The price for shipping was a tad high for such a light product,Inside the box, it was carefully padded with air cushions.I was so happy the product was a couple days early and in perfect condition! I Will STILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER ! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm and the cute tins...I&#x27;m trying to use less plastic and it&#x27;s hard to find lip balm that&#x27;s not sealed in plastic tubes or tubs, so this is a good choice if you&#x27;re looking for non-plastic containers and a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love all 3 but the Strawberry smells awesome!  The rosebud has multiple uses so its great as well.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST lip balm EVER.  I am an absolute chap stick junkie.  I buy them in bulk as a matter of fact, but then a friend let me try this and I am hooked.  The tins last forever even with an addict like me.  Unlike other lip balms once its on it lasts for hours so you don&#x27;t have to re apply every 30 minutes.  Another thing I noticed was with this product, it instantly moisturizes your lips, there isn&#x27;t that sticky, waxy feeling.  You get 3 tins of it in 3 different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;  one is also a hand salve that can be used for both lips and hands. (really they all can and they work wonderfully.)</li>
    <li> Smells and tastes so awful, I immediately wiped off my lips. Sorry, would not buy again</li>
    <li> great for dry skin or lip</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this in the mail. This the first time I have bought anything from this brand, but the reviews were good, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a medium sized tin, small enough to fit in my hand. Once you open the tin, you can immediately smell a sweet, rosy flavor. It came with three lip balms. The ones I got were Rosebud, Minted Rose, and Strawberry. The thing I love about these balms is that when you dip in with your finger, the balm softens a bit so you can apply it to your lips easier. They reharden afterwards pretty easily so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it accidentally spilling or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balms are about 5 cm in diameter and 2 cm deep, so not too bad for the price, although I will admit that these are a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rosebud salve has a very strong rosy smell. It has a pink-mauve color. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but I&#x27;ve noticed that this one is softer than all the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Minted Rose salve smells like just mint. The most I can get is a medium hint of rosy smell from the container. It&#x27;s bright red with a little sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Strawberry salve smells fruity, but not overly sweet. It kind of smells like Starburst the candy. The color for this one is light pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love all three of these balms. They keep my lips smooth and soft. I apply them before I got to bed every night. My favorite would have to be the Rosebud salve with the Strawberry one coming in to a close second. I definitely recommend these and I probably will be getting the other flavors as well.</li>
    <li> Love these!! Good deal for all 3 kinds :)</li>
    <li> bought this for my step mothers birthday and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I recieved the product yesterday in the mail. The can that held the 3 little cans was dented. I got the plastic wrap off the top of the can to look at each of the can and all 3 of the cans were greasy and slippery. I cleaned each of the cans to try the lip balm and the stawberry is perfect. I opened the minited rose and it looks like someone went in and cut half of it out with a knife. I am still not able to open the rosebud salve and I have cleaned the can and everything. I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but ended up keeping it for myself. I love the simplicity of this product and the fragrance is light but lovely.</li>
    <li> five start,very good.</li>
    <li> Great trio of moisturizing products. A nice treat for your lips and skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for yourself, for a family member, or separate them and give them to three people. The salve is not only great for dry lips but can be used for rash, under eye moisturizer, cuticle cream, food/hand lotion and when my sinuses dry out and I don&#x27;t have nasal spray I can use this in a pinch. The salve is light, it absorbs fairly fast, and the scents are not overwhelming. I think it would be great for both genders. However I was a male I probably would stick to the original formula.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It smells great and makes my lips feel so very nice.</li>
    <li> Wow is this stuff awesome!  Most lip balm seems to make my lips worse somehow, but this stuff keeps my lips moist and they never get sore.  Try it!</li>
    <li> What a great why to try the original Rosebud lip balm and two other flavors - minted and strawberry!  You get everything you in see  the picture. I find the flavored ones to be just lightly scented - enough to enjoy for a second.  They do keep my lips moist!</li>
    <li> Value set. As I expected</li>
    <li> I am writing a NEW review on this product, from 1 star to 5, because I did get it now. If you buy this, it&#x27;s not 4 items, it is 3, and they are inside the can that you see. It&#x27;s good if you want to try different kinds. I hate the concept of ADD ONs still. Let me buy something if I want to. Don&#x27;t make me buy something else to get it. It&#x27;s SO annoying and a boon for Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great thing I have ever know before. Until I buy it, it does work very well on the winter time.</li>
    <li> I received my order today. The package contained one item which was a tube of lip balm called Minted Rose Lip Balm.  Some of reviews that go along with this item match the picture; but the item shipped to me is not in the picture and it is only one small tube (.5 oz) of lip balm. The tube of lip balm which was shipped is not called three lavish layers lip balm by the company making this item. But the seller&#x27;s sticker on the package says that (funny how they picture three items and the sticker on the tube refers to 3 layer lip balm, imho they are trying to trick customers). The tube without the sellers sticker is called Minted Rose Lip Balm by Smith&#x27;s. It is an awful product for chapped lips or even lips needing a hint of moisturizing. Within minutes of putting it on, it disappears and my lips felt the same as they did minutes before putting it on. What is the point of a lip balm if it disappears so quickly? This is by far the worst lip balm I have ever tried. EOS and Rosebud Salve are far more superior.</li>
    <li> The strawberry one is the only one that tastes ok, the other two I couldn&#x27;t even wear because the smell/taste was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing and helping with chapped lips, I think Carmex and Baby Lips do the same job if not better (though they also have a weird smell).&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this product is okay, but not any better than any other drugstore balm. I don&#x27;t know what the hype is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus side is that it makes a nice affordable gift to someone. The box is really cute.</li>
    <li> Great product, good deal, fast shipping, thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing a review on YouTube. Such a mistake. NEVER pay this much for lip balm. A few things to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The tin get stuck easily and are sometimes a pain to open.&lt;br /&gt;2. The scents are not that great. One of my friends compared the smell of one of them to her wound medicine.&lt;br /&gt;3. The strawberry scent is the best and quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;4. Very slippery. If you want something thick and luscious, look somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;5. Very shiny. Looks very glossy when you put it on. If you don&#x27;t want shine I recommend a cheaper lip balm by EOS or Nivea - much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is simply not worth the money. There are a million drugstore lip balms that will do the job much better.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I bought the rose bud lip salve, and have been in love with it since. I had a difficult time finding it to reorder, until I looked it up on Amazon. I love all scents. So excited!</li>
    <li> A must have!  Heals dry lips, cuts, soothes cuticles, helps with dry skin patches. It does it all!</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They smell great, feel luxurious on your lips, look cute, and have a tint of color that is beautiful and natural looking on. I will definitely be buying these again. They also would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> great product just like it was years ago. Nice size tin tub. Love it. Keeps my lips moist and not sticky</li>
    <li> I love this brand and have always purchased them a la cart.  Love how it smooths the lips and adds just a tint of color.  Just make sure to wash your hands before you use it as the tin can can collect bacteria.  highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a good deal, I normally buy this at Sephora but his one is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other lip balm but this is the only one that works.</li>
    <li> I have bought this lip balm many times over the years. Can&#x27;t live without it and use it every night at bedtime. This was a super deal and I got three so I will not be reordering for some time.</li>
    <li> My Need:I have extremely dry skin (lips and hands). I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of lip balms, chap sticks, etc. and have found nothing to really help. A friend of my used the original Rosebud Salve lip balm and let me try it. I haven&#x27;t turned back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Variety: I enjoyed getting three different kinds of these to keep in different places and use it whenever I need it. I will say that I use the regular Rosebud lip balm much more than the other two (strawberry and salve) simply because of the peppermint flavor or the original lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Quality: This stuff is top notch. I have been using solely the original lip balm for a month straight on both my hands and cuticles (up to 10 times a day) and it seems as though this container is bottomless! My lips feel moisturized and my cuticles and hands have never looked this good in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order Accuracy: I have seen someone people complain about ordering this product and getting something completely different than what is pictured, however my order was fulfilled exactly like it states.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Pleasant scent. Feels great on dry lips and skin. Thank you. No wonder it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
    <li> The lip balms themselves are probably okay, but this needs some serious packaging/quality control. When I got it, one side of the tint was heavily dented in. I went on to open the lid and when the lip balms fell out i felt something sticky. The lip balms have leaked out making the whole tint greasy and sticky. The lip balms that I dumped out left big areas of stains on my bed sheet. The inside of the tint, the lip balms, my hands and everywhere were greasy with the pink sticky contents. Too lazy to go through the trouble of returning so I&#x27;m just going to keep it, but amazon really needs better quality control.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have to say I was a little reluctant to buy it because of the price, however, it was well worth it. From the moment I tried this product on, I knew it was different. It has made my lips so soft, plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling sticky whenever I put on this lip balm. Also, all three lip balms smell fantastic, and are not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> Pretty. Love the strawberry ones while hate the mint one.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I love these! My family has bought these for years. The price is also very good, so I bought 2.</li>
    <li> Love the original, the strawberry goes on with less shine.  Cute tin that I use for safety pins.</li>
    <li> I am overly obsessed with lip balm. I bought these at a boutique in my town and spent a LOT more than what Amazon was charging. When I ran out, I thought to check Amazon to see if I could re-order. I was super impressed, mostly because it was SO MUCH CHEAPER. Very happy customer. Will buy again. Also, these make great stocking stuffers!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only heard good things about these lip balms, even before seeing the amazon reviews for them here!&lt;br /&gt;I originally just wanted just the strawberry one but this was such a good deal, I grabbed it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for a few weeks now and I love love LOVE the strawberry one. The Mint rose is also nice. I am not a big fan of the rose but figure I will use it eventually. I&#x27;m just not a floral scent fan. I&#x27;m a fruity gal~&lt;br /&gt;The tin are all easy to open.. except the strawberry one for some off reason. I struggle with it here and there but it&#x27;s worth it for the delicious buttery sweet lips I get from it!&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with chapped lips most of my life and this is a sure fave. I like the lanolin oil in it is the trick c;&lt;br /&gt;I will def be back for more, and to try other flavors!</li>
    <li> These are great. At places like Sephora, the original sells for about $6, so its a really good price. Makes for a great gift to others as well as yourself.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money especially since it&#x27;s on sale!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! My tins all arrived undamaged. The mint one seems to have a less solid consistency than the over two, and it&#x27;s difficult to get the lid off at times. My four year old is just as in love with these balms as I am - we are fans for life!</li>
    <li> Most flavorful and luxurious lip balm my family has ever tried.</li>
    <li> I love this balm.  I use it at night and it keeps my lips nice and not chapped.  Plus, it smells nice.  Only issues with these tins is that they can be a pain to open.  Not all of them, just some.  Who knows.  But, once you get in, it is fantastic balm!  Sometimes, I put a little on my elbows if they get dry and it seems to help.</li>
    <li> I received this order today, and it is exactly as the photo shows. The balms are wonderful, all three smell great. The tin I&#x27;ll use to store things, it is attractive enough to keep out on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This package has 3 lip balms and are good quality. The strawberry one smells so sweet but it tastes really weird when it sometimes get into my mouth accidentally. Anyway they sell for $7 for each in Sephora stores so I would say it&#x27;s really a good deal.</li>
    <li> Ive got nothing against the lip balm itself, but i must have received a bad batch. The big tin can was dented, but that didn&#x27;t bother me too much. However, inner balm cans were all greasy because they had spilled out of the cans. It seems to have been stored at high temps and on its side. They were impossible to open. I was able to open one with a knife and I left it in my desk slightly opened. I&#x27;m not going to be able to use them on the go. All the sadness.</li>
    <li> It is the best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Products are really good! I received these yesterday and used Minted Rose Lip Balm and pretty surprised to see that it actually helps your lips remain moisturized. I had also used the product on my way home from the gym and pretty much slept on it. In the morning, my lips were still moisturized and soft. I haven&#x27;t put it on since I woke up about two hours ago (wrote this at 9:00AM) and my lips are still good! Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fedex should at least deliver the packages better. They just threw the box on my front door. Nt very please with their service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, very pleased with these and might order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love all three of these. It&#x27;s a very good value on Amazon, I&#x27;ve seen them sold for $6-7 each. They smell great and moisturize without having to reapply all day. Love these!</li>
    <li> I used to have the strawberry lip balm when I was a teenager and it lasted a very long time. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other lip balms since then and I missed the fresh strawberry smell and how well it moisturizes. I used to keep a tin in my purse in the winter and kept it in the fridge in the summer. I forgot the name of this product and looked for it in stores, knowing I&#x27;d recognize it if I saw it and found it on the internet. The Rosebud Perfume Co. website was down so I was very excited to find it on Amazon from this seller with 2 other tins I haven&#x27;t tried before! I love the minted rose, very refreshing. I found out from reading various notes on the internet that the Rosebud Salve is their number one seller and a best kept beauty secret, I use it as a blush and on my brows for a soft rosey glow. My favorite thing about the strawberry salve is that it&#x27;s exactly the same as I remember! They should last me a good long time but at least now I know where to get it when I run out.</li>
    <li> SO MUCH lip gloss haha I&#x27;m still on the first tin and barely made a dent in it. The packaging is really cute and i love that they are all stored away in a larger tin. It is creamy and smooth. Def great purchase- bang for your buck with the amount you get!</li>
    <li> It came to me melted since it&#x27;s hot where I am, but I just left it in the fridge to firm up again.  The balm works very well.  The only bad thing about it is that one of the balms wouldn&#x27;t open and I had to pry it open and leave the lid off of it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is in love with these and uses them daily. She had chronic chapped lips for over 4 years (since her pregnancy), and the lip balms fixed the problem. She has tried carmex, burts bees, EOS, and some others. These are the only ones that have corrected the issues. As long as she uses them 2-3 times a day, her lips are in perfect condition. I think the minted rose is her favorite.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite care for the Strawberry or Minted Rose (the Minted Rose being my least favorite of all the salves I have tried), but the regular Rosebud Salve is always nice, no matter what brand.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this tin with all 3 flavor.  Instead, just buy the regular Rosebud flavor on its own or try my two favorites of all the salves I&#x27;ve tried: Apple Rose Salve by CO Bigelow (very hard to find now and expensive when you do) or Smith&#x27;s Menthol and Eucalyptus Balm.</li>
    <li> Just seems like Vaseline , won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Good item.fast shipping,delivery on time.I like it .I will recomand the item to my relative .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple of sets for myself and several as gifts for others.  I love and swear by the the Rosebud and Rosebud mint.  It&#x27;s the best value set i&#x27;ve ran across.</li>
    <li> My favorite long-lasting lip gloss at a great price!  The only problem was that the lids on these tins are way too tight making it very difficult to get them open.</li>
    <li> I love this product,so it hurts me to give it 3 stars. Let me explain......the product in the jars are a 5 stars but the jar it self trying to open it....GOOD LUCK. It is the worst to open and get the product to use it. So that is why I gave it a 3 stars. But is smells amazing and it makes my lips feeling wonderful. Guys if you are reading this review please do somthing about the jar(maybe a twist off top), because the jar is not user friendly.</li>
    <li> Love it! but have a problem opening one of the lids on the tins, waaay too tight</li>
    <li> Love all three salves included! Very moisturizing. The strawberry is my favorite...put it on at bedtime and wake up with smooth soft lips!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! I used one tin before, and I like the smell and it moisturizers very well.  It&#x27;s not expensive as some big brand, but the performance is very good. I recalled that once I put it on the heating radiator occasionally in a winter and finally found the lip balm melt into a fresh watermelon color liquid when I remembered to get it off there. When the temperature down, it became to the original status. That thing makes me love the lip balm more because the ingredient seems safety and harmless to us.</li>
    <li> Good value, considering there are the three different balms and the Smith&#x27;s brand is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;The Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is softly floral scented and a bit firmer in texture than that &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; rose salve. The strawberry balm is just that in flavor and smell. The minted rose is a nice twist on the traditional rosebud scent and is (in my opinion) the best of the three as the peppermint oil is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I like to carry just one all-purpose item in my purse and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use any of the three on my hands or wherever needed.&lt;br /&gt;This would make an excellent gift for any lip balm junkies!</li>
    <li> These are some of the best balms I&#x27;ve tried. And the tin is so cute!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, Cute little tins.  Worth the money?  Vaseline is cheaper, does the same job and lasts longer on application.</li>
    <li> bought this and shared with a coworker. the rosemary mint is my fav! strawberry doesnt really taste like strawberry. plain is plain. they are all really moisturizing. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of the original Rosebud salve but when I saw this 3 pack I decided it was worth a try.  Especially because of the cute tin, which is basically &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; to me since the salves cost around five bucks apiece normally.  I see a lot of the reviews mention products that were received leaking, melted, or otherwise damaged and a dented tin.  I experienced nothing of the sort.  All of mine was in perfect condition including the tin which holds the three containers of salve.  The tin itself had very secure packaging as did each individual salve.  I adore the original and the minted rose.  I&#x27;m not as crazy about the strawberry version myself, but it is all right.  I will use it more as lip gloss.  I use the other 2 products for a wide variety of things including moisturizing while on the go.  I love these unique products and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll keep the cute squarish tin for years to come, too.</li>
    <li> I love 3 will last me a long time, and I love the container it comes in!</li>
    <li> The strawberry smells so good ,and it makes my lip really soft and smooth,i love it,and i will buy it again</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is a nice way to try three different versions that I never would have tried otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and all its scents. My favorite is the strawberry. It smells like strawberry short cake. Not to mention the product does a great job on my lips. The salve is great for chapped hands, too!</li>
    <li> This leaves you with the softest lips and hints of rose. What&#x27;s not to love. I swear by this product.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite in my family.  I purchased these lip balms to share as gifts, however, and the price made them so affordable we were able to share around to several friends.  The fragrance is appealing, but not so overwhelming as to flavor anything that you eat or drink right.  The balm moisturizes well without leaving a heavy, gooey layer on your lips.</li>
    <li> This lip balm makes your lips feel wonderful! I keep one at my desk, in my purse and close at hand.</li>
    <li> I love these lip glosses, but they arrived all melted to one side except the strawberry. I&#x27;d like to note that it&#x27;s probably not the sellers fault, and that it&#x27;s probably because I ordered these in the middle of the summer. I&#x27;ll be purchasing these again in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of thinking the large jar was filled with gloss - technically it is, but not in the way that I expected it to be. It&#x27;s a cute holder for the other three jars. It&#x27;s not a giant gloss pot :-P</li>
    <li> I love the original and minted. I am not crazy about the strawberry, but its not bad. The original and minted have a smoother texture and smell amazing.  The tins all opened easily and seal well. Love the antique looking tins that they come in! They do not feel tacky or sticky when you wear them as lip balm. Love it for my elbows and cuticles, and keep one at my bedside to use before bed!</li>
    <li> Possibly the best lip balm ever. I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few of these, for me and as gifts. They are my woobie.</li>
    <li> I remember using this product when i was a little kid. I was excited when i saw this online and immediately purchased. The gift tin it came in is great too. Also the fact that 3 cans came means one for home, car, and work!</li>
    <li> so i was expecting to get 3 lip balms just like on the picture they send only 1, what a spam!</li>
    <li> i cant live without the rosebud salve. i usually use it for my lips and occasionally on any  dry spots. i ran out for a while and was dying. not many places near me sell this. i nvr see it in any stores. only once i saw it in bath and body works. so i checked on here and this was the only one on prime. im glad i ordered it and got these three! i nvr knew this company actually made lip balm. i LOVE the strawberry one. it feels just the same as the salve. i dont rly like the mint one but i dont like anything mint so i gave it to my boyfriend. for some reason the mint tin is hard to open but all the others r fine. i definitely recommend this product! esp this one since it comes with 3. u can give some to ur friends or family!</li>
    <li> My parents used Rosebud salve as an all around medicene when we where growing up. It still works on so many different things. Cuts burns chapped lips bits etc.</li>
    <li> These have been on my wish list since I read an amazing review of the lip balms.  This Christmas, my parents splurged and got the set for me! I love all of them - they smell great and they make my lips silky smooth. I&#x27;m using the salve on my dry cuticles and it seems to be helping! Very excited to be putting these in my purse.</li>
    <li> this brand has the best lip balm!!!!!!! all of them are so beautiful! and what&#x27;s more, they are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Arrived on time and was packaged with care. So fresh.</li>
    <li> Great product for my lips and such a great bargain. Usually are $8.00 a piece at other retailers.</li>
    <li> I like it, degree of moisture is very good</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balms! So soft and yummy.</li>
    <li> Great product last a long time!!</li>
    <li> Smooths lips and keeps them moisturized, but needs to be reapplied frequently.  Hard to open tins.</li>
    <li> The actual lip balm is great but how are you supposed to get to the lip balm when the tin is almost impossible to open? I&#x27;ve used this stuff maybe 4-5 times in the year I&#x27;ve had it because I hate messing with the packaging despite adoring the smell and feel of the lip balm.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading reviews, wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but just needed something alittle more appealing, practical and soothing all at once for my lips than what I can get at the local walmart, drug store, grocery store, or mall. Be warned. Try this product at your own risk.... Because You may not be able to live with out it after you&#x27;ve tried it! This is my favorite lip gloss ive ever tried. Don&#x27;t be scared away by the price when compared to the .99 cent chap stick, this stuff is wonderful on a whole other level and worth every last penny. Also the 3 pack was a decent value compared to buying the tins solo. I&#x27;m stuck on the stuff hook, line, and sinker now and am I doomed to having to track down the stuff online everytime I run out now as this is not a product I can buy locally and I can&#x27;t survive with out the stuff. Did I mention it smells nice?</li>
    <li> These are awesome... I&#x27;ve always loved Rosebud Salve, but usually purchase mine from Bath &amp; Body Works. This stuff is identical and I love all three. My daughter won&#x27;t keep her hands off them either. :)</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the stawberry one. But all of them look soft and tender. I want to share this to my friends. I think girls will love it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product my wife loves them. Scottmitchell1811@gmail.com. highly recommend all of there products.</li>
    <li> Got the recommendation from a friend, and I love it. It works very well to prevent drying and have a natural smell of rose/ strawberry.</li>
    <li> So I wanted to like these I did..... But gave them all away.... They all except the strawberry smelled funny to me.... We not a fan at all...... The strawberry had the best smell but yo much wax smell after it was on the lips.... Oh well.....</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a birthday present for a girl friend of mine. We love these lip balms. This is by far the cheapest price that I have found for this product, especialy with Amazon prime shipping. My gift arrived before the expected delivery date. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of my great grandma and great aunt.  It has been around since 1892. It works wonders to moisturize lips or dry chapped skin without adding irritation.  I love all three of the varieties. This is the first time I tried the Mint Rose.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife but 3 year old daughter uses it as well. Truly a step up from other lip balms. Classy packaging just adds to it. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> . . . well, let&#x27;s be honest here.  It works, and it smells nice, and all that.  It&#x27;s scented vaseline, my friends.  Of COURSE it works.  But I have to admit once I realized it&#x27;s basically vaseline . . . I was a little less-impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do the same amazing things for your lips with the 39-ounces-for-$18 vaseline that Amazon sells.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The lip balms smelly great, the packaging is stylish and the balms are so moisturizing . I will be buying another tin for my daughters to share.</li>
    <li> Love the packaging and the product.</li>
    <li> Good products and nice service!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of these balms, the tins are so tight they are difficult to open</li>
    <li> Buy again,I like it.It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> Really cute. Useful, especially overnight</li>
    <li> Sweet relief!  This stuff is not only great on lips, but is wonderful on cuticles too.  Love all the scents, and the nice larger size tin is easy to open. I will never go without this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, even though I did have reservations buying because it&#x27;s petroleum based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. Other reviewers said that the balm doesn&#x27;t last that long, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I put on much less of the rosebud salve than I do of other lip balms, like Burt&#x27;s Bees or Blistex. The salve is especially helpful in the winter months, even on my cheeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the scents; they&#x27;re too light for my liking, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great trio of Rosebud Lip Balm, perfect to have one in the car, gym bag and on the go! Love the varying scents to mix up the traditional rosebud flavor. The price of three is well below retail for buying separate</li>
    <li> The best ever, will always buy</li>
    <li> Love the variety and how these feel.</li>
    <li> Good for moisturizing lips. Mobile saints good. It is practical.</li>
    <li> Usually one Rosebud Salve goes for $6 or more... with this package I was able to save at least $10! It works wonders on my chapped lips. I can use this stuff for anything too, like my hands and cuticles. One pot can last me about a year or so. Definitely worth the investment! I live by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love all three of these. My favorite has to be the mint one but it&#x27;s the most difficult to open. :( still worth it though! If you love lip balms that drench your lips with moisture, these are the ones to get! They definitely repair your lips from cold winter damage, unlike a drying EOS lip balm. I have yet to try anything as heavy duty as these.</li>
    <li> This is by far my most favorite lip balm.  I bought the tin of them a while ago and they are very hydrating and each tin literally seems to last forever.  I think I can get at least a month to a month and a half out of each tin and I use lip balm at an obscenely quick pace.  I recommend these even more than the tubes of the same balm because they seem slightly more hydrating, more cost effective, and the tins seem to last much longer.  I cannot rave enough about this stuff and use it daily alone and over lip stain when I put on makeup.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as I wanted! Provided three lip balms, one that doubles as a salve for other uses. I love the strawberry one, it brings me back to when I used to use it as a child! The scents are amazing. They are long lasting. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love it! Everyone should have one of those ! This brand is my favorite ! Whether the smell or the cover are perfect!</li>
    <li> This product is great for everything. I had my first jar for over 5 years before I ran out. This year I bought some extra&#x27;s for family friends because it is so hard to find it. I am just glad I found it here</li>
    <li> these are a STAPLE item in all of my purses. can&#x27;t go anywhere without them. Love that they have multiple uses.</li>
    <li> I research everything that I buy and spend a lot of time doing so. I found out that this was the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; lip balm to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have no doubts. All three products last for a very long time and moisturizer fantastically. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The BEST lip balm ever. Great price, smells good, TONS of product in the tins! 5 times more than any other lip product, cute packaging.. and most importantly: IT WORKS. Leaves your lips feeling soft/smooth every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie so I was happy to get 3 of these lip balms in one cute tin for a decent price.  The original Rosebud Salve (kept in my bag) is by far superior to the others, it&#x27;s even great on my cuticles.  The Minted Rose (kept in my bathroom) is not as moisturizing (my lips require a lot of tlc in winter) but perhaps it will be less of an issue in warmer weather.  The Strawberry (kept next to my bed) has a lovely flavor but next to the Original Salve, it&#x27;s hard to consider it a real staple - I think it&#x27;s actually perfect for a little girl because they may enjoy the flavor without being fussed about moisturized lips.  If I purchase again I will give away 2 as gifts, Only wish they had three Rosebud Salve in one tin as well.</li>
    <li> These smell great and look super cute in the tins, however, they are literally just petroleum jelly and perfume. They have no special ingredients that make them a unique product to test out. I went through a crazy phase trying to find the best lip balm and was super excited to try these before I realized they were just petroleum jelly. Which I already have. If you&#x27;re just looking for something cute and easy to carry in your purse, these are great, except opening the tins can be a pain with short nails If you&#x27;re looking for a good product for your lips, save you money and try a regular bottle of petroleum jelly first.</li>
    <li> Rosebud balms are phenomenal. They are highly moisturizing, wear a long time, and can be used on cuticles, elbows, and anywhere else you need a little moisture. I have been known to use a tiny bit of Rosebud salve to smooth out flyaways in a pinch. Worth noting is that for the price, you get a huge amount of product that will last you a long time. I&#x27;ve had tins of this stuff last a year even with daily use. Plus, the giant tin means I&#x27;m less likely to lose them somewhere in my house or drop them on the ground and not notice (which tends to be how I part with my lip balm tubes). The smell is great too, I love the original and Strawberry the most.</li>
    <li> I liked it but I was looking for a chapstick/lip balm that wasn&#x27;t glossy. These we&#x27;re all glossy and I was disappointed in that. But over all it was ok and applied well</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and have purchased it in the past whenever I would find it in some random store but I bought it this time through the mail in the middle of summer. which was a big mistake on my part because the salve was all melted and seeping out of the tins when I got it.So take my advice and don&#x27;t order until the outside temp is below at least 75F. other then that I would have given this product five stars but I did notice that the tins are getting harder to open which is annoying I think next time I&#x27;ll order the tubes although I would prefer a working tin.</li>
    <li> The salve works great and works great on cuticles, which is what I purchased it for.  I am not in love with the lip balm.  Cans are tricky to open.  I will look to see if this product comes in a tube or squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating cause the package was perfect and received it very quickly and in perfect condition. My mother used it on me I used it on my children and now on me and my grandchildren. It was a joy to find this product in Amazon thank you so much for the service I received . I was so happy with it my daughters received one each from me that I also ordered from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. 3 different tins inside the big tin. The Minted Rose is my fav. This product came up on a search for best products for chapped lips, and I can see why! I have to apply it a lot less frequently than the chapstick I had been using.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it came in a super cute tin container. My favorite as to be the strawberry. It smells great but not so strong that it overwhelms. My least favorite has to be the Minted Rose, it gives off a strong medicinal smell. The balm is nicely textured so that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily when applied or make my lips look like I smeared oil over the.</li>
    <li> Rosebud salve comes to rescue your lips, cuticles and your cracked back of the foot!!! lol.&lt;br /&gt;After using the salve with miraculous results, I decided to purchase the 3-pack with the lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;Lip balms are just as great as the salve, only tastier ;P, smells better, and a tiny bit glossier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect gift for bridal shower!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got cracked, dry lips like mine, this product is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot of color but wants color on cracked lips.&lt;br /&gt;This will last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.&lt;br /&gt;Tryit, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> The consistency is amazing and makes your lips feel hydrated.  Super shine makes it awesome to wear along or on top of lipstick.  Best lip product out there.</li>
    <li> This is the very first time I use Rosebud lip balm and it works perfectly, no more flaky lips!  I usually apply it before going to bed and before applying lipstick. I like strawberry flavor the best, the other two is ok.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, and have had trouble your whole life with chapped lips, summer or winter, buy Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Lip Balm NOW!!!  Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.  I have never had a product actually Treat my chapped lips, not just make them smoother for a little while.  I can put this on in the morning and it is still working at night, with no re-application.  It&#x27;s even worked over-night, if I haven&#x27;t licked or rubbed too much off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found this product decades ago, and saved my pooor lips from years of torture!  I love the scent and the taste.  So far, I only have used the Rosebud, but want to try the other formulas as well.  And, I am going to make sure that I am never without this product again.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have problem chapped lips, RUN to buy this product!!!  I have never endorsed another product of any kind so strongly.&lt;br /&gt;The Rosebud balm does tint the lips with a tinge of lovely rose, so another of the Smith&#x27;s may be better for a male needing a fantastic lip balm, and doesn&#x27;t want to look like he&#x27;s wearing lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Smith&#x27;s Company for making the best product, in any catagory, that I have purchased this year!!!</li>
    <li> I buy these as gifts for people of all ages all the time--people love them. i have given them several times and have never had a complaint--everyone has been really happy with them</li>
    <li> This was a great set and a great value the three lip balms that were included were all nice and very moisterizing and helped keep my lips from cracking. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love these! They arrived in perfect condition and the lip balms are super moisturizing.  The minted rose is my favorite. It will take me forever to use these up but when I do I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, but only because I have bought the same for myself. The only caveat I have for it is: in hot weather, it&#x27;s not a good item to put into your purse and leave in the car---it will melt and shift. Easily corrected; I have put one in a frying pan on Low heat for just a short span of time, then turned off the burner, and it reverted to its smooth, level form. It they make this in a tube, that would be fantastic for purses. When you&#x27;ve had it for a long time, it can get more difficult to pull the lid off---probably solvable by a good cleaning around the rim(s). I love it enough to buy it even when I know of these minor issues. When a product has survived in the marketplace for as long as this one has, there is usually a reason.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for all 3 wonderful lip balms!!!</li>
    <li> Great value ! Really effective product!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed at the packaging of this 3 seemingly awesome lip balm; the square tin/container came dented.. Not good to go as a gift. Have not tried the product, looks larger than i thought so it&#x27;s a surprise, read lots of good reviews so am hoping it can compensate my disappointment with the poor packaging.</li>
    <li> I have only been able to open one of these the other two are seeming like they will never open. The one that did open has saved my lips the regular rosebud. I was using blistex medicated lip balm in the blue tiny jar but was still suffering from chapped lips. I use this almost every night and I makes my lips extremely smooth and soft and not to mention chap free. But also what I love most is how I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and I&#x27;m not even half way through it. So its the total package even if only one of them opens.</li>
    <li> Simply put this is a great product period. A real balm. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve always used the rose flavor. I use it every single night before I go to bed. It&#x27;s such a treat. And it lasts forever. But now, I just fell in love with the strawberry flavor too! These are the best lipglosses ever!</li>
    <li> Delivered  really fast. Im so obsessed with this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love the balms, however try as I may, I can&#x27;t open the rose mint one.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and I was very pleased when I received them and started using this. It provides a nice shiny glow on my lips and it moisturizes my lips. I also like the rosebud fragrance. I often use this for my dry hands as well, as it moisturizes and makes my hands so soft. Over time as I used this more I noticed that the effects did not last as long as I would have liked. I have to keep reapplying the salve on my lips several times throughout the day to keep my lips moisturized and soft. I suppose this is the same with any lip balm product. Overall, this is a great product and it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Good buy for the amount of contents.</li>
    <li> Looking for a salve to replace my favorite which seems to have disappeared from the market. Rosebud is fine, nice scent, like the bigger tin.</li>
    <li> Delightful. Just what I wanted to carry in my purse...so much nicer than a stick lip balm (not waxey at all). I love the old-fashioned tins also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve barely used two of these, since one pot lasts for.ev.er. but I have loved this brand for years. I always got the regular rose salve but I wanted to try something different, and it turns out you really can&#x27;t go wrong. The Rose salve is great for everything, too, not just as a lip balm. I use mine for dry skin, tattoo care, rashes, even a little perfume. It seems expensive but it is absolutely worth it. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Bought these for a stocking stuffer because I love this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Love the lip balms! A cure for my dry lips!</li>
    <li> I love these. Very good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought these after I read about the rosebud salve in an article. Nowadays I just assume a product such as this is petroleum free. Nope. Sure it gives a nice shine on lips but I have petroleum free products who do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms. The strawberry especially smells fantastic, and the minted rose gives a nice minty tingle to my lips. Worth every penny! I always have one of these with me at all times :)</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference in your lips in just one day. Leaves them incredibly soft and the scent isn&#x27;t strong like other products.  After trying plenty of products, I&#x27;m finally using the right product on my dry-and-always-in-need-of-moisture lips.</li>
    <li> 3 salves for this price is amazing! I&#x27;m going to be using these for one of my bridesmaids gifts!</li>
    <li> My mother purchased this for me for my birthday. I read reviews of people getting sent the wrong product or this being a fake but it is authentic! Great steal for the Rosebud salves tend to cost 6-9 dollars at most Beauty supply stores. The strawberry one is my favorite and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or a strong vulgar smell. The regular Rosebud salve works amazing for anything you need it for! Definitely try this product out if you are hesitant.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these in all the local drug stores in town with no luck. I was happy to find it here. Great quality...just as I remembered...and a great price!</li>
