      <li>I don&#x27;t think its fair for this item to be called &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This is my 3 rd bottle I love it and at a great price</li>
      <li>I purchased this perfume for my aunt (it is her absolute favorite) and she loved it!  </li>
      <li>Ok product.</li>
      <li>So refreshing.</li>
      <li>but this is NOT the Perry Ellis America that we all know and love.  </li>
      <li>I received this as a Christmas gift some time ago, and having never seen it before, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it is quite lovely.</li>
      <li>It is a floral scent, but it&#x27;s not at all overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I have never smelled anything as lovely as this.</li>
      <li>it smells like perfume, with too many additives that make it too strong for summer.</li>
      <li>This company ships super fast and has great price.</li>
      <li>It is very offensive and strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.  </li>

<li> She has been using this perfume for as long as I can remember.  </li>
<li> and I love it, though it is difficult to find lately.  </li>
<li> Is a poor imitation of the original fragrance, it smells horrible, I&#x27;ve never been able to use it, the smell gives me a headache, do not waste your money buying this crap perfume.</li>
<li> I received this directly from Amazon LLC and it was a fake.</li>
<li> so not sure if Perri Ellis changed the formula or the product is not original.</li>
<li> I usually wear it during the day, but have worn it at night as well.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s false advertisement.  </li>
<li> It is a fake.</li>
<li> I had my doubts because after reading the reviews I was afraid that I was going to get a fake.  </li>
<li> but it almost made me sick on my way to work this morning.  </li>

    <li> Ok product. Scent is different than the original I had in the 90&#x27;s so not sure if Perri Ellis changed the formula or the product is not original. Looks legitimate though</li>

    <li> This is my 3 rd bottle I love it and at a great price</li>
    <li> Smells like hair spray. It is a fake. I use to wear it. Is not the same, trust me. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Please so not spend your money on this item.  I know it is a lot of mixed reviews on here but this is NOT the Perry Ellis America that we all know and love.  I tried to make it work but it almost made me sick on my way to work this morning.  It is very offensive and strong and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.  I don&#x27;t think its fair for this item to be called &amp;#34; America&amp;#34; and it is clearly an off brand.  That&#x27;s false advertisement.  I am very upset with amazon right now because I can not return it but I will just chalk it up as a loss.</li>
    <li> I received this directly from Amazon LLC and it was a fake. Just tinted water. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!</li>
    <li> Is a poor imitation of the original fragrance, it smells horrible, I&#x27;ve never been able to use it, the smell gives me a headache, do not waste your money buying this crap perfume.</li>
    <li> Exactley what I needed.  Would order from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> perfect........my neice loves this perfume and was so happy i found it for so cheap thanks so much for that</li>
    <li> it smells like perfume, with too many additives that make it too strong for summer. I gave it away immediately upon smelling it.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I will buy. I have never smelled anything as lovely as this. It will last me ALL day and you only need a tiny bit. I get compliments all the time!</li>
