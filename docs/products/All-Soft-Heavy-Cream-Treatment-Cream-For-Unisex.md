      <li>My daughters hair is very coarse and it feels very soft after using this product.</li>

<li> I thought this product would be another in the long line of experiments that failed to live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I was impressed...more so than any other product I can think of in the last few years.</li>
<li> then with whatever product you have left on your hands, run it through the scalp, which should need considerably less.</li>

<li> I expected to receive redken w avocado oil and received redken w argan oil.</li>
<li> That was disappointing because I was really excited to try the avocado oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the same product. I expected to receive redken w avocado oil and received redken w argan oil.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a haircut in a year and highlight my hair every few months. I have only used this product twice and it&#x27;s made a big difference for me. It&#x27;s super rich and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a huge Kerastase Masqueintense fan. But it was really pricey. Happy I found something to replace it that works just as well.</li>
    <li> Order item in Avacado, as Advertised, came in Olive Oil. Was Mis-Advertised!!&lt;br /&gt;Had to return.</li>
    <li> This product is good at conditioning without adding heaviness to the hair. Able to comb through it, which is a plus and it rinses clean. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews and had a good dose of skepticism. As a naturally curly/wavy caucasian girl with thinning long hair and a mix of normal and fine strands with a smattering of gray, my hair is touchy - I almost never apply heat or styling appliances and when I do, I use heating protectorant sprays. I also color the roots to catch the new gray about every 2 months and do one salon overall color once every year or two to even out the color. I only use a wood or horn comb, treat my ends almost nightly with varying oils, and try try try to increase length. I avoid sulfectants, alcohol based mousse/hairsprays, stay away from dimethicones and I shampoo only at the roots. I deep condition every week using varying products which all say they work but in reality, often have little long term improvement. I thought this product would be another in the long line of experiments that failed to live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I was impressed...more so than any other product I can think of in the last few years. I always leave conditioner on longer than recommended....this I am leaving on an hour uncovered. Upon first use, the entire hair shaft was much improved, even my straw like ends. Repeated uses have only continued the improvement. My natural texture will never be &#x27;smooth and silky&#x27; but I am no longer fretting over the ends like I used to. I finally feel like I have a real tool in my battle to improve my hair quality and continue growing it longer. This is the first Redken product I have ever tried and I am now looking at the rest of the line as a potential life line.</li>
    <li> of all the expensive hair products i&#x27;ve purchased, this one is the only one that makes a difference to my hair. but i&#x27;m still trying to figure out if it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love to use this product. I have fine wavy hair, and put it in my hair after showering while it is still wet. It acts as a detangler so I can brush it while wet, and when my hair drys it is sooooo soft! Great product and lasts a long time so worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.  However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)</li>
    <li> Redken All Soft Heavy Cream is the best Redken treatment of the entire Redken line. I luv all the Redken lines. Each of the lines are for different hair issues. All soft is universal. We all get dry, damaged, brittle, and dull hair. This product is the best for all those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I luv the fact it has avocado oil in it. Avocado oil is the best oil for dry-damaged hair. It smells great. After leaving it in my dry-damaged hair for about 1-hr with a plastic cap, my hair is soft, manageable, silky, and 90% less breakage occurs when I comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REDKEN Lines are some of the best hair care product on the market. Its in every high end hair salon. Its simply one of the best. My favorite is the all soft line. Its best to use the shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment together for the best results.</li>
    <li> So I have used the Redken All Soft Heavy Cream with Argan oil and decided to purchase the one with avocado oil since I had started using avocado oil on my scalp, and it was working wonders for my hair. Well, I ordered this product, with Avocado Oil, mind you, but when I got my package, lo and behold, it was my ol&#x27; trusty Redken All Soft Heavy Cream with Argan Oil. So they sent my a product that was different than the advertised product. That was disappointing because I was really excited to try the avocado oil. Therefore, I give it 2 stars. It could be 5 star worthy, but I don&#x27;t know because I didn&#x27;t get the correct product.</li>
    <li> Does all it promised for me. My hair is so soft and still managable, holds curl. Will recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I always use redken products. This time I placed order three of these and just noticed that one of these are pretty waterlly than usually.</li>
    <li> This heavy cream is the best conditioner ever! I have curly coarse hair and I also relax my hair (Black American). The conditioner makes my hair so soft and full of life. A couple of months ago i had a lapse in judgment and decided to try a different product with keratin in it and it completely fried my hair. I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair and it felt like straw. Finally after about a couple of months I wised up to the fact that the new shampoo and conditioner was causing the problem with my hair. So with my hair heavily damaged I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner again to see if it could repair my damaged hair and I&#x27;m so happy. My hair is soft again and very healthy. I can run my fingers through it again. I will never try a different product because nothing works as well as this and it smells really good. I shampoo and condition in the shower and I leave this product on my hair for about 15 mins. Also use the the shampoo with this product for best results. My daughters hair is very coarse and it feels very soft after using this product.</li>
    <li> I received this product a few weeks ago.  I wash my hair every other day, sometimes two days without shampooing at the most, as it is best for your hair.  The very first time I&#x27;ve used it my hair looked and felt INCREDIBLE.  Soft, smooth and very manageable.  I have long, straight, chemically treated hair (dyed blonde from dark brown, so lots is done to it.  Although it isn&#x27;t damaged I guess you can say there&#x27;s that typical fee associated with bleaching your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time used, my hair hasn&#x27;t had the same exact feel afterwards.  Note that I don&#x27;t leave the product in for longer than maybe 10 minutes.  I simply don&#x27;t have the time to put it in my hair and walk around for 45 minutes, but still it gets the tangles out.  I think I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that although I don&#x27;t use the product every day it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the first time I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair tends to get &amp;#34;chemical build up&amp;#34; quickly it seems.  So, the bottom line is that I have to alternate this Redken product with other conditioners in order for my hair not to get too used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  This conditioner can get kind of heavy on the hair.  Use as little as you can and massage it well into the end of the hair first.  Really lather it and then with whatever product you have left on your hands, run it through the scalp, which should need considerably less.</li>
    <li> Company  was good to deal with and delivered fast but I didnt know Redken changed this product.I love the original kind so much better. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner, it makes my hair so soft.  i do not use it all the time only when I take a longer shower.</li>
    <li> This is not what I order! I order the avocado heavy cream! That&#x27;s even how they advertise it but instead they sent me the argon oil one. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Amazing Results for bleached damaged hair!</li>
    <li> all Redken rocks. i trust my hair to all of their products. this leaves hair silky soft for days</li>
    <li> Amazing product ... Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive. Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy. Excellent choose. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> i have used this conditioner for several years and because of cost i&#x27;ve tried to find others. i always come back to this one, though, because it conditions the best. i have very fine, wavy hair that is weighed down easily, but this product doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my hair (as i&#x27;ve seen other reviewers note). i have very light highlights over most of my hair and it tends to dry out and break if i don&#x27;t use this and i always get comments from my hairstylist that my hair looks &amp;#34;too healthy&amp;#34; given the processing she puts it through.</li>
    <li> They messed with the formula.  Sigh.  Why do they do this?  I&#x27;ve been duped into buying a product that&#x27;s nowhere near as good as the old one.  It&#x27;s adequate but no longer my go-to conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it in the shower after shampooing (Redken All Soft shampoo) my hair and leave it on for about 5 minutes. I rinse it out and then use the Redken All Soft conditioner and my hair feels so soft after using. I will definitely by this product again! The delivery was also speedy and got here before the deadline.</li>
    <li> I LOVED it. I have extremely damaged hair and have tried sooooo many different products. I used it for the first time this week and left on for 30 minutes, my hair is so much softer and manageable. I am excited to keep using to see the difference it will make!! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Works great on my dry curly hair as well as keeps my beard moisturized. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Very thick. I&#x27;d say this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and this time around I really destroyed my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for hair that has been colored and just a dime full makes your hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo and regular conditioner better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. To me it&#x27;s a bit overpriced. But works well!</li>
    <li> Iam addicted to this. I have very thick, wavy waist length hair that needs some help. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I wash and condition my hair. I only use a quarter size and smooth it thru the shaft of my hair and then a little on top. My comb sails right thru it and I have to use leave in conditioners to get the comb thru it. After my hair dries and I brush it my hair has so much body and softness!  Highly recommend this. I love it</li>
    <li> It made my hair super soft. That&#x27;s really all I can say. But they made me add eight more words.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week , totally makes my curls soft &amp; transforms it when I need extra love. My hair will be dry &amp; ugh then I use this &amp; its wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have, as I live in a dry climate and have fine, color-treated hair. It comes in at about $5 less than the average beauty supply store as well.  Massage well into the ends of hair, and use up to the roots for easy comb through --which is usually a big problem with me.</li>
