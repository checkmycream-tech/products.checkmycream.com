      <li>I get great comments on my nails all the time when I wear this</li>
      <li>good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Very cheap but great quality</li>
      <li>These nails are a great bargain and are very affordable!</li>
      <li>I do wish the sizes matched up better will my nails.</li>
      <li>Great color and very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>on&amp;#34; sticky strips (for a lack of a better description).</li>
      <li>sticky tabs are not as strong as the glue on nails.</li>
      <li>Very nice nails, very natural looking, good fit, but the color is not burgundy/dark red as pictured.  </li>
      <li>These were extremely cheap, the price reflects the product.</li>
      <li>I received one pack of hand painted nails and one pack of the chip free.</li>
      <li>I got 2 packages, which with my nails equals out to 4 full sets.</li>
      <li>I have tried several different nail product and Kiss is the best quality and look!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise fine product - beautiful color but the size ranges were not as useful for me as I would have liked (not enough smaller sizes, and there is a big curve on these).</li>
      <li>Chip prof is always a plus because they still look great after a few days.</li>
      <li>n tear...use very gently.</li>
      <li>I have on the first pair that I received two weeks ago.</li>
      <li>More of a brownish red.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried another brand so can only say I am quite satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Use these exactly as directed and they will wear 5-7 days.  </li>
      <li>They are very durable and look just like real nails.</li>
      <li>Absolutely like these nails.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I give them high review.</li>
      <li>Kiss makes the most durable nails, much better than other DIY brands which either are very fragile or too thick.</li>
      <li>Just wanted to let others know, because it isn&#x27;t clear from the description or box.</li>
      <li>I believe the seller may be getting rid of old stock??</li>
      <li>As others have said they look really natural and they are extremely durable - with the right glue of course.</li>
      <li>These were pretty but even at the short length they were a little too long.</li>

<ol>
    <li> excellent as always...thanx</li>
    <li> good quality for the price. Sturdy but this did NOT come with nail glue nor &amp;#34;press on&amp;#34; sticky strips (for a lack of a better description).</li>
    <li> Not what I expected very thin</li>
    <li> I personally hate paying $75 for a nail job, $50 is still to much. These are great, they stay on. I give them high review.</li>
    <li> I have some physical issues and cannot always make it to the nail salon. I use standard nail glue and they stay on for just over a week.</li>
    <li> Absolutely like these nails. As others have said they look really natural and they are extremely durable - with the right glue of course. Glue or adhesive not included with nails. I received a compliment when I had them on.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different nail product and Kiss is the best quality and look!  I get great comments on my nails all the time when I wear this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;S. Caroline Bolden</li>
    <li> No complaints. Almost a week on with no chips, no cracks. Great color and very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking. I have received several compliments.</li>
    <li> Use these exactly as directed and they will wear 5-7 days.  Best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> These were extremely cheap, the price reflects the product. I received one pack of hand painted nails and one pack of the chip free. I believe the seller may be getting rid of old stock?? Either way each only lasted a few days, these are not for everyday wear n tear...use very gently. Since they were 37 cents when I bought them I will consider this a lesson learned.</li>
    <li> These nails are a great bargain and are very affordable! I have on the first pair that I received two weeks ago. They are very durable and look just like real nails. I would recommend them and will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> Very cheap but great quality I got 2 packages, which with my nails equals out to 4 full sets. Chip prof is always a plus because they still look great after a few days. Mine stayed on for 12 days!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it.  Had to buy glue . . . kept popping off.</li>
    <li> I didnt realize no glue came with these.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Very nice nails, very natural looking, good fit, but the color is not burgundy/dark red as pictured.  More of a brownish red.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried another brand so can only say I am quite satisfied.  I do wish the sizes matched up better will my nails.</li>
    <li> These were pretty but even at the short length they were a little too long. Love the color. sticky tabs are not as strong as the glue on nails.</li>
    <li> great price, the color is great too. lasts longer than expected</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loves the nails.</li>
    <li> NO GLUE OR PRESS-ON TABS INCLUDED. Just wanted to let others know, because it isn&#x27;t clear from the description or box. Not a deal-breaker but I wish I would have known ahead of time that I&#x27;d have to make a trip to the beauty supply store to buy press-on tabs additionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise fine product - beautiful color but the size ranges were not as useful for me as I would have liked (not enough smaller sizes, and there is a big curve on these).</li>
    <li> Kiss makes the most durable nails, much better than other DIY brands which either are very fragile or too thick.</li>
