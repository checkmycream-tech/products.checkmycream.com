      <li>My husband favorite, shampoos.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Both economical and good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The moisturizers helps condition the hair, leaving it manageable and looking healthy.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband and he love it.</li>
      <li>Shelf space is a valuable commodity--and that space is literally up for sale in many stores.</li>
      <li>He says this one smells better.</li>
      <li>you love the smell I even use it :)</li>
      <li>Leaves his hair more moist and is faster since is 2 in 1.</li>
      <li>What more could you want from a shampoo?  </li>
      <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering, and a nice clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>It smells nice and leaves his hair clean.  </li>
      <li>Super refreshing!</li>
      <li>and we both liked the original scent as well as the clean rinsing performance in this no hassle one product shampoo and conditioned.  </li>
      <li>Very light yet manly in a clean, almost citrusy way.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo leaves his hair - and beard and mustaches - clean and soft with nice body and no unpleasant odor or taste (when kissing his beard LOL).</li>
      <li>No, the scent is much more natural, light and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It also rinses easily unlike under 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner combinations.  </li>
      <li>Seems to keep my hair and scalp clean and healthy.  </li>
      <li>The men in my family strongly prefer 2 in 1 shampoos to messing with conditioner.</li>
      <li>It is a nice fresh light scent.</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
      <li>B000TMM2PU Nioxin System 2 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Thinning Hair Duo 33.8 oz]].  </li>
      <li>We will purchase this Alpine Fresh again because we do love the smell.</li>
      <li>Suave is a great value for a low price!  </li>
      <li>He was happy to try this Suave because it&#x27;s cheaper and our local big-box store carries it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(packaging may vary)]], just because it was available in Costco.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I love this Alpine Fresh scent on my husband.</li>
      <li>Very nice; I will definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>In general, I have had really good experience with Suave men&#x27;s shampoo.  </li>
      <li>In fact, the scent dissipates fairly quickly, which is fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am aware that many men are concerned about conditioners that are too weighty.</li>
      <li>And, it rinses clean with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a very good haircare product, lathers up good, cleans good and washes out without any residue left behind and leaves my hair just right.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; aspect is spot-on, but what I&#x27;m really smelling in this scent is much more like berries and fruit.  </li>
      <li>You could spend a fortune on much hyped brands and not get any better than Suave Professionals Men 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>The Alpine Fresh scent is cooling with some light citrus notes.  </li>
      <li>I feel my hair clean and with adequate smoothness.</li>
      <li>In 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Alpine Fresh works as expected, as does most Suave products they make quality products for a fair price.</li>
      <li>Second, a two-in-one is a good efficiency for me.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a shampoo and conditioner combination.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and get&#x27;s my ratty hair nice and clean after just one lather &amp; rinse where most other shampoos would need a second lathering to get all the gunk out.</li>
      <li>though I would try out this new scent, though and see if it was as good as the older one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a clean fresh sent, and not too fragrant</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this because we have recently been very impressed with several Sauve products.</li>
      <li>He likes the scent better and says his hair seems to have more body without looking flat or frizzy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t weight their hair down at all either and has a great scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out or soften my hair which I like and the scent is good.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The smell is do good, makes my man smell manly LOL</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a family member.  He said it worked good and had a nice clean smell, did not smell like flowers or perfume, which I think most guys appreciate!.  Suave is a great value for a low price!  I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> I love the value of the Suave 2-in-1 body wash/shampoo! I purchased it for my husband and was pleasantly surprised by the scent. He is a little picky about what he will use and won&#x27;t use. So, when he saw this he was a little hesitant. He is using it, though, and he even seems to like it.</li>
    <li> My husband and son loved this Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo. They both shower everyday and they liked that they didn&#x27;t have to use 2 different products. Shampoo and Conditioner all in one bottle. Will definitely continue to purchase this. Didn&#x27;t weight their hair down at all either and has a great scent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this myself but hubby smelled great lol</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he love it. Compared to Dove which he use to use. He says this one smells better. Leaves his hair more moist and is faster since is 2 in 1.</li>
    <li> I have been using Suave products for years and find them usually every bit as good as higher priced products.This one is no different. It cleaned my hair well, left it soft and the smell was nice and not over powering at all. In fact, the scent dissipates fairly quickly, which is fine.  My hair looks and feels great after using this and the price is very reasonable. So I &amp;#34;like it&amp;#34; (4 stars) and think it&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great</li>
    <li> Smells good and get&#x27;s my ratty hair nice and clean after just one lather &amp; rinse where most other shampoos would need a second lathering to get all the gunk out.</li>
    <li> There have been many stretches in my adult life when I was happy with just a cheap shampoo--and when my hair was long, with a cheap shampoo and cheap conditioner (to get those nasty tangles out!:). Suave was usually my go-to product then. My wife was good with that, too. But more recently, my wife has wanted &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; shampoos, so I just got into the habit of using a little bit of what she was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have this whole movement of mass-market brands like Dove and Irish Spring and Suave packaging and targeting special versions for men. And the store shelves are crowded with all these many varieties of major brands, all taking up the shelf space and using their marketing strength to power out lesser-known brands. Shelf space is a valuable commodity--and that space is literally up for sale in many stores. So the big guys like Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever take up almost all the space with all their many brands. I mean, Unilever owns Dove, Axe, Suave, Degree, Vaseline, Pond&#x27;s, Lever 2000, Noxzema, Nexxus, Tresemme, Caress, Motions, Consort For Men, Soft &amp; Beautiful--and that&#x27;s just in health and beauty aids. Think of all the shelf space they take up with all their different varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is &amp;#34;Suave Professionals Men&amp;#34;? It&#x27;s just a bunch of chemicals and scents packaged and targeted in a way to hit someone, somewhere, like buckshot. It&#x27;s from Unilever and it fits within some target segment they&#x27;ve defined. Nothing really to go crazy about or cheer over. Okay, rant over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. It&#x27;s value-priced but ever so slightly upmarket from the 99 cent bottle of shampoo I used to get at the supermarket or superstore. So now they can charge a higher price for it, and they can create shelf clutter not only at the store but also in our shower stall, where we now have all different varieties of shampoos, conditioners, body washes, rinses, and whatever, all taking up space. (I guess rant wasn&#x27;t over!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, the shampooleaves your hair feeling clean and conditioned, and it smells good, too. I do like the Alpine Fresh scent--I don&#x27;t have to walk around with flowery or fruity-smelling hair anymore! Well, I guess there is something good about this gender-specific market move.</li>
    <li> Both economical and good.</li>
    <li> Works well. Seems to keep my hair and scalp clean and healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out or soften my hair which I like and the scent is good.  The price is great and with subscribe and save I never have to worry about buying shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have received this product without charge/discount price to give my honest opinion on it these that are expressed are my own Thank you love the smell I even use it :)</li>
    <li> I am for the first time using this shampoo and did like it. When I poured it for first time, felt it was less viscous but once in the hair, had satisfactory amount of lather, easily washed off, and is really odor neutral.  For records, I was always using [[ASIN:B000GCXSHO Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care With Almond Oil Dandruff Shampoo With Pump 33.8 Fl Oz (packaging may vary)]], just because it was available in Costco. A hairstylist suggested that if you do  have thinning hair , to try [[ASIN:B000TMM2PU Nioxin System 2 Cleanser &amp; Scalp Therapy for Fine Thinning Hair Duo 33.8 oz]].  I have not tried yet, but plan to do it next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most men, this will be a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> This Suave Professionals Men 2 In 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Alpine Fresh works as expected, as does most Suave products they make quality products for a fair price. It leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable. It lathers nicely rinses out easily and smells great a mild scent noting overwhelming. This is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not saying this is an original product that does what no other shampoo does. However, this is a fine product on its own merits, It is a great value. You could spend a fortune on much hyped brands and not get any better than Suave Professionals Men 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner. It has a clean masculine scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering like some shampoos for men. The formula was noticeably rich and made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Decent shampoo but seems rather watered down. It did do the job, but is not a product I will return to.</li>
    <li> Good my hudband likes it ty</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expressly for men, although I really could tell no difference between this and what my wife uses, other than the scent.  This is good shampoo, which left my hair delightfully silky and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent: officially it&#x27;s \\&quot;alpine fresh\\&quot; but I&#x27;m not smelling the mountains at all.  That unique and hard to come by scent will lie forever in the realm of [[ASIN:B0018RG2VU Badedas]], the classic German body wash.  Now that&#x27;s alpine, at least in my mind.  The scent is not unpleasant at all; in fact, it smells more like a breakfast condiment than a personal cleaning solution.  The \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; aspect is spot-on, but what I&#x27;m really smelling in this scent is much more like berries and fruit.  It&#x27;s not a heavy, commercial/industrial faux fruit smell, like the one that assaults you when your wife drags you into the candle store at the mall.  No, the scent is much more natural, light and pleasant.  Upon rinsing the scent stays but is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the bottle easily and quickly, being just a little bit more viscous than some shampoos I&#x27;m used to.  I liked that, in that as the bottle began to drain it was still easy to get the product out, and I didn&#x27;t have to stand there for 15 or 20 minutes for the product to ooze its way down to the spout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: good product, that does exactly what it says it will, and smells great while doing it.  Yes, I will look for this when I go shopping.</li>
    <li> This Suave Men&#x27;s 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner is very much like the [[ASIN:B00GTBZI6A Suave&#x27;s Men&#x27;s 2-in-1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner]], except without the dandruff fighting components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shampoo that cleans well, suds well, with a minimum amount of conditioning.  It&#x27;s the sort of product my husband likes. It gets his short hair squeaky-clean and the &#x27;conditioning&#x27; doesn&#x27;t leave his hair either greasy or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a dude with longer hair, you might want to add either more conditioning, or a different set of Suave products.  I have long hair and while the Alpine Fresh 2-in-1 didn&#x27;t leave my locks feeling stripped, it didn&#x27;t provide any help with detangling and I definitely will continue using my Suave [[ASIN:B00A0IWRRG Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo]] and conditioner which I feel is better for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as scent, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good basic shampoo and conditioner for people who want affordably clean hair with minimum conditioning.</li>
    <li> Awsome value for the price</li>
    <li> This works very well for a year. Not for flakes but it washes well and smell good. I recommend and will likely buy more, and I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, it&#x27;s clear, but not too runny so that&#x27;s nice for applying it.  It&#x27;s got a clean fresh sent, and not too fragrant (I&#x27;m in my mid-50s and don&#x27;t like fragrant products so this was just right).  The ph level was right too - as it did not burn my eyes.  My hair is clean after using it, and using it daily has not been a problem for my scalp.  As for conditioning, I&#x27;m not sure that it works as well as a 2-step process with an actual conditioner, but my hair is short enough that it&#x27;s not been a problem for me.</li>
    <li> It looks like a cloudy gel.  Not very thick and easy to spread on your hair.  It gives you enough suds to work on.  Pine smell on this shampoo is a bit off or a bit odd for me.  It also rinses easily unlike under 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner combinations.  I feel my hair clean and with adequate smoothness. Overall a very decent product.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely men&#x27;s shampoo - leaves hair feeling fresh, soft and clean. Very nice; I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have short, fine, color treated hair, while my husband has short, thinning hair.  When I selected this shampoo I didn&#x27;t realize it was a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; shampoo, but I was happy to see that the scent was neutral and not over powering.  With five children at home, I find myself taking fast showers, and I appreciate the 2-n-1 product.  The conditioner is very light, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, nor does it leave my hair limp or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; looking.  All in all, I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on fancy shampoo. I&#x27;ll use almost anything. Prior to trying this, I was using some no-name shampoo that cost a buck. I absolutely noticed a difference with the the Suave. For one thing, I was able to use much less. A dollop about the size of a penny is sufficient to produce a good lather. For another, my hair did seem cleaner. But that&#x27;s in comparison to an off-brand shampoo. Compared to other shampoos I&#x27;ve used over the years, the Suave seemed fine but nothing spectacular. It cleaned my hair, and that&#x27;s all I really ask.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because we have recently been very impressed with several Sauve products. Sadly, I cannot recommend this one. It smells good but very very strong and it stuck around all day. But the biggest problem is that it doesn&#x27;t condition well at all. It leaves hair a little dry and flyaway.</li>
    <li> In general, I have had really good experience with Suave men&#x27;s shampoo.  It is one of the few shampoos on the market that leaves my hair squeaky clean with no residue afterwards.  Even though this version is a 2 in 1 with conditioner, it did not leave my hair feeling heavy as other conditioners normally do.  The Alpine Fresh scent is cooling with some light citrus notes.  Not so heavy on the fruitiness so that I smell like I used my wife&#x27;s shampoo, but enough to feel like I have been swept away to some Alpine meadow singing the Sound of Music like Julie Andrews.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of combining the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m not particularly fussy about my hair, but I do want it to feel clean while being easy to comb. I use product in my hair and this cleans that right out with making my hair feel too raw or dry.</li>
    <li> You know how they say &amp;#34;Wash, Rinse &amp; Repeat&amp;#34;, I prefer these &amp;#34;2 in 1&amp;#34; Shampoo/Conditioners for the repeat part. They get whatever the shampoo might have missed, but also provide the conditioner to repair the damage a harsh shampoo might have caused. The Alpine Fresh scent is nice but not overwhelming, which is what I like from my haircare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good haircare product, lathers up good, cleans good and washes out without any residue left behind and leaves my hair just right.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I can use without my hair getting dried out, simply the best</li>
    <li> Loved the scent of this shampoo and it works great.</li>
    <li> Smells good. My son says it makes his hair feel soft and that it makes it easy to comb after washing. It&#x27;s good for it to be a combination shampoo-conditioner for him because he might not otherwise bother to condition, even though that makes his hair feel smoother and easier to handle. He has naturally curly hair by the way. Unfortunately he has to hide the shampoo in his room though so his younger sister won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this with hair and without hair, he always comes out of the shower smelling great.  He loves the after feel of the shampoo, it has never dried him out and had always left the hair he had feeling soft. We will purchase this Alpine Fresh again because we do love the smell.</li>
    <li> Foremost, this product has a phenomenal scent! While it reads Alpine Fresh, it reminds me a bit of green apples. Super refreshing! (I was smelling my boyfriend&#x27;s hair all evening long ... and, he certainly was not objecting). Additionally, just a small amount of this product will generate a rich lather. And, it rinses clean with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that many men are concerned about conditioners that are too weighty. This is not the case here. There is just enough conditioner to leave hair smooth and shiny, but with no added weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the price cannot be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another in a long line of fabulous Suave products. Add it to your cart! You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Never used Suave before but having done so for the past few months I have to say it has done an excellent job. Very happy with the way it smells and how well it works. I&#x27;ll be using it in the future!</li>
    <li> Great price on subscribe and save and my husband really likes the product. I wish a larger size was available.  For that reason, I may purchase in the store in the future.</li>
    <li> So much of a regular guy&#x27;s selection of shampoo comes down to basics. For me, the smell has to be not-too-fruity, for a funny reason. I walk outdoors a lot on nature trails, and the fruit scents actually attract bugs. Second, a two-in-one is a good efficiency for me. I work out at a YMCA and the showers there are what are known as &amp;#34;Navy showers,&amp;#34; short bursts of water meant to conserve as much as possible, rather than a regular shower as we&#x27;ve come to know it in our homes. It tends to make one move quickly, and there&#x27;s always that next guy in line waiting to use the same stall. It&#x27;s also easier to carry just one bottle in the gym bag rather than two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have thick, almost wiry, dark hair. I tend to need something that relaxes it, at least in the short term after a shower, and not all shampoos do that. This one does. Add that to efficiency and a pleasant, outdoors-inspired smell, and it works for me.</li>
    <li> My husband likes 2 in 1 shampoos, and has used Finesse for years. He was happy to try this Suave because it&#x27;s cheaper and our local big-box store carries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks with this new shampoo, he&#x27;s very happy. He likes the scent better and says his hair seems to have more body without looking flat or frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product for a nice price, that&#x27;s a great deal in my book!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I love this Alpine Fresh scent on my husband. He smells wonderful after showering and using this in his hair. It is a nice fresh light scent. He has used Suave for men hair products before. He really like this 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner, it leaves his hairs soft, shiny, and clean.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a shampoo and conditioner combination.  It cleans and conditions the hair all in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizers helps condition the hair, leaving it manageable and looking healthy.  The shampoo/conditioner combo also lathers and rinses well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, the scalp isn&#x27;t left itchy or dry to due build-up.  Nor is the hair weighed down.  Lastly, the Alpine Fresh scent is alluring and not consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not the best shampoo/conditioner combination that I’ve purchased, but it works well none the same.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for some time now and we both liked the original scent as well as the clean rinsing performance in this no hassle one product shampoo and conditioned.  I though I would try out this new scent, though and see if it was as good as the older one.  Mmmmmm.  It&#x27;s even better.  Very light yet manly in a clean, almost citrusy way.  It doesn&#x27;t over power or hang around in the air.  The shampoo leaves his hair - and beard and mustaches - clean and soft with nice body and no unpleasant odor or taste (when kissing his beard LOL). I will buy this Alpine Fresh variety again.  Good work, Suave, you got it just right.</li>
    <li> Like it, great price!</li>
    <li> Came just as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what distinguishes a men&#x27;s shampoo from one designed for women except, perhaps, fragrance but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this 2 in 1 Suave product.  As a guy, I&#x27;m simply not inclined to bother with a separate shampoo and conditioner, but this Suave product offers both products in one.  And it works.  My hair looks better and is more manageable - less &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34;; just as if I had used a separate shampoo and conditioner - which, again, I&#x27;m just not apt to do.  Good product and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The men in my family strongly prefer 2 in 1 shampoos to messing with conditioner. This shampoo gets hair clean and conditions decently. It smells good too. The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering, and a nice clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Good value, it&#x27;s inexpensive and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and is great for boys and men.</li>
    <li> I love this for my husband. Its a really great 2-1. I would recommend this. Smells great and its does its job.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband.  It smells nice and leaves his hair clean.  What more could you want from a shampoo?  :)</li>
    <li> this is a nice shampoo/conditioner.  We both like the scent of this and it isn&#x27;t too strong.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin either.</li>
    <li> My husband favorite, shampoos.</li>
