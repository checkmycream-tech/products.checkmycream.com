      <li>don&#x27;t think this would be effective for all types of hair loss.</li>
      <li>I had an instinctive feeling that some kind of oil would be the answer, so this product seemed like it.&lt;br</li>

      <li>and I would recommend it to everyone as it is cheap and a good product.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, love that it&#x27;s all natural, and will continue to use!</li>
      <li>This just seems to good to be true...</li>
      <li>I use it more than twice a week and it improves my hair quality tremendously!!</li>
      <li>I love the warming burn on my scalp and massage for 10 mins twice a week.  </li>
      <li>I have recommended it to all my friends as I see great REAL benefits.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use and the price is ok with me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been losing lots of hair for many years, it&#x27;s thinned out a lot-</li>
      <li>Will update in a couple of months, but I&#x27;m wildly satisfied at this point.  </li>
      <li>That was alright, but my hands still hurt, even more than my head at that point.</li>
      <li>The top of my head started tingling, then started burning.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it is helping.  </li>
      <li>This treatment brings more volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>Love that is has Cayenne pepper which is known to improve blood circulation.  </li>
      <li>you can tell it&#x27;s causing more blood flow to the scalp.</li>
      <li>My hairs are thinning on the top.  </li>
      <li>I just want more hair.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to use it on my eyebrows yet</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a month and have already noticed a bunch of baby hair showing up and giving me more volume.</li>
      <li>I look forward to seeing more results.  </li>
      <li>This cayenne product keeps my scalp healthy as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products including Rogaine and this works much better without the side effects of minoxidil.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients appear to be top notch.</li>
      <li>and as i use this more I notice even more baby hairs coming in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll take time to see more results</li>
      <li>There is no oily feel just hair that is healthy.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this treatment.</li>
      <li>My scalp feels very clean and the tingling sensation has me feeling like I&#x27;m at a spa.</li>
      <li>My new great hairdresser recommended this to me.</li>
      <li>so I am confident I do not put some mix of cheap fragrant chemicals on my scalp.</li>
      <li>So far I’m happy</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy to see a marked slowing of the hair</li>
      <li>Since more information is available on this hair product  </li>
      <li>loved it so much that i bought for my fiance who was also having some hairfall</li>
      <li>It washes out easy.</li>
      <li>Its strong, so keep that in mind.</li>
      <li>they have some excellent articles and slight decrease in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed fine hairs growing along my hairline which has never happened with</li>
      <li>cause if it gets on yor face it does burn, but it feels fine on my scalp.</li>
      <li>This treatment made my hair healthier and stronger, and I noticed results and hair growth much more quickly than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I have seen a bit of baby hair growth and enjoy using it - it smells fantastic and</li>
      <li>Great Product my hair is coming back and getting fuller.</li>
      <li>This hair oil is great, I had my doubts about it doing anything for actual hair growth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to keep it from the eyes while washing the hair.</li>
      <li>I tried it as a free sample with another purchase, and can’t wait to receive my purchase of the full size bottle.  </li>
      <li>and I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss when I brush.</li>
      <li>I’m glad I read some reviews first because I would have been nervous about the tingling sensation and the icy/hot feel but</li>
      <li>(original review 09-28-14):</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash your hands very well after using this because it will burn everywhere you touch!</li>
      <li>All user ratings are rating the same products, some kind of Garcinia Cambogia Weight Loss Supplement, Dr Song products, tons of Shibari sex products, a book named &amp;#34;digi&amp;#34;, cellulite creams, and much more.  </li>
      <li>however I would have to say you&#x27;d need a good year to really notice much since hair grows in cycles and during the off cycle, you won&#x27;t notice anything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update after I give this a chance to do its magic but so far so good, high hopes for this one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does work. I had a patch break and needed some growth soon. This works. The smell isn&#x27;t bad but its not great. Its unusual</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and smells horrible.</li>
    <li> i had been having a serious hair loss problem. I was losing hair in the shower, while brushing, and everywhere else. they say its normal to lose 100 hair strands a day- i was probably losing 2000 a day.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using Cayenne for 3 months now, twice a week. I noticed significantly less hairfall right after the first application. My hair has been looking much healthier and bouncy with continued use, and the hairfall is so much normal now.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much that i bought for my fiance who was also having some hairfall problems.&lt;br /&gt;and with all natural ingredients, and definite effectiveness, I am never going to another product for my hair issues.</li>
    <li> WOW. The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t see all the benefits. Needless to say I was like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just oil, I don&#x27;t feel any tingling like the reviews promised&amp;#34;. So my BF suggested I shake the bottle and try again. He xplained that most products usually have ingredients that settle at the bottom of the container. So, on my next wash day I did exactly as he stated and BOY OH BOY. I felt the warming/tingling sensation that time. Especially when I did a mini scalp massage with the tips (not nails).  My hair has thickened up at the root after 4 uses and I still have more than half a bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;-Part hair in 4 sections and clip with butterfly clips.&lt;br /&gt;-Put on disposable gloves&lt;br /&gt;-Gently detangle a section and apply the  treatment on the scalp (shake the bottle for each section you do)&lt;br /&gt;-Lightly/gently massage scalp&lt;br /&gt;-Put on plastic shower cap and wrap with a towel (I leave this on for 30 min)&lt;br /&gt;-Remove shower cap and towel and complete my wash routine. (Common sense will tell you to wash all your hair toward the back under the faucet with any treatment/mask in your hair) I haven&#x27;t had any problems with anything getting in my eyes or face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this oil smells AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know what they used to make it do that. Actually, the scent is partially the reason I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work at first. I have come to think that hair growth products need to smell awful to be potent. Not true. LOVING THIS!</li>
    <li> Does nothing!!!waste of money,and it&#x27;s burning skin too.</li>
    <li> Seemed like I lost hair using this product.Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Applied this product as directed.  The top of my head started tingling, then started burning.  I went in the shower and as I rinsed it off, my eyes started burning and hurting.  My eyes bothered me all day and the next.  I repeatedly flushed my eyes out.  I just hope that I didn&#x27;t damage my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I could not stand the smell of this and had to return it immediately. It made me sick to my stomach and I am not even sensitive to things like this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of different hair treatments. Cayenne Hair Growth Oil is one of my favorites. I like the gentle burn on my scalp, and I like that it washes off easily, unlike other oils I tried.&lt;br /&gt;See definite improvement.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any new hair but I have noticed that I am no longer seeing large amounts of loss. Have only used half of bottle.  Will try it for 2 months to see what happens.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have used it for a month now and on my second bottle, it has dramatically decreased scalp itchiness and dandruff, which I have had a problem with for a couple of years. I have seen a bit of baby hair growth and enjoy using it - it smells fantastic and the icy-hot tingling sensation it gives my scalp feels invigorating. I even purchased a bottle for my sister, who has also had issues with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;One downside is that the cayenne can really sting my eyes if it gets in them, and makes me cough when I rinse it out in the shower. The remedy I have devised is putting a thin coating of vaseline around my eyes, at the brow and underneath, around both of my nostrils and mouth. It seems the vaseline acts as a barrier against the cayenne mixing with water and dripping into your eyes. Other than that I love this product and recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was a canceled order but this came anyway. When I smelled the box I decided to try it and with no regret. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days BUT this stuff has added BOUNCE to my hair!!! I just couldn&#x27;t believe it! I applied some to my husband&#x27;s hair and he likes it too. I didn&#x27;t know I was receiving two bottles. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll take time to see more results but I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected. I put it in a spray bottle with another hair oil so maybe that&#x27;s why. Love it! I use it once a week, usually after I&#x27;ve washed my hair. I don&#x27;t need anymore oil in my scalp until the next week when I wash my hair again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago thinking it would help me grow my hair, and that&#x27;s exactly what it did. (But don&#x27;t expext growth immediately) When I first opened the bottle, the first thing that caught my attention was the smell. Its strong, so keep that in mind. Try to keep this product focused on your scalp because it will burn your skin and eyes.</li>
    <li> I feel the burn and I love it!!!! My head is actually pulsating and it&#x27;s orgasmic!!!</li>
    <li> i was very happy to see this product and how many stars it had however that happiness surly faded away as i had recived my product and i at first was very displeased to see how small it was then i tried it.When i had tried it i noticed that my head had felt weird i guess that ment it was working well it was surly working, working its way to drying out my hair iv e have never tried such a worse product it ruined my hair and it took along time to recover. If you do get this product just be prepared to find out that looks can be decieving if i could rate this thing a 0 i would but it is only allowing me to rate it a one so anyway i guess you can now see my frustration and anger causing me to lose even more hair along with this product.</li>
    <li> I started to use this hair loss treatment a while ago. And going through my second hair oil bottle.  First bottle I was using intensively up to 3 times a week. My hair is naturally oily as is, and this treatment helped me to balance my scalp health. So far (after about 3 months) my hair grows faster, feels thicker and healthier. I am also using just natural products and this one is 100% botanical. I have recommended it to all my friends as I see great REAL benefits.</li>
    <li> not as potent as I expected</li>
    <li> First time user of this product. 40 something female losing hair at the root level for unexplained reasons. This product has a dropper you use to apply to scalp and massage in. I sleep in mine and wash out the next day with my normal shampoo using a second shampoo rinse to make sure I get the oil out. It is oil based. No matter how careful you are the roots of your hair will absorb the oil requiring it to be washed out after use. I do not find it harsh or stinging. It washes out easy. It does not leave a residue behind after shampooing even on blonde hair. I can feel it tingling some- you can tell it&#x27;s causing more blood flow to the scalp. I noticed less hair falling out right away. I can&#x27;t say that I see new hair but I&#x27;m happy to see a marked slowing of the hair I was finding in my comb everyday. What a relief. I will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this would be effective for all types of hair loss. I would suggest examining a piece of your hair that&#x27;s fallen out and looking at the root tip for tiny piece of skin indicating that it&#x27;s falling out from the root/scalp level. I am not sure this product would stop hair loss if your hair is falling out due to breakage.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to received this product. I have hoped that I would see some baby hair growth after using it for almost three months. But no baby growths and my hair just keeps falling out a lot. Finally, I chose to cut my hair very short and realized that fell less.</li>
    <li> There are literally hundreds of \\&quot;hair loss products\\&quot; on the market today like androgen blockers (Rogaine, etc.) Unfortunately, they are all chemically-synthesized products and have a lot of side effects. Moreover, discontinue of these products leads to the same problem - hair loss. I was eagerly looking for a product which would contain only natural ingredients and would be very efficient at the same time. I tried many different products, expensive and not expensive one. My new great hairdresser recommended this to me. I fell in love with this treatment. It not only improves the appearance of your hair (they became softer and shiny), but has the significant ability to stimulate new hair growth. After just first few applications, I noticed a difference. My hair stopped falling out as it was before and I see lots of baby-hair growing like crazy! One bottle goes a long way because you need only a few drops in each section of your hair.</li>
    <li> After spending two hours reading through every 5 star review and checking the reviewer&#x27;s other reviews, I&#x27;ve found an astonishing amount of people who are all reviewing the same products and have a handful of only 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is very suspect and you should take the time to investigate this before purchasing based off of reviews that were likely purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you not get taken advantage of.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my grandfather who recently began to lose a great amount of his hair (he previously had only a somewhat recessed hairline). Within just two to three weeks of starting this hair treatment, the hair loss stopped completely. He’s now been using it a few times a week for about two months and his remaining hair has definitely thickened and is even growing back. We’re excited to see further results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s tried quite a few different hair loss products with varying outcomes, but this has been his favorite thus far. It’s easy and mess free to apply to the scalp. Also, it has a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product. Hair really looks better and hair fall is much less.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a risk and what can I say... It did wonders for me. When I smelled the box. It had a very appealing scent which drew me towards it more. And now my hair has bounce to it again! Just Incredible! 100% satisfied and would recommend!</li>
    <li> I stopped using this.  I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> i think my scalp is too sensitive for this product. this product burned my scalp, it became incredibly painful &amp; my scalp turned red.  maybe this is what is supposed to happen since it&#x27;s cayenne? but it was painful, so i stopped using it after trying it a couple times. also, i noticed that a lot of shorter finer hairs were gone after using this product in conjunction with the cayenne shampoo...so definitely not the right product for me. but there are plenty of glowing reviews, so might work for other people.</li>
    <li> Аfter about a month or so of usage I stopped my hair loss. This is тхе excellent product for fine, breaking hair. This cayenne product keeps my scalp healthy as well. I am on my second bottle of this product and can tell you that it really works.</li>
    <li> I was very concerned about hair loss and the thinning around my front , a week ago my hairdresser recommended this product. I am surprised that it actually seems to be working :). The thinning seems to be going away and the hair is looking healthier and thicker.</li>
    <li> This product is natural and has nothing but organic ingredients so I am confident I do not put some mix of cheap fragrant chemicals on my scalp. I am in my 40s and I have had thinning hair since a young age. I can finally see my hair getting thicker, fuller and stronger. This treatment brings more volume to my hair. It does not let it lie flat and keeps it lifted long lime after I style my hair.</li>
    <li> I used it for over a month. I did not notice any thing.  Oh well....win some lose some. next time</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am using this product. This product gives my scalp that tingling sensation it needed in order to wake up my hair follicles. Within a week I noticed less hair fall, this botanical treatment has amazing hair-loss fighting ingredients like saw palmetto and cayenne. Very pleased with the product and how it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but some people say smell good. But personally I think is awful... my husband hate it. .. besides I have been using it for 2 weeks (4times) and my hair is still falling and worst the hair look like old doll hair ... I&#x27;m stopping to use it. If someone know about a good product for hair loss please email me joanna.fernandez@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Great product.....Has help to slow down hair fall out.  I look forward to seeing more results.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry scalp for many years. I have only used this product 3 times and can already tell a difference with my scalp and hair! My scalp feels very clean and the tingling sensation has me feeling like I&#x27;m at a spa. My hair feels extra soft and moisturized as it should be. I will definitely continue to use this product! I&#x27;m eager to see what the long term results will be!</li>
    <li> My hairs are thinning on the top.  I have tried quite a few hair products out there.&lt;br /&gt;None of them worked for me.  This product is no exception so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Cayenne hair product extensively for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Apply twice a day and left it on at night.&lt;br /&gt;The result is \\&quot;a little pain\\&quot; (hot pepper oil accidentally on skin &amp; strong scent)  but \\&quot;no gain\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it to see if there are any improvements on my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I will post the results back in 2-3 months and I will update my rating accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 2+ months of use, I do not see any hair growth at all.  So, I changed the rating to 2-star.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product five times over the past two weeks. It is not convenient because you have to let it sit on your scalp for twenty minutes before you shampoo it out. Believe me, I can not wait to wash it off. The smell is awful. I do not know if my product is different (poor quality control?) than what other customers received because some said it smells good. Also, be very careful washing it out of your hair because it makes your eyes burn. It is also oily and I need to shampoo twice to remove it, which I never do otherwise. However, I will probably use up the bottle just to see if there are any positive results such as new hair growth or at least less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Finally I found this product here! Out of all the hair oils I&#x27;ve tried before, this brand has the lightest structure and the best organic ingredients! I am growing my hair out, but it grows so slow. so I got CAYENNE Hair Growth Oil to help. It is not greasy, absorbs quickly and you do not need much. Just few pumps on hair roots and then massaging into scalp. I use it more than twice a week and it improves my hair quality tremendously!!</li>
    <li> Only problem that I have with Cayenne hair growth &amp; hair shampoo and treatment &amp; Scalp hair oil are burn my eyes when I use and I have to wash my hands well before I touch my face otherwise it also burns.</li>
    <li> There are many product that I have tried but all were fake But then 1 day my friend told me to buy CAYENNE Hair Growth &amp; Hair Loss Treatment &amp; Scalp Care and guess what i did listen to him and i am in love with my hair now and the best thing about this product is that it is cheap and I would recommend it to everyone as it is cheap and a good product.</li>
    <li> I used this oil for a month and noticed that my hair became stronger and almost no hair loss compare to what I had before. It also smells good. This is 5 star product and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> WOW....I&#x27;m pinching myself ...could this really be...but my hair has stopped falling out.  It smells dreadful but it tingles like crazy and I&#x27;m sure it is helping.  This just seems to good to be true...time will tell.</li>
    <li> Great Product my hair is coming back and getting fuller.</li>
    <li> Extremely messy. It seems as though there&#x27;s a constant leakage. It didn&#x27;t stop the dry scalp as promise, I am yet to see the improvement in hair growth. I do like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month and I hardly shed any hair at all! It seems to give my hair some oomf and I love the smell! I advise putting a layer of Vaseline along your hairline cause if it gets on yor face it does burn, but it feels fine on my scalp. Love it!</li>
    <li> useless as hair growth, its just some hot pepper that will burn your eyes out if it gets in. the stuff is oily and won&#x27;t wash out well, it will stick to your hands after you&#x27;re done&amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; your hair. if you still must try it, wear goggles and gloves. The label even says it does nothing to reduce DHT related hairloss.</li>
    <li> This star is not for the product but rather the purchase. The discount code provided does not work.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I wish i had before pictures but the after results are amazing! After the first two weeks of use i started noticing a HUGE difference. Tiny baby hairs started sprouting out like wildfire. Now those same tiny baby hairs have grown about an an inch and a half and as i use this more I notice even more baby hairs coming in. It&#x27;s slightly tingly the first few times you use it, but after a few applications your scalp gets desensitized and you will feel little to nothing at all. It had an amazing spa like scent, and leaves your scalp feeling refreshed after every use. My hair feels and looks thicker and is much healthier as a result of using this product! Would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using it, my hair was pretty thick, but there were some areas that were noticeably thinner. After using it, my hair is starting to fill in in those areas, and it is starting to become evenly filled which is something i never thought would happen. It is a life saver!</li>
    <li> So I bought this scalp oil because it&#x27;s all natural. It&#x27;s got cayenne in it as well as a bunch of botanicals. It&#x27;s supposed to help stimulate my hair follicles for hair growth and help prevent loss of hair. I&#x27;ve been losing lots of hair for many years, it&#x27;s thinned out a lot- and I had thin hair to start with. Anyway, I don&#x27;t much care if it makes my hair grow faster, but if it actually makes my scalp healthier and prevents as much hair loss- I&#x27;ll be thrilled. I&#x27;m surprised you read this far. Here&#x27;s part of the payoff.... Only I would be so careless with scalp oil full of cayenne pepper! I&#x27;m standing in my bathroom, using the dropper to drop it on my head and then I&#x27;m supposed to rub it all over to help stimulate the effects. After I started rubbing it in, my head started burning like crazy anywhere I had scratched. Owww! Well- I was trying to rush through it thinking &amp;#34;the faster I finish, the faster I can start the timer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I should have worn gloves because this is really burning my hands&amp;#34;. Suddenly-some got in my eye! Ahhhh! It burned! I had to wash my hands 4 times to get it off them so I could start splashing my eye to get it out.  I got a rag to rub my eye too. It was burning my eyeball, the  lower rim of my eye, and my eyelid! Eventually the pain faded and I could see again! Now I&#x27;m sitting here, writing this unnecessary novel while my scalp sizzles. Is it time to rinse yet?But wait, there&#x27;s more! While I was waiting for it to be time to rinse, I decided a hot bath would help take my mind off of it. WRONG! I ran a bath and got in. Immediately my hands turned red everywhere the oil had touched, which was almost all over because I rubbed the oil in with my fingers. It felt like I was roasting them over a campfire. Owww! So... it was kinda hard to relax. I leaned back and rested my hands on the sides of the tub. That was alright, but my hands still hurt, even more than my head at that point. So I sat there until it was time to rinse. Then I had the bright idea to rinse my hair... In the tub I was in. So I laid back to rinse. BIG MISTAKE! What was I even thinking? I felt like someone was pouring boiling water on a 3rd degree sunburn! My scalp, my ears, my neck, my shoulders... They were on FIRE! As I sat up to wash it a second time, I felt it mingling with the water, the backs of my legs started to hurt. I rinsed again. LAVA! It felt like lava all over! How could it feel so hot?! So I pulled the plug to drain the tub while I was still scrubbing shampoo into my scalp vigorously. The oil seemed to concentrate at the bottom of the tub. It seemed to singe the backs of my legs as I waited impatiently for the tub to finish draining. I rinsed again using a cup and faucet water. I washed my hair 5 times total. I washed myself frantically- just trying to get it all off. I ended up rinsing off in a tub of cool water- which really helped. After all was said and done, my hair looks great. haha. Not sure if I&#x27;ll have the guts to try that again though. Even with the knowledge that I need to be super careful with the oil, and rinse only in cool water. The bottle says to use it twice a week. YIKES!the bright idea to rinse my hair... In the tub I was in. So I laid back to rinse. BIG MISTAKE! What was I even thinking?

    <li> I have tried my product and IT WORKS! I noticed fine hairs growing along my hairline which has never happened with&lt;br /&gt;other products. I intend to continue for as long as it takes to grow my hair to the length I want. Thanks.</li>
    <li> IT IS WORKING GREAT IT REALLY SMELLS GOODS THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m real sorry to have to give a negative review. I was really hoping for results. I am a male late 60s and my hair was getting thin on top. I tried various products. I had an instinctive feeling that some kind of oil would be the answer, so this product seemed like it.&lt;br /&gt;Today I found the statement by the company that it doesn&#x27;t work on male pattern baldness. End of story.</li>
    <li> Good product, wash hands and under your nails , will burn if gets in your eyes,.</li>
    <li> Too greasy!  Can&#x27;t go around with greasy hair after you use this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, I am still testing it to see results.</li>
    <li> I tried this cayenne treatment over the summer, and then, lapsed into my usual hair routine. What a difference a few weeks make! What I had failed to notice over the summer was how few hairs were on my bathroom floor and on my light kitchen tiles. Once I stopped the treatment, the hairs were everywhere. So, now, I am faithfully applying this cayenne oil before each of my shampoo times. My hair loss is still heavy after I shampoo, but the hair on my head seems fuller, and short hairs seem to be filling in the sparse spots on my head. I don&#x27;t mind the heavy pepper smell as much as I do the stinging on my face and eyes. Ah, what we will do to maintain our last strands of hair!</li>
    <li> I have read all the reviews, positive and negative, and decided to buy and try for myself. The tingling sensation was a bit of a surprise but tolerable. I use it twice per week. I massage my scalp once applied, then shampoo and deep condition when I use this oil. I do not use it as a leave in and use this on Sunday&#x27;s and Wednesdays. I have natural hair, am in my 50&#x27;s and noticed some thinning and hair breakage, not cool. I started this product 3 weeks ago and will continue. My hair is stronger, no breakage, fuller and shinier. There is no oily feel just hair that is healthy. I will continue to use and the price is ok with me. Looking forward to the weeks ahead.</li>
    <li> I like it however I would have to say you&#x27;d need a good year to really notice much since hair grows in cycles and during the off cycle, you won&#x27;t notice anything.  I make my own formulation now with certain oils and essential oils, as buying this on a regular basis is just too pricey.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long...only about one week, but I like the scent of the lemon and there is absolutely NO burning sensation whatsoever as others have stated....not even a hint of burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if this works for me.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this oil. I have been using it for about a month and have already noticed a bunch of baby hair showing up and giving me more volume. The oil smells great and I even wear it all day, not just before the shower, because it is not greasy. Can&#x27;t wait to try the hair growth balm for the eye brows! The ingredients appear to be top notch.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s pepper, I expected it to burn and it did, however it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  I left it on all night and I tolerated it well.  I&#x27;m seeing great results and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> To make this story short: -first few weeks were fine (same as before using this product); - after one month, nightmare (started to lose a lot of hair, more than ever before). I  still have half of bottle left and can give it for free to anyone who is willing to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> Very different smell but makes my hair feel denser (according to my stylist), softer, and I see some baby hairs along my hairline. Excellent product, love that it&#x27;s all natural, and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> I was applying product to my scalp few times a week and I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss when I brush. There is too early to see new hair growth, but this product has stopped a lot of my hair loss. I massage product into my scalp and put on a shower cap for 20 minutes. One bottle lasts around 10 applications.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite new hair treatments.  I tried it as a free sample with another purchase, and can’t wait to receive my purchase of the full size bottle.  This treatment made my hair healthier and stronger, and I noticed results and hair growth much more quickly than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and price!  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have only used the product twice.  It does make the scalp tingle, due to the cayenne in the product. It&#x27;s important to keep it from the eyes while washing the hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as yet in my hair growth. I will continue to use it and if there is a real difference  the review will be amended. A few months later. Since more information is available on this hair product  the review will be amended.  It is an excellent product and seems to add fullness to the hair.Use with caution, however,as it stings the eyes.</li>
    <li> Could be effective but is very hard to avoid the eyes when you shower. I think is not very happy combination...I wasn&#x27;t so happy.</li>
    <li> in this product is what attracted me to it.  Love that is has Cayenne pepper which is known to improve blood circulation.  I got it a few days ago and have used it once and am so happy that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy feeling and it just seems to penetrate right into the scalp.  I&#x27;ll update after I give this a chance to do its magic but so far so good, high hopes for this one.</li>
    <li> Another excellent product, I use it along with the Cayenne Shampoo.  I love the warming burn on my scalp and massage for 10 mins twice a week.  I also have Afro Textured hair Type 3B/3C curly and some kinky curls in areas. These products has stopped some of the shedding and breakage. I have a full head of hair that doesn&#x27;t look thin or sparse on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cayenne stimulates your scalp making it feel like I&#x27;m getting the \\&quot;Green House Effect\\&quot;. The Green House Effect has in return with the help of other healthy hair practices help grow my hair to BSL..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use flat irons, blow dryers, chemical dyes etc ................I see a big difference in my health of my hair.  You should go to the the Company Website they have some excellent articles and slight decrease in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discount code \\&quot;MY15OFF\\&quot; worked for me.</li>
    <li> I almost bought this, then I started checking on the way the 40 odd users were rating other purchases.  A obvious dishonesty became very apparent.  All user ratings are rating the same products, some kind of Garcinia Cambogia Weight Loss Supplement, Dr Song products, tons of Shibari sex products, a book named &amp;#34;digi&amp;#34;, cellulite creams, and much more.  I never saw so many of the same products commented on by all the same buyers of another product.  If you take a look you will see the pattern here.  It&#x27;s made me suspicious and therefore steered me away from purchasing this hair product.  The similarity with the all the reviewers and their reviews of same product purchases is truly fraudulent looking.  I hope everyone takes a look at this trend before purchasing this product or any other.  Our money is hard earned and to be scammed out of it is so malicious and greedy.  This is my thoughts on the reviewers for this product others may not see the alarming similarities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products including Rogaine and this works much better without the side effects of minoxidil.  It might cost a little more than some of the products out there but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  It not only stimulates the follicles to start growing again, it improves softness, texture, and shine.  I can&#x27;t stop feeling how thick and soft my hair is getting.  Great customer service too!  I only wish they sold it in bigger bottles!!!</li>
    <li> I really like it I have been using it for about a month I now have hair in my temples</li>
    <li> I am trying right now, it got delivered on time. So far I am satisfied</li>
    <li> This hair oil is great, I had my doubts about it doing anything for actual hair growth but I wanted to use it for the overall health of my hair. I have always had thin, silky hair that lacks body and volume. I also have light colored and a little thin eyebrows. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to use it on my eyebrows yet but I bought this to try on my hair first and see how it went.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a change in my hair after the first week, not hair growth, just seemed fuller and after blow drying my hair just looked amazing. I’m glad I read some reviews first because I would have been nervous about the tingling sensation and the icy/hot feel but that’s normal and didn&#x27;t have any side effects at all. Especially since this product is made from a lot of natural oils and not chemicals is why I decided to give it a shot, otherwise I would have just dealt with it because I’m not losing hair I just want more hair. After trying it for a few weeks I noticed more volume, less breakage and less hair on my brush than I usually did so it definitely made my hair stronger and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;After those results I tried their separate product and using it on my eyebrows, it burns a bit and you need to be careful not to let it run onto your skin or your eyes. I found out it is not recommended to use this formula anywhere but on your scalp, so if you do want to use it on your eyebrows check out their other products. So far I’m happy and I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> WOW!! this products really helps to stimulate blood flow around the hair follicles, providing at the same time omega 3 oils to the scalp.. I have less hair falling down!!.. This is a product that will really help to grow the hair.. It is very stimulating!!... Don&#x27;t stop selling it!! thank you!</li>
    <li> I never realized it was my scalp causing the problems with my thinning hair until this treatment came along and cleansed away all the dirt and debris that had built up from years of damage and products on my scalp. Within a few weeks it was totally flake free and once my scalp could breathe it was only a matter of time before the hairs coming in improved as a result.</li>
    <li> I am a 47 year old female with thinning hair in the front.  You can see my scalp through my &amp;#34;clever&amp;#34; camouflage of bangs.  I started using this product 2 weeks ago.  It is working!  I know that it is too soon to see results, so I think it is a combination of 3 different things that I am doing.  1. six months ago, I cut out bread and sugar to lose some weight.  2. I started taking a good multi vitamin.  3. I started using this product.  I got a haircut today, and my stylist told me that she could see stubble growing through my &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; bangs.  She showed me with a flashlight so I could see it too.  I put the oil on before bed, and cover my head.  The only negative that I can report is that I hate the smell.  I always wash it out in the morning, so all is good in the end.</li>
    <li> it did nothing. And I believe the other reviews for this product are artifact</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s made a difference and to be honest I don&#x27;t use it every week.  Like any deep conditioner you need to leave it in for about 20 min.  I shower it out and it&#x27;s a real hit or miss on getting it in my eyes during the shower. Yes, burns it burns your eyes if the water gets in them.</li>
    <li> Still trying this hopefully it will work for me. Just don&#x27;t get it in the eyes, because it burns.</li>
    <li> ...I have 3a curly hair and have shed like a pony in the springtime my whole life.  The hair grows back, so yay for THAT, and I&#x27;ve got enough body in it that a lot of folks don&#x27;t realize how frustrated I&#x27;ve always been to apparently have so many growing cycles going on at once.  Ultimately it means that by the time my hair gets long, past my shoulders, it&#x27;s consistently raggedy and thin at the longer lengths.  After my 2nd treatment (honestly, I want to say after my 1st treatment but that just sounds INSANE LOL)...I had to pinch myself as there was absolutely MINIMAL hair in the drain guard in the tub.  Normally I have to remove a wad (technical term) of hair each time I shampoo or the tub really does start to fill up because the drain is THAT blocked. No comment yet on new growth, but if this product is already exceeding my expectations I&#x27;m more than happy to wait a few more weeks.  Will update in a couple of months, but I&#x27;m wildly satisfied at this point.  I think we all become used to disappointment, and the incidence level of THAT for me in the realm of the issues I&#x27;ve always had with my hair is particularly high, which is why I&#x27;m practically vibrating as I&#x27;m writing this review.  (Also, I did purchase a \\&quot;Roots Only\\&quot; applicator bottle separately, from another company,which works extremely well with this product. I&#x27;m super clumsy, which may not be an issue for you.)  I have to say, the Green Touch people are the real deal--I give them (and this product) an A+ with a bullet and OMG can I DANCE to it...;o]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 01-03-15 (original review 09-28-14): Finally saw my hair stylist for the first time since I&#x27;ve been using--he confirmed the hair growth and told me to update my review, LOL--and he&#x27;s using HIS first bottle of the saw palmetto formula...;o]</li>
    <li> This burned my eyeballs to a point that I wanted them out . The ingredients this potion is made of are great, except the Cayenne eye blinding compound</li>
    <li> Less fall out but its not going to stop it the first day!! Very strong! Make sure to wash your hands very well after using this because it will burn everywhere you touch! and its hard to rinse off! Also note: the cayenne is strong so double shampoo and make sure to bend over so that the water doesn&#x27;t run down your body because this will leave a burning path!</li>
</ol>
