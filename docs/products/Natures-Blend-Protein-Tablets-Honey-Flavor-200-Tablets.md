<li> The most nasty tasting I have ever had and to chew six tablets no thanks</li>
<li> it was a waste of time and money</li>
<li> Horrible, and very chalky tasting.</li>

    <li> Only 1/2 of a gram of protein per tablet!</li>
    <li> Horrible, and very chalky tasting.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Taste great too!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I wasn&#x27;t getting enough protein in my diet. They taste good and I seem to have a spike in energy after I eat them which is great. For some reason, I pictured them looking almost like jelly candies lol They are actually round, solid and chewable kind of like a rolaid. I wish there were a little more protein in one serving (you have to eat 6 of these for 3g of protein) but other than that, they&#x27;re great!</li>
