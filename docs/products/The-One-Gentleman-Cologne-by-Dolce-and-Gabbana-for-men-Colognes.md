      <li>He enjoyed this very much!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Its light, but manly.</li>
      <li>fast shipping, big bottle, smells awesome.</li>
      <li>Great smell all the way around, lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>and I never heard of it until I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Great clean scent</li>
      <li>but this one made a nice masculine addition to the group.</li>
      <li>Overall, the experience was good</li>
      <li>this cologne was a fair amount cheaper than I could find at local stores.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you are looking for a new cologne, nice woodsy smell without overwhelming.</li>
      <li>mild version of the one but still lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>It fades quick.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this frag, check out John Varvatos classic/vintage for a similar feel.</li>
      <li>Nothing that really stands out, certainly not bad per say, but nothing fantastic (imo)</li>
      <li>I originally thought I was getting another version of D&amp;G, the first time I got this.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorites that is out on the street right now.</li>
      <li>juuust right.</li>
      <li>did I make the right one.</li>
      <li>It also shipped out very fast.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance initially but it doesn&#x27;t stick with you through the day and doesn&#x27;t project at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>On the one hand, i love it due to the warmth if exudes, yet its fresh in its opening.</li>
      <li>Certainly a compliment getter.</li>
      <li>Love the scent, wish it lasted a little longer, but still worth the money.</li>
      <li>My wife loves it and that&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal, folks.</li>
      <li>Well I don&#x27;t much about cologne (I buy what I smell on people) and</li>
      <li>The company shipped it fast</li>
      <li>He doesnt really care what he wears for cologne, but I do</li>
      <li>arrived fast and in one piece</li>
      <li>I will buy again in the near future on more colongne</li>
      <li>I cheated with a perfume that does not look anything like the original, is a big mistake buying perfumes by the internet, because politics is that in no perfume claim or guarantees of what you are buying, do not do what I</li>
      <li>Decent price.</li>
      <li>Different on the nose for sure but same atmosphere.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>A nice subtle, floral (?)</li>
      <li>I will definitely be coming here first.</li>
      <li>but then it has a menly classy smell...</li>
      <li>I know why, it is different, and at times light, but then heavy.</li>
      <li>I would say the smell of The One Gentleman is stronger and more bold, but not in a bad way.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, i cant tell if the drydown is just my nose, or am i standing in my high school locker room in 1992 with the smell of sweat and banana peels in the trash can next to the exit door.</li>

<li> It is a very distinctive, but delicate scent.</li>
<li> While I initially had some problems with &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34; cologne smell being too subtle, I find that it&#x27;s much more apparent than &amp;#34;The One Gentleman.&amp;#34; I am almost done with this bottle, which is a big disappointment since I wanted it to last longer.</li>
<li> Never got a single complement wearing it.</li>
<li> Very different from the usual D&amp;G frag.</li>
<li> order other items with it as well.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;ll have to make due with what I have and was delivered to my mailbox.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t however boxed in its original box (disappointed as it is a gift)</li>
<li> the only thing i found weird is that says it&#x27;s a spray, but it&#x27;s not, you have to pour it with your fingers....</li>
<li> i was not pleased about that</li>
<li> delivery time was quite slow</li>
<li> , that&#x27;s when things gets weird.</li>
<li> If you want the ladies to go crazy buy this product.</li>
<li> However D&amp;G really shocked me with this scent.</li>
<li> I have a love/ hate with this frag.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wear it 4-5 days a week.  I occasionally am complimented and asked what it is I am wearing. Decent price.</li>
    <li> The price for this cologne is a steal! Bought it as a gift for my father and he loved the smell. It also shipped out very fast. Next time I need to buy cologne I will definitely be coming here first.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband...he likes the smell and I like the smell on him. A nice subtle, floral (?) like smell, but not feminine floral. Also, the Amazon price is a lot lower than dept. stores.</li>
    <li> I also own a bottle of D&amp;G 11 La Force.  I would say the smell of The One Gentleman is stronger and more bold, but not in a bad way.  I think it is a great cologn to have in ones collection.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant fragrance  that is not too over powering.  I have received many compliments on it.  I highly recommend it.  The seller shipped out the product within a couple of days after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This cologne has a smoky smell to it - it&#x27;s really great. I normally like really light smells (Happy, Yves St Lauren, etc) but this one made a nice masculine addition to the group.</li>
    <li> I cheated with a perfume that does not look anything like the original, is a big mistake buying perfumes by the internet, because politics is that in no perfume claim or guarantees of what you are buying, do not do what I I let myself be fooled by fakes.</li>
    <li> I have a love/ hate with this frag. On the one hand, i love it due to the warmth if exudes, yet its fresh in its opening. On the other hand, i cant tell if the drydown is just my nose, or am i standing in my high school locker room in 1992 with the smell of sweat and banana peels in the trash can next to the exit door. This is definitely one to find a sample of before you buy the big boy. I give this 4 stars because i feel this one will grow on me. Based on others reviews, many absolutely love this! I know why, it is different, and at times light, but then heavy. Morphs well. Sillage is nill.  Can be a bit cloying.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it smells wonderful on him! Highly recommend if you are looking for a new cologne, nice woodsy smell without overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I order this product as a gift and he loved it.  order other items with it as well.  keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like I remember. I know there are lots of knock-off and inferior versions of most colognes and suspect i may have received one. Also, amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return this, something about it being &amp;#34;hazardous.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great smell all the way around, lasts a long time.  One of my favorites that is out on the street right now.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent.  Not over powering like some.  Soft, fresh fragrance perfect for work or play.  You will like this one.</li>
    <li> While I initially had some problems with &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34; cologne smell being too subtle, I find that it&#x27;s much more apparent than &amp;#34;The One Gentleman.&amp;#34; I am almost done with this bottle, which is a big disappointment since I wanted it to last longer. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this item again simply because it takes a lot of sprays for you to notice the smell. I would consider switching back to &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34; or finding another cologne.</li>
    <li> If you want the ladies to go crazy buy this product. In addition, do not spray more than 3 squirts</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne and the price offered here is the best I have found anywhere. I will continue to buy it here as I need it.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance initially but it doesn&#x27;t stick with you through the day and doesn&#x27;t project at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its light, but manly. Hint of powder and woods. Great scent, but which is projected more. Wont order again.</li>
    <li> What else can you expect from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. This was a gift and I never heard of it until I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Great clean scent</li>
    <li> It is a very distinctive, but delicate scent. It is not overpowering, but definitely attracts the nose.</li>
    <li> Thank you! arrived fast and in one piece</li>
    <li> Always getting compliments .</li>
    <li> Women love it . Its good for a date night and it sets in really good. I would definately purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He doesnt really care what he wears for cologne, but I do and I do like it.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, I would recommend to anyone regardless of age</li>
    <li> fast shipping, big bottle, smells awesome. Thanks for the great product.I will buy again in the near future on more colongne</li>
    <li> Great product and good price. Love the scent, wish it lasted a little longer, but still worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, folks. It makes my odor probs be gone and now I feel splendiferous. Girls comment on my scent, with nice remarks... sometimes guys do too, that&#x27;s when things gets weird.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD, THAT AROMA EXECUTIVE IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME, LOVE AND STAYED WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE. RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
    <li> this cologne was a fair amount cheaper than I could find at local stores.  I originally thought I was getting another version of D&amp;G, the first time I got this.  I ended up liking this cologne better and have stayed with it.  The company shipped it fast and I got what I wanted.  Good all the way around.</li>
    <li> Got this because I have The One, I still think that The One is better, but this one still holds it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> mild version of the one but still lasts all day.  great for any event i will always keep a bottle of this</li>
    <li> i bought this parfum, for valantine&#x27;s day for my boyfriend, at the begining when he open the bottle i didn&#x27;t like it but then it has a menly classy smell...i really love it...the only thing i found weird is that says it&#x27;s a spray, but it&#x27;s not, you have to pour it with your fingers....</li>
    <li> I so enjoyed getting to make this Christmas special for my family but, mostly for my Wonderful husband. He enjoyed this very much!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. I have it on now. My wife loves it and that&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
    <li> Dolce &amp; Gabana frags are often ... meh. Nothing that really stands out, certainly not bad per say, but nothing fantastic (imo) However D&amp;G really shocked me with this scent. Very different from the usual D&amp;G frag. Certainly a compliment getter. Lasts a good time and projects juuust right. Very pleased with this frag, check out John Varvatos classic/vintage for a similar feel. Different on the nose for sure but same atmosphere.</li>
    <li> Dolce&amp;Gabbana released two scents with similar bases, but quite different aspects.  This one is a softer version of The One, employing warmer notes than the spicier personality of The One.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t last long and it hasn&#x27;t got that \\&quot;Wow\\&quot; effect. It fades quick. Never got a single complement wearing it.</li>
    <li> delivery time was quite slow i was not pleased about that</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t much about cologne (I buy what I smell on people) and this cologne was recommend by a coworker so I went ahead and decided to make the purchase and boy did I make the right one. This smells awesome! I received the item on time. It wasn&#x27;t however boxed in its original box (disappointed as it is a gift) but I&#x27;ll have to make due with what I have and was delivered to my mailbox. Perfect fit inside. Overall, the experience was good and I would recommend buying again.</li>
