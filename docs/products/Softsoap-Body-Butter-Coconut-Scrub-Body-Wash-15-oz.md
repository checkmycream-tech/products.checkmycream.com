      <li>Loved that it was PRIME and got quickly!  </li>
      <li>great price and l already love this product, I order every time I run out right from here.</li>
      <li>My favorite coconut scrub.</li>
      <li>I love that it is part of a 2 pack</li>
      <li>I love this scrub it smells like heaven.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed using Softsoap&#x27;s antibacterial hand soaps in the liquid form before</li>
      <li>so I knew I was taking a risk and not being able to smell it before purchasing it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I had ran out and knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to make it to the store soon</li>
      <li>My favorite bodywash.</li>
      <li>Have used the product many times and love it.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t care for the exfoliation scrub, but it does smell good and it was a good value for two of them.</li>
      <li>and I love how smooth it feels.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft and smelling great.</li>
      <li>Nice product at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>So in the end....delivered fine but price, based on their company title, was no bargain.</li>
      <li>and I like cheap.</li>
      <li>and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
      <li>This soft-soap is aweeeeeee, wow, so soft and wonderful smelling</li>
      <li>I feel super clean afterwords</li>
      <li>I expect a decent amount of lather, a pleasant scent, an agent that softens but also cleanses leaving me clean and fresh and soft</li>
      <li>super saver on the label</li>
      <li>simply because there are much better products in this price point that are more organic.</li>
      <li>Love this product , highly recommended</li>
      <li>fun useful coconut gift</li>
      <li>skin feels like silk right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>simply because there are much better products in this price point that are more organic.ast ingredient is &amp;#34;Cocos Nucifera Oil&amp;#34;, which is not the white flesh</li>
      <li>My favorite retail drugstore chain CVS bombed me with coupons last week</li>
      <li>was actually really excited about exfoliating with pieces of coconut because I thought it would be a healthy alternative to some of the little beads and things that are found in exfoliating body washes.</li>
      <li>Great product; it&#x27;s a gentle exfoliating body wash and the coconut scent is subtle.</li>
      <li>but I thought to myself that the price seemed higher than normal.</li>
      <li>Sure enough it was because tonight I am walking thru Publix, which is where I shop normally for the body wash, and saw their normal price of $4.50 per.</li>
      <li>good scrub not too harsh and didnt dry out my skin</li>
      <li>the photo on the bottle is of an actual coconut, seeming to depict the brown outside filled with this body wash inside of it.</li>
      <li>very soft when lathered not too abrasive.</li>
      <li>but this product is actually quite deceptive in its claims on the packaging which is all you can go on when purchasing something like this for the first time online.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for my seven and five year old.</li>
      <li>This made my skin soft again and restored it&#x27;s natural glow.  </li>
      <li>so I made a fast dash to my local store at the tail end of a blizzard.</li>
      <li>It definitely removes dead skin, softens the skin, and leaves me feeling both fresh and clean for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;The final cost for all this wonderfuless minus all the incentives?</li>
      <li>5/5 Very smooth and thick along with having little beads in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While other reviewers like that the smell is mild, I actually wanted something that might linger a little bit and to me, this body wash does not smell like coconut at all.</li>

<li> there is nothing remotely close to crushed coconut inside this product</li>
<li> Naively,  I figured that coconut was pretty hard to screw up.</li>
<li> so Amazon recommended this body wash based on my other purchases.</li>
<li> After receiving it and using it in the shower for the first time, I was disappointed by the smell but also by the fact that there is no actual coconut in this product.  </li>
<li> It contains micro beads as well as what appears to be some sort of grit to remove the layer of dead skin.</li>
<li> The fragrance added and the small amount of oil from the palm is how Softsoap is claiming that this is coconut body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I have been on a coconut kick lately where I am using coconut oil as a moisturizer at night and also in my hair as a conditioner overnight</li>
<li> I have extremely bad skin.</li>

    <li> Good deal, smells great. Leaves lots of beads in your shower when your done though.</li>
    <li> Great product; it&#x27;s a gentle exfoliating body wash and the coconut scent is subtle. The two count is a bargain and will order again.</li>

While other reviewers like that the smell is mild, I actually wanted something that might linger a little bit and to me, this body wash does not smell like coconut at all. Same goes for my girlfriend....she doesn&#x27;t like the smell either. I don&#x27;t mind the smell but this product is actually quite deceptive in its claims on the packaging which is all you can go on when purchasing something like this for the first time online. You can read reviews and look at the product description and what the bottle actually says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because the front of the bottle claims that this &amp;#34;body butter coconut scrub body buff wash has crushed coconut and jojoba butter extracts.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually really excited about exfoliating with pieces of coconut because I thought it would be a healthy alternative to some of the little beads and things that are found in exfoliating body washes. After receiving it and using it in the shower for the first time, I was disappointed by the smell but also by the fact that there is no actual coconut in this product.  the photo on the bottle is of an actual coconut, seeming to depict the brown outside filled with this body wash inside of it. That would lead you to believe that there is part of that flash of the coconut used in the product since it claims that there is crushed coconut in the product. There is not.  there is nothing remotely close to crushed coconut inside this product but there are a ton of chemicals. The last ingredient, meaning there is the smallest amount of all that is listed the last ingredient is &amp;#34;Cocos Nucifera Oil&amp;#34;, which is not the white flesh/edible part of the coconut that we all think of...it is the entire palm, which can grow up to 100 feet tall.  The fragrance added and the small amount of oil from the palm is how Softsoap is claiming that this is coconut body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a film on your skin after showering that feels like lotion....and I would assume that&#x27;s from the chemicals and the jojoba butter that is the second to last ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the label before buying it but it was an impulse buy.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again...simply because there are much better products in this price point that are more organic.ast ingredient is &amp;#34;Cocos Nucifera Oil&amp;#34;, which is not the white flesh/edible part of the coconut that we all think of...it is the entire palm, which can grow up to 100 feet tall.

    <li> this stuff is awesome. skin feels like silk right out of the shower. will buy again!</li>
    <li> great price and l already love this product, I order every time I run out right from here.</li>
    <li> Definitely got what I paid for. Have used the product many times and love it. I had ran out and knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to make it to the store soon so I went ahead and ordered the 2 for $12. It said super saver on the label online but I thought to myself that the price seemed higher than normal. Sure enough it was because tonight I am walking thru Publix, which is where I shop normally for the body wash, and saw their normal price of $4.50 per. Lol. So in the end....delivered fine but price, based on their company title, was no bargain.</li>
    <li> Loved the price for two!  Loved that it was PRIME and got quickly!  This is the BEST soap! I love the smell and I love how smooth it feels.  I have been using the same soap FOREVER... and now have switched to this!  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> best deal for the price</li>
    <li> Wonderful bubbles. Gentle enough for my seven and five year old. Nice scent and texture. Wonderful to get such a great value.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft and smelling great.</li>
    <li> This made my skin soft again and restored it&#x27;s natural glow.  Love it</li>
    <li> Love this product , highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love the smell, makes skin feel silky smooth and great that it comes in. 2 pack.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for the exfoliation scrub, but it does smell good and it was a good value for two of them.</li>
    <li> My favorite bodywash. Works amazing!</li>
    <li> good scrub not too harsh and didnt dry out my skin</li>
    <li> So, a review about body wash...&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 5/5 (Has a very good smell and doesn&#x27;t over kill the scent)&lt;br /&gt;Texture: 5/5 Very smooth and thick along with having little beads in it.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: 5/5 I feel super clean afterwords and my skin feels so smooth. This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* As a disclaimer, I am a male in my 20s, 6ft, athletic/gym enthusiast.</li>
    <li> My favorite coconut scrub.</li>
    <li> The only body soap I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> This soft-soap is aweeeeeee, wow, so soft and wonderful smelling and I got it for a great price.  Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely bad skin. This body wash is the best soap I have ever used for my skin condition.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves this product</li>
    <li> I like good and I like cheap. My favorite retail drugstore chain CVS bombed me with coupons last week and I was running low on body wash/exfoliant so I made a fast dash to my local store at the tail end of a blizzard. I guess this speaks volumes of my customer loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a week. My pronouncement is wonderful stuff for the price.&lt;br /&gt;What does one think of a body wash/exfoliant? I expect a decent amount of lather, a pleasant scent, an agent that softens but also cleanses leaving me clean and fresh and soft all over.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t appear to contain coconut, but has the smell. It contains micro beads as well as what appears to be some sort of grit to remove the layer of dead skin. It produces an enormous amount of suds. It definitely removes dead skin, softens the skin, and leaves me feeling both fresh and clean for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;The final cost for all this wonderfuless minus all the incentives? About .63 after CVS Cash and a $2 coupon. I also received $2 CVS Cash toward a future purchase. I guess you might say I got this for nothing. The cool thing is that this product is very good.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub it smells like heaven. My skin feels fresher and cleaner. I will buy this again. I love that it is part of a 2 pack so I don&#x27;t have to buy it constantly.</li>
    <li> fun useful coconut gift</li>
    <li> Love this! smells great! and it&#x27;s amazing to shave with :D</li>
    <li> Smells great! very soft when lathered not too abrasive. good for a very mild exfoliation.</li>
    <li> great body wash but target has the 2pl for 5.72</li>
    <li> Nice product at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
