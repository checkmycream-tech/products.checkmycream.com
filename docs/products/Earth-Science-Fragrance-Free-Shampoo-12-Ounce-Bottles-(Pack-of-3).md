      <li>Very nice product worth the money.</li>
      <li>I find it spreads better that way,</li>
      <li>I even had one in the shower using a product I use to be able to use because they changed the product to &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Tried several shampoos and this one comes out best.</li>
      <li>It is okay for me in the winter as it does not seem to strip my hair.</li>
      <li>is more efficient, and rinses easier.&lt;br</li>

      <li>After I started using this shampoo my scalp started looking healthy again, as does my hair.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s urns enter and has no toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>At over $23 dollars, this is a bit steep for one bottle :)</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve ordered from this supplier and received 3 bottles as described, then I&#x27;m an exception, and I&#x27;m pleased you did not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>The fact that it is on Prime, just makes it that much more affordable.</li>
      <li>i have chemical sensitivities so finding unscented products is challenging.</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and leaves my hair &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
      <li>I find that the Earth Science fragrance free line (conditioner, and even facial moisturizer) are excellent.  </li>
      <li>Also, I use their conditioner and it does a great job leaving my hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I do love this product, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have this cheap plastic smell.</li>
      <li>happen to be allergic to perfumes and colognes, as well as strong scents.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up just enough to feel good in the hair, and (by accident) I&#x27;ve learned that it is a great soap for my whole body.</li>
      <li>As with most fragrance free products there is an inherently unique smell -</li>
      <li>Huge fan of earth science products.</li>
      <li>Given my sensitivity to perfuming agents, I require fragrance free shampoo.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fantastic for my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>fantastic shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Conditioner available also.</li>
      <li>It now has a cheap plastic smell with it.</li>
      <li>This product is truly free of fragrance as the ingredients themselves have no fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is frangrance free but it seem to be free of almost everything else.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t order it again unless I know it will be packaged securely.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Good quality natural shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This one looked good, but after the first wash, it was doing the very things I was trying to avoid.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smelling clean (smelling like nothing, basically, which is what I want from a shampoo).  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is more gentle, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or fade out my hair.  </li>
      <li>I find that this shampoo is good at cleaning, has reasonable suds, and does the job on normal hair.  </li>
      <li>This is the best price I have been able to find (compared to local stores and other websites)</li>
      <li>You would be surprised how many things contain them.  </li>
      <li>I developed many allergies after having my daughter and every shampoo I tried made my head itch.</li>
      <li>so many &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or sensitive skin products don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>Most of the hypoallergenic shampoos I tried didn&#x27;t clean well or left my hair feeling funny.</li>
      <li>Even though I am a sucker for good smells, I don&#x27;t mind that this is fragrance free because it does not clash with my conditioner.</li>
      <li>Most shampoos either give me a rash, or make my scalp super dry and flakey.</li>
      <li>I tightened each bottle top and washed the bottles before storing for later use.</li>
      <li>the price is reasonable too!</li>
      <li>I am not eager to find an appropriate way to wrap them and send them back.  </li>
      <li>So decided to try the iternet and your ad showed up first.  </li>
      <li>Not exactly a lather king, but does clean, and comes in ez to handle bottle, and price was fair, so it&#x27;s on my regular list now.</li>
      <li>It really is fragrance free, unlike other fragrance free products that have chemical smells.</li>
      <li>I do love this fragrance-free conditioner, but ever since they started putting it in these new plastic bottles it smells different.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t want to commit to 3 bottles this shampoo is also carried at whole foods.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is totally fragrance free, the conditioner does smell alittle like rubbing alcohol but after you rinse it out you cannot smell it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate finally finding a shampoo that is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
      <li>The three-pack is economic and the subscription means I never have to run out</li>
      <li>It rinses off very well and seems to leave my hair and skin moisturized but not oily/sticky/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
      <li>I am assuming that not that much shampoo was lost in each bottle</li>
      <li>My wife uses it and really likes it because it does not contain perfumes</li>
      <li>This shampoo works very well, and has no offensive odor at all.</li>
      <li>and she likes it very.</li>
      <li>I took a chance and bought this product recently, in hopes that it would be that ever elusive shampoo that would clean my hair and scalp without stripping or burning.</li>
      <li>Also, now that I&#x27;m back in a low humidity location, I&#x27;ll start using the Earth Science fragrance free conditioner, too!</li>
      <li>I ordered this shampoo specifically because the ingredients list that the manufacturer posted on Amazon does not include Cocamidopropyl Betaine, a coconut derivative, since I am highly allergic to coconut.</li>
      <li>Overall a fantastic everyday shampoo that is indeed fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>Right now, it is the only one I can use.</li>
      <li>Added bonus - I started using this shampoo when I was pregnant and EVERYTHING made me sick to my stomach - happily</li>
      <li>This shampoo is truly fragrance free and does not leave any trace amounts of foreign smell or bothering odor.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I appreciate finally finding a shampoo that is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t make me itch. Unfortunately, this particular shipment spilled due to poorly-secured packaging. The bottles do not have a proper seal, therefore they must be taped shut to prevent leakage. Never ship a product in a plastic container without doing this. I won&#x27;t order it again unless I know it will be packaged securely.</li>
    <li> I have ultra sensitive skin and this shampoo does not cause me any problems. It works well.</li>
    <li> Not much lather. It is frangrance free but it seem to be free of almost everything else.  I would NOT recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am trying to avoid using any products with sulfates as I have recently become aware that I am sensitive to them. You would be surprised how many things contain them.  I discovered this shampoo contains sodium myreth sulfate which is not listed as part of the ingredient list on Amazon&#x27;s description. So if you are wanting to avoid sulfate products this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  Most say sodium laurel sulfate is the one to really avoid but I&#x27;ve also read that both can be bad and if you are sensitive to sulfates anything with the word sulfate or sulfite in it should be avoided.</li>
    <li> I hate scented things, and this stuff has no scent. It lathers up just enough to feel good in the hair, and (by accident) I&#x27;ve learned that it is a great soap for my whole body. It rinses off very well and seems to leave my hair and skin moisturized but not oily/sticky/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff. Nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is truly fragrance free and does not leave any trace amounts of foreign smell or bothering odor.  As a shampoo it is great.</li>
    <li> I do love this fragrance-free conditioner, but ever since they started putting it in these new plastic bottles it smells different. It now has a cheap plastic smell with it. I&#x27;ve even put it in an old plastic bottle it used to come in and the smell is still bad, but not quite as strong. I do love this product, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have this cheap plastic smell. It used to not smell that way when it came in the white and purple bottle.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp &amp; skin. I have been using this shampoo for quite some time now with out any problems. Not only is it gentle on my hair &amp; scalp the price is reasonable too!</li>
    <li> It lathers nicely and leaves my hair &amp;#34;squeeky&amp;#34; clean.  And there are no toxic chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to perfumes, and the last fragrance-free shampoo I had was really harsh on my dyed hair, fading it out almost immediately.  This shampoo is more gentle, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or fade out my hair.  Leaves my hair smelling clean (smelling like nothing, basically, which is what I want from a shampoo).  Sulfates are one of the few things I can tolerate, so I don&#x27;t have a problem with them.</li>
    <li> only shampoo I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out!</li>
    <li> If you are tired of buying hypoallergenic products that still cause a skin reaction, search no more, this is it.  It truly is fragrance free, but does not have a bad scent, as some do.  (How boring, though, I want my tresses the scent of gardenia and ginger!).  Lathers well, rinses well, hair is silky. I&#x27;ve tried other products that either do not lather or smell like a clay pit, and I always come back to this.  I&#x27;ve bought this for years.  Conditioner available also.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I used to use Avalon , but they changed the formula and it was no longer for me. Found Earth Science on amazon and decided to try it bc it had good reviews. It is amazing! Left my long curly hair so soft and not frizzy at all. The shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t make my scalp itch either. The shampoo is totally fragrance free, the conditioner does smell alittle like rubbing alcohol but after you rinse it out you cannot smell it. Would reccomend this product to anyone looking to replace their Avalon products!</li>
    <li> Overall a fantastic everyday shampoo that is indeed fragrance free.  I have severe fragrance sensitivity (smell) and skin sensitivity during allergy season especially.  Unfortunately I also have very oily skin and hair/scalp so many &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or sensitive skin products don&#x27;t work for me.  I find that the Earth Science fragrance free line (conditioner, and even facial moisturizer) are excellent.  Unlike some other brands &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products (which often have some sort of faint or strange smell), Earth Science ff shampoo and conditioner are truly odorless.  I find that this shampoo is good at cleaning, has reasonable suds, and does the job on normal hair.  I find that in the summer, when my hair is more oily or dirty from workouts, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well and I will wash twice in one shower.  It is okay for me in the winter as it does not seem to strip my hair.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me I was allergic to the fragrance in the products I was using.  I did some research and I found this product.  It is the best bargain I believe.  It last me a long time and it lathers and rinses like regular shampoo.  I do miss my fragrances, but I do appreciate not breaking out from all the harsh chemicals.  Also, I use their conditioner and it does a great job leaving my hair soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that cleans my oily scalp well.  Plus there is no smell to my hair which is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo with anyone with allergies like mine.  Makes hair soft and manageable .  Very nice product worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Right now, it is the only one I can use. All others I have tried have had other problems. But this works perfect. and it is nice to be able to get 3 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I not only use it as a hair shampoo, but as an unscented body wash.  It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to reorder more when this runs out.  As with any shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever used, I put some in a separate container and dilute it 1 part shampoo to about 2 parts water.  I find it spreads better that way, is more efficient, and rinses easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends and relatives, especially any of them who have allergies.</li>
    <li> One of the few shampoos without scent.  The only one use!</li>
    <li> I developed many allergies after having my daughter and every shampoo I tried made my head itch. Most of the hypoallergenic shampoos I tried didn&#x27;t clean well or left my hair feeling funny. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 5 years and I love it. It cleans well and, paired with their conditioner, leaves my hair soft and shiny. This is the best price I have been able to find (compared to local stores and other websites)</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for me.  Can&#x27;t tolerate shampoos with perfume in them and it was impossible to find shampoo free in any of the stores I go to.  So decided to try the iternet and your ad showed up first.  Thanks.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I got this as a prize from [...] I and have used it since then. I have to say that it is one of the best shampoos I have used. It really is fragrance free, unlike other fragrance free products that have chemical smells. It is fairly thick, so with a moderate quantity I get my hair squeaky clean. It also leaves my hair soft and untangled, something that is usually a problem with other shampoos since I have really long hair. I still use conditioner to prevent breakage but my hair feels so soft I feel I could go without it. Even though I am a sucker for good smells, I don&#x27;t mind that this is fragrance free because it does not clash with my conditioner. I would recommend it to people with sensitivities since it does not have many of the bad stuff you find in other personal care products like SLS. My husband who has severe dandruff has seen great improvement with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Given my sensitivity to perfuming agents, I require fragrance free shampoo. Not only is this product truly hypoallergenic, it cleans without being too harsh - it is perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one star review is a warning to other purchasers from this supplier - I ordered this, received only one bottle, contacted Amazon customer service who immediately ordered me a replacement and sent it overnight (delivered on a Saturday), and again I only received one bottle. At over $23 dollars, this is a bit steep for one bottle :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ordered from this supplier and received 3 bottles as described, then I&#x27;m an exception, and I&#x27;m pleased you did not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is mislabeled, hopefully this will prompt the supplier to either change the description and price for one bottle, or correct their problem with shipping.</li>
    <li> If you need a good shampoo that will not give you&lt;br /&gt;a headache from the ingredients then this is the one to use.  This has a light smell that is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Good quality natural shampoo.  My wife uses it and really likes it because it does not contain perfumes</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well, and has no offensive odor at all. Glad to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and bought it here because the one store that had carried this product has discontinued it.  It was great knowing I can get online for a slightly lower cost without having to travel.&lt;br /&gt;I happen to be allergic to perfumes and colognes, as well as strong scents.  It is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t have any scent. (I get severe asthma attacks)  I even had one in the shower using a product I use to be able to use because they changed the product to &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;.</li>

I shampoo everyday, and like to alternate shampoo brands. This one looked good, but after the first wash, it was doing the very things I was trying to avoid. I even mixed a half capful in a pint of water, just in case it was a bit too strong. Well, for two days afterward my scalp had a low grade burning sensation. My natural wavy hair had little body, and hung rather straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Sodium Myreth Sulfate is an inexpensive ingredient, and closely related to other sodium sulfates, which are very harsh. It seems that the company, based in Santa Barbara, California, is making a bundle of profit from their low quality, overly priced product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, hey, I have the cleanest dishes in the neighborhood. One tiny squeeze of the bottle, and I create enough suds for a whole dish pan full of dirty dishes. It will take quite a while to use up the bottle, so the $7.00 I lost won&#x27;t seem so bad, afterall.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time along with the conditioner. They&#x27;re fantastic for my hair and scalp. Love that it&#x27;s urns enter and has no toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is in here that is causing problems but when I used this shampoo it made my scalp sting.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance-free shampoo I have ever used. Does a wonderful job of cleaning my hair without residue. No fragrance can be detected.</li>
    <li> we love it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the corresponding conditioner seems to have added an apricot like odor to which my wife has a weak negative response</li>
    <li> I am so happy with Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo!  My hair is shiny and soft and there is NO fragrance.  Just a little goes a long long way.  The fact that it is on Prime, just makes it that much more affordable.</li>
    <li> Only non fragrance or non-scented shampoo I have found that I like.  Give this product 5 stars!  Oh the shipping and speed shipped were good also!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least ten years. I cannot be exposed to fragrances, and this is the best shampoo I have found, and I tried many others. Also, now that I&#x27;m back in a low humidity location, I&#x27;ll start using the Earth Science fragrance free conditioner, too!</li>
    <li> every time i try something else i keep coming back.  fantastic shampoo.  i do not notice as much hair shedding or scalp sensitivity since i switched, but the reduced shedding could be other factors. if you don&#x27;t want to commit to 3 bottles this shampoo is also carried at whole foods.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers great...no smell. Love it. Will purchase again. Highly recommend this product if you are fragrance and chemical sensitive</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for super thick evil curly hair is hard to find in the all natural fragrance free category. I have tried almost every kind on this website and this is by far the best kind. All the others horribly matt my hair when I&#x27;m trying to lather and wash my scalp, or smell weird, or both. This one helps me to not trap my hands in my hair while trying to wash it, letting me get through my hair and wash it thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like smelly soaps, shampoos, cleaning liquids, etc., so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good stuff with no smell. Tried several shampoos and this one comes out best. Not exactly a lather king, but does clean, and comes in ez to handle bottle, and price was fair, so it&#x27;s on my regular list now.</li>
    <li> Most shampoos either give me a rash, or make my scalp super dry and flakey. After I started using this shampoo my scalp started looking healthy again, as does my hair. Added bonus - I started using this shampoo when I was pregnant and EVERYTHING made me sick to my stomach - happily, I found this and no longer felt like I was going to get sick every time I took a shower. As with most fragrance free products there is an inherently unique smell - but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> The pack of 3 bottles arrived in a plastic wrapping.  So far so good.  But when I opened it and tried to take out one bottle I discovered it was coated with the shampoo and the same was true of the other bottles.  I tightened each bottle top and washed the bottles before storing for later use. I am not eager to find an appropriate way to wrap them and send them back.  I am assuming that not that much shampoo was lost in each bottle but it was a surprising and unwelcome event.  The manufacturer, distributor and merchant should examine their stock and their procedures to check this out to avoid producing a lot of disappointed customers who, like me, will think at least twice before buying liquid products through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This product is truly free of fragrance as the ingredients themselves have no fragrance.  It is very difficult to find items that are truly free of scents.  Cleans well and leaves no residue on the hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo specifically because the ingredients list that the manufacturer posted on Amazon does not include Cocamidopropyl Betaine, a coconut derivative, since I am highly allergic to coconut. I am extremely angry that the makers of this product omitted this ingredient (which is second in the ingredients list on the bottle, and therefore a big part of the product). This is false advertising, so I will not be buying anything from this company ever again.</li>
    <li> Great price. i have chemical sensitivities so finding unscented products is challenging. The three-pack is economic and the subscription means I never have to run out</li>
    <li> not good for me, it is drying and if you can see the first ingredient there is sodium....not buying it again, still need to find a good one,</li>
    <li> Huge fan of earth science products.</li>
    <li> My wife Janice has been using this product for some time and she likes it very. It does what she needs to do.</li>
