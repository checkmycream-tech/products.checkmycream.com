      <li>Ok I have oily skin</li>
      <li>I achieved better results by mixing 1 drop of tamanu oil into my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Rinse hands with massage face until most of the oil is off.</li>
      <li>Best facial cleaner ever !  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it really does work like all the other reviews say. man it cleans!</li>
    <li> I bought this after Kandie Johnson, the make up artist recommended it as one of her &amp;#34;favorite things&amp;#34; on Youtube in February. She was correct this cleanser is amazing. No breakouts or oily residue.  I&#x27;m 44 and always using expensive cleaners for aging skin, so this was a nice surprise without the pricey tag.  My skin feels wonderful and looks so bright!  Dry winter skin is now soft and pretty with a healthy glow. My skin feels fabulous and this will definitely be my go to cleanser!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work well enough. I&#x27;m sure that I can have the same effects from coconut oil but I hate he smell. I did however, still have to use my regular facial cleanser. This stuff works great for getting rid of makeup, but not so much the impurities in my face. I wear makeup quite regularly so I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Cleans wonderfully, takes off make up and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I love these small sizes to take on the go!</li>
    <li> Love the product, love the travel size!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing oil for about 3 months now, and I&#x27;ve barely used up one bottle! I don&#x27;t wear makeup EVERY day, so that&#x27;s probably why I haven&#x27;t gone through more already. DHC Deep Cleansing Oil is really all it&#x27;s cracked up to be--it&#x27;s smooth, washes off cleanly with water, has only a very light scent to it (basically like olive oil). Just a few drops on my fingertips will dissolve my eye makeup wonderfully, and unlike other makeup removers I have used with cotton balls, this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes red and irritated, nor does it leave my skin feeling oily or tight and dry. I always follow up with my usual face wash and moisturizer out of habit, but I could honestly leave out the face wash if I didn&#x27;t need the acne-fighting ingredients, because it dissolves and removes the excess oil and dirt from the day quite well.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  I have spent my entire life unable to put anything with oil in it on my face.  My friend sent me this product as a gift and I decided I was going to try it.  My face seems to love it.  It is all I use as a cleanser.  Slathering this on my face each night is something I really look forward to.  These Minis are perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t cleanse my face with anything else! My complexion is the best it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
    <li> Great product, tried it as a result of a mailed sample.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to take to dance  competitions - even caked on mascara comes off quickly and easily, leaving your face soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t been using this from day one of wearing and removing makeup! This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made pertaining to skincare and the removal of my makeup in a very long time! I&#x27;m still amazed at just how clean my face feels after I rinse this! I mean, this is OIL, after all and USUALLY oil and water DON&#x27;T mix! But, in this particular case, they work rather well together! After drying my face I use my Eyptian Magic cream and my face feels like butta - and in the GOOD way! Not greasy at all! After I&#x27;m done with this 3-mini pack I do believe I&#x27;ll be purchasing the full size! However, I have a feeling these will actually last LONGER than the full size for some reason, so I may just repurchase this mini pack!</li>
    <li> I have used this cleansing oil for years now. I thought the mini sizes would be good for travel. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but how could I go wrong?? The same great oil in a travel size. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Perfect sizes since I don&#x27;t need to use too often.  One for home and one for my travel bag and a spare.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really cleans your face. Makeup just falls off after you rub this oil onto your skin. You proabbly need about 5 drops for your entire face, depending on how much makeup (particularly, eye-liner/mascara) you have one. This set comes in a very small container. Each bottle is probably about 3 in tall with oil making up 2in and the cap another 1in. Good travel size bottles.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The seller delivered it to me on time and I like the way it leaves my skin my only drawback is that it does not remove my make up well at all. So I need to use it in the morning when I am not wearing makeup but need something else for nighttime that will remove my mascara. Keep in mind my mascara is NOT waterproof so it normally comes off very easily.</li>
    <li> Great size. Perfect for carry on while flying.</li>
    <li> Little to greasy for me😕</li>
    <li> Love it.  Skin is so soft</li>
    <li> I travel a great deal so need small sized products I love.  This worked out great on my recent trip to Tuscany.</li>
    <li> Very good product for removing makeup.  I really haven&#x27;t found another product that work so well. At first, I believed that this was just another broken promise just to get money.  But after trying it, I was amazed at how effectively it remove 99.99% of my face and eye makeup.  The removal of my stubborn mascara was really a plus for me.  I give it two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Once I started using this product, I never went back to my usual skin cleanser. It has no odor and deep cleans without being greasy. Because it&#x27;s safe to use on eyes, there&#x27;s no need for a separate cleanser to remove waterproof mascara. A few drops will clean your entire face, so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This oil is unbelievable.  Nothing has ever cleaned my face better. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few mths, but never did a review.  You must try this.  I was skeptical at first, thinking &amp;#34;Oil?  On my face? I can&#x27;t!&amp;#34; But, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I usually use wipes to remove my makeup,  but as I got older [35 ish, shhh], I want to keep my skin supple. I rubbed it on. My skin loved it. It soaked it in, Yet what was left on my face, rinsed completely clean. No Residue!!  This oil cleans my skin and removes Every trace of my foundation. At first, I didn&#x27;t trust it. I grabbed an [old faithful] wipe and check for [left behind concealer] Guess what my wipe found? Nothing!! Nothing but clean,  smooth, non tight, glowing skin. A Must Have.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really works.  Delivery excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing oil. I have been using the Tatcha cleansing oil for the past year and recently purchased the DHC because it is half the cost.  It works just as well taking off my make-up and cleaning my skin.  The smaller sizes are great for travel and gym trips.</li>
    <li> I like to take this cleanser with me when I travel and the mini 3-pack makes it easier. Worth the extra $$ to me for the convenience.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my face super dry and tight.  I only use it sporadically when I want a deep cleansing but definitely not every day.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this is the best facial cleanser I have ever tried.  It takes off all of my makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry.  I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this is an amazing find for me.</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because it really does take off your makeup.  Took all my: foundation, eyeliner, eye gel, eye shadow, etc. It did a great job w/out me having to rub too hard.  I did not give five star because I do not use mascara.  I am not sure how well it works taking off harsh / waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28, and this is a little much for my skin since I still breakout. I love the idea of cleansing oil, but may have to wait til my skin is a bit more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absolutely love DHC. I have been purchasing this oil based cleanser for about 12 years now. I started at very acne prone/oily to now combination acne prone skin. I have turned my grandmother, mother, &amp; aunt on to this cleanser. Do not be afraid of using this is if you have acne. This is the only cleanser to prevent cystic acne for me. It cleans so deep, that it&#x27;s the only thing I have found to stop hormonal cystic acne from forming on my skin. If I would go a week without this I would get cystic acne. I am soon to be 29 and I have outgrown the cystic acne, but if I go without this cleanser I break out. The best thing about this cleanser is it is a TRUE makeup remover. Many cleansers are only designed to remove dirt, &amp; oil. This cleanser is capable of breaking down even the heaviest makeup so your skin gets truly clean! For years I tried high &amp; low end, natural cleansers on ebay, everything  &amp; every brand you can think of. 80% of cleansers I was using were not TRUE makeup removers, and this was a big culprit to my acne. DHC IS also great for black heads. DHC deep cleansing oil will bring blackheads to the surface. Try use it on your nose then doing a pore strip- it rocks! I can&#x27;t say enough about this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out, it doesn&#x27;t break me out, it deep cleans. It is my all time favorite beauty product out of every cleanser/makeup product I own. I have tried other brand&#x27;s oils as they are easier to purchase in store but nothing works &amp; rinses clean like DHC. My biggest problem with other oils are they either leave a film behind, or are too stripping. This is the best of the best. I have also tried DHC&#x27;s other cleanings oils- this is still my favorite. I have all the cleansing oil sizes &amp; this one is great for travel &amp; to give a friend a sample. Try dhc you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thought they would be too small but they are great!  You have to squeeze because there is no pump but these little quys pack a punch!</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and my face feels cleaner and more moisturized. It does a superb job of taking of makeup. When I rinse it I do not feel oily or anything. In fact, my face feels as clean as when I used foaming cleansers, but less tight and dry. I am still using my moisturizer twice a day as I usually do and I am very please with how radiant my skin has become.</li>
    <li> The product does not clean makeup off my face as well as cold cream, especially eye makeup.  I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Just tried this and love it already.  Cleaned my skin and left it feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product so far. However, I am using it with a combination of other new items so I can&#x27;t tell if its responsible for my skin improvement. 4 stars because several reviewers said that the product unclogged their pore to the extent that they saw blackheads or whiteheads come out and it really hasn&#x27;t done that for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and cleans my skin with an oily residue. Unfortunately after purchasing it I found out that DHC tests on animals so I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I tried this with the oil cleansing method and ended up with terrible skin. I achieved better results by mixing 1 drop of tamanu oil into my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Although I love this actual product, the mini 3 pack I ordered must have been VERY old and it smelled rancid.  I was able to return it no problem.</li>
    <li> The olive oil cleanser is very good at removing makeup and pollution residue from your skin.It rinses off well and leaves your skin soft and supple.I follow with a toner and moisturiser.The small three pack is great to travel with and one bottle goes a long way even using day &amp; night.</li>
    <li> Great product. Live the minins especially when traveling. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy. I also have super dry skin so it kinda just soaks it all up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it. It cleans away make up easily and leaves a non- greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> works well and convenient size</li>
    <li> It bothers my eyes a little when I use it. Does remove makeup really well.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful cleansing oil and a little goes a long way. The bottles were completely full and they are good for travel. Do not be afraid to use this oil even if you have oily skin. It does wonders with your pores and your face will feel very soft after use.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel good and was good at removing makeup but broke me out after a few days of use.....back to the clearasil for this 50 year old!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST OIL CLEANSER ON THE MARKET IT REMOVES ALL MAKEUP AND LOTION AND LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING SUPER SOFT AND CLEAN</li>
    <li> I had a free sample and decided to use it.  This works very well, doesn&#x27;t leave greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this product on Amazon. I have used it for years. Love the 3 pac of smaller bottles which is perfect for travel and even at thome as a little does the trick of removing makeup and leaving skin soft!</li>
    <li> The product is good, but it&#x27;s a little hard to get out of the small bottles.</li>
    <li> Ok I have oily skin but sometime I get dry &amp; this get the dead skin off,clean your skin(all over) it up to you &amp; moisturize at the same time without leaving you oily Thank DHC</li>
    <li> If you hands are dry, it works really well.  You need to pour a few drops onto your DRY hands, then massage into your face.  After about a minute of massage, rinse your face.  The product is very water soluable, so it rinses off easily and leaves a squeaky, clean face.  However, if your hands are wet, the oil turns kind of a milky color, and starts to disolve.</li>
    <li> love this oil, very light &amp; cleanses beautifully!</li>
    <li> I love this new facial cleanser, who would have thought that an oily cleanser could clean and make my skin so soft without feeling greasy!! I fully intend to buy the larger size when I am done with these three bottles. I learned of this great product from a free sample sent to my house, now I am a believer.</li>
    <li> Great product - cleans off all makeup and prepares me for the second cleansing step.  Convenient size for travel.</li>
    <li> Was introduced to DHC thru a catalogue sent to the house. This is my favorite product from this line. In packable sizes. I feel really good about using this oil as a cleanser. What can be better for your skin than this back to the earth product. It is an olive oil cleanser, yet, believe me, it does not feel greasy! It is a relaxing thing I do for myself at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this after trying Garnier&#x27;s line because I thought the price difference was too tempting. I then got these to sample DHC before committing to the big bottle. Nothing compares to this stuff. It goes on light and removes makeup immediately, and the emulsion is a breeze to wash off. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel filmy or dry and tight, though I use this as a pre-cleanse and follow up with Neutrogena oil free acne wash. It makes my face look amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it is that there is no pump bottle, so you have to squeeze pretty hard to get enough. Usually by then I&#x27;ve used TOO much. For the price per ounce, I don&#x27;t want to waste any product!</li>
    <li> This product is so great that I had to buy the travel size items. It works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the full size stuff. These are so easy to transport and now I have three to take on trips with me!</li>
    <li> Great travel size. I have used this product for at least ten years. It dissolves makeup and leaves skin soft and smooth with just a water rinse.</li>
    <li> great cleanser I am still looking for a cleanser that takes waterproof eyeliner off</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash and makeup remover I have ever used.  It smells like olive oil, and even though it&#x27;s quite clearly an oil, the minute you apply water to your face to rinse it off, it comes off clean and leaves your face clear (no oil) and feeling smooth and moisturized.  I am constantly marveling at how well it does at getting my jet black mascara and eyeliner off.  Sure, it requires a bit of massaging the oil on and around my eyes to make sure it is doing the trick, but in a single face-washing session, I can get all of my makeup off and not have to go back with an eye makeup remover to clean up.  This size is perfect, too, so you can easily take it to the gym or on travels.</li>
    <li> These really clean make up off well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, just what I wanted, no more &amp;#34;soap &#x27;n water&amp;#34; for me</li>
    <li> Great oil! easy to rinse with water! im 29, acne prone, aging  skin. i use it before bed to remove makeup and just cleanse, after that i use toner and cream, works well. Will be buying it again. Only thing, bottle is not sqeezable, its too hard to get oil out, but i removed little cap with hole, and it works better that way. not a best packaging.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product for normal to oily skin!!! Removes my makeup and my face had cleared 100%</li>
    <li> small packaging makes it easier to travel with., oil removes all your make-up, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling oily. pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could try this product and share one with family. This is a very simple cleansing product that is gentle, non irritating and good for getting off makeup. I did not notice anything amazing happening to my skin while using it, and I would definitely need to use an exfoliant twice a week if I kept this in my beauty regime. But this is great if you do more drastic skin enhancements like acid peels or microdermabrasion because it is so gentle, it was the only thing I could wash with that did not irritate my skin after my first home acid peel so I was glad I had it on hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but I order &#x27;here&#x27; versus directly from DHC because they have this auto ordering thing that forces you to order a lot and spend TOO MUCH MONEY.  Way too much money.  They also can be &#x27;pests&#x27; via email.&lt;br /&gt;But ordering here, I get the best product at the lowest possible price.&lt;br /&gt;This WORKS. And I have oily, acne-prone skin!  But I&#x27;m also in my late 50s now and some of the scrubs etc are just too harsh for my sensitive skin.  This product WORKS, it cleans like nobody&#x27;s business and does NOT leave an oily or greasy residue.  It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> Love this oil!!! Bought the small size to try it out. Will be purchasing a large size next. Great product. Really cleans my face. I love oil - I have really dry skin.</li>
    <li> Pros: I love the product!  First off, I like it that, a little bit goes a long way. I can use a small quantity and all the makeup on my face comes off.  Especially since I don&#x27;t want to rub my face  harshly, a couple drops will do the trick! Once,  I wash my face, it leaves my face moisturized and not dry like other products I&#x27;ve used before. I also read that the product has minimal chemicals that are harsh for the skin that&#x27;s why I picked it to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The container is a twist off cap so if you&#x27;re not careful when taking the product out, a lot of it may drip out.  There is also a pumping container but I decided to get the small ones as a test trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other else I&#x27;m pretty satisfy with it and did recommend my sister to use it. I would buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> Does not seem the same as what is sold by dhc. I have been using that product for years (since 2003), this one from amazon made me have an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! My complexion looks much better and makeup is much easier to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot about cleansing oils, and I actually saw on YouTube, Jen from Head to Toe, use the full size bottle in her video. I have oily skin, but I kept hearing they were great for removing makeup. I decided to get the mini-pack to try it out. I ended giving one to a friend to try out too. She fell in love! I was amazed how much dirt and makeup this oil took off. I use Laneige Deep Pore Clearing Foam after this, and I think it is by far the best pair I&#x27;ve used on my face since Proactiv (until I developed a skin allergy to it... eek!)  Some people don&#x27;t like to use this on their eyes, but I don&#x27;t mind it. It helps take off the rest of the mascara that I may have missed with makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Nighttime regime - Wash hands. Remove eye makeup. With DRY clean hands, pour a nickel size on palm. Rub with hands and pat on face. Massage into face (and eyes if desired) for about 20 sec. Sit for 10 sec. Rinse hands in lukewarm/cool of all oil. Massage with WET hands to create milky substance. Rinse hands with massage face until most of the oil is off. Rinse face with water. You can leave your face wet to prep for your next cleanser or exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Kinda of fake lol, I used it. The oil inside doesn&#x27;t look like the 100% real one. The quality is not as good as the big bottle one.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used. Does not leave my face greasy, just soft.  I especially love it for removing waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Bought it thinking it would help me reduce acne on my face. But it did not make any difference. At least it did not increase the acne. It did my leave my skin dry like most products. good make-up remover. I followed this with my own face wash just to make sure all the reduce leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time. This set comes in the perfect travel size</li>
    <li> A holy grail cleanser for me. I feel like it really melts my makeup off. I especially like that for an oil, it does not stick to my skin. It turns into a milky consistency and washes off easily. Also love this mini trio. Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been real vigilant over the years in nightly cleansing...I love this product!  I actually look forward to the event.</li>
    <li> I like it because I runs easily on my face and really removes make up. By the way it rinses surprisingly well with just water- no need for tissue or cotton balls. However, I do not know how much is doing for my skin (mixed skin). I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now.  If something, I feel a little drier. I will keep using it because someone said that removes blackheads and I am guessing that takes a little more time.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but traveling with a open full size pump bottle is looking for trouble.  This mini 3 pack is a perfect solution.</li>
    <li> this is great for very dry skin care.</li>
    <li> Great! Even removes mascara.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil cleanser.  I&#x27;m 40 and I can still get blemishes if I fall asleep with my makeup on.  This takes even waterproof makeup off quick and easy without tugging at the skin, so taking off makeup at night isn&#x27;t a hassle.  It also keeps my skin from getting too dry. My face feels clean after I use it, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with a breakout since.  I purchased these sizes for travel and they&#x27;re perfect.  I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much and have used it for a few years, as a nice addition to my skin care routine.  Last time I ordered, I  purchased  the mini sizes for a trip, but I will not do that again  because the bottle is so stiff you can&#x27;t squeeze the correct  amount of product out, but must sort of &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; it into your hand, one drop at a time.  It is time-consuming and inefficient because you can&#x27;t regulate the amount and often, in an attempt to get enough, because it comes out very slowly, too much drips out when I shake it harder.  I think next time I&#x27;ll try the 2-pack size with the pump when I&#x27;m traveling.  Don&#x27;t change the product - it&#x27;s wonderful - but consider changing the 3-pack bottles.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time! I love it!! These travel sizes are great! First, I put this all over my face, then I leave it on and use a cleanser with it. It dissolves makeup and leaves my face feeling wonderful!</li>
    <li> The small size works well for airplane travel - one bottle was just enough for a one week vacation - love this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara remover and makeup remover!  Best ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, I bought the travel size for vacation this summer. I&#x27;m 62 but people tell me that they can&#x27;t believe it, I believe this product has helped make that happen</li>
    <li> Love this stuff been usoing for yers..</li>
    <li> These little containers last so long and are adorable. It is important to head the directions and apply with dry face/hands. It helps remove clogs from my pores and washes off cleanly. I recommend this 3pk to anyone curious about oil cleansing.</li>
    <li> Great as a make up remover or as a cleanser. I love this product and am glad I was able to essentially test it because of this size packaging</li>
    <li> Best facial cleaner ever !  I have tried just about everything, and this is the only product that does everything that it says it does. My friends keep asking me if I have had work done. My face looks like it glows. And my face is so soft and even toned. I would recommend it to everyone. Only product I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> I like the size of these because they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room while using/storing them and also while traveling.  The oil is very cleansing and easy to use to take off makeup.  Oil doesn&#x27;t clog pores and if your skin is dry, it is very hydrating.</li>
    <li> I bought shu uemura&#x27;s pink bottle ad this at the same time because they both got super high ratings as an oil cleanser.  I started with this one first because I was traveling, and this mini 3 pack was small and easy to carry.  A week later I start to break out.  Now it could be because I was in a different country, and the water there is different, BUT, I do like shu uemura better.  I&#x27;ve been using it since I got back, and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have used. It leaves my face feeling very hydrated after each use. Would definitely recommend it to anyone with dry or aging skin.</li>
    <li> I got a sample in the catalog, and when I finally used it, I was amazed. I&#x27;ve now set all my other cleansers aside.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Only wish they were refillable (as I would like to buy the large size but keep the small ones in the cabinet).  Just a small amount (about a dime size) on your hands and it washes all your makeup and grime off your face.  Then just rinse with water and dry.  I use it every night and have no need for moisturizer as it keeps your face very soft.  Perfect size for traveling.  I will buy the larger product once this is gone.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I took the advice of one of the posters, and left it on under 30 seconds. it worked well taking my makeup off</li>
    <li> convenient bottles for travel - I like the pump for home.</li>
    <li> Great price. Like the size for traveling. Cleans my face without leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> very comfortable when you travel</li>
    <li> This is okay to gently remove some makeup but still have to use a regular cleanser after to remove rest of makeup.</li>
    <li> This oil works wonders in sliding off my makeup, even my waterproof L&#x27;Oreal eyeliner and mascara. It can get into my eyes and does not sting AT ALL. I have extremely sensitive skin, and for this product to not cause a reaction on my skin is a miracle and a blessing. I tried changing to another brand because I found this DHC cleansing oil too pricey for the size, but I just found myself coming back to DHC because the other brand was just not working for me as well. The oil does tend to somewhat clog up my pores sometimes, although I believe it is due to my pores being almost crater-huge due to them being merged to the acne scars. It is fairly easy for anything to get stuck inside my pores, really. The product does work, but $15.00 for maybe a month&#x27;s use or less? A little unfair, but if that&#x27;s the price I have to pay for the closest &amp;#34;best makeup remover&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve discovered so far, oh well. My face is FULL of tons of DEEP cystic acne scars (ice picks) so I do full coverage makeup on my face almost every day. Plus I wear very heavy, dramatic eye makeup almost daily (this is my trick: take the attention to my eyes -the only pretty thing attribute on my face- in order to distract the vision towards the rest of my scarred face) so I DO have to use a lot of the product each night. This is the reason why a bottle does not last me more than a month. Still, it does a fine job each day removing makeup. On that note, these ARE travel size, so they are perfect for traveling since it is no more than 1 ounce each and the bottle is very safe and convenient as it is not a pump but a twist-off cap, so that prevents accidents and spills inside suitcases or bags. I only take 1 star off because of the price. I would buy again, and I am somewhat satisfied. I would not recommend to a friend though, because they would all think it is at a ridiculous price and they would not pay for it. I do recommend it to amazon buyers for removing makeup smoothly though. :)</li>
    <li> Great, perfect size for travel</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected. I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I live in Texas. With the humidity and everything I try to put as less I can on my face. I never put any makeup or a ton of products on my face. I use an organic peppermint soap by dr bronner. I use st Ives scrub and alcohol free toner and once a day I use ponds moisturizing cream. It was the day after I scrubbed my face, I got these. I used it as the direction said but before rinsing I used a cotton ball to see how much dirt it picked up and LOOK AT THAT!! Never felt so gross in my life. But at least now I know this product works. It doesn&#x27;t dry your face and leaves feeling a little soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleansing oil. I just ordered the larger size. Removes most of my makeup and mascara. Leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
