<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for two years now.  I&#x27;ve recharged the battery twice.  Great product if your unsightly ear and nose hair needs professional removal.  the other attachments work well too.</li>
    <li> When I saw the price (~$188), I laughed.  I&#x27;ve owned this unit for years ... it&#x27;s not worth $188.  The listed price has to be a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently looking for a similar trimmer with more attachments.</li>
    <li> the shaver itself seems good but charger stopped working in first few days...&lt;br /&gt;I sent it outside US so could not get it replaced under warranty as well... bad experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while now but the comb broke so I was looking for replacement parts but was surprised to see the price for the unit itself. I paid about 20 bucks for it when I bought it. It must be a mistake in the listing.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive groomer that has quite a few features.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when you are charging it, you have no idea if it is fully charged or not.  A blinking light or some indication that it is fully charged would be nice.  Adjustments work well, and it gives a clean finish to your shave.</li>
    <li> It works good, It has all functionality one may need. And  for information. Philips uses the same materials as for expensive models so the quality is guaranteed.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer, charges just fine, with easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a beard trimmer before (nor a beard). These trimmers make it pretty easy to maintain it at just the length that I like. I got it mainly for the beard trimmer attachment. The nose hair, precision trimmer, and foil shaver attachments work well too. The full length trimmer works pretty well, but even the longest length is practically a buzz cut, I wish the lengths extended to even longer. Overall it&#x27;s great, and it&#x27;s convenient that it has a rechargeable battery in it. I&#x27;m not enamored by it, but I like it :)</li>
    <li> I have the Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System, had it less than a year. The battery is the main issue...it will not stay charged more than one day - even when not used.  Other trimmer parts seem to work pretty well...except the rotary hair/nose hair clipper pulls (yikes!) out about as many hairs as it cuts. The clippers, are supposed to be washable, rust pretty quickly if you don&#x27;t get ALL the water out. It helps to add a very light amount of clipper oil to keep these running smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Main problem is that Phillips Norelco wants me to pay shipping and insurance so they can evaluate my G370...must have receipt (who keeps these?), etc. and this is just to decide if they&#x27;ll honor their 2 year warranty. By the time I pay for shipping, and the time it takes to do all this, I may as well get a different clipper.&lt;br /&gt;All for the lack of a decent battery...you should be ashamed Phillips Norelco!</li>
    <li> Ive had this trimmer for about 6 months now. I mainly use it to cut my hair and its done a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;But here are a couple of problems with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The first has to do wit the beard trimming attachment. The first time i used it, it cut me under my chin and it was so painful!!! Which made me not use it for a couple of weeks and when i did use it again it did the exact same thing!!! Hopefully ive learned my lesson.&lt;br /&gt;The second and WORST problem it has, is that you cant use it and charge it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I knew you couldnt when i bought it cause i had read it in the reviews. But i didnt think it was going to be so inconvenient. I thought to my self \\&quot;oh ill just make sure its always charged\\&quot;.  Easier said than done!&lt;br /&gt;Time and time again it has died in the middle of me cutting my hair. And it wouldnt be so bad if it charged quickly but it doesnt!! An hour long charge only last me about 30 seconds to 1 minute  of usage!! Its insane!!!&lt;br /&gt;So just take my advice and buy a better trimmer because i guarantee you the same things that happened to me will happen to you</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this trimmer, though the first one was gray and had a stand. I now know what I did wrong with the first one and why they did not include the stand this time. DO NOT RECHARGE this device until it needs recharging. I charged it once a year ago when I purchased it and keep a very stylized beard and it&#x27;s still going strong on that one charge. My previous trimmer lasted me a couple of years but that was with me constantly charging it in the stand. I kept the old stand but I don&#x27;t plug it in.</li>
    <li> The razor&#x27;s cutting units were very sharp and got the job done, quick, fast, and in a hurry!!! Would definitely recommended this product to others!</li>
    <li> This is not a new product. It has been on the market for a while. But it seems to be the best a man (or really furry woman?) can get!</li>
    <li> I have friends (girls) that use this product and it is great for women and for men.  It is small and rechargeable.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I rarely have to charge this.  It can sit in the cabinet for a long period of time and it&#x27;s ready to go.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Described as exactly. Great for cutting hair in all areas. Would recommend to anybody thats for sure and heres one more word</li>
    <li> love this device.  Seems cheap, but if you take care, it&#x27;s actually very sturdy (base) and I love all the attachments.  So far, it&#x27;s served me very well.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a great device at the price it originally sold for while it was in production, ~15 at triple digit prices it&#x27;s not even in play.</li>
    <li> I love this groomer. I have had it for quite some time now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it on myself, my man and now our little one. Much easier to manage than the old standard plug in style. Small, strong, effective and versatile.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my grandson.  He liked all of the accessories; however, he hasn&#x27;t actually used it yet so we don&#x27;t know how well it perform.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy.. just does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who doesnt want to shell out much for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> To start, I didnt expect this to be the best device in terms of quality and longevity for $19.00 but it holds its own in terms of bang for the buck. I decided to give it the first couple weeks of home use and then my most recent 10 day vacation of use before writing my review. The G370 does a really good job on daily facial hair maintenance. I used the mini foil shaver, both edge trimmers and the nose/ear hair trimmer. I havent used the 2 hair/head trimmer attachments as I really didnt need to with a 3 week haircut regimen. The mini foil attachment really surprised me, it really got me by during my vacation in the areas I wanted the least amount of hair. It doesnt replace my actual razor at home but sufficed well while out of town for more than a week. The larger of the two edge trimmers I used as a chin and beard groomer for the days I opted for the 5 o&#x27; clock shadow look and the smaller edge trimmer really helps in the fine line areas of trimming as well as touching up around the ears/hairline. I used the nose/ear trimmer a couple times and it works pretty good, well enough I didnt get bothered by nose hairs tickling my nostrils at all, heheh. It holds a charge for a very long time &amp; offers enough power to get the job done in a timely mannor. I went 5 days on a single charge while on vacation and honestly only attached it to the charger to be sure it would have full potential for shaving &amp; trimming, not because it was dieing or running out of charge! All the attchments remove and connect easily and can easily be cleaned form hair debris with the offered cleaning brush. I think some purchasers were using water to rinse thier attachments but I opted not to just to add to the longevity of the metal parts. The only attachment that I used that collected the most hair internally was the foil shaver wich is a double attachment (2 pieces) that allows for easier cleaning. If I never used the trimmer ever again I feel I got my moneys worth out of it already. To end this review, Id like to note that I believe some reviewers leaving negative feedback were expecting the results of a $100+ shaver/trimmer. I went into this purchase expecting a $20 trimmmer and feel I got that and more and will continue to keep this in use on a regular basis along with my regular home shaving items (razors/shaving cream, etc)!iew, Id like to note that I believe some reviewers leaving negative feedback were expecting the results of a $100+ shaver/trimmer.

    <li> Everything is as advertised. It works great and has a bunch of different settings for length. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I had one like this for over 7 years. the beard trimming attachment broke (not the actual razor), so I thought it was time to get a new one. I bought the exact same model because it has been incredibly durable and the only reason the trimming attachment broke was due to my rough treatment of it. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my bf cause he travels a lot and recently lost his personal shaver. He liked it. When I told him it wasn&#x27;t very expensive and asked him how it was? His words were &amp;#34;its really very good for its price. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve basically stopped using blades since i purchased this electric razor. it should pay for itself with what i saved on the blades in no time.</li>
    <li> Small design makes it easy to manoeuvre especially around the ears. One adjustable guide makes it easy to switch to the size you need. However it easily clogs the hair in the guide (not the blade itself!) and you need to remove the guide altogether at least once per session. Takes about 10-12 hours to charge for a use of at least 20-30 minutes. I did not check exactly how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended to let the charge drain between usage, not kept plugged in continually.&lt;br /&gt;Holds the charge well for now.  Great for the price. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> right for the price right for the price right for the price right for the price&lt;br /&gt;not very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;but cheap, so that is enough</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself works fine. It feels pretty sturdy and seems to run fine. It holds a charge really well, I don&#x27;t have to charge it very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are sort of cheap and you have to be really careful when you are putting them on the razor. On the &#x27;hair comb&#x27; attachment, the little black plastic piece that locks in a length broke the 5th time I used it. I called Norelco @ 1-800-243-3050 and they sent me a free replacement, which they noted they would only do once. The other ones do the job, but again, they feel sort of cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on a budget, then go ahead and pick this trimmer up, but be really careful with the attachments. But if you have a few extra bucks, I might shop around for a razor that is higher quality and that comes with nicer attachments.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. This thing comes with a slew of attachments, most of which I don&#x27;t need, but you never know!  This unit charges fast and is extremely light and easy to handle. Highly recommended for home use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Conair ($14) groomer lasted 10+ years- let&#x27;s see how this puppy does!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  The clippers are too small for any serious hair cutting.  The razor is only good for detail work like getting a sharp edge on side burns.  Would take for ever to actually do your whole face.  However, it was worth the price for the nose and ear trimmer.  Works great (loud in your ears though).</li>
    <li> As long as you dont expect any use out of the shaver this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This machine have a lot to offer i just need to get use to to hold it in the right angle to not make mistake is good for the price im happy :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product mainly because I was sold on the versatility. Five different attachments, so no need to buy separate products. But if you are in the market for a multi-use trimmer, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.    First, I had two separate chargers die on me. The first one died after three weeks. A trip to Radio Shack said that a replacement charger would run $30 or more than the cost of a new one. I returned the product and purchase a new G370 thinking maybe I got a black swan. Guess not, because the second charger just died on me after about 6 months.    Charger issues aside, I mainly used the full size trimmer attachment with the adjustable levels and the beard &amp; mustache trimmer. The full size trimmer was good at adjusting my facial hair down to a \\&quot;one\\&quot; or fuller than a five o&#x27;clock shadow but just enough to keep it professional. This was about the only thing the unit was good at. I used the beard and mustache trimmer to keep my sideburns neat when I didn&#x27;t have the two-day growth going. While the G370 did neatly square them off, in my opinion, it didn&#x27;t trim the hair short enough. I tried to finish off my sideburns then with the razor attachment but also that didn&#x27;t get things short enough. I did use the nose hair trimmer four or five times and I&#x27;d say that the G370 did okay in that area.     I never tried to trim my hair with the G370, but it feels flimsy enough where I wouldn&#x27;t trust it to cut hair evenly or professionally. Also, the unit seems to run best on a full charge (obviously) but would quickly die off in terms of effectiveness after one or two uses. If you are thinking of packing it on a business trip greater than five days (i.e. two/three trimmings) then I&#x27;d suggest bringing a charger with you (if it doesn&#x27;t die).     I&#x27;d suggest looking at a few product levels up from the G370 and paying extra to get a more quality trimming unit.</li>
    <li> Cheap and works VERY well. This is the second one I&#x27;ve had. Extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This set is all I need. Easy to use and works great. This is a replacement set for the older version of this set...which lasted about seven years of me dropping and using and finally the grooming guard broke. Great set at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco trimmer that I have bought. The first one is about 8 years old and the only reason I had to buy this one is because I dropped it and broke part of it. This works well and has great features. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very disappointing. According to the description, this trimmer is \\&quot;self-sharpening\\&quot; and has a full two-year warranty. We have had it for less than 6 months and a few of the blades were dull a few months ago and now it seems that they all are getting ready to go in the garbage. I&#x27;ll admit, when we first got it, it seemed like a dream come true. I wonder if it is worth buying a new one EVERY 6 MONTHS. We have had trimmers before this that have lasted years and the only reason we got the Norelco is that they BEGAN to be dull after all that time and use. I&#x27;m very disappointed that this \\&quot;SELF-SHARPENING\\&quot; TRIMMER IS A LIE. We used it regularly maybe once a week. The attachments, when they worked, were wonderful but now it seems that we just have more trash. Back to looking for something that promises quality and delivers.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new gift! Trims his beard and mustache like a professional did it. I love the ear and nose trimmer he uses. No more wild hairs growing.</li>
    <li> I had this item from Dubai airport 5-6 years ago and I&#x27;m still using it!!!, I trim my hair every 2 - 3 weeks and it never failed me. 5 stars for such quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for about $15 at Target. It lasted a while but the plastic head attachments began to break. The replacement parts on the Phillips site cost more than the entire item. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I will try very briefly to describe all advantages and disadvantages of that trimmer    Positive  - Good price, trimmers from drugstores and big discounters often cost more  - Unbelievably, but so many functions in that device, actually you do not buy only trimmer but full hair styling device less then for 20$  - Reliable comparing with analogs, works great while a lot of competitors just jam your hair instead if trimming  - Has battery and could be recharged, you do not need AAA batteries  - Goes with travel bag  - A lot of different heads for different grooming and hear styling    Negative  - Just a little bit bigger than I expected    In conclusion, I want to repeat that you do not need any hair styling machine if you have that trimmer.</li>
    <li> The item arrived within a few days. It was in excellent condition and is exactly as advertised. I love the all in one grooming system. It has saved us a bundle on haircuts.</li>
    <li> We are so pleased that when I (dropped) broke our first one we wanted a second one exactly like our original.  My husband is in the military and requires his hair cut every two weeks so we save tons of $$$ cutting it ourselves.  HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This Norelco works great, cuts close and my husband loves it.  It is lightweight but works awesome and is great on storage and being able to recharge quickly and very easily.  WE LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I owned this one before it lasted just under two years very pleased to see its the same quality and about the same price I paid 2 years ago...</li>
    <li> This thing works pretty well for nosehairs and shaving, but be careful if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair with the clippers!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with different size guards, it comes with one adjustable guard... and the guard likes to adjust itself sometimes. You&#x27;ve got to be careful to make sure you&#x27;re not cutting too much off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the Navy and have been paying $8 for a haircut at least once a month. This thing has paid for itself several times over for me, but the guard still scares me. I have to be very careful with it. I think the adjustable guard also isn&#x27;t the standard sizes you find in a hair salon. When I tell them I want a 4 faded to a 2, it looks much longer on the top than when I use a 4 on this adjustable guard. I&#x27;ve found that I need a 5 faded to a 1 to get the look I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, haircuts take a while and a lot of battery power. This thing doesn&#x27;t run if the battery is dead even when it&#x27;s plugged in, so you&#x27;ve got to make sure you charge it well! It lasts for two haircuts for me before I have to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, you pay for what you get. For $14 (what I paid including free 2 day shipping from Amazon Prime) this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> It is okay for the price</li>
    <li> I like the product allot. I was nervous when I placed it because of how cheap it was. The clippers work well. it has 9 setting. it has a mini shaver nose hair trimmer that does not hurt.  I also used the clippers to trim arm hair and it works very well for that.  This is not desgined to shave your face. Great product</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Wireless when charged.  Great stubble :  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use around the ears and perfect for misc shaves...</li>
    <li> For the price good value. Has sufficient attachments to meet my needs. I groom a goatee and also use the hair attachment to keep my hair very short. The guide stays in place at the setting I select. With proper care it looks like it should last at least a few year. My last Conair was about the same price and  lasted 12 years</li>
    <li> This is good for the price, i liked the battery backup as well. the shaver that comes along with this is not good</li>
    <li> I purchased this groomer to trim my beard and I have been very impressed. It is cordless (rechargeable) which makes using it much easier, it does a fantastic job of keeping my beard neat and it was one of the more inexpensive trimmers that I saw.</li>
    <li> I originally wanted the G380 model but this model is exactly the same.  Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System and the price is half what I would pay in stores.  I am quite satisified with both models. Both are easy to use with a rechargeable battery. You will not use all the applications because they are for different types of hair.  The Razor itself is very gentle cut clean. I am satisfied with  Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System.</li>
    <li> this is a great inexpensive trimmer...lots of attachments i had my last one for 2 years it broke into 5 peices when i dropped it but i charge this thing once every 2 months....great little trimmer  A+++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything, and actually I did not buy this product on amazon. Yet I felt compelled to voice my disappointment with this product. I bought this set thinking I was upgrading from my former, standard model in which I don&#x27;t quite remember the manufacturer. Now I wish I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache trimmer (the function I bought it for) boasts about it&#x27;s \\&quot;8 settings\\&quot; but only 4 were actually able to be utilized for a normal-length &#x27;stache. Moving in between the settings required much effort and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the attachment, the razor actually pinches the skin! (i&#x27;ve used other razors in which this was not the case). Would NOT recommend using this in \\&quot;vulnerable\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems pretty advanced if all you&#x27;re looking to do is  maintain short to moderate length facial hair. Keep it simple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shave for over a year and am very pleased with the precision and feel of this trimmer. So much so that I have given up shaving and have just been trimming for i have no more razor burn.     Note: I have not used this unit for beard trimming, just other hair.     Pros:  -- Durable, I have dropped the unit on the hard floor twice and instead of breaking,     the unit just disassempled itself, absorbing the impact. Great engineering.     -- Looks slick, even though it is plastic, Stays nice and shiny.     -- Easy cleaning, just open it up and clean the hair out.     -- Great precision. This unit has 9 different cutting lenght when an attachment it on it. I use it for touch ups all over the place.       Cons:  -- Can&#x27;t use the shaver with it plugged in. Only on charged battery.     -- Made of plastic.      Overall I love this trimmer. It looks good and performs even better. Solid trimmer that will be durable and last you some time. A great product to trimming, or use instead of shaving for that rugged look.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers .  This is my second set I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Before I started growing my beard out, I used this 2-3 times per week to cultivate the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look. I used it 2-3 times per week for more than a year, and it&#x27;s been outstanding. I rarely need to clean it. The guards are easy to switch out. And it&#x27;s got a rechargeable battery. I bought this assuming it would have planned obsolescence, but it does not seem to. Great product!</li>
    <li> Its been nearly 1 year since I have been using it and its still working well. I will definitely recommend it to everyone. Its cheap but still good one for hair-cutting.</li>
    <li> Good value for money. At this price, you can not get any better. The attachments are good, the battery life is amazing. I am using it for last 2 months without recharge (I use it once a week)</li>
    <li> Does a very good job at what it does, and the price is very low.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars if it had lasted one year.&lt;br /&gt;And it is still working after 2 years...&lt;br /&gt;Need to make sure the charger light is on during charging...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the G370 for shaving my head every week. I&#x27;ve used it four times now and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it. It works better than the more expensive G480 model for shaving my head.</li>
    <li> Finally, I can have a trim every week that keeps me looking sharp with these easy to use cutters.</li>
    <li> purchased more than 2 years ago. still going strong.</li>
    <li> Bought this at WalMart about 3 months ago. Recharged it twice. Performed well enough for the price(I forget exactly how much but it was less than the others on display). Without knowing anything about the competitors&#x27; similar products, I bought this based on the price and the BRAND NAME. But the third time must have been the charm because it will no longer recharge. As a result, I no longer associate quality with the name Norelco nor will I buy anything with the Norelco name. Why do companies like Norelco insist on shooting themselves in the foot by including poor products like this in their lineup?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother after he misplaced his old conair. From opening the box it became clear why it was sold for the price it was and upon using it for the first time it broke. The plastic is very flimsy and of course once broken cannot be repaired. I&#x27;ve since dumped it and ordered another conair. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.. except of course if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap.</li>
    <li> it last for a while but some parts stop working.</li>
    <li> I only used once, battery doesn&#x27;t seen to last long.&lt;br /&gt;While charging, your will not be able to use it... drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luiz</li>
    <li> Despite the price tag, this is a high quality machine -unlike many other little shavers.</li>
    <li> This Norelco \\&quot;G370 All-in-1 Grooming System\\&quot; has held up remarkably well with fairly heavy usage over the past three years. I keep a very short beard and mustache (see my \\&quot;Profile\\&quot; picture) so do a trim every two or three days. Since I am also getting older, there is now a lot more hair where there aught not to be hair (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc) and fortunately this set has attachments to handle all of those needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with the handy caddy tray that holds the attachments and the charger cord can be connected through the bottom so the trimmer recharges when it is seated. The trimmer can easily run through three or four of my sessions without needing to be recharged, which is great when traveling since it is often not necessary to bring my whole kit along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real issue with the trimmer is that with the spacer attached the hair gets crammed down in between the attachment and trimmer body, making it messy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> This thing seriously rocks for the cost. The nose trimmer thing seems kind of useless but other than that this thing has gone strong for me so far and it does everything I need it to flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Good as trimmer, not intended to be used as a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good overall value.</li>
    <li> It´s an excelent produt, and arrived on the right day.     Thanks</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a few years and it has come to the point where the attachments have stopped working with the trimmer or just doesn&#x27;t hold enough juice in the battery to move the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard tends to grow fast so with only a few days of not shaving I would use this trimmer. I personally don&#x27;t like to do a traditional shave because of my sensitive skin and it would give me razor bumps and itch forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now in the market for a trimmer to use either daily or every other day to keep my facial hair under control. I will most likely get something that barbers use professionally in the shops.</li>
    <li> It works fine. Does everything you would expect as you would expect. However this is the second one I&#x27;ve had to buy. The first one I bought was replaced due to a slipping guard that forced me to shave my beard after a miscut. The replacement stopped working after I dropped it a short distance. The unit should have survived the fall but it is really cheaply made in China just like everything else etc. etc. Bottomline: The thing is cheap to buy but is crap and I hate to fill up the landfill with crap</li>
    <li> I used to just use scissors and try and trim but that was less then effective, especially when I cut myself with the scissors in the process. This is a great little product and I am very impressed with the quality. I was expecting something rather cheap for the 14+ paid, but to my surprise it is excellent! Definitely Recommend!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for every one who wish to have a personal grooming set at home. I found it useful. Am falling in love with it every time I use it.</li>
    <li> When I left the Army in 2004 my wife started cutting my hair (buzz cuts cost about 15 bucks with tip at the barber).  My wife bought one of these Grooming kits so she could get rid of the cord and larger razor normally used for hair cuts.  So far we have been unable to find a groomer that beats this one.  I HIGHLY recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> The basic cutter design works well, however, the plastic trimmer parts are just impossible.  When you try to adjust the trimmer to a higher setting the entire trimmer head snaps off. In the other direction the trimmer reverts to the 1 setting with no apparent action on my part.  This AM I cut my beard short for the second time because of this reversion to the 1 setting.  I don&#x27;t believe I should have to check the setting each time I use the trimmer, and yes, I do know how this thing is meant to operate.    Second issue, the charging instructions are written for a Ni-Cad battery and manual says the non-replaceable battery is a LiIon type.  So, does the charger match the battery?  I know this is a bottom end trimmer but I believe the manual should make sense and the unit should function as desired.  Don&#x27;t buy this thing, I now am in the market for a real trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas because he really needed one and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money lol. So I found this one on Amazon and he absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> This kit works great for the price. My only complaint is the clipper guard is flimsy and breaks with moderate force. If you use it gently it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem and besides, you&#x27;re cutting your hair not rubbing it off right?</li>
    <li> Over the years when one of these has finally gotten too dull to cut my husband&#x27;s hair I will buy another of the same.  They are a very good price and save us a lot of money on his hair cutting costs.  I am no hair cutter, but since he likes his one short length all over it&#x27;s as simple as can be.  I use one attachment to cut and another to trim around the ears and back of the neck.    I will do this every 4 - 6 weeks.  When I finish with a hair cut, I leave the cutting attachment in and run it until the battery has died completely.  That way when it recharges I will have a full running charge to work with.  I think it says it takes 10 hours to recharge and I just do that overnight and unplug and store away until it&#x27;s needed again.      Hope this helps another who may consider buying this product.</li>
    <li> I Like it when you compare the price and product. Size is very useful for travailing.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get it to hold a charge, and it doesn&#x27;t work even when it&#x27;s plugged in.  It has probably gone through 3-4 recharge cycles.  That isn&#x27;t that many.  Now I have to buy a new one.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System is definitely not a hair trimmer. All hair get stuck inside the trimmer and it stops cutting. Maybe it is good for something else but not for hair trimming.</li>
    <li> This grooming system is versatile and does not take up much space on the counter. Yes, the build quality could be better, and the way that the parts combine and re-combine is somewhat confusing, but at around $20 (with free shipping if combined with another purchase), you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this system intermittently for a couple of months now. While I would not substitute it for my regular razor, it is great for quick touch-ups, thinning, and definition. So far, the battery is strong and seems to hold its charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, take the time with scissors to carefully open the clamshell package, give the directions at least a quick read-thru, and study how the system works. It&#x27;s pretty ingenious, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are available online as a PDF. Reading this PDF will help you decide whether this purchase is for you. Here is a currently working link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, you can search by product name (\\&quot;Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Bill Brent [20 July 2010]</li>
    <li> Works real well.  This is the second one I have ordered, as I broke a part on the first one (stepped on it)and the replacement part was the same price for a brand new entire set up.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Won&#x27;t hold a charge for long and can&#x27;t run off the cord alone. Attachments always popping off when you don&#x27;t want them to.</li>
    <li> It works very well, and doesn&#x27;t get hot when I charge it. It can take care my hair perfectly. There are 9 choices of trimming level and it is enough, no need for too many choices like the other brands that can have as many as 14 levels. The shortcoming of this tool may be that it doesn&#x27;t care where the cut hair should go. Many of the hair get stuck between the internal parts.</li>
    <li> This thing is excellent.  I had the previous model for maybe 4+ years and it was still great.  I decided to get the new one just because I thought it was time for something new.  This thing is maybe twice as powerful as the older model.  A welcome improvement.  The trimmer attachments are excellent.  I use it for my beard, other areas, and even to cut my own hair from time to time (I don&#x27;t get around to the barber sometimes...).  Great quality, excellent batt life, excellent power, easy to clean, I really can&#x27;t think of how a trimmer could be better.    For the cheap price that it is, you can&#x27;t really go wrong.  I believe Walmart also carries it for the same price however...</li>
    <li> The battery would not hold a charge in the initial unit.  Norelco replaced the unit imediately with a different model, G480 and it is very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> this does everything you&#x27;d want out of a cheap set.  i dont use it very often, but the battery is still going strong for me.  i&#x27;ll have no issue with replacing it when it eventually dies.</li>
    <li> I like it, although it doesn&#x27;t shave as clean as I wanted. I dont regret buying it.I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This trimmer started out really well, worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;But in 3 months, it completely died out, and it&#x27;s now unusable.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl that is in the same price range that broke when I dropped it onto a tile floor.  The Wahl had lasted me over 8 years.  It replaced a Wahl that lasted about as long.  I had to replace it immediately as I was half done, and headed out that evening.  I bought the Norelco at a CVS, not Amazon, but it is the same model.  I would have bought another Wahl if CVS had carried them.  It was cheap, so it doesn&#x27;t get only 1 star...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is VERY cheaply made.  The pieces don&#x27;t sit well, and occasionally come detached while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2) Carrying it in the provided pouch, one of the attachments broke into many little pieces.  Naturally it is the beard trimmer, the piece I need the most.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is made of a weird shiny plastic that seems charged to attract beard hairs.  Each attachment lets in a LOT of beard trimmings, and they are not as easy to clean out as the Wahl&#x27;s, which also had less of a mess inside.&lt;br /&gt;4) Replacement parts are available, at the price of a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Did I mention it is cheap?  Won&#x27;t set you back an hour&#x27;s wage unless you make minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they improve the quality of the shaver attachments.  I would certianly give up the \\&quot;ear and nose\\&quot; trimmer to free up some money to do so.  Really, trim nose hairs, then put it in my ear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, over to the selection page to buy a NON-Norelco beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Even if you spend $10 more, try the G480 - the combs are sturdy and it is a better product than this.</li>
    <li> Gosh, what a disappointment!  I am a woman and I use this grooming kit for more personal place and the danged thing actually cut me in 4 places that are very sensitive!  AND, the nose trimmer mostly rips the little hairs out rather than cuts them.  I still have it as I haven&#x27;t replaced the kit but I will not use it unless a total emergency arises.  I was very disappointed but for goodness sakes, cant they at least make it sharp enough not to pull the hair out and then not so poorly done that it cuts your skin?</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly, and it has saved me a good deal of money in haircuts. I have used products that need to be plugged in, and this is far superior. The performance is excellent, and being cordless means I can use it where it is convenient for me. It comes with more attachments than I need, but the storage caddy keeps the system neat. I have been impressed with the battery life. I use it for a weekly haircut, and the battery stays charged for a month.</li>
    <li> This product works great, but don&#x27;t let the picture fool you. It does not come with the stand to hold all the pieces neatly together.</li>
    <li> NO attachments stand. priced higher than targets. they have the stand, also. should have gone to target, for a good one.</li>
    <li> works very well attachments easy to use , my only draw back is the lack of a vacuume system the one it replaced would hold the clipings</li>
    <li> For less than $16 this little guy can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve used this for several years to trim my facial hair, sideburns, and nose hairs with zero problems.    Pros:  Fully adjustable guard lets you trim down really close or go long if you want.  Rechargeable battery charges pretty quick and holds a charge for a while.  Comes with adapters for hair, sideburns, and nose hairs.  Comes with a little stand to keep everything organized.  Comes with a little brush to clean it out after every use.    Cons:  Not waterproof (can&#x27;t expect too much for the cost).  You can&#x27;t run the unit with it plugged into the AC adapter (plan ahead and make sure it&#x27;s charged before you need it).  Sometimes it&#x27;s easy to accidentally move the guard length and trim too short (check the number before each use!)    Tips:  Honestly the only maintenance I ever did while using this was to take off the black adapter and the guard that attached to it and rinse both of those out under running water. I would dry them off and let them sit on a towel.  Occasionally I would brush out the attachment, but rarely every found the need to.    Overall I give this 5 stars for its low price and easy of use. Also when you are using the guard make sure that you have it on the right number EACH TIME YOU USE IT. I can&#x27;t stress enough how many times I&#x27;ve accidentally trimmed too short because it&#x27;s sometimes easy to accidentally adjust the guard length and instead of trimming with it on 2 or 3 I accidentally had it on 1.</li>
    <li> Insanely versatile for the price. I&#x27;ve been using this bad boy for well over a year now and it&#x27;s still going. I use it to trim my beard, nose hair, private areas, and I used to use it for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cheap, there&#x27;s no denying that. However, if you want something that can cut hair in a large variety of ways, this thing can do it all. If you trim your beard regularly, and buzz your head often, I&#x27;d get separate devices for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issues with this device have to do with battery and power. The battery is weak and the charger isn&#x27;t powerful enough to just plug this in while you use it. The power also makes it difficult to shave my head effectively. Also, there&#x27;s no indicator for how much battery life this thing has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works. It can do it all, just not incredibly well.</li>
    <li> I took a while trying to find the suitable replacement to Norelco&#x27;s D-Finer with a trimmer and also a microfoil. This is perfect in all regards.... except one ... I think it doesn&#x27;t have to be as big as it is to do the same job of the previous version. Also it would have been nice if the batter could have been changed after a while. However with that said it&#x27;s still an excellent product.</li>
    <li> holds a charge.  it grooms me.</li>
    <li> The clipper and attachments are a little too narrow, so it takes a long time to do an entire head.  There is also some wiggle on the gaurd, so the hair is not always cut exactly the same length.  However, the rest of the attachments work fairly well.  Overall, you get a decent clipper for a very low price.</li>
    <li> My wahl trimmer went south on me so I thought I would see what i could find on Amazon. I must have looked at everyone on here and went with this one, mainly because of the price. I figured that if it goes south on me im not out much. I am amazed that it works better than the wahl, it has a nose trimmer, which ive never used before and it works great. All in all it is a great little machine.</li>
    <li> Hi,  This costs cheap and also doesn&#x27;t work good.. it plucks while trimming even after charging it for 12 hrs... The charge too does not stand by for a longer time. Hardly 5-10 mins for every 12 hour charge is maximum. I dont like the product.. To my opinion the more u pay, the better u get..</li>
    <li> Its really a worth product at a good price..Its comes with different grooming blades.. I recommend it strongly.. :)  Pros:   - Excellent selection of attachments   - A single charge lasts for weeks   - Charging stand holds everything quite well   - Good ergonomics, nice feel to it   - Solid; seems to be built well   - Detailed instruction sheet   - 60-day money-back guarantee, 2-year warranty     Cons:   - Horrible clamshell package, difficult to open</li>
    <li> Just like you would see in stores like target or walmart. i bought it with prime so i didnt pay for shipping but i would guess it would cost the same as if you bought it in a store. otherwise you would save like 4-5 bucks with prime.</li>
    <li> Its good for what we pay. Though, the short trim selection isn&#x27;t as good as its supposed to be. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very useful products. Can trim your hair a bit in between hair cuts and in 2 trims you save enough money to buy this product. 5*****</li>
    <li> Have only used it a couple of times but the battery lasts long enough for my needs and it cuts well.</li>
    <li> I received this same Norelco set as a gift some years ago and loved it. It comes with a stand and all the trimming accessories a man needs to look neat. Some where in my travels a month or so ago I left the charger in a hotel and needed a new one. The charger sells for about $25 on Norelco&#x27;s website, whereas I found a whole new set including of course a charger on Amazon for about $17. Now I have a duplicate of all the needed items plus my new charger for less than the manufacturer wants for the charger alone.</li>
    <li> prefect size and right price for this product .. its still working after 2 years</li>
    <li> The stroller was very good and its been quite handy. I bought it for my niece and she enjoys staying in it :-)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than 10 seconds even with the cord still attached to it... Piece of crap... An old roommate of mine has these and I loved them, so I found them here and I was sold a defective one...</li>
    <li> I bought this model at Walmart about 7 years ago.  Pros:  It,s inexpensive.  It&#x27;s a fast, 5 minute cut for me. I just do it on the back deck.  The battery in this thing is great, I only charge it when it starts to go dead.  It does everything: hair, beard, mustache, haven&#x27;t tried the nose thing yet.  Cons:  It takes a little finesse doing it myself.  Wish I had a girlfriend to help out.  Overall:  If they still offer it, if mine dies, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the second set of the G370 I bought. The first set was like the picture shows with holder included. You could keep all the tools on the counter top.  What you actually get NOW is just the tools and NO holder.  This means all the attachments are either scattered on your counter top or you&#x27;ve got to put them under the sink.  Amazon needs to update their photos.</li>
    <li> Not so hot. All my old ones cut better and closer.  Threw it in the bottom drawer where it will languish until I give it away.</li>
    <li> The first time i purchased this was in a Walmart when i was looking for a All in one grooming system. Since then i have been using this as a trimmer. I have used it for 2 years and lost the charger while travelling. I bought a costly one as a replacement but decided to got back to this again. Does a great job for the price. I have owned other costly trimmer from Philips but this matches them all. Best buy for anyone looking for an affordable all in one trimming/grooming kit.</li>
    <li> The price is the best, also the brand, besides I dont need to replace batteries, rechargeable, the battery is greta</li>
    <li> I rarely like to shave my face, and perfer the \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look instead.  This product is gentle on the face and is easy/convenient to use. I would recommend this product to anyone who finds it irritating to shave your face everyday and still wants a clean look!</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap. Doesn&#x27;t trim my beard very consistently and now the battery is no longer holding a charge. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pros;    Easy to use and works perfectly  Value for money    Cons:  Suited only for US plug points.  Doesnot work internationally..</li>
    <li> This trimmer has lasted the longest of any of the trimmers I have owned at 2 years and still holds a good charge but is very noisy and wakes up everybody in my house when I trim before going to work. other then that it is a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I recently retired a Remington grooming set that I had for 4+ years...Tried my chances on this one and I did good. I used it last night cutting my hair with the #9 attachment, used the small foil shaver and the trimmer which all worked better than expected.&lt;br /&gt; Not Norleco&#x27;s fault but the storage case did not come with it but Amazon is taking care of that right now. For the price, a perfect buy by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-14-2011&lt;br /&gt; Update. After 3 attempts to get the bottom base for the Norelco, as shown in the picture, Amazon was unsuccessful. 3 TIMES. The shaver still works good for the money spent, I just wish I could get whats showing in the picture. I gave up.</li>
    <li> I have bought alot of other cheap &amp; name brand trimmers/shavers in past but at so less price got this trimmer. It did work amazingly well, corded &amp; cordless rechargeable battery (preinstalled) came with a good surprise. Good battery life as well, easy to work with. Would definitely recommend it to anybody, I am an anti-brand name guy but liked this product quite well.</li>
    <li> my biggest problem is there are two gapping clips and they are about the same size, 3-4 inches. way too thick of a gap for any facial hair. what&#x27;s the point? because it&#x27;s obviously not a hair trimmer...</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this set. It looked as if it had a great selection of grooming tools, but they were all quite ineffective -- especially the ear piece which just buzzed and about makes you deaf, but doesn&#x27;t shave any ear hair. Good luck getting this set to do anything with ear or other stray hairs. The best part of the unit is the main unit, a small trimmer that works OK for trimming down beards and mustaches. That&#x27;s OK, but not worth the price of admission for the entire set. Overall, this brand has gone downhill from a top brand to Chinese junk in the last decade.</li>
    <li> Good product... Works better than expected! If you have facial hair that you want to keep neat and trim this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my dad for his Birthday.  I have the exact same one which I&#x27;ve had for about 3-4 years.  I love the extra attachments and the batter still lasts a few beard trims between charging.</li>
    <li> it is a great grooming system, just be caregul with the attachments , they easily broke... and it is a bit noisy, that is why it lost 1 star.  buy I do recommend it, cheap and good.  good combo!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. Buyer beware. I had bought this mainly to help trim my husband&#x27;s neck hair and ended up nicking him several times. And yes, I used it correctly. It&#x27;s just not safe. Hopefully, Norelco sticks to their satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and has a long charge. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the older version of this trimmer for about 3  years with no problems.  It was grey and the only reason I switched to this one is because I dropped on of the attachments and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4/5 stars because the parts feel very cheap and as I said before, a good drop can put it out of commission.  Other than that, it trims great and works well.  Charging isn&#x27;t too bad, I believe it&#x27;s 10 hrs for 35 mins of use.  The motor sounds very strong too and so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> much better than cheap clippers out there. Carefully with sharp blades. Does it job very easy. The charge remains for days, so no worries on travel.</li>
    <li> My mother bought me this trimmer about 8 years ago for Christmas. I am just now having to replace it due to the battery no longer holding a proper charge. It was a fantastic piece of kit that I would recommend to anyone. 8 years out of a $15 trimmer is a AMAZING value. I&#x27;ve trimmed everything from beard, mustache, soul patch, sideburns and even my entire HEAD once with it. The ear/nose hair trimmer attachment is also really great. Can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System arrived quickly and undamaged. It is a very affordable and it does what it advertises. The variety of attachments can cover a wide array of tasks and the tasks are performed well. Phillips/Norelco Co. is very good at covering any problems that are covered under their warranty.</li>
    <li> So I read quite a few reviews for this and a couple of other beard trimmers out there before deciding on this one. The item that tipped the scales in favor of this model was the mini razor attachment that is included. I was hoping that I might be able to replace my full size razor and just use that for trimming around my neck and face while sporting a beard.   The item arrived only 2 days after ordering (and I used the \\&quot;slower\\&quot; free shipping method) exactly as described. Well, it arrived exactly as the photo supplied by Michael indicates. As at least one review pointed out the nice stand that is shown IS NOT included. I knew that in advance so it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I cut it out of its packaging and charged it for a good twelve hours before its first use. I&#x27;m writing this review after only using it for about a week but here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found so far.  The trimmer is great! I&#x27;ve tried all of the attachments and found that they all work as I would hope. The mini razor does an excellent job and is VERY useful for trimming around my mouth and spots that my full size razor makes a bit difficult. It won&#x27;t be replacing the full size though. Takes a bit too long to shave my neck with such a small razor, but I think I&#x27;ll probably still find use for the mini razor even after I shave my beard. I&#x27;ve used the trimmer in some capacity nearly every day in the last week and the battery is still going strong from its first charge. I think it will work quite well as long as you follow the instructions that came with it.  Overall a great product for a fantastic price! We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time but for fifteen bucks if it runs for more than a year I&#x27;ll be satisfied. If I find any major changes in the performance of the device I&#x27;ll pop back and add to this review. Otherwise you may assume I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I liked the beard trimmer attachment, but after a few weeks, one of the prongs on the guard broke.  So I bought a different model that I like better.  But I tossed this one and forgot that I would need a new nose hair trimmer.  After buying and throwing out a couple of other items, I ended up buying a new one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, holds a charge a decent amount of time, and has one of the better and easier to use nose hair trimmers on the market.  It&#x27;s worth the $14-15 amazon charges JUST for the nose hair trimmer.  I did get a better beard trimmer [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] that has sturdier guards and better blades.  Now I just use the beard trimmer to trim my beard and this set for edging, sideburns, trimming any stray hairs, and nose hair trimming.</li>
    <li> Awesome Clippers! Great price, used them now for a few months with no problem, battery holds a charge just fine and is good for a weeks worth of trimming, clippers are very durable, dropped onto concrete from face height and only the clipper attachment broke, very impressed, Would and will buy again, great deal...</li>
    <li> Dont think much and buy this item I am sure you&#x27;ll love this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And make sure don&#x27;t play with this ! It can shave anything!</li>
    <li> I love this Norelco grooming kit.  The adjustable trimmer concept is truly fantastic and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the better personal grooming items I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Norelco and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for close to 3 years and some of the attachments broke due to normal wear and tear.  I occurred to me that it was cheaper to buy a whole new unit than the parts I needed.  But I have loved it the whole time I&#x27;ve owned it.  I have a beard and it is perfect for trimming.  Makes it a snap!</li>
    <li> I bought this grooming kit to replace a broken part (foil micro shaver) from a kit I bought at Costco a few years ago.  The price for this whole kit was the same as the replacement attachment!  Now I have plenty of extra parts as the originals wear out.</li>
    <li> When it comes to electric shavers, I always go Philips but this grooming system was actually better than expected for the price I paid. This product is good mainly for trimming and fixing your sideburns or hair it&#x27;s great if you like to keep a little scruff when shaving you know Ben affleck style, also the nose trimmer worked well for me but not the best thing if you&#x27;re looking for a close shave. Overall its a decent product.</li>
    <li> The Price is low, but the clippers are made very well. They do the job. Impressed by the guards. Better than I could get at other stores in my area.</li>
    <li> This shaver/trimmer is fantastic. Every head attachment works as I expected or better. I have a full beard that I keep neatly trimmed. The adjustments on the trimmer allows me to keep my beard exactly as I want it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and i tottally recomend it! i work in bank in Dominican Republic and i have shave 3 days a week so this is a magic wonder!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for about 3-4 years.  I just bought it at a local retail store because I wanted something ASAP under $40.  I was replacing an older version of the [[ASIN:B00005MA7P Conair 3-in-1 Personal Trimmer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;-Nose hair trimmer works the best of all the attachments...as long as you adjust to the feeling of it pulling out your nose hairs since the rotating blade is plastic and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer blades pinch your skin unless you actively focus on keeping them off of your skin or use the adjustable height attachment.&lt;br /&gt;-Short battery life due to Ni-Cd battery.  It also must be fully drained before charging so it doesn&#x27;t form a \\&quot;memory.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Attachments fall off even without pushing the release button.  You have to hold them on as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable height attachment will slip if any pressure is applied whatsoever.  (I first learned this when trying to buzz my own hair...went from a 6 or 7 all the way to a 1. Needless to say after taking a huge chunk of hair I had to keep it at 1 to even it out.)&lt;br /&gt;-The rotating mechanism and the receiving end of the attachments are all plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to save your money for one of the better trimmers in the $30-$50 range since my experience with this trimmer as well the [[ASIN:B00005MA7P Conair 3-in-1 Personal Trimmer]] has been disappointing.  Though I will say of the entry level trimmers the Conair was far superior when just using the default attachment since its blades had much tighter spacing; this made it less likely to pinch your skin.</li>
    <li> It worked awesome for the first time, but after the third use it&#x27;s not functioning at all. The reviews about its malfunctions are totally true, and now I so regret I bought this product</li>
    <li> Works great, quite handy, long lasting battery, lot better than other trimmers available in market - many experienced. Some of the attachments are useful on regular basis.</li>
    <li> We had a earlier version of this product (G270) that finally bit the dust (the attachments either began to fail or fall apart but the base unit was still cranking.. we looked at buying new attachments but buying this package was cheaper).  My wife and I had  owned/used this groomer for about 7-8 years without incident so we did not hesitate to buy this newer version an only $17 and change.  This new model has a few more attachments but overall it is like deja vous all over again.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product for the price and quality.. and the battery lasted a long time between charges.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a replacement for a previous generation rechargable Norelco Grooming system that I used for years.  I loved the older one and I love this one.  It has many accessories that are handy, but I mainly use as a mustache and beard trimmer.  It can trim very close or keep a longer beard looking neat.  Also very good at buzzing a beard off before you shave.  It charges quickly and holds the charge well.  Very easy to use and clean.  More than adequate power and cut.  The base keeps all accessories organized in a small space. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This handy little trimmer has been great for all my beard trimming needs - it has a ton of easy to switch accesories/heads and still works 3 years later. The battery life is usually good for about an hour of running time which usually gets me through a week if I&#x27;m using it regularly.  Easy to clean and charge.</li>
    <li> Perfect trim for the perfect price.  I had one of these before and wanted one just like it.  This is great recharges in your bedroom and can use in the bathroom until it needs a new charge</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco for some time now and my last one died on me after 7 years of daily use. This one is ok but not nearly as powerful as my previous.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  The first one crapped out after a long dedicated relationship.  Its light weight, simple and effective.  Its true the detachable groomer/guide thing is easy to come apart, i had to put mine together twice before.  Other than that, great little razor for face, body, pets, neighbors, knuckles, etc.</li>
    <li> good company as I got my product the best price, arrived on time and without problems</li>
    <li> My husband really liked this grooming set until the hair trimmer guard broke.&lt;br /&gt;He looked around for other groomers and decided that he really liked this one and wanted another.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought another groomer for Christmas. He uses this about once every month to month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Today he went to trim and the exact same piece broke off of the hair trimmer guard.&lt;br /&gt;Im trying to get a replacement from Norelco since this is under a 2 year warranty and it is clearly a defect in the design.&lt;br /&gt;Still, not happy that it broke because he cant trim his hair until I go get something for him to use!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this kit after reading several reviews. I was very impressed with the overall quality of the trimmer and attachments. It seems that Norelco has mastered the art of combining high quality stainless steel with durable, precision-molded and assembled plastics. It is unbelievable that such a combination of grooming devices can be packaged all for less than $20! The basic machine is a simple rotating \\&quot;finger\\&quot; that results in reciprocating action by the several trimmers and shavers in the kit. It is comfortable in the hand, quiet and balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the basic trimmer, the nose/ear trimmer, and the beard trimmer successfully. The tiny shaver is a bit of a puzzle due to its small size, but it does what it is suppose to, which is allows close shaving along the edges of a trimmed beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to using the hair grooming device, as I usually have my barber cut my hair to 1/2 inch length. I should be able to use the Norelco to do that. Once you master the settings for the combs for beard and hair trimming, it is not difficult to keep the setting stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always read the directions to understand battery charging and extending the battery life. I have a 10-year-old Norelco Reflex Plus cordless shaver with new cutters, and the battery still holds a charge for weeks.</li>
    <li> used it three times for hair cutting. very easy to use, and my husband is absolutely satisfied with it. if you also just want to cut your hair very short, this toolkit will be enough for you and save you a lot of salon money.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price, would recommend. I have been using now for several months and has help up rather well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 6 months, no issues till now. works well. charging also lasts for good time. I am taking few more pieces to my friends too. Its worth for money too.  Only thing i felt was, if it had worked for 110-240V it would have been great. I cannot effort to reduce its rating because of this. Guys, if you are planning to use this product in other countries like India, make sure you use a tranformer or else its charger will go off immediately (like it happened with my earlier piece)  Thanks,  Vinayender</li>
    <li> This trimmer is sharp (trims hair quickly without any pulling or scratching of skin),  Efficient (fast clipper through thick hair without clogging), and flexible (many trimming heads for different length or style of cut).  It can also be used in sensitive areas without fear.  Much better than my last trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great product, for a great price.  replaced the same product which i had 4 over 5 years, blade was getting dull and battery didnt hold charge 4 more than 2-3 shaves.  It does everything i need it to do and im looking forward the next 5 years and getting my money&#x27;s worth again!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for doing haircuts, but unfortunately it is completely useless for this: Hair gets stuck in the machine, and the engine is too weak.</li>
    <li> Works great. For non-professional trimmer has a good amount of power.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product because the pictured stand is NOT included.  Unless traveling, the pouch that is included is not convenient.  I haven&#x27;t actually tried it yet due to the requisite 10 hours of pre-use charging time.</li>
    <li> This groomer works great. I owned one previously and loved it. It has many different settings which gives it flexibility. I like that you can knock down the eyebrows with ease.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. My husband likes it and says all attachments work well except 1. The attachment that gets rid of stubble and provides smooth face doesn&#x27;t work well. Great for manscaping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for 30 years and this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. I had the exact same trimmer for 6 or 7 years and the battery finally went out. I was thrilled to find they still made it. It comes with several flexible heads that allow you to trim your beard and even your hair if you choose. The charge lasts a good while and when down it charges fully in about 30 minutes. The price on Amazon was cheaper than when I bought my first one. How many things can you say that about? It&#x27;s absolutely a 2 thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> Had to buy another one... the power was not good enough.</li>
    <li> Dear Amazon,    If you have a picture of an item, it should accurately represent what will come in the box.  This picture includes a very convenient charging stand that holds all the attachments.  What comes in the box is a razor, a charger, a bunch of attachments, and a bag.  This is the opposite of convenient, and the opposite of the picture.  Fix your picture, and expect this item to be returned in the very near future.  Thank you in advance for the full refund.</li>
    <li> I like all the parts that come with the grooming system, however, the picture is deceiving due to no stand to put all the parts in. Now they are just laying around. The previous one I had purchased had the base.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel razor because it was small and inexpensive with reasonable reviews. It&#x27;s absolute junk. When I was young I noticed that by Grandpa had little patches of long hairs that he missed while shaving. I figured it was his failing eyesight but now it&#x27;s all clear to me, he had a razor like this one.</li>
    <li> So crude and painful that I could not use this trimmer. The quality is horrible. It cuts skin easily and pulls stubble. I tried using twice and it is simply impossible.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because the price was right. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I have had this for just over 4 months and have treated it no rougher then any other personal grooming device I own. One day, I dropped it in the sink and it is now completely useless to me because the beard trimmer BROKE! I can use the other attachments , but it is now unable to perform it&#x27;s main task. For $20 bucks, I didn&#x27;t expect much, but I certainly expected more. I would advise against this product. The build quality of the main unit is solid, but the attachments  are flimsy and break WAY too easily. I own other Norelco products, and I have to say they cut corners wherever they can. I hope in the future they put out a line of products that uses quality materials rather then the cheapest they can get away with. I think next time around I will be going with another brand with all my personal grooming devices.</li>
    <li> Comes with good accessories but a poor Charger. Charger went down only after using twice. Trimmer cannot be charged while using.</li>
    <li> Cons - button that pops off the top for putting different grooming cap on is right above the on/off button, and easily hit, because just as big in different shape. Should have put it on the back.&lt;br /&gt;To remove the mustache trimmer to just use the blade, common when trimming, you must slide the whole trimmer assembly off, using depth level button to remove. That probably won&#x27;t last long. Previous trimmer the whole head assembly came off maintaining the setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses - decent selection of other trimmer types to replace, though ease of carrying/storing them has not been found yet.</li>
    <li> This product is all I could have asked for and more.  I think that it is the detachable parts that make this product amazing.  And, while I haven&#x27;t had it for a long time I am impressed to the point that I can say, do yourself a favor and make the purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you into thinking this is a cheap product. This is a great razor that I use a few times every week. It comes with a bunch of attachments (most of which I don&#x27;t use) but the best thing is the rechargeable battery. For only ~$13, this thing is great and helps me keep my stubbly look.</li>
    <li> Ok overall, however some of the features of the grooming system have very little use. The shaver, for example, does not provide a very close shave at all.Same with some other features. Bottomline - don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
    <li> I wanted to by a plug and play trimmer but couldn&#x27;t because of my low budget. Then I selected this one and it is really amazing. It is powerful enough. Battery life is also long. It comes with different attachments and I&#x27;ve tried all of them and they really works well. I am using it for last 1 month. I use the main trimmer for usual trimming, the precision trimmer attahcment works well for sharpening and improving the edges (if you like to give some shape), for nasal trimmer, you have to try li&#x27;l bit harder bcoz it&#x27;s not so easy as main trimmers..!! Both the guide combs are so effective and shaver is also quite good. But before using the shaver attachment, make sure that your facial hairs are not more than 1 mm in length because shaver attachment only works with short (1 mm) hair..!!&lt;br /&gt;This one is really best product but you have to maintain it in clean condition so after every use, clean it with the brush provided and don&#x27;t use continuously for 5-10 minutes because by doing this you will get lots of hairs inside the attachments so run it for 2 minutes, take a pause, clean it and reuse it.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, this is a delicate thing so please handle with care..!!</li>
    <li> This is easily the best grooming system. Easy to use looks cool and handy and definitely a variety of options .. go for it , for the money you pay its more than worth it ...</li>
    <li> If this trimmer&#x27;s parts didn&#x27;t break so easily it&#x27;d be a great tool. However this is my second one that had the gimmicky adjustable trimmer accessory jam and break.Then it becomes unusable. Made with thin plastic, it explains why it&#x27;s so cheap.A real piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Norelco should be ashamed of ever putting this on the market under their previous good name.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the grooming system for a little over a month and have absolutely no complaints.  I&#x27;ve used most of the attachments and they&#x27;ve all worked like they should.  If you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive that just gets the job done, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I actually use this for grooming my beard as well as for trimming my very low faded cut hair. I have tried 4-5 other shavers (some much more expensive) and this one works the best for a low cut trim that you can very easily adjust for a gradual height change (fade). My only negative remark would be for the quality from Phillips Norelco. I broke the guide I use most and couldn&#x27;t get another one. After several attempts at getting a better one from other manufacturers I gave up and bought another....they are that easy to use.</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate it higher. It has a lot of attachments and it&#x27;s worked well for beard trimming, but after a short while, something happened with the blade, and it has cut into my skin on many occasions. It just means I have to be really careful with it, I suppose. For the $17 I payed, I guess I can&#x27;t ask for much more, but it&#x27;s still underwhelming.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for well over a year now and I&#x27;ve only charged it a handful of times. All of the tips work perfectly and cleaning them is easy. The trimmer is lightweight and accurate. The blades are still sharp after a lot of regular use. I recommend this product and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome inexpensive and does the job. I love the different adapters. Easy to switch out and they make it very versatile. My last set of these lasted nearly 10 years... for roughly $20 that&#x27;s beyond impressive.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a previous model which was several years old. One of the attachments broke and would have been as expensive to replace as buying this complete new trimmer. If this one also lasts several years, I&#x27;ll consider it money well spent.    For between barber visits, this trimmer works very well, at least for short hair. The batteries are now NiMH (my older one had NiCad) and last for about three trims. It&#x27;s quieter than the older model, maybe because of the new batteries. It&#x27;s very easy to use since it&#x27;s cordless. And power is more than sufficient, again at least for short hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this item to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. The only thing he doesn&#x27;t like is the storage cup and the way you feed the electric plug adapter into the storage cup. Many times when you thing the bottom of the groomer is plugged in to be recharged it isn&#x27;t. A minor frustration to get use to. He loves doing his sideburns,ear and nose hair trimming in between barber visits.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best buys in Amazon.Especially with respect to value.My husband just loves this thing.U will get ur value for money back within 4-8 weeks. He uses this to trim his hair ,beard, side burns ,moustache..All I did was watched his hair dresser at the salon...as they too have similar trimmers..Follow the same routine at home...And U dont have to go to the salon anymore...Ofcourse..if ur new to hair cuts it takes time...but..once u get the hang of it..u can act like a pro ;-)...I wish they had something so effective for women too.</li>
    <li> Product works great and as  described and does a good job of trimming. I would recommend this product for trimming jobs.</li>
    <li> Quite frankly, this is a piece of junk.  I&#x27;m surprised that Norelco would put its name on it.  I received it as a Christmas gift and within a week, the adjustment lock on both the beard and hair trimmer had broken so that I could no longer use either on anything but the shortest length. The trimmer itself is adequate, but not up to Wahl or other basic cutters.  The parts are mostly plastic and cheaply made.  I would not suggest this cutter to anyone. Either spend more money and get something substantial and durable, or spend the same amount on a trimmer without the frills that is better made.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an excellent product from Norelco when I purchased this to replace my worn out Conair trimmer. It turns out that the quality is just fair. It works Ok for trimming facial hair though not perfectly. I strongly suggest NOT using this for trimming body hair because it is very easy to clip your skin. No matter how careful I am I can&#x27;t avoid drawing blood. I will defiantly be replacing this set with something better very soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve has half a dozen beard trimmers in my life. I&#x27;ve owned this one twice, because somehow i lost the charging cable. Once charges this thing kicks for MONTHS. Gets the perfect shave. is accurate. I keep it in the shower its whole life, and after a few years, still no rust. still works. still sharp. no battery drain. Norelco fo&#x27; lyfe!</li>
    <li> Its been 2 years after i got this.&lt;br /&gt;Whats the one most amazing thing about this product? The customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 6 months teh clipper attachment broke when it fell down. I called customer service.&lt;br /&gt;What do they do? They sent me a brand new set. Not this model, but an upgraded model. No questions asked. WTF :-)&lt;br /&gt;I have seen nothing like this customer service ever any where. Norelco rocks</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a while before writing a review to see if any of the troubles other people reported happened with my unit.  I&#x27;m happy to report that they did not.  My trimmer holds a charge for a very long time, and it works very well.  It&#x27;s only been a few months, but so far I love the unit.  It is used for my face as well as a few other spots that need trimming.  As with any trimmer, BE CAREFUL if you&#x27;re trimming a potentially sensitive or \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; area.  Note that you do not need to use that big base unit to charge the trimmer.  The chord merely slips into that thing.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different types before, but never found one that I liked.  This product works amazingly, and most importantly is easy to clean.  Everything except the actual base can be cleaned in water, so you just take the detachable pieces off when finished and throw them in some hot water for a little bit, and you&#x27;re done and ready to go for next time.  Much easier than other brands where you have to attack everything with a brush and cleaning liquid.</li>
    <li> It takes more effort to shave the chest. Also the nose piece does not work to perfection. The face shave piece useless. Its best to use this product for hair shave.</li>
    <li> Great electric groom kit.  I use all the accessories.  Does the job well and is a bargain at this price.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable length beard trimmer attachment is great - quick and effective.  The nose hair trimmer hasn&#x27;t pulled yet (knock on wood).  Holds a charge for a couple of months, when used 3-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Used this for a while. After about 3 months the plastic length adjuster broke. Now it&#x27;s worthless.    Also, if it starts to slow down and you plug it in, it&#x27;ll take 1/2 hour to charge as it won&#x27;t just use the outlet power.    With so many choices, just move on</li>
    <li> I just bought this trimmer this afternoon and while I was trying to attach the beard trimmer, the flat retaining clip and adjustment tab fell out of the attachment.  Obviously these attachments are of very poor quality and design but this seems normal nowadays.  What a shame that in the year 2007, manufactures cannot do any better than this.  I would be ashamed if I designed this peice of garbage.     I am taking this already broke piece of junk back for a refund and will no longer buy their products.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I have been using it for over a year now and am happy to report that it is still running as strong as the day I purchased. The attachments are awesome, and the charge lasts for what feels like a month or two. I will most likely be purchasing another, just in case anything were to ever happen to my current. It&#x27;s a great clipper!</li>
    <li> I bought this one after looking forever in futility for one similar to the system it&#x27;s replacing. It&#x27;s fairly large, and is fairly powerful, but just not great at doing detailed trimming. It does the large areas of my goatee just fine, but some areas of the mustache are hard to get at well. Not bad for the price, and it does some things really well. I guess it&#x27;s just hard to replace a tool that did everything the way I liked, and did it for many years.</li>
    <li> This product is great, a very good performance for the price. The one drawback though (hence 4 stars and not 5) is the transformer is for 110v only, therefore it may not work outside the US where most AC is 220V. I actually did not notice until I pluged it on 220V in a hotel, where it just blew away. Otherwise, you can purchase without any doubt and can shave/trim any part of your body confidently.</li>
    <li> I mostly use it for trimming my facial hair and this product makes it amazingly easy. It trims the hair without making you feel any hair pull. This retains the charge quite well. I use it once a week and I haven&#x27;t recharged in six weeks.</li>
    <li> Trims well.  Plasticky, would rather fewer piece of higher quality, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to replace an identical one I bought over 7 years ago.  The first one held up well. I feel confident this one will too</li>
    <li> does the job. has many option and features. cant say that its the best machine ive seen, but it worth its price</li>
    <li> I still own a Norelco 20XL, but because the NiCad battery would no longer take a charge I decided to try the G370. Well, let me tell you, don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk! (Sorry Norelco!) To begin, using the beard/hair trimmer attachment is a joke. Trying to adjust it will cause the head assembly to come off because the mechanism that locks the adjustment in place is poorly designed. Also, compared to the 20XL, the G370 looks and feels like it&#x27;s flimsily made--actually because it is! It appears Norelco set out to design something like the 20XL but provides more options while keeping the price down at where the 20XL sold for. The only thing I found going for the G370 is that Norelco is now using a NiMH battery instead of a NiCad battery. Why do I know this? Because I took the G370 apart and took its battery out and replaced the NiCad battery in my 20XL. Now I have my 20XL working and I threw away the piece of junk G370. By the way, you can use a NiMH battery in a device that is designed for a NiCad battery. However, always read manufacturer&#x27;s warning label just in case. Just be aware that charging time will vary between a NiMH and NiCad.</li>
    <li> People who expect a $100 trimmer who buy this one and are disappointed by it, are crazy! This cost me $14 and works great. I trim up my beard twice a week and it works without a problem. I haven&#x27;t had issues with the plastic attachments breaking and even if something would break, it cost me $14 so I would get over it. If this trimmer last me only a year, I wouldn&#x27;t be sad because it had served its purpose. Great trimmer for the guy who doesn&#x27;t need it everyday. Don&#x27;t look any further.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of poorly constructed or faulty trimmers in a row. This one lives up to the good reviews, at a very reasonable price none the less. It certainly is not the most solid trimmer that I have had. It does have a light plastic feel to it. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months and I have no complaints. I would certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> I trim my beard every day, and I used many types of trimmers, this is the best one! highly recommend.   it&#x27;s precise and easy to use, no cuts and no bold areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this \\&quot;system\\&quot; for a couple years now, and I&#x27;ve just had the last straw with it so I threw it against the bathroom wall and smashed it to pieces.  What happened? Well, tolerating this POS just became too much, and it painfully pulled another nose hair for the last time.  The actual cutting surfaces are dull and pull your hair more than cut it clean. Everytime I use it I end up drawing blood somewhere. It&#x27;s just cheap... and painful. You can&#x27;t use it if it is plugged in, which is useless if the battery dies, and it takes a full day to charge. Useless. Hair easily gets inside the attachment area.    Yes it will trim hair, with all kinds of crappy attachments.  They should have given a couple quality attachments, rather than 6 dull surfaces.</li>
    <li> It took some time for me to write this review simply because I needed ample time to use this product and all its components. After doing such, I must say I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The blades are sharp and cleaning is a breeze (just rinse with running water). It&#x27;s cordless, rechargeable, has a storage pouch and doesn&#x27;t make that much noise (in my opinion). I&#x27;ll break things down as it relates to each piece of the clipper set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Full-size Trimmer: Awesome, ergonomic design, lightweight, effective. Does an even job QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Mini shaver: I really didn&#x27;t have use for this piece actually... nothing came out of it for me but maybe it did for others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Hair clipper: I have very short hair (close enough to my scalp) so suffice to say this didn&#x27;t do much for me. It didn&#x27;t go low enough to properly cut my hair and the grooves in the teeth left uneven spaces, which eventually led me to use the full-size trimmer on its own. What I do love about it though is that I can adjust the height of the cap from 1-9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Beard &amp; moustache trimmer: This is great! It delivers! I got an even cut and I could also adjust the height of the cap from 1-9 similar to the hair clipper. When the hair clipper didn&#x27;t get to my hair I immediately switched to this cap and got great results in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Nose, ear &amp; eyebrow trimmer: I only used this on my nose (I don&#x27;t have ear hair and I don&#x27;t have a need to trim my eyebrows) and it worked great. Tickled at first but it did an awesome job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Precision &amp; detailing trimmer: As the name suggests, it delivers precise action each and every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy I found this item and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. One thing I forgot to mention is that I wish it came with the stand that&#x27;s displayed in one of the product pictures, but it&#x27;s not so much a big deal to me since I still store every piece in the original hard plastic package.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and the cheap plastic parts had broken off. Unusable for even one shave. Sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has lots of accessories, is easy to handle, holds a charge a long time, and is quite powerful.  I would recommend it highly, and feel it is a great value for a very low cost.  Please be aware that the charging tray holding all the accessories and shaver in the photo, does not come with this model.</li>
    <li> This model is way better than the newer models. Even though it is plastic and can break easily, I find the unit is easier to use and more stable to guide through the hair.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Looking at price, best deal around.  Can be used for all purposes, nose and ear hair trimming,   beard trimming, hair clipper etc.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was a little daunting receiving all the attachments to this grooming system.  The instructions leave a lot to be desired, and I had to get a magnifying glass (I wear tri-focals) to read some of the instructions and look at the illustrations to assimilate what they meant.  Did not feel that they were clear.  The first time I used the trimmer, which can be length controlled by a dial, it got stuck on the apparatus it attaches to which is removable so I must use the trimmer in the position that it is dialed.  Thank goodness I had dialed it to the length I always use.  I am not really excited about the cut it gave or the way the hair looks while growing out.  I probably will explore buying another trimmer, and one that does not have all the attachments.</li>
    <li> Works really well, great price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products we have bought in a long time. My husband loves it! I only gave it 3 stars because we had some customer service issues. Other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a trimmer for me and my husband and saw this one. I read all the reviews I could find for it and a few others. Then I saw that my dad had this trimmer and asked him how he liked it. He said he really liked it, that the attachments worked well on it, it held charge well, and it didn&#x27;t pull his hair or skin. So, I went ahead and ordered it. I am glad I did. My husband really likes it. He has used several of the attachments for it and likes those too. It does work well on delicate areas, but only use the bigger timmer head. The small one will grab and pull. Overall, we are very please w/ this purchase.    *UPDATE* 03/19/11  This is still working very well. It holds the charge for a very long time. My husband has used the foil attachment regularly since he got this, and he said it is the only attachment that pulls. But he said that it didn&#x27;t pull enough to really hurt, so he still uses it. He is still very satisfied w/ this item.</li>
    <li> Has a very good battery power. I use it rarely. I have used nearly like 15 times and not recharged it.  Total value for money.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer for the price. You can use it to pretty much trim any part of your body. However, it is a bit loud for my taste. Overall, it is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
    <li> As the general consensus seemed to indicate that this was the best value for money, I bought this and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. There is a large number of useful attachments and although I haven&#x27;t used all of them the hair trimmer with different lock settings, the mini trimmer and the mini shaver have worked as well as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some useful information on the info sheet. The extensions all fit in the attachment stand (which looks like it could have been sturdier) pretty snugly and while cleaning the extensions after is slightly bothersome it is nothing too bad especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the top reviewer said the plastic clam shell packaging was a bother and I came off with a couple of scratches from trying to open it with a pair of scissors while making sure I did not cut up the info sheet. I have yet to figure out why companies still insist on using these.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. At sub $20 this would be the best value of money among all the trimmers available out there. Only lack is a proper carrying kit but then at this price if i am expecting that also, then i think its a tad too much.. Great value for money..</li>
    <li> The battery is good. It is quite sharp.So be careful. You need to practice for some times to control it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit several months ago, and have been very satisfied.  Multiple attachments make it easy for trimming sideburns, nose hairs, and the back of the neck.  I dont have a beard, but the unit does come with a couple beard trimming attachments as well.</li>
    <li> Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge.</li>
    <li> This lasted me for several years and did the job well with little to no maintenance just cleaning. I got it wet, cleaning it, several times and it finally burned out. I would probably buy it again though.</li>
    <li> It lacks more power. when I took the head off I noticed that the spinning thing inside was covered in grease (it´s supposed to lubricate  the mechanism) and it get all covered by hair, so it´s quite challenging to clean it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months already and I could only say that for that price u hardly find something better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product since I already had one for my sons birthday gift.  Works good for trimming the stache and beard.</li>
    <li> This is my first beard trimmer purchase. Until now I&#x27;ve been using grooming scissors to trim my goatee. This trimmer is excellent! Very easy to use, the attachments snap on pretty easily. Other trimmer reviews complained that the attachments were flimsy and that the snaps would chip or break off after about 3-4 uses, except for the hair comb attachment this trimmer&#x27;s attachments don&#x27;t feel very flimsy. The blade attachments snap in easily, and then the comb attachments click in place over the blade. It&#x27;s fairly simple, and works well.    Almost as soon as the trimmer arrived I had it out of the box and was trimming my goatee. It performed excellently, and only took about 2-3 minutes to get set up, trimming, and done. I was rinsing out the attachment and letting it dry before I knew it. I&#x27;ve used all the attachments except for the nose/ear/brow trimmer and can say I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. You probably can&#x27;t find a better trimmer setup for the price.</li>
    <li> This shaver was actually a replacement for an identical one that also failed after a few months.  Like almost all appliances these days,  the charger is supposedly designed for both 120 and 220 current--I live in both the states and Africa--and for the first 5 months, it worked perfectly.  However, once again, it simply failed to recharge the shaver.</li>
    <li> The precision trimmer and the full size trimmer (with comb) work fantastically. I imagine the clippers (being based on the full-size trimmer) will work well too. I found the mini-shaver useless (takes forever to shave anything), and have not tried the nose-hair trimmer yet. Also, the bag is very cheap and I threw it out because it was coming apart.  Despite the low quality of some of the other accessories, the core functionality is great, especially for the price, so I&#x27;ll only take one star off for that. I bought for growing my first beard and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a trimmer. So far I&#x27;ve no regrets or desire to upgrade to anything else. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer already.</li>
    <li> My husband has gone through two of these. It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, and breaks quickly. A piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Works great as a trimmer... I use on my body and on Sideburns, ears, nose, and face... Love the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; of the adjustable length guide/shield...</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, hard to clean, and easily broken. The beard trimmer attachment is very delicate, the nose hair trimmer is pretty dull, and the foil shaver does absolutely nothing. NOTHING. Won&#x27;t even trim the peach fuzz off your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, it does do a decent trimming job if you&#x27;re careful with it. How happy you are with your purchase depends on what you pay for it, and the price here seems to fluctuate wildly. I paid twenty dollars in 2011; now they&#x27;re asking more than fifty. For anything under twenty-five bucks, it&#x27;s worth it. More than that, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The grooming system is good for maintaining a beard. The small shaver is good for removing growth in the parts of the face that you do not want bearded. The trimming system (a small and a large trimmer) are good for trimming beard edges. The large trimmer has a calibrated comb that allows you to trim the hair on the top of the head. That is good for cutting down the number of haircuts that you need. With another setting you can also trim the beard (I wear a fairly short facial beard) The nose and ear hair trimmer works, but not perfectly. It is noisy when you trim in the ears - I was nervous whether there was the potential of damaging hearing. It also requires many passes to get at all the hairs. I use the small trimmer initially to remove long hears and then I follow up with the nose and ear trimmer. The charger is not a hi-tech charger. It only works on US voltages, and there is no protection for the NiCad batteries</li>
    <li> I use this to trim lighter areas of my fluffy cat.  It works well without having to get out the big clipper.  Haven&#x27;t used it on a human yet though.</li>
    <li> Lot of accessories and works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this in October 2012 and it is still going strong.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday but it works great every time I do.  Lots of attachments, even a nose hair trimmer</li>

    <li> When I saw this item I was hesitant in thinking it could do all it claims as well as all I needed it to do.  The price is unbelievable and so low compared to drug store razors and trimmers.  I am thrilled with this product and find that the grooming system comes with all the pieces necessary to serve all my needs.  This really is an all in 1 kit.  You get a full size trimmer as well as a mini shaver.  Any man can use this for full body grooming.  It will take care of your hair, beard and moustache with exsquisite precision.  You can also trim your nose and ear hairs as well as the eyebrows.  The guide comb and mini shaver and attachments also help you to trim away any unnecessary body hair be it trimming the neck and sideburns to back hair, chest hair and any area there is unwanted hair.  The attachments are very easy to clean and I find that as long as I keep the whole set clean it continues to work with definite precision.  Battery life for me has worked great.  Seems to last a reasonable length of time with each charge.  I highly recommed this system.  It has proven the answer to all my grooming needs.</li>
    <li> My first one lasted for about 5 years of daily use, and is actually still working though does not hold a charge for long.  I bought another as I use to shave my head daily and also trim my beard. If the blades are oiled regularly it should keep running.  I&#x27;ve dropped it a number of times and it still works great.  So if you are a clumsy bald man with a beard, you can&#x27;t beat the value for the money.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, item as described, good condition, no problems</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming kit for men.  I am only concerned about the durability of this product!  I have not had success in the past.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over past 3 years now. For the price that it comes, it is a fantastic product. I recommend G370 all in one to everyone who is looking for a good product to use. This product in my opinion should not disappoint you.</li>
    <li> I purchased the same trimmer in July of 1998 for over $20 and the battery slowed down some and I purchased another one again from Amazon for less money after 13 years. It is rechargeable and has the same design with the same grooming tools as the one I purchased 13 years ago. Amazing product for the money and that is for a trimmer. Do not get this for fine grooming unless you have used it for some time. Bravo.</li>
    <li> This grooming tool is well made and works very well for the money. They should include the stand to hold the shaver and trim heads, the last one I purchased had one.</li>
    <li> Ive had this well over a year and nothing has broken. the battery still lasts me a long time. the only thing is the little case it comes with is a piece of crap but the machine its self is quite good. I use this about once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these little trimmer kits I&#x27;ve owned... they&#x27;ve each lasted a couple of years and eventually just won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  I still keep coming back though - these are pretty cheap and they work well so it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
    <li> Let me first say, overall I am pleased with the performance of this trimmer. It met all of my expectations as an inexpensive facial hair trimmer and lasted about as long as you might suspect, in my case a little over a year. If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality device that will stand the test of time, look elsewhere. But for under $20 this thing is a hell of a lot cheaper and more convenient than a years supply of razors (assuming you don&#x27;t mind the 5-o-clock shadow look) or even a single trip to a professional.     Other than durability, which is not great by the way, one minor complaint I do have about the design is that it is very easy to press the button that detaches any given shaving/trimming piece for the device while you are in the middle of using it. On more than one occasion, I would accidentally tap the release button and send the beard trimmer flying across the floor of my bathroom. After a year or so of use mine doesn&#x27;t even turn on anymore, but some will probably have better luck. For me, it&#x27;s time to shop around for something different.</li>
    <li> The product works great~~This is the second time I bought this product.  The only drawback is that it could not work when it is charging..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this one before but lost/left it in a hotel room. Bought this one off Amazon for a better price I could buy it the store for. Decent quality, trims good. It does the job for everyday trimming.</li>
    <li> Great grooming product. Love that fact that it&#x27;s a rechargeable, less waste with disposable batteries. The beard guide is great and the nose trimmer gets it done. Pretty happy camper right here.</li>
    <li> Actually I did not hate it, but it stop working 1 month after I brought it and it is useless for , money gone into vain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not return it since I crossed one month standard return Policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I liked the gromming kit it is useless for me with all its parts perfectly fine, Is there any way you guys can provide me the main part.</li>
    <li> I received the item as a gift, and I didn&#x27;t already have a trimmer, so I decided to open the package and use it despite the myriad negative reviews. I have an average beard - not too thick, not too thin, but full face coverage. I keep it trimmed under 1 inch almost all the time, and usually much shorter.    Packaging:  The package is a blister pack which encloses the trimmer, attachments, carrying case, the base stand/holder, and a charging adapter. The charging adapter can be attached to the base stand, although it&#x27;s a pretty cheesy design. The packaging is attractive and protective in PET recyclable plastic, and all the necessary operating parts are included.    Design:  The base stand/holder is thin plastic, cheaply made, and barely functional. The attachments are likewise cheap, poorly made plastic with barely functional adjusting mechanism. The trimmer unit has a fixed internal battery which is charged by plugging in a 1.6 volt, 80 mA power supply with positive tip - a small yellow one that is the same size often used to charge mobile phones and bluetooth devices. Previous reviewers are correct in saying that the trimmer cannot be powered directly from a wall outlet. The user can leave it plugged in during operation, but it will not draw wall power in any way (the LED indicator shuts off) when the trimmer switch is on. The trimmer unit seems thus far to be solidly built.    Function:  I gave the item 2 stars because it works for trimming facial hair, but not very well. It cuts slowly and awkwardly even through hair on accessible areas of the face and neck. Attachments are adjustable for various hair lengths, but the user soon discovers that the attachment and adjustment mechanisms are inexact and flimsy.     The trimming process is not a pleasant experience, and the poor design and cheap construction are the reasons why. In my first attempt, the trimming attachment went careening into the nearby toilet. If I keep the item, I anticipate having the experience ofholding the attachments on the trimmer, as previous reviews have commented. The manufacturer provides a 45-day money back guarantee if the product is postmarked within the time period and mailed along with the store receipt. Call 800.243.3050 for authorization. Defective products will be repaired or replaced without charge for a period of two years from date of purchase.    In summary:  Flimsy. Barely functional. Not worth $20, but possibly worth $5-$10. Do not expect this to be a lifelong friend, but it should work for a short period of time or in a pinch. Other brands I have used, including Wahl and even Conair, have worked much better. This should not be considered an indictment of all Philips Norelco products, as I have been satisfied with others. In this case, however, consider paying more for a better product.</li>
    <li> It works ok, however it is not particularly sharp. Don&#x27;t expect to have very smooth edges. However it cuts fine and fits well in the hand. The charge life is average, and the whole thing looks and feels sturdy and well built.</li>
    <li> If you are planning to use this as a hair trimmer for kids then it is not the one. The switch that adjusts the length of cut attachment is too flimsy.  Numerous time the whole trim head slides off since the plastic adjustor on top sits too tight on the hair trimmer.  Happened 3-4 times while I was trimming my sons hair.  ( I do that between his visits to the hair cuttery).  Finally I called Norelco and invoked the 45 day money back gurantee and sent it back.</li>
    <li> This is relevant for G370/G380:  I purchased the trimmer as I liked the convenience of a cord free appliance.  I travel a lot, so it&#x27;s great to be able to pack and take with me.  It&#x27;s very convenient, works really well - I use for trimming hair only.      Major downside is the flimsy adjustable hair trimmer.  The adjustments are not very secure when fitted to the trimmer, however, the flimsy plastic teeth on the comb easily break.  I&#x27;ve contacted Philips/Norelco and it&#x27;s not possible to buy replacement hair trimmer attachments, they can&#x27;t even ship you one for free.  As the item is sold with a Two Year Warranty in the US  they will replace the full product for you.   Seems like such a waste of money in return shipping, packagaing etc.    Come on Philips, just come out with a sturdier hair trimmer attachment that you provide an appropriate hard case for that can easily be used whilst travelling.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, I simply love it, if it is used rightfully, you will not need to shave at all.</li>
    <li> This little deal is great.  I have had it for a very long time and only had to charge it like twice.  I do sometimes put the attachments on backwards when I am tired in the morning and they are pretty easy to get on backwards and harder to get off when put on wrong, but that is more my fault than the products.  I only use the beard trimmer with a built in guard and the small clippers.  I would totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco is the best grooming system that I have found and I have tryed a lot of them it cuts all the fine hair on my head.  This is my third one that I have owned.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for more than a year. This is a great product. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product is certainly value for money. But to my dissatisfaction, the blades are not that sharp. I expected more afterall it being a Philips product!</li>
    <li> one of the best,I recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 of these (for my friends &amp; I)&lt;br /&gt;we are all satisfied</li>
    <li> The shavers work good. All the head work well and can give a close shave but takes a while to do so, about 30-40 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few years now and still think it&#x27;s a great piece.  The attachments fit securely and you get a nice even trim all around.  It&#x27;s great for getting even sideburns and also shaping facial hair.  The battery life has been fine up until a few months ago.  I just charge it more often, that&#x27;s all.  As soon as it will no longer hold a charge at all, I&#x27;ll happily buy another.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for myself and I&#x27;m satisfied with its performance so far. Fairly easy to control the length with its 9 inter-locking position. The battery operated clip is right size and easy to hold. Only concern is the rechargeable-battery life which I leave it to Philips brand name and hoping it will last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to trim my beard for almost 6 months now. The convenience and quality is very worthy relative to its price.</li>
    <li> This item works well and has a good range of attachments to cover your grooming needs.  It even has an electric shaver attachment that I used once to try it out (it works but I don&#x27;t like electric shavers).    For the price this is a must... it also has a nice sleek look and is a good size/weight/shape for the hand.  Every guy needs one of these \\&quot;multi-purpose\\&quot; groomers and for [...] bucks it is a steal.</li>
    <li> Its active ! Its doing all what I like to do. I love the nose trimmer :) Its easy, fast and effective.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son&#x27;s 21 st birthday and graduation.It came within 3 days of ordering.Since it&#x27;s arrival my son has shaved and groomed himself more often than before.He can trim his beard or his side burns because the kit contains several different blades.He has been enjoying it very much with nary a complaint.Product works very well.</li>
    <li> Nice rechargeable trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the attachments have been more useful than I expected.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this.  Twice for my husband over the last 7 years, yes it lasted about 5 years!  And just purchased one for my dad.  I will continue to buy these as they are inexpensive and last a long time.</li>
    <li> The adjustable head on this thing will not stay at the setting you select. When you press it against your face the head collapses to the lowest setting. Not good.</li>
    <li> Not too bad so far. Few things though.&lt;br /&gt;1. Was confused with the adjustable heads.&lt;br /&gt;2. Sometimes when you change trimmers feels like you will twist off the trimmer head.&lt;br /&gt;3. Also feels like you&#x27;ll strip the heads when pulling off the trimmer guards</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco, I keep buying them because they are great. Its really handy, charge lasts a lot and does the job.</li>
    <li> I had received the grooming set very fast and it was brand new. Nothing was opened and everything works great.</li>
    <li> I must have had the same grooming system for about 10 yrs before I decided that I need another updated grooming system.  The Philip norelco had very good reviews and with the relatively low cost I choose this product the last me the next few years.  I like the beard trimmer that has an adjustable length to trim my beard in the winter when I like a little length to it.  I also like that it came with a plug in charger, because it&#x27;s a pain to have to buy batteries all the time.  This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let these people rip you off, I had this cheap trimmer like 5 years ago and it had only cost me $12.00. Don&#x27;t get ripped off!!</li>
    <li> Had my first one for a number of years (until I dropped it and flushed it down the toilet on accident).  Found the exact same model so had to get it.  Great product (many more attachments than I hope to ever need to use - seriously, who uses a nose hair trimmer?).</li>
    <li> I bought this product almost 4 years ago and its still kicking! Trimmer still cuts facial hair with no tugging or pulling and I have some thick facial hair. I was skeptical at first being so cheap with all those attachments, but was pleasantly surprised. The adjustable beard trimmer is just great, no more switching on and off different clips. I really only use this to trim my beard and use the other attachment for my sideburns. Battery charge holds pretty well, I use this about 1-2 times a week and cant remember when I charged it last. It did give me some trouble recharging it before (about 2 years after purchase), the recharge light didn&#x27;t come on when I plugged it in, thought it was busted. But I fooled with it a bit more and it works again. Even if it died at the time, there is no question in my mind whether or not I&#x27;d buy another. Whenever it finally decides to kick the bucket, I&#x27;ll place another order.</li>
    <li> I have one of these, and bought this one for my friend. I have been using this for more than three years now, still working great. Replaced the the internal-battery once, about a year back.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back and began finding problems with it right away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) The trimmer cannot operate on A/C power alone.  This means you can&#x27;t plug it into the wall and use it.  Instead, you have to charge the battery, then unplug it to use it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) About 2 weeks after I bought it, the beard trimmer attachment broke.  The little tabs that hold it at different lengths snapped off so you can only use it on the shortest setting, and you have to hold the attachment on with your hand so it won&#x27;t slide off.  Clearly, I&#x27;m not the only one who this has happened to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3) The nose trimmer has very dull blades. I don&#x27;t normally use a nose trimmer nor do I really need one, but I have a cheap one that I got in my Christmas stocking that I&#x27;ve used a few times.  Out of curiosity, I tried the attachment that came with this trimmer and was introduced to a new kind of pain.  It was pulling at the hairs but not cutting them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I contacted the a representative at Norelco to see if I they would send me a replacement beard attachment or if I could purchase just that attachment.  They directed me to their service centers who wanted $10 for just that attachment.  Including shipping, it would have cost me almost what I payed for the whole set. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My advice:  pay a little more for something sturdier.  That&#x27;s what I plan on doing.</li>
    <li> Received on time.  I like it. Thanks</li>
    <li> great product, work great</li>
    <li> This thing changed my life. Endless beard care for the price of one professional trim.</li>
    <li> I have been using this watch for over 2 years. Here are my views about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;• Works good, never had any issues in last two years&lt;br /&gt;• You can use it at least two times, approx. 30 mins after one charge of abt 6-8 hours&lt;br /&gt;• Pretty affordable and reliable&lt;br /&gt;• Precision blade and attachments are nice for sideburns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;• So many fancy attachments, half of them are just useless.&lt;br /&gt;• Even at biggest level, if you try to trim the hairs of your head, it will chop them too short.&lt;br /&gt;• Will leave a pretty subtle and thick beard. Not close enough for a trimmer at lowest level.&lt;br /&gt;• Shaver attachment is a piece of junk. If you try to use it, it will take you almost an hour to complete your shave with uniformity and as soon as you will start shaving, you will realize its not efficient but since you started, you will have to finish it :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If you want subtle thick beard, this is right and one of the most affordable product. Quite reliable too but if you like close to 1-2 day earlier shaved like beard, look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;With other trimmers, I used to do trimming once in a week but since this one leaves a thick beard (but it is pretty uniform) so I have to use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: If this review was helpful to you in any way, pleas vote “Yes/helpful”</li>
    <li> My husband had an old beard/mustache/nose hair trimmer. Took batteries so they would lose their juice. This trimmer plugs-in for the charge, but is cordless for the trim.  It comes with multiple attachments and the Norelco brandname to back it up. My husband is quite happy with this item.</li>
    <li> got this for my boyfriend for christmas (2012) its still working (christmas 2013) and he LOVES it!!  He has a beard but likes to keep the edges and sides neat and tidy, it does the job very well!</li>
    <li> I owed some similar - or earlier - model of this trimmer, purchased at BB&amp;B long time ago. Eventually all of its attachments, made of clear and exceptionally brittle plastic, shattered - some due to falls, some simply from normal use; in fact, using the trimmer at the shortest setting made them crack and break at the point of contact with shaver blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, and some reviews for this model pointing to the same flaw, I decided to buy it and be more careful with the grooming attachments. The old trimmer itself still works - the motor, battery (per its manual, I never left it permanently plugged in) and the blades on it were still just fine. The attachments system on this one is completely different and generally improved, though the material is just as fragile, so don&#x27;t let them fall or hit anything. It generally does a very good, accurate and fast job trimming by beard. My only new complaint is in the mechanism that connects the motor drive shaft to the blades - it is covered by white solid grease, some hairs do get inside, and eventually get stuck in that grease. Removing them without removing the grease is obviously not easy.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd set I owned, the first I broke the attachements.  The trimmer set is a very decent trimmer, with nice attachments and a good powerfull motor.  I use it regularly to trim down my facial hair.  The charge lasts pretty long, but dont go overboard and try to cut alot of hair on your head, since it might drain before you finish (30 minutes non stop use on longer hairs).  But in general this hair trimmer is well made and worth the price.</li>
    <li> New and in original packaging Wish I could get another one at the same price I paid in this order!</li>
    <li> For the price I was hopeful this would work at least just for my husbands beard, but I shave his head with it also, had it for a few months, it&#x27;s a great little package deal and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> So the charger got really hot and stopped working the first time charging the trimmer. Sometimes you just get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I got this awhile ago to replace another sub-par product I had. I don&#x27;t have a full beard or mustache; I just try and keep a very neat, short goatee, and some stubble, and also prefer the option to \\&quot;clean it up\\&quot; once in awhile. This product does not allow for this at all. The default blades do not cut close enough to the skin, whereas the shaver pulls hairs instead of shaving them. There&#x27;s no way to get a clean line across with any of the attachments, something that my older entry level Remington could do (I only replaced it because the attachment broke, but that&#x27;s a different story).    Bottom line is I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I&#x27;d spend a little more on one that had a sharp trimmer that produced sharp, clean edges.</li>
    <li> Thing is loud as a F-22 fighter flying over your house. It will last you a long time, but than again you better wear ear plugs when using it.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for about 2 years and I was genuinely sad that it stopped working today. I used it 2-3 times a week for the past 2 years. The battery would last for hours and it was easy to clean. I was thinking of buying this model again but saw that there was a newer one for a few bucks more. I would definitely recommend this product if you don&#x27;t want to shell out the extra bucks to buy the newer model.</li>
    <li> My husband had used the G270 for years and was happy with it. When it finally succumbed to age we were happy to find that the G370 was a match. So far it is meets our expectations based on past performance. It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit plasticky and cheap, but it gets the job done (no matter what kind of job you have for it) and the price is fantastic. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I find that most things that are multi-purpose are never as good as a product that is meant for one thing.  Case in point, this is a good hair trimmer.  All of the other attachments for shaving, nose hair trimmer, etc... just go ahead and throw them away and buy a real one.  That being said, it is iniexpensive and works GREAT as a hair trimmer (face pre shave, body, sideburns, etc) and is completely worth buying for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I sent this ti my son in Taiwan and he has really loved using it.  He said it works well and he was unable to purchase one there that was reasonably priced.  He highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> My nephew ordered this  clipper and i saw it in action.The battery life is very good he said and the versatility of it is to talk about.Its light weight but has a good form factor to it.I personally like the nose &amp; mustache attachment and the eight adjustable height settings that you can choose from when trimming your hair to cutting your mustache.I would recommend it for both male and female.Like the name suggests, it really is a complete all-in-one groomer.I am no way affiliated with the company for those who maybe wondering(I live way down in the Caribbean islands).I&#x27;m just a really really satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I have had untold electric trimmers over the years, and this was a replacement for one that had rusted out.  So far I like the array of attachments and there seems to be one for whatever you would be using this for.  So far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item 4 months back and my charger is not working now. I can not find a charger for that in the market and now I can not use it. Do not order this product. I am not able to find the seller details now and I dont know what to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 70 and have seen a few this one is \\&quot;really\\&quot; nice. They all say their good . This one should say greaaaat!</li>
    <li> If, like me, you are in the market for a $15 grooming device, then let&#x27;s just be honest:  neither of us really cares that much about what we get.  We just want something that will put our facial hair in the \\&quot;acceptable\\&quot; range.  Somewhere between Justin Bieber and Ted Kacyzinski.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little guy is enough for me.  If you have a goatee or a modest beard, it&#x27;s probably enough for you, too.  It&#x27;s exactly as cheap as you&#x27;d imagine it to be.  Got the painted plastic grey buttons and some fairly dinky attachments.  But it has nine stop settings on it, comes with a charger, and is powerful enough that it won&#x27;t pinch the hairs out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t buy this razor to impress anyone, or to accumulate self-respect.  You buy this razor because you&#x27;d rather save your money for the dates you&#x27;ll be getting because your face is now *attractive enough* for the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Godspeed, fellow tightwad.</li>
    <li> Worked quite well until it stopped working about a year after I bought it.  I&#x27;m not crazy about any device that lasts only a bit over a year with maybe use once per week.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Target and returned it after one use. Here was the problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;lock-in\\&quot; length settings were easy enough to change, but they did not actually lock in. When I tried to trim my beard at a 6, the very first time I pressed it to my face, the length setting collapsed all the way down to a 1, effectively shaving off my beard. I had to shave off my entire beard and start from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massively terrible design flaw there, and I highly recommend you do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> While this trimmer is really good and compact for shaving your head hair and beard it&#x27;s not very good as a body trimmer. I tried trimming in my body and it gave me big painful bleeding cuts. It does not have an adjustable head so that I can move the balde a bit back. I tried the other smaller attachment and got the same results. I had a wahl before and never had the issues. Will go back to Wahl, which never caused me bleeding while trimming body hair and which also comes with adjustable head..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great trimmer as long as you don&#x27;t use it for your body hair.</li>
    <li> In between visits to the barber this product is fantastic.  All the different options really come in handy depending on your beard or hairstyle.  It is really flexible depending on the customer&#x27;s wants.</li>
    <li> I purchased this groomer almost a year ago. My first impression was that the housing seemed fragile and the motor underpowered. After regular use, I have changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors remain sharp. The power is more than sufficient. A single recharge lasts for weeks. The groomer is easy to pack, and it is well-designed for the hand. This is a solid, efficient, reliable instrument, and I am very pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat: If your beard is especially coarse or heavy, you may not be as satisfied as I have been.</li>
    <li> I only give this a 2 star review because whoever buys this product is getting ripped off BIG TIME!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned 2 of these over the course of about 7 years.  Its a great trimmer and that&#x27;s why I was looking to buy another one.  BUT you can purchase this thing at a WalMart or Walgreens for like $20 !!</li>
    <li> The set of trimmers and cutter is just right for the man who takes his shaving and trimming on weekly  or more often bases.  The plastic is cheap by some standards but for the price, most buyers might want two or an accessory package.  Great for trimming kids, adults and older gentlemen like me.</li>
    <li> I was very disapointed when I opened my Philips Norelco G370 All In One  Grooming System. It was made out of cheap plastic!  I have been charging it for 2 days and the charge lasted for 3 minutes  I would not avise anyone to purchase this product. It is nothing but trash  I wasted my hard earned money on it. I was exspecting the clippers to be alot bigger</li>
    <li> Decided to look for a new beard and mustache trimmer when my trusty old Norelco Maverick TX-450 finally gave up the ghost and just quit running. If this sounds like I&#x27;m slamming the product, I&#x27;m not, as I had owned this basic battery-operated trimmer for over sixteen years - far longer than I ever expected it to last when I first got it. I could have probably fixed it (again) if I disassembled and cleaned it out, but decided to see what might be new on the market. This was primarily used as a mustache trimmer, but after using it for a few years with a handheld comb, was able to do a fair job with my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was amazed to see how many models were now available, and how many companies were making them. After doing some research (and asking my barber), ended up getting the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]], and must say that so far this seems to have been a good choice. My barber had suggested that I stay with the more basic (and more economical) trimmers, as most from a particular manufacturer have the same heads as their higher-priced models, and it was the cutting head itself that made a trimmer good or bad. He had suggested that I consider some of the Wahl and Panasonic models, but also had a personal preference for the Philips Norelco products, as they seemed to last... which I had also experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has a great array of attachments, and each of them is quite useful, performing exactly as expected. It has an excellent beard and moustache comb/guide with nine locking length settings, as does the hair clipper comb. The little mini-shaver attachment is good for cleanup, and acts like a miniature micro-screen electric razor. Was cautious about the nose and ear trimmer, but after reading the instruction sheet, found that it was easy to master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Six attachments that can be rinsed, making it easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;* Nine length settings with the key trimming attachments&lt;br /&gt;* Self-sharpening blades, no oil needed&lt;br /&gt;* Small travel pouch&lt;br /&gt;* Two-year factory warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took the time to read the instruction sheet that came with this trimmer, which was detailed but easy to understand. The instructions had indicated that the trimmer shouldn&#x27;t be left with the unit charging full-time, which I found to be a nuisance at first. Charged it for the ten hours suggested before using it, and it worked fine, and a charge lasts for weeks. The charging/attachment stand itself looked to be a bit flimsy at first glance, but while handling it when I was setting it up, found that it was sturdier than I had first thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: According to the latest info, this small charging stand no longer comes with the G370 as it did when I first reviewed it in 2009. It no longer appears on the Philips Norelco site as an option, either. Mine was made in China, which made me skeptical at first, but my initial doubts were eased over time, as it has proven to be an excellent trimmer over the long run. I do not know where the current versions are made, but go by the product description if it matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit, as so many products today, came in one of those irritating theft-deterrent clamshell packages designed for retail stores. This one was more of a nuisance to open than most because it was difficult to see if the contents were going to be damaged when cutting through the plastic with a combination of scissors and a sharp knife. Just be careful when opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent selection of attachments&lt;br /&gt;- Green light on power unit indicates charging&lt;br /&gt;- A single charge lasts for weeks&lt;br /&gt;- Good ergonomics, nice feel to it&lt;br /&gt;- Solid; seems to be built well&lt;br /&gt;- Detailed instruction sheet&lt;br /&gt;- 60-day money-back guarantee, 2-year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Horrible clamshell package, difficult to open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we all have different things that we look for in trimmerslike this, thought that I might share some of my findings with others here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also considered the [[ASIN:B000FED5DK Philips Norelco G380 All-in-1 Grooming System]], but the only difference between this and the Philips Norelco G370 Trimmer was that the G380 came in a gray color and had a travel pouch... which also came with the black G370 trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked at the [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]] which was considered for its hair deflector and vacuum, but the price difference was enough to make me go for the more basic G370 trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918-617 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer]] seemed to be a good one, and its ability to operate cordless via battery or plugged into charger sounded good, and it had good reviews. This was a very close second choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B000GP5752 Wahl 9877-500 \\&quot;The Goatee\\&quot; Advanced Dual Blade, Rechargeable/Cordless Beard, Goatee &amp; Mustache Trimmer]] had some interesting dual blades, but the Philips Norelco G370 had more attachments, and the model that I looked at made me shy away from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had also considered the stylish [[ASIN:B000VKV29M Panasonic ER2403K 5 Position Beard/Moustache Trimmer]]. This one features wet or dry trimming, five length adjustments and an excellent price, but since it uses two AAA batteries, decided to rule it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was my past experience with the Philips Norelco products that helped make my choice, and I don&#x27;t regret it. If I can get even a fourth of the life of the sixteen years of service that I got from my original Maverick TX-450, then I&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated January 10, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this Philips Norelco G370 trimmer for almost three years since this review was posted on January 24, 2009. Actually wondered how long it would really last when I originally posted it, with most of the concerns being (1) the life of the rechargeable battery, and (2) the sharpness of the blades on the attachments. Had shaved my beard off in 2010, so it became a daily moustache trimmer. Then I grew the beard again a little over a year ago, and it has seen daily use once again. Happy to report that the trimming attachments are still sharp, and the rechargeable battery is still going strong.

    <li> I had for five years nolerco clipper 20xl (similar price 5 years ago). Someone in store told me that g series replaced xl series.I am not sure if this is true, but G370 dissapoints me. Plastic looks cheap, joints are not solid, power cord is short, but even if it would be longer it wouldn&#x27;t help. Attaching the cord wil not run this trimmer/clipper, battery has to be charged before doing anything (in 20xl in situation when battery is gone I could always attach the power cord and continue). I am happy with tis clipper right now, but I don&#x27;t expact to have it too long. It looks too cheap for that.</li>
    <li> Ever since the day I&#x27;ve gotten this trimmer, I&#x27;ve had more than 5 people borrow it from me. My brother uses it all the time, so I ended up getting him one as a gift. I got these when they were much cheaper, so the value was unmatched. With its easy maintenance, I would definitely recommend to anyone in need of a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the good reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product, and it is not very good at all. It takes a long time to trim and does so very unevenly.  Try a more expensive product like the Phillips QT4070 or other brand.  You get what you pay for as they say. This wasa waste of money for me.  When I bought it it was 34.00 now the price has gone up to 44.00.  why???</li>
    <li> Great system.  No complaints.  Works very good.  Recommend it.  Battery seems to stay charged long time.  It trims hair nicely.</li>
    <li> I love all the uses of this shaver. I use it all the time to clean my hair all the time. Great buy</li>
    <li> great,fast item does the job like a barber shop,EZ tothato,slim/nice color,norelco is great the best get it go,go,go,go,go,go,,,,gothis  is the best product that anybody can buy online</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a older Norelco beard trimmer for years, and was very pleased with it.  I was afraid that because of its age, it might fail on me at a bad time, so when I saw this one which looked very similar, I bought it.  Turns out it is identical except for color (the old one is light gray) and the parts will interchange.  So now I have a brand new one just like the one I&#x27;ve used and liked for years, plus a bunch of interchangeable spare parts and an spare charger.    My only complaint with the new one is the color.  After one use, I see why they made their earlier model light gray.  The new black one attracts beard trimmings and looks awful after just a short use, especially if your beard is gray.  Never even noticed it on the gray one.  The new black one is much better looking than the old one, but only for a few moments until you use it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very many uses. So many products in one and comes in handy for easy grooming and keeping yourself clean cut. I especially like it for removing facial hair.</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect for multiple purposes. But the recharger use old technologies and it can be used only in 110 volts power systems. So don&#x27;t hope you can use it while traveling to Europe.  First you should find another one 110-220 AC to 1.6v DC.</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product for the first few weeks - it was cheap and small and light and did an adequate job. However, when I left it unplugged for about a week or so, it completely lost its charge and won&#x27;t recharge. Note that the instructions explicitly say to NOT leave it plugged in all the time, so that&#x27;s why it was unplugged. I&#x27;m not having much luck getting a refund fom Norelco, so it seems like I&#x27;m out of luck. Feeling lucky?</li>
    <li> the one I have has worked without any issues for over 3 years now... Bought the same model just incase the first one finally kicks the bucket...</li>
    <li> I lost the charger for this over three years ago. It *just* ran out of battery life. It became a running household joke that this thing would last forever. Can&#x27;t explain how this was possible, but twice a month, for nearly four years, this thing turned on without any charging whatsoever. Really sad that I can&#x27;t readily find a replacement charger :(</li>
    <li> As other reviews have pointed out, this is not professional-grade equipment by any stretch and not something likely to last you a lifetime. However, it is a very good little trimmer, especially given the relatively low cost. It comes with a good assortment of attachments, and it&#x27;s been doing a great job of keeping my beard trimmed. I do not use it to trim other body hair, and would not suggest it as a tool for maintaining large areas or large amounts of hair. I like the stand that it comes with since it neatly contains the trimmer and attachments in one handy unit.</li>
    <li> Not for cutting hair. I made the mistake of buying this to save money at the barber.I have very short buzz cut hair. This is for beard , nose, and ear trimming ...... But for that it is awesome !</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but good as a travel kit. The cutter width is small and dont expect it to give you a shave.</li>
    <li> Works much better than my last trimmer. Battery life os great and quality apears to be good. At this price you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product 2-3x, here&#x27;s why. The plastic attachments (particularly for cutting hair) are SO LOW QUALITY that they break just shaving your head. Again, this is my 3rd one. I&#x27;m not buying them anymore, and am instead investing into a quality hair cutter (not made of garbage plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will break, and then you&#x27;ll be forced to buy an entire new kit to replace the pieces. Spend the extra 50-100 and buy a quality one that will last 5-10 years.</li>
    <li> Use it twice a week, great quality. Really good battery life, very diverse selection of buzzer heads. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister because she wanted to shave her head and it works very well. She loved it and for the price it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace a beard trimmer I had after the old one Quit. This unit does a great job and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it still works great. I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, it&#x27;s to bad they decided to change it. so i bought this which was one of the few left.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the purchase, good quality, works well and I recommend you buy you will not regret it at all.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. It&#x27;s my second one (lost the power cord to the first one). The attachments (two guards, two beard clippers, nose hair, and shaving attachment) are all useful. The only one I don&#x27;t really use is the shaving attachment. Holds a charge pretty well and is easy to change attachments.</li>
    <li> Does NOT come with stand shown in picture so I am very very disappointed. If you don&#x27;t need the stand then it&#x27;s OK except that the main head flies off when you change hight settings. so be careful.</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco Multigroom Grooming kit I have tried and the second to fail. The first one the attachments broke and the cost of replacements made buying a new one a better option. But the G370 I got in Aug 2011 has now failed due to not being rechargeable any longer. Since it has a 2 yr warranty I may see about using the warranty. But if there is a service or shipping charge then I&#x27;ll pass. I won&#x27;t buy a Norelco replacement.</li>
    <li> The price of this is cheaper than any store you can find, I have been using these for a long time, I replace them every 2 years, the blades on the main trimmer are not the same after 2 years of wear and tear. Battery life also degrades, with this price anybody can replace these every two years.</li>
    <li> First off I only bought this because it was the only one they had at the pharmacy and it was cheap- 15 bucks or so and the quality reflects it. Even though it looks cheap, it did give me a pretty decent trim and a pretty good close shave every time. The trimmer has a couple of levels of adjustment for desired length. The attachments feel pretty flimsy and if your not gentle could break it. I actually had the machine die on me for some reason and decided to get another one- which is why i can only give it 4 stars... For 15 bucks this is a pretty decent trimmer/shaver. I&#x27;m not sure why people are hating on this thing, i&#x27;m not sure if you can find a better device in this price range. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Crappy blades. save up an extra 10 or 20 dollars and invest in something useful. this is the type of product that&#x27;s used often so don&#x27;t invest in the one unless you don&#x27;t ever use the attachments.</li>
    <li> The cutting accessories are very versatile. Blades are sharp and don&#x27;t seem to snag hairs. It charges fast, and maintains a charge for a while. No real complaints on it. Great for the money.</li>
    <li> Works well, but charging takes a long time. After a few months, the plastic clip for hair got loose. This causes hair to be cut unevenly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and have to say that I am extremely happy with it.  You get so many different tools in one product, the nose/ear trimmer is great.  You can use it for body grooming/ facial hair trimming or hair cuts.  I have had this for several months and I haven&#x27;t had to charge the battery as one charge will go a long way.</li>
    <li> Razor works as advertised, but is made of some of the cheapest materials I have ever seen in a razor. Some of the attachments came apart in my hands and I had to reassemble them.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a second razor, then this might do the trick, but be warned regarding the substandard build quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer for the price, but very delicate and doesn&#x27;t do as clean a job on the head as you see from more pro grooming systems. And it fall from you hand chances are something will snap and it&#x27;s dead, like the first one I purchased. But for a $15 trimmer I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very descent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday present. He enjoys using all of the different features of this shaver and enjoys it&#x27;s ability to give a clean cut with no problem. He did have some difficulty at first figuring out what length was best for his beard. Overall he enjoys this product,</li>
    <li> excellent experience!&lt;br /&gt;battery life is amazing with no loss of capacity after more than two years.</li>
    <li> First of all, the price listed on this item is around $37, which is way more than what I paid. I think it was close to $20 when I bought it. Price aside, I have owned the product for a few years now, so I figure I can write the pros and cons of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I like the carrying case and the number of attachments it comes with&lt;br /&gt;+ It seems to hold a decent charge. I have never run out of power mid trim (even after moderate use for about 2 years)&lt;br /&gt;+ It comes with a nice plastic base to store the unit and all the attachments when not in use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The nose hair trimmer isn&#x27;t the best. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharp enough to do a great job&lt;br /&gt;- The beard trimmer attachment only has 9 settings. While that seems great, it really isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have a beard, I have the shorter \\&quot;sexy stubble\\&quot;. The #2 setting seems to be too long, but when I switch to setting #1 it looks way too short. Yes I am picky, but I want a setting in between. The ONLY reason I am shopping for a new grooming system now is because of this point.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light on the unit, so you should get into the routine of charging it after every 3-4 uses so it doesn&#x27;t die.</li>
    <li> Clipper charged up appropriately, all accessories were in the package, timely delivery.  Having to replace the combs each time you use it for a different purpose is a small pain but it is very versatile.  Seems to hold a charge well and does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Performs as it should.Has all the attachments you would need. Stays charged for a long time. Needs faster charger and indicator lights showing its fully charged.</li>
    <li> It is one of the most handy grooming system i have. generally use to trim side hairs and trim beard. a perfect use for it. and still using it for 2 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these groomers in the last 6 years, you really can&#x27;t find a better groomer for the price.  It&#x27;s made from cheapo plastic but it is reliable and cuts well.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my other electric plug in clippers but for body hair trimming and a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look it does its job well.  It comes with useful attachments for nose trimming and beard shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the adjustable length trimming attachment is very cheaply made and will break after heavy use.  I have yet to find a place online that sells a replacement piece which is what led me to buy an all new trimmer, just for that one piece.</li>
    <li> I got this much cheaper than my brother got practically the same thing. His came with a little base station that sat on the counter and you put all the things away in there. This one came with a bag. The opening of the bag frayed a lot, however it still holds everything securely inside.</li>
    <li> Very useful and versatile product.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a lot of accessories for shaving and trimming.&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair add on is really great too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the foil razor attachment as described.  Bought this for my husband and he gave me specific attachments that he needed the shaver to have. He was a little disappointed as one could imagine,  as he uses this attachment piece every day. So I guess he will have to use his old one again. Lame.</li>
    <li> The included attachments make this trimmer very versatile. It also allows a lot of use between charges. The one negative about the product is that is tends to hold the cut hair in the lubricating grease and is therefore somewhat hard to keep clean. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very please with this product and would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I liked a lot this trimmer, it&#x27;s fantastic! I bought 3 of it, 1 for my brother, 1 for my father and 1 for me. You up to 9 degrees (heights) of use, the battery life is good and it can perform multiple tasks!  I recommend it...</li>
    <li> I like it very much i think it worthes more than what I&#x27;ve paid for.  All the heads are usefull and usable. I buy it again.  It is a little small that is not good. You cannot plug it in and use it too. And you cannot use it under shower. It is not water resistant these are the cons.</li>
    <li> As a college student, I was looking for something effective and cheap.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much given the price I paid, but I have been wonderfully pleased with this product.  The inclusion of a carrying bag, comb and cleaning brush seemed rather gimmicky, but they have all come in amazingly useful.  I have had this for over a month now and use it to shave 2 or 3 times a week, and I still haven&#x27;t needed to charge the unit since I charged it initially.  If anything, the nose/ear hair attachment doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as a stand-alone unit, but even with that considered this is a great buy.  I highly recommend it to anyone considering it.</li>
    <li> This device has worked excellently for me thus far. It has numerous attachments to trim every type of hair on your body to whatever length you may wish it to be. The charge holds for a substantial amount of time, I have probably used it for 4 periods of about 7 minutes each after my first charge and it is still working fine. After using this device, my body is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. The attachments are easy to clean, simply run water over them and allow them to dry. I would definitely reccommend this kit to anyone looking at looking good!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m still shocked this trimmer is less than $20.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job perfectly and plenty of options. Look no further. This is your best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> No, I do not want to do this part. This will be the last time I turn in a review.</li>
    <li> I was trying to buy a trimmer locally but couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted or an accessory was missing. So I bought this for $13. I am telling you this is an amazing little trimmer and the quality is awesome. It works great and I love all the accessories. I loved it so much that I bought 2 more for gifts. A must have and the price is unbelievable. Buy it and love it.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one i have purchased. It is easy to use and works great for about a year.</li>
    <li> I purchased the trimmer to replace an ailing Remington, the battery was no longer holding a charge and I had it for over 12 years.  When I received the Norelco I was shocking how flimsy the adjust was, in fact if you pushed hard enough against your face the adjustment would move.  This was a deal breaker for me, all I wanted it for was for keeping my beard neat and trim.  This was a poor design and Remington obviously wins over on this design because i always felt safe while shaving that once I made a selection for length I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it.  I&#x27;ve returned this product and purchased another Remington, the adjustment for length is still the same as it was on my old trimmer, a great design why change it.  Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want the trimmer length to fail in the middle of a trim giving you a much closer trim than you intended.</li>
    <li> Really nice shaver. Holds a charge for a LONG time and the guard is nice and adjustable. I only wish it came with a stand or something so minus one star for that.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this trimmer. The battery life has been amazing so far. I believe I would buy another one of these when the need arises. Fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> so much better than anything I ever used in the past. Absolutely love it!! when you need the new razor systems you should definitely buy this one!</li>
    <li> I have had a shaved head for years, and also seem to sport the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow look on my face.  I&#x27;ve always used barbers trimmers with a cord on my head and face, which I&#x27;m sure you could understand was kind of a pain due to the weight and size of the trimmers.  I can&#x27;t believe its taken me this long to find such a product.  The Phillips groomer is an excellent product.  I initially purchased this for my beard, but was happy to find out that it even works on my head.  I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d have enough power to cut through the thicker hair on my head, but does so with ease.  Very light and very maneuverable.  It comes with all sorts of attachments which gives plenty of options.  I even purchased a second one for my dad for fathers day.  I&#x27;ve only owned the trimmer for about 3 months, but was comfortable with purchasing it as a gift with confidence. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the storage.  It comes with a bag that everything just gets tossed in.  The bags opening is somewhat small so its tough to get my hand inside it and find what I&#x27;m looking for.  I usually just dump it all out.  A small stand that would hold the trimmer and attachments would be great.  All in all, its been life changing for me!  A huge improvement over my corded, heavy and out dated wahls.</li>
    <li> I use this to finish up after cutting my hair with full size clippers. For awhile I used them about once or twice a week to trim my beard when I got too lazy to shave for a few months. They never pulled and work really well, great for the price.</li>
    <li> I have a trimmer and a razor. This is the best brand in the price range. it is smoother and sharper out of the package than anyother in the price, and i tried this brand because it had the nose trimmer in it as well, and it works great also. what i really love is the beard trimmer, it is adjustable with the click of a finger. so easy!!!! if it goes dull soon then i wont buy again, other wise ill buy another in about 3 years.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for the price! Does what i need it to do. I really like how you can use this trimmer while its plugged into an outlet, which is key for me. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this set in December, 2006 for the foil trimmer attachment to replace my Norelco Definer.  I loved my Definer, but it is apparently out of production... a real shame!  The foil trimmer is nearly as good as the Definer.  The \\&quot;clipper\\&quot; trimmer is much larger than the Definer and not nearly as accurate for trimming the bottom of my mustache, but very adequate.  The nose trimmer works very well.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the different attachments for trimming my beard length yet (beard is too new), but based on my experience with the rest of the trimmer I am guessing it will work well.  One real plus is that I only got three or four months use out of the Definer foil.  I have used this trimmer every day for nearly seven months and am on the original foil.  My guess is that when this foil wears out I&#x27;ll have to buy a new trimmer, as a new foil will probably cost almost as much... if one is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned above, the Norelco Definer is the best small trimmer I have ever used.  I would love to buy about a dozen to last me the rest of my life.  Short of that, this trimmer works well and is much less expensive than the Definer.  The quality is \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; although not to the level of the Definer, but the trimmer does everything it&#x27;s suppose to do at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this set, and the accessory pieces broke within weeks.  I returned the broken set, and got a new set in exchange, and the second set did exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy something with better quality, and avoid dealing with the hassles of this inferior set.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had two of these. both had the same problems: the battery has a very limited lifespan (about 1 yr).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other the low quality/short life battery: the fact that it cannot be used while charging is the most significant flaw of this razor, especially as the battery looses its capacity to hold a charge (which means you might not be able to make i through a full hair cut). OK for the price but if you use yours a lot, you might look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This one was good. I mean with the expectations that I gathered based on reviews, It does what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Although, some people said they had to charge it only once in 1 year. Not sure if they are using or if they have been given some \\&quot;Rajnikanth\\&quot; battery.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer and what a bargain! Comes with several attachments that will give you just the trim you need. Philips Norelco products are the way to go for all your trimming needs. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Shipped faster than expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same model for last 5 years. I buy a new one every year. 20$ for a year is good for me. Does the work very well..I would really recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Decent shaver. I have dropped it a few times, and the shave head came apart, but i have been able to fix it everytime.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive trimmer.  Powerful enough for head hair, though I&#x27;ve yet to try that.  It works fine as a beard trimmer.  Not perfectly, but for the price I&#x27;m not complaining.  The size changes on the beard trimmer seem to jump too much.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer - small, really easy to use, a number of interchangeable heads and the power it delivers makes it great for use - whether as travel-gear or as your everyday trimmer. Comes with a nifty little string bag that looks good and carries everything. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great deal, cos the same thing was marked $22 at Walgreens and $19 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all in one kit to handle everything that my face could throw at it and wow is this it!&lt;br /&gt;From the very nice attachments to handle my short beard and mustache to my nose hair to sideburns... this little unit does it all!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> This works. Really well. In fact if you don&#x27;t read directions properly and put on the wrong attachment, it can and will shave your eyebrows off. :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, it&#x27;s a good trimmer that hold battery for a quite a while to stay trimmed depending on actual usage. I&#x27;d buy it again if this one died sometime longer than a year or so.</li>
    <li> Bought this product about 6 months ago and it still works great. Mainly interested in the nose trimmer part of it as I recently got a desk job. It cuts, doesn&#x27;t pull, gets warm but not warm enough to irritate. Would highly recommend as a trimmer for all of it&#x27;s uses.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible product, very cheaply made. Within a month of purchasing, I was using the shaving attachment to touch up before a job interview, and part of the metal guard bent up and cut me...before my job interview. Needless to say, when a product does the very thing (cutting my face before an interview) that I was trying to avoid by using it in the first place, I consider it a pretty atrocious product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, buy a different model.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product. Works as claimed. With variety of options/attachments its a one stop device for everything. It has a good battery life as well. As mentioned its \\&quot;THE\\&quot; All-in-1 grooming system which is fairly priced. I am highly satisfied by this product and will recommend anyone for this product.</li>
    <li> Its actually great for shaving i used it all the time and it gets the Job Done perfect i like it.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I bought an of brand trimmer. Man was I sorry - If you want to do the job right you need to use the best trimmer going. I am on my third one now.</li>
    <li> I purchased the same trimmer in July of 1998 for over $20 and the battery slowed down some and I purchased another one again from Amazon for less money after 13 years. It is rechargeable and has the same design with the same grooming tools as the one I purchased 13 years ago. Amazing product for the money, it trims and trims, without any problem. The old model was shiny finish the new  model is matte finish. Bravo</li>
    <li> As someone else stated, the attachments are rather flimsy and some of them barely work but I really only needed one which is okay.  It takes some getting used to on how to shave especially in delicate areas.  Don&#x27;t use it for close shaves.</li>
    <li> great multi-purpose trimmer for the value.  Keep it cleaned and charged, light oil on the blade mechanism and it will function for a long time.  I have had mine for about 6 years.  Bought a second as a gift for my son.</li>
    <li> Very nice set , my second one I have had the first one for twenty years, just like this one only this is better</li>
    <li> Great quality. Only thing I hope is that the blades last. It claims to be self sharpening. Highly recommend for anyone trying to trim nose hair, eye brows, sideburns, etc. The dry facial hair attachment doesn&#x27;t work that great for stubble.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life for this is amazing&lt;br /&gt;trims stuff good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;nose hair ripper/trimmer sucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well, but I had to throw away the nose hair trimmer because it made me cry...literally....dadgum thing tore out more hairs than it cut. I don&#x27;t really care about that though, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth taking a star away.</li>
    <li> After owning this shaver for more than 2 years I have to say that I&#x27;ve been quite impressed. The blades haven&#x27;t degraded and battery life remains strong. For the price, this is great little unit.</li>
    <li> Well, the only thing is that if you have a very strong hair it won&#x27;t work very well on you...</li>
    <li> Good price.  Have used the product for months now.  Holds a charge for a long time.  Does a solid job.</li>
    <li> Cuando la compre lo hice especialmente para rebajar el bello de la cara, pero no me hubiese disgustado para nada el que tambi&amp;eacute;n sirviera para darme una afeitada completa.&lt;br /&gt;Aunque tiene un accesorio para afeitar no es el ideal cuando lo quieres hacer con toda la cara.&lt;br /&gt;Corta muy r&amp;aacute;pidamente y limpio. Tiene varios accesorios y estos a la vez pueden graduarse lo que hace el trabajo mas a lo que se busca.&lt;br /&gt;Sirve para el cabello si no lo tienes en abundancia.</li>
    <li> Not going to get into a lot of detail but I love this trimmer/cutting system. Its compact, has re-chargeable batteries and has just about every trimmer head and guard I need. Great for staying sharp in-between cuts. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased approx 6 months ago.  I use to shave beard and head.  The unit works well and isn&#x27;t loud.    My only (major) gripe is the adjustable head is very difficult to adjust without taking the whole head piece off.     Other than that a great value.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on thursday night, and paid extra for one day shipping. It is noon, 4 days later, and i still haven&#x27;t received my shipment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always meant to pick up a clipper.  My first purchase was a cheap Wahl  that - while effective - was loud, was a bit awkward to manage with the  power cord, and failed after a few uses.    When shopping for a replacement, I opted for the more familiar Norelco name  and the G370.  It&#x27;s small, quiet, and works just great.   It&#x27;s a bit  smaller than expected and requires several passes for an even trim.  It&#x27;s designed to run purely off the rechargeable battery, so plan on  letting it charge for 10 hours before initial use or after the battery  runs out.  It runs for about 30-40 minutes before requiring recharging.     I can&#x27;t say the instruction booklet was very clear, and it takes a bit  of poking around to figure out how things interlock with the accessories;  however, it&#x27;s not rocket science and it is designed rather cleverly.    Whether you&#x27;re saving money on haircuts or pretending you have cancer,   this is certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have a similar beard trimmer to this that I picked up at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond for $45. I loved the trimmer so much I picked this one up for my vacation house. It was only 23.45 and the only difference from the more expensive one is it doesn&#x27;t have the stand to keep it on the counter. Its not a big deal because its only in a house I use about 40-50 nights a year, max. I don&#x27;t know if the $20 is worth the stand, but I guess thats up to you to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims my beard perfectly and really doesn&#x27;t make a big mess. My wife has even used this to cut my hair before too, and no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Handle the trimmer height adjustments with care--I recommend really making sure you&#x27;re holding in the button and being slow and careful--I went to push it in the direction it&#x27;s supposed to go without pushing the button and it straight up broke, with very little force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great trimmer and I&#x27;m considering purchasing another one just to get the adjustable trimmer head back.</li>
    <li> If you keep trimmed you cant beat this. Several different heads that cover all the needs of a trimmer. I tried a really expensive Braun and was unhappy with the length adjustment and width of the cut. This one is narrow enough to fine trim facial hair but wide enough to trim your beard or moustache in a few strokes. Easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time. Another thing is that the heads can be replaced without replacing the whole thing</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 years ago, still going strong!</li>
    <li> This thing bites sometimes. Hurts. I still love it though.</li>
    <li> For $15 what do you expect? It works, tends to pull hair, but after 5+yrs of use, it still works. I upgraded to a $60 Wahl and man, it&#x27;s a world of difference!</li>
    <li> This shaver does exactly what is is intended to do. Let me trim and do upkeep on my facial hair. The charge lasts me a good long while (a few weeks on a single charge with use every other day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the lack of a battery meter. I have had a few times where I would try to shave before work and not finish because I ran out of juice. The shaver also doesn&#x27;t run while plugged in so I have left my house with half of my face more trimmed than the other. But the battery life is long so this doesn&#x27;t happen often at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I was able to find this again. Still my favorite set of clippers for lining up my beard.</li>
    <li> First off, the battery runs forever between charges. Very nice. Several attachments makes this a very versatile tool. Lightweight. Handle feels good in the hand. Sharp blades. Running more than a year now and still happy.</li>
    <li> THIS GROOMING SYSTEM DOES THE JOB, ITS NOT LIKE THE EXPENSIVE ONES YOU PAY ALOT FOR TO GET THE JOB WELL DONE, BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE FOR THE PRICE AND IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT UNLESS you sue the lower trimmer in the wrong place...</li>
    <li> This item works well, though I admit I have not used all the attachments. I really just use it to trim/shave my beard and it does and excellent job at that.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted same as my old Grooming System just a different color.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly exactly what we expected...</li>
    <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve had them almost a year and they still work like new. Stay charged for a good length of time as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this at K-Mart approx 6 months ago and it&#x27;s already to throw in the trash. First when I was trimming I bumped it very lightly and all the plastic pieces on the end fell apart and broke. I finally got all the pieces snapped back together but they keep coming apart. You have to charge it for a full day or over night just to get approx. 20 minutes of trimming time and then it slows down near the end of the 20 minutes. Everything is snapped together by these small plastic clips that always come aprt when your using it. The bottom line is it&#x27;s a nightmare to use. I just bought a remington and will see if its any better. I paid $50.00 for this at K-Martnd its not worth $10.00. Norelco does not cover it if you drop it and it breaks so I&#x27;m aout of luck. Even if it was&#x27;nt broke it still is a piece of junk. Please look for another brand or a different trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it and says it works well.  He only wishes it would have come with a stand to put it on.  I didn&#x27;t think to check for that when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Clips are very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Best grooming set for the price. The Con Aire ?? is no comparision in ease of use et. al. The insurance company replaced my Phillips Nerelco with a Con Aire (best guess as to Mfg) which was a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> beneficial and super handy..battery operates for long once charged..love this product and will recommend to others. Good buy in less price</li>
    <li> Very durable and sturdy. I use this to trim my beard before a shave and it works great. Trims well without any tug or pull.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have grown a beard.  I asked the young lady who cuts my hair what to use to trim my beard.  She recommended a trimmer that had a length limiting attachment and try a couple of different settings unitl I found one I liked.  This one has 9 different settings and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it too much. Once a month to cut off my beard and shave.  I&#x27;m still running on the same battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the attachments.  It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave like a razor, but I didn&#x27;t buy it to shave, I bought it to cut the thick beard which would clog a razor.  I like it because it is very light, and usable.  Be a bit careful when you do your lip.  In all I can&#x27;t find any dislikes.  I think its a bargain and to last, sadly the battery is not replaceable, hence I reduced it by 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s were the pudding lies with most electric shavers, the longevity of the number of times a battery can be recharged before having to replace the unit.  That only time can tell.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works pretty well right up until it breaks. Well, it&#x27;s the attachments that break actually, I replaced it with a different model and have demoted this one to nose only.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer from a trusted brand - Philips Norelco. The overall quality is very durable and the blades on top are sharp. It cuts hair effectively and has a long batter life. It provides good power when in use. Great product for a great price!! Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I had this product for quite a long time now and still working as brand new. The adjustable trimmer size and nose adapter are great features.</li>
    <li> Works well this is my 3rd set in 5 years since I used them daily. They work perfect up until the charger stops charging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about a decade.  While it still works and gets the trimming done, the charging system is flawed.  It takes forever to charge, looses power quickly, and if you do lose charge in the middle of trimming, you can&#x27;t continue on AC power.  Instead you will just have to walk around for a few hours with one side of your face longer than the other while it recharges.  I kid you not.  I have had this happen before.  Such a supreme oversight like this has me baffled.</li>
    <li> This is my second. My wife dropped my first after several years of great service. This one was shipped promptly and for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver it is quiet, smooth and a perfect size.  I have always loved Norelco products.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> ...and boy have I gone through groomers at this price range.  The biggest issue is always lack of solid construction.  This one is decent, and does the job. I use it for small hair areas.  Putting more $ than this into a groomer is a waste of money as long as its solidly built.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, perfect speed, easy to use, great price.  Does everything I need it to do, hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for the price. The lithium ion battery is better than having AA batteries all the time. A++ product!</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly, and it was packaged very carefully--I was pleased with the time they took and the condition of the product. So far it works great and my fiance it thrilled! He definitely recommends it. We loved the fact that it came super sharp and already charged up and ready to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the same unit that was about 7 or 8 years old.  I use it mainly to clean up my side burns and as a nose hair trimmer.  It still does a great job cleaning up my side burns, but the nose hair trimmer is awful.  It is painful and feels like it is ripping the hairs right out instead of cutting them.  I wish I had the old one still as it did a great job trimming the hair with no pain what so ever.  Oh well, lesson learned.  I never would have guessed the quality dropped off that much.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco G370/60 grooming system after going up and down the price points and reviews here at Amazon and in some local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never having had a hair clipper/beard trimmer before, I had no idea where to start, or which is \\&quot;the one\\&quot;, so decided to try this little guy then go from here if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main objective is to keep a short beard even and clean-looking; secondarily to keep the ear and nose hairs in check and maybe even start learning how to do some hair touch-ups between barbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are printed on one of those huge newspaper-type sheets and depend hevily on cross-referenced diagrams. After awhile I gave up on that and went by the descriptions on the clamshell container it shipped in. Not going to take any stars for the instructions but they&#x27;re pretty pitiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basics you need to know are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Charge it for 10 hours before using.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use the battery all the way up before recharing to get longest life&lt;br /&gt;3. The silver squarish button on top in front of the power slider is your head-release button. Hold that in and the blade guard and attachments (such as the nose hair trimmer) come off.&lt;br /&gt;4. The beard trimmer and the hair trimmer have a button underneath that allow you to position the trimmer guard closer or further away from the blades. That setting is marked underneath 1 to 9 on the razor and are visible through a little cutout. Also that same guard button is used to take the guards the rest of the way off the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really about it. I found that if you use the nose-hair trimmer mostly in an in-out motion instead of side-to-side, you will eliminate the pulling some people have mentioned in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: The reviewers that have mentioned that the body of the trimmer is slick and easy to drop are correct. I took two, 2-inch x 1/2\\&quot; pieces of self-adhesive stair tread tape (like you see on skateboards- from any large Home Supply Store), and attached a strip to each side of the trimmer body just behind the finger cut-outs. Now there&#x27;s a good solid grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money this little trimmer is really a great value, I actually look forward to using it- it makes a neat job and does not create \\&quot;rows\\&quot; from the trim guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the closest shave in bare areas, I follow up with my 3-bladed regular \\&quot;wet\\&quot; razor. Really, you couldn&#x27;t tell that this was not done in a professional shop. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE December 15, 2012: Still using this on the original battery charge from December 1st and getting good use out of it. How can you beat this for under fourteen bucks shipped with Amazon Prime? :-) I wish someone would have given one to me for Christmas last year!</li>
    <li> It willl stay charged a long time. Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in.  Charge it and forget it until it needs another charge.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sick of being a grizzly adams then buy this thing. It&#x27;s not going to give you a clean shave by any means, but it&#x27;s great for quick trims to make you look presentable.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny. It trims to perfection without any plucking sensation. Also it gives various other accessories which are very useful! Would certainly recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Battery works for upto 6 haircuts&lt;br /&gt;- Very light&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable cutting head - No need to change cutting heads / spacers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- A bit loud&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning it is a bit difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy a good scissors and tapered comb to complement this set</li>
    <li> I use it all the time to shape the side burns and all. Works great all the different it has work good.</li>
    <li> This gets five stars because of its price.  I use it as a beard trimmer.  A nice bonus is the nose hair trimmer.  The blade is sharp, the attachments fit on easily, they are easy to use, and the charger works well.  I would say the plastic attachments don&#x27;t make me confident they will work five years from now, but for the price this is too good to pass up.</li>
    <li> Attempted to cut my nuts several time and it cuts me every time even when I am being careful. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 5 years now.  Use it once a week for trimming my beard.  It&#x27;s held up great as long as you blow out the hair and keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to empty the attachments during the trim as it does collect hair and you don&#x27;t want to burn out the motor, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> If asked, \\&quot;Would you buy this product again if you had it to do all over?\\&quot; My answer would be \\&quot;In a heartbeat!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with I read the instructions. I charged the battery for 10 hours before using and it has run flawlessly for a month without a recharge. You can&#x27;t just leave this plugged in all the time. Basically, run the battery down and recharge for 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is light and feels good in my hand. The attachments snap in and out easily and they are washable. The blades are sharp and do not require oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used Wahl trimmers. In fact, I bought one again but when I got it home it didn&#x27;t work right so I decided to give this one a try. Frankly, there is no comparison. This Norelco is really that much better than any of the Wahl&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adendum: It&#x27;s been 34 months and still running great. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I had a problem with the beard trimmer guards losing teeth after only a few uses. I think this product is very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Well, I would not normally order a cordless trimmer (nothing quite like shaving your head, battery dying halfway though, LOL)  But a friend suggested it, so I went along.  I have pretty thick hair, and my beard was pretty heavy when I received this, but it arrived in perfect shape and fully charged, and I went ahead and used it right away.  I used the attachment with the flexible guard to shorten up the hair on my head, then proceed to go shorter to just stubble on my head, then trimmed and shaved my beard with the shaver attachment.  All on one charge.  Took about a half hour, so I was pretty shocked.  I find I actually like it not having a wire to get in the way, or make me have to stay a certain distance from the receptacle.  Head attachment swaps are easy as pie, and so is cleanup with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Wireless; ease of use; easy of head change, powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I have a gut feeling the NiCd (or NiMh, not sure) batteries will wear out over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully by the time the NiCd/NiMh batteries where out, I&#x27;ll have saved money on barbershop head-shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTWE, please pardon my spelling/grammer, it&#x27;s early morning for me and I haven&#x27;t had my coffee yet. :P</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product. On the minus side is the absence of uni volt adaptor for charging the rechargeable battery. Would appreciate assistance for buying 220 V adaptor for use in India</li>
    <li> This grooming kit works great for a quick and good trim up, it doesn&#x27;t exactly work as good as a razor but if you take your time, it gets the job done. I also like how it provides a nose and ear trimmer, as well as adapters for trimming up your hair. I use it more for my face rather than my hair so I am not sure how it is with thick hair. Overall its a good product and would come in handy on a trip or for an on-the-go trim up.</li>
    <li> Great product and price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The grooming kit comes with multiple finish add-ons and while it&#x27;s probably not the most premium product in the market, it should fit the bill for most people.  It&#x27;s a very good, reliable product for the price and should last for a while.</li>
    <li> Works great. Had to purchase it a second time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and this is the 2nd trimmer I have EVER owned. It just died after a unfortunate drop( I had also dropped it a ton in the past). This held up to the test of time. I got this about 12 years ago and way outlasted my first trimmer. I am pricing and seriously debating about spending the money. It does lose a bit of battery power over the years. Mine I had lost its charge every 48 hours. However it held the charge for a week for what seemed like forever.</li>
    <li> Overly loud unless you hold everything together while it runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it once and a thin piece of plastic broke on a head so now it is no longer adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button is difficult to switch on and off when hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cheap. But it does work. I&#x27;m looking for a new one. I&#x27;ll spend more than 20 dollars this time.</li>
    <li> it continues to serve me well for trimming my beard. i keep a stubble, so this is the only device need to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;- good value (i purchased or 15.00 USD on Amazon - any more and you&#x27;re paying too much)&lt;br /&gt;- versatile&lt;br /&gt;- holds charge well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- power button is poorly designed for traveling. sometimes it gets turned on and starts buzzing in the travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;- hair falls into device. i just stopped caring about it since i only use one attachment.&lt;br /&gt;- the beard attachment breaks super easy. i bought a second one just to get another beard attachment.</li>
    <li> Bad Smell!&lt;br /&gt;And also cheaply made so it is easily broken!&lt;br /&gt;Look to use it only for 3 months&lt;br /&gt;Really bad!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my money well spent. I use it almost every other day. Works great every time. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Best product for best price. Been using it for more than 2 years now, and its still perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great in a skilled hand. Powerfully cuts through an amazing amount of hair. Keeps its charge far longer than I expected and has quite an assortment of add-ons. I use it on my Lhasa-Poo much more successfully than on myself though. I gave myself the worst haircut ever, but that was totally my bad. Should have followed it with a buzz.</li>
    <li> Worth the money, doesn&#x27;t cost much and does what it is supposed to do.  Why buy one for the twice the price unless you have so much hair it is like shaving a bear.  Turn it on clean up the sideburns and turn it off.  Don&#x27;t need anything fancy to do that.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these units.  The battery tends to lose charge over time with weekly use.  I am looking to purchase another one, but I am blown away that they are going for $50.  I paid $15 for the first two...  I will be looking for a replacement now I suppose.</li>
    <li> Spend the money and get a nicer trimmer. Settings on this one sucks.</li>
    <li> I still have these Philips clippers.  The battery has a good life, they clippers are strong and the accessories are everything a person could want.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. The price was very reasonable and it works like a charm. There are a lot of attachments that came with it too.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL, GREAT BATTERY LIFE, ONE CHARGE HAS LASTED FOR THREE MONTHS AND I USE IT TWICE A DAY. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> This shaver works wonders. It&#x27;s easy to use and charges quickly. I&#x27;ve had it for a year now. I actually use this on my lady part and arm pits. It beats the pain of waxing or helps in betwen waxes. LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> Good basic trimmer with enough attachments to suit the average person. Stays charged very well, I&#x27;ve gone months on a single charge. I do, however, only use it about 4 times per month but most trimmers lose their juice after a few weeks whether being used or left idle. Cleaning can be chore if you don&#x27;t do it after each trim, so maintenance is key. Does what it claims, seems to be long-lasting and durable. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby at his request.  He&#x27;s got a goatee and mustache that he keeps much better groomed using this product.  His skin is much smoother than using a razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a newer version of a Norelco trimmer I had a few years back that I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was NOT.&lt;br /&gt;Shoddy construction.&lt;br /&gt;Precision trimming was HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;Length setting was iffy at best.</li>
    <li> I have used several beard trimmers over the years and this one really met my needs.  It hold a charge for a great deal of time.  I have had this to last up to a month.  It trims very evenly and does the job.  Thanks Phillips Norelco, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> It is a very useful product with a very wide range of how it can be used. The complete set gives u total freedom of styling your hair, beard and mustache. I am happy with its services.</li>
    <li> It may be that I got one with a bad battery but a charge doesnt last even 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is the third consecutive Norelco beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned during the past three decades - yes, I&#x27;ve liked them. This one - the G370 - is a disappointment. The new design of the interchangeable blades - big, hollow, snap-on heads - produces relentless, loud, annoying vibrational noise, unlike the quiet buzz or hum of my previous models.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to help trim my beard since I developed a skin reaction to razor blades.  The Norelco G370 Grooming System does everything I wanted it for perfectly.  The battery is long lasting, the trimmer is plenty powerful, and the changeable heads include everything I need.  Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use to keep your man looking good. It also makes a great gift for a man because it has attachment they use for grooming. I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Robyn AZ</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short, best shaver kit for under 30.00 you&#x27;ll EVER find! I&#x27;ve bought 2 so far (lost the power cable on first one), and it competes EASILY with others valued at 80-100! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this almost two years ago, and it still works great.  I have had no problem with it holding a charge, usually a charge will last me two weeks or more.  I have a beard and goatee which I trim at least every other day and also use this to trim the hair over my years.  I have regular barber clippers to cut my hair, but this works great for that fast trim.  I lost a couple of attachments so I am thinking about getting another set, even though the one I have still works great.</li>
    <li> I had one like it for 5 years before the battery died. This model is the same except for a couple of more attachments. I paid less money for this one and am very happy with the performance. For me, it cuts nice and clean with no &#x27;pulls&#x27; or &#x27;snags&#x27; and it fits the hand very nicely. It was a GREAT DEAL for the price that I paid. Could not beat it! There are more fancy ones out there but you won&#x27;t find a better value.</li>
    <li> I decided to try growing a small beard, so I bought a $10 Wahl beard trimmer. I liked how the beard was looking and decided to upgrade to something rechargeable. I downgraded my Wahl to manscape and got this because it had a lot more features.    I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 months and this is what I can say so far.    Battery - Great life. About 40 minutes of life per 10 hour charge. Not a problem if you can time your days properly. You CANNOT plug the unit in and shave if there is no energy in the battery which is a feature that would have been nice to have.    Trimmer - There are actually two trimmers. One is wider than the other and the smaller trimmer is supposed to be for fine details. The trimmer attachments only clip on to the wider trimmer! I personally use the wide trimmer with the trimmer attachment then pop off the wide trimmer with the attachment and put the thinner attachment on for detail spots (it&#x27;s quicker than taking the trimmer attachment on and off).    The blades seem to be of good quality and claim that they don&#x27;t need oil or sharpening. They are easy on the skin (unlike a previous Remington unit that cut me without attachments).    Trimmer Attachments - There is a hair clipper and a beard trimmer attachment. Again, they attach to the big trimmer only.  I enjoy how the beard trimmer has a tension which hugs your face on the various curves. You can adjust the length easily. People claim that this breaks easily; while the design could have been better, only a great force of pushing the unit to your face will cause it to break. And if it does break, a simple examination of how the attachment works, a paper clip, and super glue will fix it. Again, this product is $16, don&#x27;t expect titanium components. I haven&#x27;t used the hair clippers yet, but i&#x27;m sure the battery will last long enough for a good cut.    The Foil Shaver Attachment - It hurts me and i have to go over a spot several times because it is so small. I just use the smaller trimmer and leaveit or use my other shaver or razor.    Nose/Eyebrow Trimmer - OW! This tends to pull a lot. My $10 Wahl trimmer came with nose trimmer and it worked a lot better.    Stand/Brush - Good. Sleek looking.      You get so much for the price. Amazing. The broken trimmer attachment seems easily fixable. Only $16. I Highly Recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have used this grooming set for several months. A quick idea of my usage; on Sundays, I use it for grooming nose, ears,mustache and &#x27;soul patch&#x27;, trimming sideburns and neckline. I do not use it for &#x27;haircuts&#x27;. Using it in this manner, I find it to be ideal and it is a great value. If you are &#x27;ham-handed&#x27; you may find it &#x27;fiddly/delicate&#x27; as it certainly is not built like a 50s era Kirby vacuum cleaner. Also, I find I can use it twice easily before recharging it. The nose hair trimmer will require 30-40 seconds per nostril I think as you need to turn, and change angles a lot to be thorough. And changing attachments will occasionally require me to flip the switch on for half a second to re-align the clutch mechanism. If you feel any resistance snapping on a different head - try hitting the switch. Now, are there any negatives? Yeah, but for my usage they are minor. For some folks they could be a problem. Mine came with a travel pouch. I don&#x27;t see how the various attachments could avoid damaging themselves rattling around in a pouch together. I&#x27;d place them in individual sandwich bags or wrap them in tissue if they had to travel in such a way they might bang/press into each other. I doubt I will ever travel with any part of this set though. Also, it&#x27;s slightly annoying having to rotate the heads to align them into the stand&#x27;s receptacle/&#x27;wells&#x27;. They should have made the stand in such a way the parts could be dropped in without worrying about &#x27;polarity&#x27;.  EDIT; update, almost 6 years old and every component works like new - and there&#x27;s no detectable reduction in the battery&#x27;s performance either.</li>
    <li> Does everything you need and is very inexpensive.  The shell is made of plastic and get a little clogged when cutting hair</li>
    <li> Comes with a 100-120v input which makes it difficult to use globally - when traveling. In general the product is very good and works well for regular use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for under a year and it&#x27;s holding up decent, but one of the parts for the smaller clipper attachment broke, so I can&#x27;t adjust the size for that part now. Overall, the precision of the blades is decent, but for if you&#x27;re looking for a system with all the basic tools as a decent price, this will do.</li>
    <li> Still using it for about 4 years now. Would use 3-4 times before you charge it. Super happy with this product</li>
    <li> I have multiple of these because they do eventually wear out, but they were at a great price. Keeps my scruff in check!</li>
    <li> Great product for all your facial trimming needs. Wouldnt recommend for sensitive areas of the male anatomy though.</li>
    <li> horrible ...poor quality ... in the bin after a week</li>
    <li> I found and bought this product at K-mart, it&#x27;s a great product and I enjoy using it I definitely did not pay 60$ for it though. I paid about 25$ for the entire kit and I believe it came with everything that was shown, you&#x27;re likely better off getting it some place else. While it is a good beard trimmer I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for hair cutting as it gives some significant razor burn but otherwise this is a great product if you can get it for less money.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice trimmer if you do not need a really fine close cut.......I use this one quite a bit because the battery life is great but I also use the Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer  I also purchased when I need a FINER CUT.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were both so cheap I purchased the two of them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;either trimmer has a GREAT BATTERY and if I had known I would LOVE them both I probably only needed to buy just one(probably the Wahl is slightly better), but oh well....I use both several times a week....</li>
    <li> Great grooming system. Cheap and affordable product that is durable. I bought mine about a year and a half ago and i still use it regularly.</li>
    <li> trimmer was not the same model as pictured.  even though I will use it; I was misled.it was not as listed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to go wrong with a Norelco.  This is a nice little grooming system.  I don&#x27;t have a beard, so it&#x27;s mainly used for the ol&#x27; nose hairs and the sideburns...for which it does a great job!  Would definitely buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> great product. love it.  just what I needed.  couldn&#x27;t ask for better.  worth every penny.  best of the best. perfect.</li>
    <li> I use it for trimming my beard, ear hairs, nose hairs as well as for shaping my side locks. I love this.</li>
    <li> this is the only thing that i shave with. i have had it over a year and no problems. battery last for a long time and charges quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cheap, efficient, and does the job I need it to do: basic body hair trimming, nose hair trimming, and facial hair trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price listed right now on Amazon is a little steep. Check our Sears&#x27; website, you can get it for $24, including tax and shipping, depending on where you live.</li>
    <li> It comes with all of the grooming aids that most men will ever need and is very simple to use. It is a very solid razor accessory.</li>
    <li> A great grooming kit for a good price.</li>
    <li> bad quality dead completely after two months , not recommended , bad experience&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product and go for better</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.  Long lasting battery.  I use this for beard and goatee trim as well as head shaving.  lightweight and attachments work fine.</li>
    <li> So, this is going to sound a bit Negative-Nancy, and is loooong. But here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late May 2010, I purchased the T980. I was looking to replace my then nearly 10 year-old cheapo Norelco trimmer that had finally bit the dust. I went for the T980 because, well, I decided the beard was here to stay, so might as well invest in a \\&quot;higher quality\\&quot; trimmer. The T980 was Norelco&#x27;s initial \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; trimmer (it has a little built in vacuum that&#x27;s supposed to suck in the hair as you trim). It was a bit big, and yes the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; setting was loud, but for all intents and purposes, it worked well, and the vacuum feature was a nice touch (not perfect, but did greatly reduce the errant hairs all over the sink/tub). Less than a year and a half later, the adjustable beard trimmer attachment broke. Two of the plastic guides/teeth just snapped. I wasn&#x27;t doing anything out of the oridnary, and had never done anything to damage the unit or attachments. The teeth just snapped off mid-trim. Well, that was annoying, but I figured \\&quot;hey, no problem. I&#x27;ll just replace that one little part. Easy!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scouring the web for replacement parts with no luck, I contacted Norelco directly. They informed me that they no longer made my unit, as they had released version 2 of my model. Which didn&#x27;t have compatible parts. Furthermore, no other parts existed that would fit my trimmer. I figured surely they must have some older parts left, but was told no, no more parts for my model existed. So then I asked if I could get a refund or discounted price for the newer model. Nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Begrudgingly, I decided to just buy another entire unit, but this time, go back to the cheapo model. Enter the G370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the G370 almost exactly 1 year now with no complaints whatsoever...untie last weekend, when the exact same part broke. This time I went straight to Norelco. I knew they still made the G370. I knew they would have parts. After a 20min chat with one of their reps, he finally dug up the product code for the part I needed. Two problems though: 1) it actually wasn&#x27;t the right part - it was the hair trimmer attachment, I needed the beard trimmer; and 2) when I found the right part on my own, it cost almost $17...before tax and shipping!! While I am amazed to find that the G370 now costs over $50, I paid about $13 for it when I bought it a year ago. So there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m paying ~$30 for a small, crappy, plastic replacement part. And, once again, I was informed no discount or refund of any kind would be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short: Norelco&#x27;s trimmers are great, but their attachments and customer service/loyalty are abhorrent. I am now off to buy my 3rd trimmer in as many years just because of a stupid, flimsy plastic part. Needless to say, I will NOT be buying Norelco. Ever. Had I paid what this unit is now selling for, I&#x27;d be even more furious. Buyer beware.e finally dug up the product code for the part I needed.

    <li> Gets the job done at a reasonable price. The battery holds a really good charge so this does not have to be constantly plugged in if it is just being used for grooming.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor at the $18-20 price point I regularly see it at, but $46.95 is taking advantage of customers.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW SAHVERS I HAVE BOUGHT FOR A VEY REASONABLE PRICE THAT REALLY DID WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD. WIFE NO LONGER JUMPS ON ME ABOUT MY BEARD.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee to trim his beard. Works really well and now that he doesn&#x27;t have a beard is great for cleaning up sideburns too!</li>
    <li> This is a real piece of junk. Trimmers seem to be getting worse and worse, but this one really takes the cake. The attachments are flimsy and ill fitting. The battery life is pathetic. The clipper blades are dull and imprecise. The shaving foil is rough and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most terrible of all is the design of the guard. It has a notch cut out in the middle so that when you go around the contours of your face (like your chin) the guard is totally surpassed. This leaves you with uneven length and even bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a lot of trimmers, including some real cheap models. None were as bad as this. I purchased this because I owned a Norelco in the past that was fantastic. Boy did I make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Norelco All-in-One grooming system in the past several years.  For the price (and for the average daily/weekly/monthly user) this fits the bill hands-down.  It does pretty much all it advertises to do, and comes with all the gear needed for your grooming needs, whether you are doing the task yourself or having someone use this device to assist with your grooming requests.  I would recommend this product, and would purchase it again after the next several years of usage.</li>
    <li> Bought it for $10. Trims beard well, but cuts the skin if used without the comb...Overall, It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
    <li> Except that you cant use it while charging.. a perfect shaver.. A lot better than [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO B006GQYSGO]] ( i earlier bought this and waster dollars, causes rashes and irritation on your face )</li>
    <li> Great shaver! Especially for $15. Lots of great attachments. Get a nice, close trim. The battery does start to not hold a charge as long, but takes a couple years before it happens. The only thing it needs a battery indicator, but what can you expect for the price?</li>
    <li> still going strong after 4 years. works great, but thats for $13 (not the 200 its at now!)</li>
    <li> I really like this.  Lots of attachments and the attachments work very well.  I was surprised how well the nose hair trimmer worked.</li>
    <li> It works as expected. Arrived promptly and in good condition. It seems to need a lot of maintenance and reading the instructions was a pain as there were too many. It&#x27;s good for creating a stubble look, but did not work as effectively for creating well defined beard styles... probably because I\\&quot;m still new to using electric shavers.</li>
    <li> This grooming system is a really good experience, all the accesories are well designed thinkin of men needs. Its a shame that the system has not came with its cradle.</li>
    <li> This thing is a pube shaving monster. Nothing gets the job done faster. Powering this beast must be a pubic hair reactor because I cant remember when I last charged it since feb 2013. Get this and it&#x27;ll make your crotch look like Paul Mitchell himself groomed your junk.</li>
    <li> At first this electric hair trimmer seemed like a good thing. It&#x27;s from Norelco, so I thought it was made by a reputable company. It&#x27;s Compact size and included accesories for around $24 seemed agreeable to me. But the accessories are made of thin plastic parts. So you have to exercise care when switching them out and when cleaning the whole system. Also, after only using it four times and charging it three times, the rechargeable batteries will not take a charge anymore. Now this almost new trimmer is nothing but a useless paperweight. From now on I&#x27;ll stick with a corded trimmer. They&#x27;re not as convenient, but at least they&#x27;ll be more reliable. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash on this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, but a big no, no if you are going to use this while traveling abroad as the power adapter in only 110V one (US only). It should include the universal adapter 110 - 240V. Would have gives 5 stars then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the fact that the it has self sharpening blades and no need to oil them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without thinking I plugged it in while abroad and the trimmer got hot and battery burned out.</li>
    <li> This must be the most Cost efficient trimmer out there, It doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money but is not at all cheap when it comes to functionality. It works great and it brings many accessories.</li>
    <li> Trims hair, still works after many uses.</li>
    <li> It Keeps it charge for quite a long time and will transform your neckbeard into a stylish and attractive look. Lol</li>
    <li> Stuck in Thailand without AC adapter. The original adapter doesn&#x27;t support 220V outlets, and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to find a replacement because of non-standard pin.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I find switching between the various tools to be a hassle and unclear.  I am one of those people that believe that products (especially as simple as this) should not require going to a manual.  Also, battery life is VERY short - so be aware.  As far as clipping - they do a good job.  But I don&#x27;t want to sit down and figure it out - I just want to pick it up and - GO.</li>
    <li> For how much i paid for it and the use i have gotten out of it, its great. I never really bothered with beard trimmers until recently, I&#x27;m older now. I have tried foil shaver and such just because i had them in my stocking on xmas when i was a teen and i know i don&#x27;t like them now. Well since i moved into my 20&#x27;s i can tell you i now need to do some maintenance... everywhere. I picked this up the price wasn&#x27;t bad and i have used it since maybe its been about a year? or longer.  I clean up my stubble with it it does OK lines. I use the foil shaver a bit just to do outlines take multiple passes. The foil shaver isn&#x27;t the best i need to take the head off and brush off the little blades because they get dirty easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The nose hair trimmer is EHH Not to sure about it i don&#x27;t have enough hair to see if it works well but i don&#x27;t think its to great maybe in a bind it would be fine. I use the hair comb for body hair length like leg hair and well below the wast type trimming. I have yet to try and use the clippers without the comb i would not recommend it just by looking at the cutters you might pinch the sack nicely. The clipper heads stay sharp, i think they are self sharpening but i am not sure don&#x27;t quote me. I use the precision head once in awhile its OK it still a bit to big for really fine work imho. I used it to cut my hair once its not good for that if your hair hasn&#x27;t been touched in 2-3 months. For longer hair its a pain. for maintaining hairs its ok at it. But like i said anything not maintained and you want to clean up its a pain in the ass although i used the beard comb instead of the hair comb. I had lost it for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I could be wrong on this but the beard comb clogged and had to be removed and rinsed  a lot. It holds a charge quite long i don&#x27;t charge it to often. It only has started to bog down after heavy use like emergency hair trimming where i couldn&#x27;t get to a barber before something important the next day in the morning. Imight add i had used to before without charging it about 5 times. So if you have to clean your head up i would have a full charge. SO all in all its ok the levels for hair are good i wish it had height adjustments for half increments on the beard comb,it would make fading a nicer feature but for how much it cost you cant go wrong and you can still fade with it you just have to use full step increments 1,2,3,4,5 ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also note this is not a shaver. This is for stubble, cleaning up lines and beard maintenance or if you need to cut a beard down so you can use a razor blade. in no way will this give you a skin close shave. Would i buy it again? sure i would for how much i paid you cant go wrong. But i will be purchasing the Norelco Multi groom pro next so maybe ill review that after i have used it for a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  edit (12/1/2013) I gave it a forth star i ended up using it again for hair with the hair comb this time. it did clog but much less. and i had a full charge this time so has proven it self to me in a pinch yet again</li>
    <li> This is a good razor.  I don&#x27;t follow the instructions for charging or cleaning the device, and it still works great.  Very durable for the lazy person within.</li>
    <li> got it for grandson he loves it&#x27;. It&#x27;s quick and easy to stay groomed at all times Stays sharp too</li>
    <li> Great product and service!</li>
    <li> This thing really holds its charge. I rarely have to charge it. It has done a good job cleaning up my neck and sideburns. It comes with a lot of useful attachments and you can&#x27;t knock the price. A good value purchase!</li>
    <li> This product uses cheap replacement adjusteable heads which break easily. I bought this item twice and won&#x27;t make the same mistake again. And I&#x27;m not the only one with this problem... Just read all thos 1-star rating comments and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> Battery takes 10 hours to charge: you better be charged before you start trimming! I wasn&#x27;t charged enough and had to go on a date with half my head shaved! You have about 35 minutes of use before the charge dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the clipper itself seems durable, the beard and hair trimmer that came with mine both fell apart during the same week. They were just sitting on my desk untouched between uses and the beard trimmer was in two pieces, half the tines on the hair trimmer had fallen off. These clearly have a shelf-life and did not last very long. Philips does not cover the parts in their warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is also under powered and chokes on my moderately thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips customer service is the worst I&#x27;ve ever encountered. As politely as possible, I asked on of the reps if their job is even intended to help customers: he said \\&quot;no, their job is mostly to deflect complaints.\\&quot; After that, he seemed to genuinely be trying to help me, but none of the reps I talked to knew even the basic information about Philips&#x27; policies or products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this clipper broke, I reluctantly tried another, higher-end (QT407)0) Philips trimmer and it was equally as low-quality. I&#x27;m currently struggling to get them to send me a return slip before the 45-day guarantee expires, but the customer service rep said Philips intentionally makes it very difficult to return a product on the guarantee: you have to keep the trimmer for 3 weeks of the 45-days and it takes a week for Philips to process a return request, so you really have something like a 10-day period to return the product. I&#x27;m probably going back to a Wahl trimmer - I had my last one for 10 years before the blade got dull and I unfortunately decided to try Philips.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift for my husband four years ago and he loves it and uses it daily.  It still runs great and he recommends it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced daily groomer.</li>
    <li> muy bueno, entrega rapida y sin problemas. El producto es uno de los mejores que existen! no hay comparación con ninguno</li>
    <li> Liked much more the older model. My wife doesn&#x27;t like and she still keeps using the old one...the new model feels more &#x27;plasticky&#x27;. Why changing something that works!</li>
    <li> Second set I&#x27;ve owned. Works well, sturdy, good accessories. I would highly recommend this product for general grooming. The Problem now is that they are charging over $225 for it now and it was just over $13 in 2013. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll by a third.</li>
    <li> I wish it was water proof, but other than that it works great. It is worth the money if you do not want top of the line.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once but the razor worked and so did the nasal hair trimmer. Both worked fine.</li>
    <li> My first one lasted 6 years. Eventually the rechargeable  battery stops holding a charge. Up till that point it worked perfectly. I think that&#x27;s about what you get out of any device so no complaints.  This is perfect for cutting in your beard lines. Precise and sharp. I got a lot of good use out of this device.  I have just ordered a brand new one, same model number. Hope to get another 6 years out of this one. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This norelco all in 1 is amazing...plenty of attachments that work, and the beard comb/trimmer works perfect for me;  it has 9 settings that are easy to use and see what setting youre on, it&#x27;s quiet, does the job quickly.  In 2 minutes my beard is perfectly groomed.  attachments attach/detach quickly and easily. it comes with a storage bag.  And I swear this thing never needs recharged.  It&#x27;s been in use for a month now and still doesnt need recharged!</li>
    <li> My old Conair cheap-o trimmer gave up the ghost, so I headed to Wally World to find a replacement. I needed something more than a simple electric nose hair trimmer, and I found this nice little number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a ni-cad rechargable battery so you CANNOT KEEP IT PLUGGED IN 24/7. That negates just about all the negative reviews for this product. If you want that kind of feature, you&#x27;ll have to upgrade to one of the Norelco trimmers with a li-ion battery. The trimmer has a 45 day return policy to the manufacturer, so keep your receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I was looking for more than a nose hair trimmer. I wanted nose, ear, eyebrow, sideburns, and the ability to do a little trim around the ears in between haircuts. Actually, I don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, but I might grow a &#x27;stache again someday. Anyway.... this little inexpensive trimmer comes with all the attachments you may need. The cutting blades cut smoothly with no grabbing or pulling. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks on one charge (but I do not use it every day, and when I do it&#x27;s only a few minutes). The attachments are easy to remove and put on. and the trimmer guides are adjustable. It also comes with a little foil shaver attachment that I thought was a pretty cool feature, although I don&#x27;t know how or when I&#x27;ll ever use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is the on/off switch. It&#x27;s a slider switch with a small indentation, and a little tab in the middle. I have to use a fingernail on it to slide the switch. It&#x27;s not easy to do with just your thumb. It&#x27;s kind of hard to slide it, but I guess maybe that&#x27;s better than too loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer does not come with a stand to hold the trimmer and attachments, like my old Conair. You&#x27;ll have to find some way to keep them all together. It does come with a travel pouch but that&#x27;s not conducive to day-to-day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a cheap trimmer for incidental trimming, this works very well.</li>
    <li> Compared to my 10-year old trimmer, this thing is a gem.  Comes with attachments for all levels of trimming, charges so you don&#x27;t go thru batteries every other trim, and doesn&#x27;t snag nearly as much as my previous one.</li>
    <li> the material of the norelco is excellent, 100% finished, it is best to be at a good price, I recommend these philips are great and do not weigh anything, are super comfortable.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer and this solves my purpose great.&lt;br /&gt;Price, functions, handling.. everything as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Use it everyweek for trimming side burns, mustache, beard.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts pretty good. have to charge it once in 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> this item is good for me  i love it so much  the price is suit for me  i lke it</li>
    <li> Good for price I got it for and cheap but you get what you pay for. Charge lasts around 20 mins. A cheap build but good variety of attachments for tool. It will do the trick. Got this for less than $10</li>
    <li> I just bought this at Walgreens to replace my electric Remington shaver that died after a few years. This one is larger, so shaving takes half the time, and with more attachments I can even cut my dog&#x27;s hair now! It&#x27;s not loud enough to scare the dogs. The old shaver would sometimes catch my skin - not break it, but it would hurt (ex. armpits) - this one doesn&#x27;t do that! I LOVE this shaver.</li>
    <li> The unit came with a cloth bag, but no charging stand. It makes it harder to store and charge. Would have bought another if I knew, but it does its job. But still, it is not superior, so without the stand this a pass item. Get another.</li>
    <li> For $15 you really cant beat this trimmer. It comes with attachments for just about everything, and it comes with a built-in rechargeable battery, which is uncommon in this price range. I can&#x27;t speak to the durability of the product since I just bought it, but it seems solid overall.</li>
    <li> it is very useful for any man to have i definitely find it beneficial for myself definitely gives me a good shave</li>
    <li> best groomer I&#x27;ve had, I use for my beard, mustache &amp; sideburns as well as nose hair. The attachments are well designed and do the job. They&#x27;re easy to change. unit is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the product until recently but it doesn&#x27;t charge any more after less than 1 year of occasional use...</li>
    <li> Bought it for the ex. But now I find it a great use for myself, believe it or not it works great on my sweaters.</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever, this is my second one first one lasted a little of 4 and i beat the hell out of it dropping it all the time constintly geting it wet. for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> For the price that it is, i would suggest it, but id doesn&#x27;t give you a good clean buzz, and is pretty cheap plastic. On the other hand, it is easy to function, pretty hard to cut yourself with and easy to switch between different heads. Overall, i liked it.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my friend who was planning to buy one. He is happy with the product and he said it works well.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about couple of years now. Works beautifully for me. Holds charge for a long time even after not being used for couple of months or more. Bought it for 14 bucks. Right now listed at 150+...whaaaa?</li>
    <li> This item is an excellent value! It is rechargeable, sharp and holds lots of battery power. It is a brand name product and I highly recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> It works fine and met my expectations. Stays charged a long time and has many attachments which make it easy to groom many areas.</li>
    <li> I bought these trimmers for my husband. When I seen the great price for such a good name brand I expected them to be \\&quot;ok\\&quot; and just get him by till I found a better pair, but was pleasantly surprised! They are very good quality, good weight and a nice sharpness. My husband has extremely cores hair and these buzz right through without hesitation. He really liked the assortment of attachments it came with. So many of these smaller grooming kits come with attachments that really aren&#x27;t very useful but these are all handy to have. It seems to hold the charge pretty well and the casing isn&#x27;t \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; feeling at all.   Good product, would defiantly recommend to others looking for a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have owned this system. Have owned this set for a year now. The first lasted several years and only the battery finally went. From the first set I can tell you none of the attatchments broke and still have them. Great product if used for beard and back of neck, also good for light body grooming. Family member uses his to trim hair.</li>
    <li> I have to say the design for the package is not good at all. It&#x27;s very very tough to open. When I managed to cut it using VERY HEAVY scissors everything fell to the ground into pieces! It took me an hour to figure out how to put them together. The plastic for the package is very sharp and my finger was cut into bleeding. The product seems not to bad for this price (I bought it for $13.97) but the package definitely needs improving.</li>
    <li> I was always havng to trim my husband&#x27;s hairs in his ears.Since he has recieved this he can do the job all by himself.</li>
    <li> I only grow a beard for a month or 2 in the wintertime and I keep it pretty short.  I&#x27;ve gone through a couple drug store trimmers over the years and, when my last one died, I searched Amazon for the latest and the greatest.  After pouring over quite a few reviews, I went with this Norelco G370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best trimmer I have ever used!  Like I said, I&#x27;m only comparing it to the cheap models I&#x27;ve had before; but this trimmer is simply a joy to use.  So much so, that I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard every few days to keep it looking real clean.  Setting 2 has me at 2-3 days growth. Setting 1 would be, my guess, just stubble.  Not once has it pulled a hair out. The floating comb attachment for the beard trimmer really works to keep the cut super clean and even.  I haven&#x27;t even had to recharge it yet. Used the nose trimmer for my nose, ears and brows.  Same perfect results. Clean, fast cut with no pulls. Even used the shaver head to clean up the strays above my beard a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a cheap shaver - go for it.  This turned out to be one of the best budget buys I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> Basic grooming kit. It looks like Conair&#x27;s and you could probably find it at the drugstore but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> The Grooming System was purchased as a gift.  The recipient was very pleased with the Grooming system and was completely satisfied with the Philips Norelco Grooming System. He would certainly recommend this to others who were interesting in purchasing a similar gift.</li>
    <li> too light ... loses charge and the accesories keep breaking now and then ....fragile</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this great little personal trimmer for about a year and a half.  While I very much do appreciate it there is one problem. I inadvertently dropped the  moustache/beard attachment/accessory into the sink.....the length control slider button broke rendering it useless.  I called the support line hoping to get it replaced, however, I was informed this part is no longer available, and it was suggested that in order to get the part I&#x27;d have to purchase a new (complete) All-in-1 Grooming System.  Needless to say.....I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay charged. Does not provide good trimming; my husband cut his testicle:(. Only the nose/ear trimmer works decently. Would have rather payed more money to possibly receive better quality.</li>
    <li> Its good. worth the cost. Used some portions of it and it is worth the money spent on it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband about 4 months ago.  He uses it maybe once or twice a week to trim his goatee.  With so little use, the blades are already getting dull and it is trimming unevenly.  It is also starting to not hold a charge, even though he keeps it plugged in when it is not in use.  It was a total waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> A very good and decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does its job well and is a nice buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to people to buy.</li>
    <li> I use this every couple of days to groom my beard. It works great, and has made the process so simple and foolproof. The battery seems to last forever. I plug it in every once in a while, and it&#x27;s never died on me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my trimmer for six years, and use it several times weekly. The trimmer does a great job, and is very dependable. Unfortunately, I dropped the unit on the floor, and the trimmer attachment broke. I will purchase a replacement of this exact model and expect the same longevity and dependability.</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS for $25 3 years ago. This trimmer is definitely not worth the price they are asking. I often found that I would get the metal prongs of the trimmer caught in my skin causing frequent bleeding. Maybe it was defective or I have big pores, but I have not had issues with other trimmers before this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about others, but this has been a very handy tool for me. Price wise, its expensive now but I bought it at half price I guess. The different attachments are not very sturdy, but serves the purpose!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect hair grooming kit for beginners. I loved all the accessories and usability aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, NOTE that this device does not operate while charging (unlike my previous 7-year old Norelco), so if you are one who shaves spontaneously, rethink this purchase. Though I am spontaneous, the usability and ease made me feel I could &#x27;plan&#x27; a little in advance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for beard trimming and maintenance for years, and it is great value.  The sideburn attachment works well to define the beard shape, and it comes with loads of extras like a nose hair trimmer.  Works well for body hair too.</li>
    <li> This fantastic piece of hardware is a must have for any man (or woman) that wants to keep their crumb catcher looking as strapping or spiffy as the next guys (or gals). It&#x27;s a death wish for any nasty briar patch that gets in its way! Its furry foes are no match for its arsenal of blades! No matter how hardy the adversary, this trimmer will cut it down to your preferred shape and size!!!&lt;br /&gt;A must buy for any real man )or woman) with a luxurious mane!</li>
    <li> This is a really great machine but I really dont know if the price listed is correct I got this same shaving machine 2 years ago from local CVS store for 25$ and its still working perfectly fine...</li>
    <li> This shaver is rocks. It cleans up hair very nice.</li>
    <li> I had this same groomer for about 6 years before the motor ran down.  I loved that groomer so I searched to find the same thing.  I use it on an almost daily basis and it works incredibly well.  The motor is strong enough to cut through my beard at its thickest, but gentle enough to trim my neck and upper chest without any irritation.  I use it for almost everything, and I absolutely love it.  If this one ever breaks, I fully intend to buy the same one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few years now. It does its job well. The guards are a bit flimsy and will break if you drop them (resulting in some too-close trims if you&#x27;re not paying attention). Otherwise definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Had the older model of this shaver for over 10 years. My old barber used this model as well. Works perfectly. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> A Remington lasted only one year.  This one lasted two!  Used it about once a month.  It stopped charging and working.  Amazon would do us a big favor if they didn&#x27;t stock junk.</li>
    <li> This is a good, very basic grooming system.  I bought it to keep armpits and other areas trim and tidy.  Perfect for that use, but the blades do rust easily so be careful.</li>
    <li> YES,IT WAS GREAT ! iIT DOES A GREAT JOB TRIMMING AND GROOMING ,I&#x27;VE NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD. MY BROTHER EVEN USES IT TO TRIM HIS HAIR FOR WORK. WOW,WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT !</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and my attempts to get a close shave with this razor were futile. It was better at cutting my skin than my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase if you have fine hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Remington Titanium trimmer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has all the attachments I need.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the rechargable battery last for ever.  Not as powerful as a prior trimmer I had. Cannot remember the brand as I threw out when this one arrived.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. For the right price.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive product is priced perfectly. It  performs higher than expectations for a product this cheap. If you just need a quick cut, purchase this. It has rechargeable batteries and comes with a travel bag. I am very satisfied with mine. The only really bad thing was the original plastic casing was made of titanium it seemed. All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> The product is basically good for the price. i only used this twice a month but already died in 10 months (or 20 times of usage). Performance is acceptable but it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This little guy has lasted me a lot longer than I had expected. I love all the different attachments, but I wish they did a better job with the length settings.  2 is too short, 3 is too to long. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new shavers or trimmer and came across this one....! BEWARE! This trimmer can be purchased at Walgreens for around $20.</li>
    <li> Broke down after two weeks.</li>
    <li> Some people had problems with charging but honestly I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all. I charged it the first day I bought it and haven&#x27;t charged it since. It&#x27;s been 5 months and it still works just as great as the first day and I&#x27;m still very impressed and amazed! This product is great! And for the price its also a steal. I can trim my hair, my stashe and everything to keep myself looking to my satisfaction everyday. You will not be disappointed with this product at all</li>
    <li> I love this thing! The battery lasts surprisingly long and the different attachments come in handy!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 or so trimmers in recent times (mixture of brand names like Wahl and shop own brand versions) and this is by far the cheapest and the best. The Wahl had the problem of pulling at my beard occasionally making shaving akin to a mild form of torture. The shops own brand version shaved well but was very poorly designed ergonomically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips doesn&#x27;t suffer any of these problem with a very simple design and well fitting attachments. I have not used it for haircutting and think it maybe isn&#x27;t the best option for this. I have had the trimmer for about 2 months now. I don&#x27;t use it too extensively (just to trim my beard once a week) but it holds it&#x27;s charge very well for a good amount of time.  As a cheap beard trimmer it really is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> The best system for the money. Does everything above the neck that the big boys do.</li>
    <li> Just okay for what i paid for. If you can cough up a few more bucks get a better one</li>
    <li> After using this trimmer several times, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it represents a great value. If you occasionally need to trim/shape your facial hair this is a great buy. The problem is if you travel frequently, I would imagine the attachments not to hold up to the physical abuse since they are made of plastic. However, if you will just use this at home and are careful with changing the attachments, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong for this price point. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I buzz my head with it. Works perfectly for that. Like the one piece adjustable comb. No need to keep changing separate combs. Holds a charge a long time. And the price is right!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer to replace my old g390 that was only half working. This is great, and for the money, I&#x27;m really happy. Good to use if you need to trim large areas such as your legs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a $20 generic set from a local drugstore.  These clippers offer more attachments, are rechargeable, and seem to be MUCH sharper than the more expensive generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last quite awhile.  I haven&#x27;t fully discharged it yet, but charging it overnight every 1.5 weeks or so has never been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if it included a stand or something rather than just a travel bag, but for under $15 I will not be complaining.  You can purchase the upgraded versions if you really need that.</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor for the money, I have had it for 4 years and use it daily, mainly to trim my beard, which is what I bought it for. The extra guides and the spring loaded guide are really great, I can even cut my nose hairs! LOL</li>
    <li> I received this product and was able to cut into it with a pair of scissors. It put up a good fight. I thought I might break something inside if I was too tough on the packaging. However, I was able to get it out with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, many people see the attachments as cheap, flimsy plastic, but I see this differently. I would rather have something that gives a little instead of rigid, hard plastic running through my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abundance of attachment makes this a very versatile tool. This really is an All-in-1 grooming system. The battery seems to run forever and the bag that they give you to put your attachments in is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase thus far. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good all-in-1 grooming system.</li>
    <li> I have always bought Norelco products and have NEVER had an issue with them.  The one time I tried to purchase another product I was dissatisfied.  After purchasing this trimmer I can say that I LOVE it!!!  I am a Norelco/Phillips product user for life.  I have had NO issues whatsoever!  It may be cheap (monetarily speaking) but the quality of the product is better than ever.  Way to go Norelco/Phillips!</li>
    <li> my daughter got me this for fathers day &amp; i just love it, it has every attachement i need its a wonderful machine</li>
    <li> Bought this product, after 4 times of using the charger, it completely stopped functioning. Bought one again, same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;Roommate bought one, it broke even faster.</li>
    <li> This product is great...I use it very often...when the time comes, I will purchase it again.  I recomment this product to everyone that is in nedd of the same....</li>
    <li> I bought this more than 6 months ago. Use it once a week. The battery lasts amazingly long &amp; it does its job quite well.</li>
    <li> After reading both good and bad reviews for this product, I purchased it to trim my husbands beard (after his old trimmer died). It does a decent job of trimming. The nose hair attachment doesn&#x27;t work. The micro foil attachment rips hairs out rather than cutting them. The attachments are made of cheap plastic so handle with care.</li>
    <li> I have a goatee and this item trims it just fine. Highly recommend it if you are a man with facial hair.</li>
    <li> I had the exact same system (grey) which I was replacing after years of use. This black glossy finish makes it a little slippery however, so grip tightly. Also, they replaced the great plastic doohickey which holds everything together on the bathroom counter with some cheap carry bag, which I am not fond of. Still, great purchase for the money, I&#x27;m sure it will last for years just like my old one.</li>
    <li> All the add ons for a shaver you could ask for. Product works flawlessly. Considering its under $10 when I bought it, I couldn&#x27;t imagine any features that would merit me buying another one. I was told to be careful leaving it plugged into the charger for long times because it can ruin the battery life, but if you mind that then you have quite possibly the best shaver around for the price. I would recommend to anyone who uses a shaver! And paying $40-200 for an expensive one with (if possible) other features would seem like a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Under $14 includes everything needed to maintain a beard or mustache.  Also includes accessories for trimming nose and ear hair and you can do minor shaving of errant stubble. Best value in a product I&#x27;ve seen in a long time!</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, but soon discovered wouldn&#x27;t even charge.  Thought I was doing something wrong, so resorted to included instructions.  Never was able to get the item to work and returned to Amazon.  Very low quality. I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these little guys over five years ago.  I have a super thick beard with very coarse hair and I trim about 3x monthly.  Still works great - the razor has gotten dull (as ANY one would over the course of five years), which is why I&#x27;m getting a new one.  Also, as with any other rechargeable trimmer, this becomes less effective over time at holding a charge.  No big deal, I just keep it plugged in now when I use it.  Didn&#x27;t have to start doing that until about the fourth year I owned it.  It&#x27;s an excellent value at under $15 and I liked it so much that I&#x27;m replacing my old one with the same model.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the plastic stand it presumably still comes with, but I just use an inexpensive mini dopp kit that I found here.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad when he developed dimentia, I was able to use this with all the attachments very easily and he was very happy to get the look he was accustomed to with a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is great and just keeps going.  For the price I expected it to be a lot let useful than it&#x27;s turned out to be.  It&#x27;s small, but VERY handy!</li>
    <li> I found this exact one with everything at walmart for 15 dollars. this is no way worth $100+</li>
    <li> WHAT A SCAM! I BOUGHT THIS FULL SET FOR LESS THAN 15 DOLLARS IN THE STORE. NO WAY NEAR WORTH 179 DOLLARS. NOT EVEN WORTH 30 DOLLARS !!!!! VERY BASIC.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a good groomer taking care of my grooming needs.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. No complaints at all. Great for trimming my beard and chest, great for getting that pesky back hair all the way to the skin without nicks, not to mention ANY OTHER hair you might wanna get rid of.</li>
    <li> This is one of the Best Grooming System&#x27;s i ever had.  It is a multifunctional system with a Good Battery backup.  I strongly recommend this grooming system and you will definitely like it.</li>
    <li> When my old (20 years) Norelco T7000 trimmer&#x27;s battery died several years ago, I replaced it. (You&#x27;re not suppose to), but when the motor started to grind I had to replace it. The new G370 was the least expensive and had so many options, I bought it. It works just a good as the old T7000 did when it was new. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Well done. I have been using it for nose trimming almost 6 years now. The adapter burned out once in that time but other than that it is a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is an excellant and inexpensive tool for the maintenence of facial hair.  Having worn a beard for over 40 years, this is the best I have found for the money</li>
    <li> I barely used this contraption which has TONS of accessories and LOUSY diagrams and instructions on how to use them. Then several of them broke. DO NOT WASTE A DIME!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought two philip grooming sets and after using one it failed. Was going through amazon return policy on this but find it more of a hassle to return to get a replacement. So I will have to cut my losses. Please stay away from this...its trash.</li>
    <li> awesome shaver easy use would buy again if i needed a new one used for a year now and still works and holds charge for weeks. buy this worth every penny</li>
    <li> I needed a cordless clippers and a colleague at work recommended this. The charge lasts for a while. The instructions weren&#x27;t that clear about how to adjust the length when cutting but I was able to figure that out eventually.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is incredible considering the price that I paid for it. I have had it for about 3 months already and do not have 1 bad thing to say about it. Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> Wish it came with a smaller (width) option. And wish it were quieter. Otherwise, works well. Seems to hold battery life really well - hardly ever needs charging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old male with nice thick hair. I use a head trimmer for under my neck since it cuts the hair short but doesn&#x27;t leave bad razor burn. I use Norelco stubble shaver for my \\&quot;beard\\&quot; I like the 5 o clock shadow look. My mustache hair is VERY thick, and can slow even the most powerful motors down. I will say that I don&#x27;t really spend big money on razors since I bought a $150.00 unit that did nothing better than my $30 unit. So for my $40 MAX for a trimmer. They seem to last me a few years, with both my shaver and my trimmer going on 3-4 years now with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Target today December 1st 2012, and bought this on sale since I have been wanting an \\&quot;all-in one\\&quot; picked it up for $16 with tax. I just tried it out, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m very happy with it. cut right through my mustache like butter, and with one of the attachable heads it turns in to a 5 o clock trimmer like my $35 dollar Norelco stubble trimmer. I may also add that it does a much better job than the dedicated stubble trimmer, since it seems to do everything in one pass and does it very evenly, I find myself having to do multiple passes with the Dedicated stubble trimmer, and even then you can tell it didn&#x27;t do an even job, although since the hair is short, and my hair grows fast, I don&#x27;t worry to much, I&#x27;m not picky. I will say that the foil shaver is kinda lame, doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, but I was kinda dirty, and my hair was stuck to my skin, so I&#x27;ll try it again in a week after a nice hot shower. Every other attachment works well. I knock off a half star for the foil shaver, and a half star for not being able to use it plugged in, which makes no sense to me... why not?! I should knock it down to 3 stars, but I&#x27;m afraid this would detour people from buying it, and it really is a good shaver, if those little quirks dont matter, then you you get a good \\&quot;bang for your buck,\\&quot;. Now if I decide to return this unit, for the Whal, which I am told is made in the US, I will not only update this review, but give a good honest comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep updating this review from time to time, and if you have any questions feel free to ask, I&#x27;ll pop back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $16, if I get 6-12 months use, I will feel as though I&#x27;ve got my money worth, anything past that, and I&#x27;ll buy another with out hesitation.only update this review, but give a good honest comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep updating this review from time to time, and if you have any questions feel free to ask, I&#x27;ll pop back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $16, if I get 6-12 months use, I will feel as though I&#x27;ve got my money worth, anything past that, and I&#x27;ll buy another with out hesitation.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because it is inexpensive and expect the batteries to wear out in a couple years just like the expensive ones do I&#x27;ve had before.  They all die someday.  The power is not great in thick hair, but as a balding old guy it does the trick.  Nice set of accessories, especially the one that adjusts zero to half and inch or so.</li>
    <li> Took me a minute to figure it out--super easy, featuring a lot of attachments that work to style and clean up your look. This was the perfect tool for me to transform my scraggly beard into a clean-cut and trim look. Bonus feature, took out those pesky nose hairs that are not so fun to pluck. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised and very pleased at how many attachments came with this beard and mustache trimmer.  It has very sharp blades that are self-sharpening and very quiet.  I was able to trim my beard to the length I prefer, shape my mustache, trim my nose and ear hair, and then with a micro shaver, clean up my neck.  All done in less than five minutes.  I&#x27;ve only had it since today so I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s longevity will be, but I&#x27;ve owned Phillips products in the past and found them to last a long time.  I recommend this set-up for anyone with a beard, mustache, nose hair, ear hair or wild eyebrow hair.</li>
    <li> Bought again after the trimmer guide thingy broke. But great value for the cost. Durable and sure to last. Done</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. The attachments were generally useful (apart from the ear trimmer), but on the two trips I made with it, it turned on in my checked in luggage, so when I reached my destination, it had zero charge left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re never planning to travel with it, I think it will do the job, but otherwise, I went with the QT4070</li>
    <li> This thing just works. Plain and simple. No cord during use. Easy to charge. Easy to clean. Easy to shape my beard. Can even cut thicker hair like on your head.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this, I use it to trim my beard and use the nose/ear hair remover.</li>
    <li> The trimming system comes with lots of accessories but the razor is a little big so its easy to get cut using it. Will need something smaller for greater detail and less catching.. OUCH!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver, but the only negative I find all the attachments rather than one hand held unit with a do all. BUT, does a great job</li>
    <li> My review for this product is waaaaaay overdue. Fast shipping, quick delivery. I purchased this for my husband in 2012 and until this day in 2014 it&#x27;s still working just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a mustache for about 20 years and a beard, off and on for 10. This thing is \\&quot;okay\\&quot; at best. The charge dies way too quickly. The beard trimmer comes apart too easily, and is frankly, rather hard to keep together when taking apart, if that makes any sense. (Think, when you need to clean it after every shave/trim.)  Enough can&#x27;t be said about how long the charge lasts. The battery is AWFUL. The charge cord isn&#x27;t compatible with anything else Philips makes, from what I can tell. The sink-side rest case is worthless. Honestly, there isn&#x27;t much to recommend this thing, except that it&#x27;s hard to find anything better. A long time ago, I had a norelco trimmer to go along with my norelco cordless razor (which I still love!) and it worked great, but I lost the charger. I figured, hey, same company right? (not.) If you can find old-school Norelco trimmers, get one. But don&#x27;t be fooled by this knock-off.  Edited 11/6/11 -   Wow. I got this thing from Amazon: Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer (copy and paste into a search here) and it is AWESOME. Blows away any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had by a long shot. I&#x27;ve never had a Remington product, but the battery life, the charger, the changing of trimmer sizes, etc all are amazing. You can see my review on that product and I gave it 5 stars. It may not do nose hair trimming (???) but for beard and mustache, the REMINGTON blows away all the competition.</li>
    <li> The trimmer isnt bad. It was very cheap and you get what you pay for. The attachments are a little flimsy and cheap but they work just fine. The trimmer itself cuts pretty well, it has yet to tug my hair and it cuts evenly. Its light and easy to maneuver. Its gets the job done as advertised. I haven&#x27;t used it that much but the battery life seems to be pretty good, only charged it once and it has lasted a few uses. If your looking for a trimmer to just get the job done then this one is fine for you.</li>
    <li> The product is very cheap. Parts of it would disfunction within the first week or two (the parts wouldn&#x27;t fit, etc). But after 2 months of not even heavy usage, it completely died and would not turn on. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> I researched several different all-in-one beard trimming systems before I bought the Norelco G370.  I was most concerned about the battery life - one of the biggest complaints about this and other all-in-one systems.  I made my purchase in March 2011, charged the battery for 24 hours (as recommended) and didn&#x27;t have to charge the battery again for another 5 months (August).  For me, the battery is not a problem.  The all-in-one system is easy to use.  The attachments snap on and off with ease and are easy to clean (I use a can of compressed air).  It is on the noisy side, which is most noticable when I use it to trim the hair in my ears.  But you shouldn&#x27;t expect perfection for $20. For the money, I give it 5 stars and would recommend the G370 to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It&#x27;s now September 2012 and my G370 is still working.  I have only charged the battery twice since I purchased it.  Letting the battery expend itself before charging will extend the life of the battery.  I clean it every time I use it so hair particles don&#x27;t clog the attachments.  I am still very pleased with this product.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year, but it keeps going, and going, and...</li>
    <li> the adjuster is a little flimsy. you have to be careful when cutting hair.still nice for the money. light in weight</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t used it that much. I found the trimmer attachment kind of glossy because it is a kind of silicon plastic different from the regular attachments that are rough and don&#x27;t stick in your skin. I bought it because it said in the Phillips website that the battery charger would work on 110V and 220V but the truth is that it will only work on regular 110V, you will need a voltage transformer to take it to Europe.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System is a really light and practical Grooming kit. Al the accesories are really useful and easy to use. The battery discharges quickly when using, but it last the right time, You have to plug into AC for 15 minutes before grooming for best and quick performance. But for 15 bucks is the best grooming deal by far. Thank You...</li>
    <li> the product shipped in time! i got it even sooner! and it works like a charm!! lots of options and completely worth the bucks! would definitely recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE) - the product stopped working shortly after use and it doesnt charge anymore</li>
    <li> Paid much more for the store bought. My old one gave out after years of service, &amp; this one will last also. Love it.</li>
    <li> Recommended...I have ordered another one for a frd...good battery...has many options...definetly better than using razors... wish i had this before..thank you.</li>
    <li> I got this grooming kit to replace one a prior Norelco kit I had for years.  This one is much better than the last, and an excellent kit that can do most anything needed to trim hair, face, nose, ears, etc.</li>
    <li> everything i was looking for&lt;br /&gt;it is going to be a gift so i havent try it yet but it came in a nice presentation and it is a great item</li>
    <li> Great for your travel bag,  good price and works well. It takes up very little space in your bag.  Just what I was looking to buy</li>
    <li> this is just what i wanted to strart my twin boys on. shipped fast and looks good. They will be so happy to have there own</li>
    <li> This works okay but if you don&#x27;t use a guard be prepared to bleed a little.  The battery is pretty good and I rarely charge it.</li>
    <li> Works for everything. i think this is a very nice product for this price ! The best part is that it is multifunctional !</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco \\&quot;Groomer\\&quot; I have owned over the past dozen or so years. Following the trend of most small appliances these days, they have continued to get cheaper in price, but also lower in quality. This model does a decent job (I use it as a beard trimmer) but it&#x27;s smaller, noisier, and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as its immediate predecessor (about $35 on Amazon 4 or 5 years ago), or the best; my first Norelco model about a dozen years ago ($70 at Target). So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good deal considering the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;d rather have paid the $70 for the old, superior model, which worked faster and quieter.</li>
    <li> Great little thing for all around grooming. Cheap, lasts forever. I even buzz my head with it. The shaver part isn&#x27;t great for overall face, but it is really good for mustache area, and neck line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 9/24/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this thing for years now. I buzz my head with one attachment, trim my beard with another, shave the neckbeard with a third. Battery is still going strong after many years of use and rarerly recharging it. Still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 7/7/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still goin strong.</li>
    <li> this is a back up just in case something happens to the one I&#x27;ve been using the last three years , love it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco G370 for about 5 years.  I don&#x27;t remember where I got it, but it has been my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Recently the blades seem to have gotten dull and it was hurting when I trimmed my beard (pulling instead of cutting).  Also, the head on the biggest attachment broke so it didn&#x27;t &#x27;click&#x27; into place for the length setting anymore.  I made note of the model because I wanted to buy the exact same one if possible.  When I jumped on Amazon I was completley shocked that it was under fifteen dollars!!  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy another one sooner!  This product is awesome and lasts a really long time.  For the price, it&#x27;s a 5 star product for sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. Although they don&#x27;t cut skin smooth they don&#x27;t pull hair. Easily rechargeable and trims PUBLIC hair easily. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another for my mustache.</li>
    <li> I use this system two or three times a week to shave my side burns. it works great for that purpose.  I would by it again and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this groomer especially to trim my sideburns and hair above and around ears.  And this groomer is well designed and has apt accessories to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about the Mini Shaver, it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  May be because my beard hair is thick.  I would not use mini shaver attachment, as it is not good for me at all.  Hey, that&#x27;s only me.  It may work well for others, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other attachments are well designed and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to share with you that this groomer comes with a tiny carry bag, probably to put your attachments in it while travelling.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this little groomer.  I primarily use it to keep my goatee thinned out and i use the micro-screen attachment as a daily touch-up for the 5 o-clock shadow - and that thing WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to be African American and a lot of us have issues with getting razor bumps after shaving with a blade.  I don&#x27;t get it as bad as others do, but my skin is sensitive so typically after shaving with a razor, I have to wait about 3 days before my next razor shave or else my skin gets reddish and painfully irritated.  I still have to wait, but now I have been using the micro-screen attachment in those 3-day periods and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and I can look more presentable. Years ago, I tried another very popular brand micro-screen shaver and it felt like someone snatching out my facial hair - quite painful.  So I am happy to report that this one does not do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother and nephew both have similar shaving issues, and I&#x27;m going to buy one of these for them too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve owned this for close to a month now and I use it all the time, and am very surprised that I literally have only had to charge it ONE TIME...now that&#x27;s efficiency.  I followed the instructions and charged it completely the first time and it lasted, and lasted.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, trims very well. I am also happy with battery life,  lasts quite long. Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- this is a great product at a great price.  My gripe is about the blade release button: it&#x27;s in too prominent of a position.  I routinely pop the blade when I adjust my hand grip. It makes a loud noise when it clatters in the sink.  That sound echoes through the house in the early morning, long before &amp;#34;she who must be obeyed&amp;#34; has chugged her second cup of coffee.  Heaven help you if there&#x27;s a baby sleeping anywhere near the bathroom.  But other than that, it&#x27;s just like I said: a great product at a great price.  With an annoying blade release button.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is so simple that I was able to trim my husband&#x27;s beard. And believe me I am not barber!</li>
    <li> Bought it from target after seeing the \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; positive reviews here on amazon. I used it once, in this one use I broke two attachments to the point where I could not reassemble them. The trimmer its self is quite flimsy and very weak because it run off its battery. I returned it after this one use, and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> At first you need to know that you shouldn&#x27;t expect this shaver/groomer to work as a big ones (like the ones in haircutteries). It&#x27;s pretty good for what you pay for. You just need to keep your beard short get the best result from it. The trimmer works well. The battery life is pretty good. I received it and took it with me to a two weeks trip right away; I didn&#x27;d charged it during these two weeks (I used it several times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaver; since the shaver&#x27;s tip is small, automatically it takes you more time to shave - since you need to go over every part of your face a couple of times to shave it well. This is not because it doesn&#x27;t shave well, it&#x27;s just because the tip is very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s definitely worth for the price</li>
    <li> I just ordered my 3rd of these beard trimmers. I use this on my face, head, and body. It does a really nice smooth job of cutting and does not pull hairs at all for me. Though I do not have very course hair. The only issue I have with it is the battery. When new it holds a charge for a pretty long time, several head and face trims. But as it gets older its loses charge over a year or two of regular usage. Not a big deal considering the low price. My main thing is that I REALLY wish Philips made a clone version of this trimmer that worked while plugged in so that if it dies in mid cut you could just plug it in and have it keep running. But I would still recommend it as is.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product and the care with which it was shipped. However, I wish they had included a durable permanent storage case tailored to hold all the components securely.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. I tried the ones with the vacuum, but they haven&#x27;t worked for me. This has several useful tools that make it more than just a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very good product.Easy to carry and has good battery autonomy. I am Satisfied with the product But it is up to everyone to choose.........,......,...............Thanks</li>
    <li> This is such a good product for the price. It is very sharp too, unlike similar trimmers. The item did NOT come with the base piece as shown in the picture though. Not such a big deal because I had an older one from a previous model.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great.  I don&#x27;t understand some of the complaints.  Why would anyone complain because it only works in the cordless mode?  Do they want to be anchored to the wall with an electric cord?  The quality is excellent.  I keep the attachments in a separate storage container so I can easily switch from trimming my nose hairs to cutting the hair away from my ears.  (For some reason, my hair stylist never seems to get that right.)  Since I wear glasses, it is a relief to have the hair cut away over my ears.  Using the &#x27;shaving&#x27; attachment, I can quickly clean up the ears and the side burns.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t been back for a haircut since I got this product.  It turns out that the only reason that I went to my stylist was to get the hair cut away from my ears and to look at Amy&#x27;s ample breast.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco beard trimmers are a brand I&#x27;ve always gone with. I&#x27;ve had one that was just like this one but gray (an older model from Costco) I got this for under $20 brand new with new accessories and it&#x27;s basically the upgraded version of what I&#x27;ve been using. It grooms all beard styles nicely, I change it up often and have used it to carve just about every weird and wacky design possible. 2 thumbs up indeed!</li>
    <li> This was a gift I gave. Nicely priced, almost the same as Walmart though (When I purchased).&lt;br /&gt;2 negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Takes 12 hrs to charge fully. So, planning is key to using this. You cannot plug it in and use.&lt;br /&gt;2. I trim my hair using this. The largest setting cuts my hair shorter than I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> Great tool for the price. On the downside it takes too long to charge and the cord connection stopped working properly after a while.</li>
    <li> A name you can trust for quality and performance. Long lasting charge with all the accessories you need to get that beard in shape</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the feel/weight, this is a solid product.  I have used this several times now and am pleasently surprised at the quality for the price, this is a very nice trimmer.  Battery life has also been a pleasant surprise, I don&#x27;t use this every day (I use it for neck hair about once a week), it holds it&#x27;s charge for several weeks ....actually over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;For the value this is a \\&quot;can&#x27;t miss.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Got this for my room-mate. He&#x27;s been using it for more than a fortnight I guess. It&#x27;s amazing how many accessories you can get with $14. Certainly a device symbolizing the power of mass production and manufacturing. My friend&#x27;s been loving it. Definitely good value for money.</li>
    <li> The service was great, but I returned this grooming system unopened because I decided to purchase a more expensive clipper with a set of separate combs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional working man with a beard. As such, it&#x27;s imperative that I keep from looking like Grizzly Adams. This razor seems like it&#x27;ll do the job for awhile. I had a [[ASIN:B00A1TQOSC WAHL Rechargeable 17-Piece Lithium Ion All-In-One Trimmer]] previously. It cost twice as much, but felt sturdier. Manlier. All it took was one fall from around three feet though and it was busted for good. So then I had a busted Wahl with a bunch of worthless attachments. So for a time it was grow the beard until it got to shaggy, then shave. Grow the beard. Shave. Grow. Shave. Not a good workflow. Happened across the Norelco and, based on the reviews and the price, gave it a shot. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. Feel like it&#x27;s the most even shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a an electric beard trimmer. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty impressive. It&#x27;s also got some other attachments that I don&#x27;t use. It does feel cheap and probably will also break from a modest height, but at this price, I&#x27;ll take the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - I forgot to mention that I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t shave with it plugged into the wall. Then it takes 10 hours to hold a 30 minute charge. Wow. That&#x27;s a long time. But I think the cost and precision shave more than make up for what is probably this products worst feature.</li>
    <li> holds a charge and easy to clean, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Does not provide as close of a trim as I would like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for two years and I&#x27;ve charged it twice. Love it.</li>
    <li> All in one. Good Product.</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> Just received product and have only used a few times. Does a great job of trimming my beard. Just used to give my son a GI haircut and it did take some time. The clipper is really too small to do a major haircut but great for trimming.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I need to trim my beard and even have a closer shave it I need to.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl brand trimmer. I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t have a length setting I liked. I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco for a few weeks now. It has a lot of nice options, although the attachments do feel cheap. I can see how the length adjusting mechanism can break, but honestly if you just be a little gentle when using it it will be fine. The foil shaver worked well and painless enough. I wish it would have came with a stand, but the bag works. As for the shave itself it required several passes to get an even look. I had no trouble with precision though and everything came out symmetrical. All in all it does what i need it to do, and more if necessary.</li>
    <li> I love this philips hair removal. Highly recommended for all people.simply ,practic and good price.It a cutter for small budget</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well-it&#x27;s the second set I&#x27;ve bought. It has many attachments, but the blades do tend to wear out. But for the price, you can replace it every couple years!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Easy, small, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs and doesn&#x27;t require going over the same spot multiple times. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and little charge time.  Multiple attachments are a plus.  Looks cheaper than it feels.  Solid Product overall.</li>
    <li> This little clipper works well and is priced very reasonably. It comes with many attachments. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This puppy has strongly held on to its price since 2010 now. Just mentioning that it really has that sweet price point.&lt;br /&gt;- 6 attachments gets my job done.&lt;br /&gt;- I use it mainly for trimming the sideburns and hair above the ear-line. One charge keeps me going for a long long time but then i use it for like once a month - But still battery hours are impressive.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to maintain and clean&lt;br /&gt;- Travel pouch makes it easy for a mobile/traveler lifestyle with all attachments and small comb and cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades have been keeping well till now , but then i do ensure to clean it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The nose trimmer is especially painful - Torturous would not be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- The overall build quality and material is not that great and i believe can not withstand a lot of wear and tear. So be careful for its upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it beats the competition hands-down. Makes a great stocking-stuffer or a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product at a great price. You can&#x27;t get much better than a Philips. Hands down the best out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer! I was a little apprehensive at first due to the price, but at the end of the day I was only looking for a basic trimmer. It wasn&#x27;t like I planned on running a barber shop or anything! For the price, you can&#x27;t do any better than this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life (got a half-dozen uses on a single charge)&lt;br /&gt;Huge plethora of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic shape fits well in hand&lt;br /&gt;Looks more expensive than it feels&lt;br /&gt;Convenient carry bag holds everything&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap feel, all plastic construction&lt;br /&gt;Long charge time (10 hours!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product for casual personal grooming. I don&#x27;t feel like it has the power and features to compete the a barber&#x27;s trimmer for cutting head hair and such. It is perfect for body and facial hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, inexpensive and good battery life. I don&#x27;t know if you can buy anything better for this price.</li>
    <li> This item broke shortly after purchasing......my first one lasted longer but still broke. Way to expensive to break so easily</li>
    <li> For the price of this shaver, I&#x27;m continually happy.  The NiCad battery is strong if it&#x27;s charged seldomly.  And it seems to last a long time between charges.  Every attachment is mostly plastic.  This is not an issue except for one of the beard trimmers.  As you use this attachment, you&#x27;ll inclined to push it against your skin and this weakens the plastic guides that are attached to the fixture on one side only.  Therefore, you tend to fatigue them and the guides start falling off after about 1 to 1.5 years for me.  However, for the price of this item, it is definitely worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Was a little concerned about the quality of the item, even after it arrived. The trimmer felt light and &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; to me, but that was comparing it to my old unit, which was heavy and had a metal casing.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable attachment is a little flimsy, and needs to be handled with care with cleaning.. or you might snap off one of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it has been running great, requires minimal maintenance, and battery last quite a bit (good for traveling).</li>
    <li> excellent grooming kit for any and all applications !!&lt;br /&gt;dont let the price fool you, this does what other 50 -100 dollars kits wish they could do !</li>
    <li> When this was working it did everything all the good reviews claimed it did.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t even last 4 months.  I charged it one evening after using and the next day I tried to turn it on and nothing.  Charged again in a different outlet and nothing again.  It&#x27;s dead and I&#x27;m out my money.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing a philips norelco product again.</li>
    <li> This compact trimmer works very well. Holds charge for a long time so always ready to go. Cuts nicely without ripping. Nice unit.</li>
    <li> My son used it and a couple of the tabs broke off.&lt;br /&gt;Had to buy a new one or just trim my beard short.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new Phillips trimmer for several month. It has worked very well and for the price is probably the best buy you will get for a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for the money. Also has the attachments like nose / ear hair trimming.  I found I had to experiment with the trim levels some but fantastic for the money.</li>
    <li> New to having a beard and this trimmer has been great.  Lots of attachements.  Trims nicely and precisely.  The rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  And its a great price.</li>
    <li> I tried a bunch of the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; it came with once I charged it a few hours. After reading other reviews I found that the battery half life is an issue so I decided to charge it for a while before I used it.  Let&#x27;s hope this works to my advantage.  Performs as desired in all aspects I tested. From nose hair to beard trimming. Although I feel one of the tools is redundant for people whith short beards/mustaches, it works pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> i purchased this as a gift for my husband,and he likes it.  The price was good for the product and receivved it on time</li>
    <li> fantastic value for money. trimmer works great and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge. cannot be beat at his or any price.</li>
    <li> Overall, it works well.  My only concern is that the hinged plastic comb at the top is quite flimsy and likely to break in the long run.</li>
    <li> Feels light and flimsy, but it works well. Doesn&#x27;t clip the skin, even when I shave in such a way that it probably  should.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this so far. I replaced a Wahl that has been very gimpy the past two years (hard to turn on and runs erratically). It works very well trimming my goatee - I use setting 4 on the adjustable head. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the detail trimmer head is not small enough to get in tight spaces (the Wahl did have a very small detail trimmer). And I really wished it came with a base (I&#x27;d pay an extra buck for that). But I was able to reuse my Wahl base for this - not an ideal fit but does work. Overall a good value so far (have had for a couple of months).</li>
    <li> The blade part is pretty small so you&#x27;ll probably do many passes through your face but it gives a great shave. All the swap-able heads come in handy too, the nose hair trimmer does have a tendency to pop off though. The only thing I dont like is that you cant use it while its charging.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple weeks ago as I started growing out my beard and needed a beard trimmer.  After a couple of uses, the plastic clip used to adjust the length broke off.  I don&#x27;t need any of the other attachments, so I&#x27;m pretty much stuck with a useless trimmer at this point.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described, no surprises.  Only complaint is the bag supplied for storage.  Very cumbersome especially with so many attachments.</li>
    <li> I give my star because this is the best price I can get this item.  I bought this for gift but this item was recommended by a close friend.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I love the variety of attachments and it is very ergonomic. I don&#x27;t use it every day but it&#x27;s been ready when I need it. I thought since it was so inexpensive, it would be poor quality, but I was happily surprised when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anybody. This product works well and comes with a variety of adapters for different kinds of uses. Battery is fine and so far I have not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> This combination unit does the job for me, what more can I say? I certainly would buy it again if I had to do so.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit several months ago, and have been very satisfied. Multiple attachments make it easy for trimming sideburns, nose hairs, and the back of the neck. I dont have a beard, but the unit does come with a couple beard trimming attachments as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve had this razor other than over 5 years; it seems like forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my neck &amp; trim my beard a few times most weeks and the worst thing I&#x27;ve found is that one of the prongs in the beard guard broke off in my luggage during a flight. That didn&#x27;t hurt the functionality of the guard or operation of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has held a charge for years; I leave it off the stand except when it needs a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight but that was what I was looking for in a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Multiple attachments, portable size, easy to carry. Reasonable price when compared to other products. No issues with battery and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Its really good and very economical. It exceeded my expectation as a product. I could not have expected a better product than this. Thanks for recomending it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my long haired small dog (a Havanese) trimmed up, especially around the face. It is easy to change attachments, and the precision trimmer is fantastic to use around my dog&#x27;s eyes. It is quiet and gets the job done easily. I have only used it twice so far, but I think if it&#x27;s cleaned and stored properly that it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought it.  Let it run down.  Oops!  Attempted to recharge it.  Couldn&#x27;t.  Trashed it.  Bought a Braun yesterday.  Hoping its better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see nothing so special about it compare to the others,cuz my husband has to do his beard more than once to get what he s looking for,</li>
    <li> So we all have em right? Get this and it will fix whatever nose hair problems you have. lets face it, no one wants to see your nose hairs dude, it gross!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten 2 the last few years, its very fragile, but for the price its worth it.</li>
    <li> Philips SteelWave technology utilizes revolutionary, wave-shaped blades that channel and cut hair for a precise and even trim every time.</li>
    <li> This grooming kit does so much! Trims my ticklish nose hair, great 4 a shave, a trim &amp; for cutting the hair of a kid that won&#x27;t sit on one spot</li>
    <li> My use is pretty much limited to keeping my moustache close, but so far this is the best groomer I&#x27;ve owned (but may be the most I&#x27;ve paid for one, too).  The build seems solid &amp; I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Works great all the way around.  For what I paid this is a great value.  New in package for under $15.</li>
    <li> excellent product. very compact and sturdy and easy to carry around. looks great too! Very happy and satisfied and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this beard trimmer and I recommend it to everyone.  I charged it up when it arrived and it seems to go on forever without needing a recharge.  It looks very well made especially for the inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> This has all the attachments you need, so I replaced having 3 separate shavers with this one.  All the attachments work great and best of all, the battery lasts forever.  Honestly, the first one of these I bought months ago and still have not had to charge it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Orders from China，Transported back. Very fond of friends，Very convenient to give her baby Barber. Very good shopping experience.Good, good,good,good ,good!</li>
    <li> Good Function! Good Brand! I realy love it very much! Moreover, it&#x27;s very very cheap! unbelievable！Only 10$! haha Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I had this for about year .. I liked if for a while, but it didn&#x27;t take too long for it to show its flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades dull fast, leaving a choppy looking cut.  The unit has to be at full charge to run, which takes 10 hours.  You cannot plug it in to have it operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are a nice feature, but aren&#x27;t all that useful. The unit is made so cheaply that while trying to adjust the cutting length, the cutting head separates from the unit... It snaps back on, but still is more aggravating than it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is egg-shell delicate. One short fumble into the sink and the main blade guard splintered into several pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid less than the price here, and I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is the second of this model I&#x27;ve owned. Works pretty well on trimming my beard and mustache and has a fairly good nose hair attachment too. Like I said, there are probably better trimmers but this is good for the price.</li>
    <li> This item went on sale and is really easy and nice to use. Quite compact too so it would be easy to bring on a trip.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my husbands old one that died.  It&#x27;s practical and works great.  The battery keeps its charge.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thus far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Norelco hair clippers. I particularly like that it is small and cordless.</li>
    <li> With all the attachments, the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable but not connected to the charger, and that it&#x27;s a shaver my boyfriend actually USES, definitely 5 stars. Under 15 bucks and you&#x27;ve got everything you need to manscape.</li>
    <li> Only problems with this are ... almost everything.&lt;br /&gt;- There are actually a confusing number of options and sometimes figuring out which parts go together takes way longer than it should.&lt;br /&gt;- There are two head sizes and a guide that fits over each one that controls the length you are cutting too. Unfortunately, in almost all cases, there don&#x27;t seem to be detents for the settings; the guides just slide.  So if you put a little pressure on, you all of a sudden are cutting your beard a lot shorter than you intended.&lt;br /&gt;- Got one nasty cut from a bare blade (well, not bare but without any extra guard; the normal way you&#x27;d use it to shave your head).&lt;br /&gt;- All of the attachments feel cheap and I don&#x27;t expect them to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really sorry I spent money on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never thought I had sensitive skin, but this trimmer makes me reconsider that thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happy with other Norelco trimmers, but I usually replace them after a year.  I decided to try this one, and guess I should have stuck with something a little more expensive.  I&#x27;m returning the trimmer; I&#x27;m assuming Amazon just throws these away when returned (I hope).</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It contains everything you need for grooming and has a long lasting charge. It also comes with a bag to keep everything together.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. We replaced a conair. So far he hasnt said anything bad about it so I am happy.</li>
    <li> Beware this item is useless in my  opinion. Too small for hair clipping. Shaver doesnt cut. Do not buy. Too many parts for nothing.</li>
    <li> I liked everything about the product except the shaver it was pointless it didnt work properly but everything else was exceptional</li>
    <li> I actually bought a second one of these trimmers to keep as a backup in case my first one breaks. It&#x27;s a great trimmer and works better than any other I&#x27;ve owned, including profession clippers. My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. It&#x27;s either you&#x27;re shaving with it, or you&#x27;re charging it, no mixing of both worlds. My advice is charge it for about 4-5 hours after every use, because the trimmer gets weaker the lower the battery power gets and it won&#x27;t shave as well. Excellent trimmer overall.</li>
    <li> I have waxed for years, but it is time-consuming to do at home and expensive at a salon (I&#x27;m also an esthetician, so I don&#x27;t like paying for it when I can do it myself- a pretty literal case of \\&quot;Who shaves the barber?\\&quot;).  I usually shave with a regular blade, but that can also be time-consuming, especially if you have not been maintaining your garden.  Personally, being hair-free is not really on the top of my list of things to do when I am single and not ready to mingle! I purchased this groomer to trim the lilac bush to a decent length before finishing off with a blade. I looked at some of the pricier models that are especially for body grooming, but for $12.99, this seemed to be able to perform exactly the function I needed- to trim the hair without mangling the fancy china.  The biggest selling point for me was that the attachments, even the main trimmer attachment, can be removed and rinsed off.  I do not have the patience to be cleaning up little hairs with that teeny brush, so this feature scores major points with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the Box:  I truly despise the plastic shrink-wrapping packing that is so ubiquitous these days, but I managed to open it without breaking into a full-on sweat. I appreciate the small, nylon bag that is provided to store the attachments, but it would be great if this came in box that could be used to organize and store it between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic body is lightweight but sturdy and the seams are clean and smooth. For my purposes, the size and weight is perfect.  A rubberized coating would be an improvement on the buttons, as the on/off slides up and down and you need some grip, but there is a little notch that you can grab with your fingernail. The buttons are also shallow, so there is no threat of breaking them off.  The two comb attachments might be considered a bit on the flimsy side, but they should hold up fine because pressure is unnecessary while using them. The rest of the attachments feel very solid and theyall slide on and off and lock into place smoothly.  If you are using one of the comb attachments, it is easier to first slide it onto the trimmer attachment and adjust the height before you attach to the unit.  I tested all of the attachments except the beard/mustache comb, but I may try it next time, as the manual says that its lowest setting (1) is 2mm, compared to 4mm on the clipper attachment and I am looking to get the closest trim I can.  There are two charts showing the length of the settings in the manual [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the unit right from the box and it was surprisingly quiet. I used the clipper comb at setting 1 and mowed the lawn in seconds.  I did not have any tugging or pulling on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tested the trimmer without the comb attachment and it worked well and trimmed down to a stubble. It&#x27;s very important to pull the skin taught and not put any pressure on it whatsoever. I can&#x27;t stress this enough because you will get nicks and cuts if you press down at all, especially in fleshier areas.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that anyone trim without the guard unless you are an experienced shaver and/or take a lot of care while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the precision trimmer, which is a smaller version of the standard trimmer head and went in for some detail work.  Owwie Wowwie!  Totally my bad for going in so willy-nilly, but I found out the hard way that it is not only smaller in size, but the teeth are much shorter too. I will not be trying this again on the lower deck and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone else either. Since it is so close and precise, it is a nice attachment for guys cleaning up their sideburns, goatees or more complicated facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any visible nose or ear hairs, but I tested the attachment anyway.  I put it into my nostril a few mms and swirled it around. I have no results to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I attached the mini-shaver and used it on the peach fuzz on my upper lip (of my face!) :)  I have fine, blonde hair and it is hardly noticeable, but the shaver did not remove the hair. I re-attached the trimmer and went over it first, then the shaver worked great.  The hair needs to be barely there and sticking straight up or it will not go into the tiny holes in the foil.  I used a small circular motion and the hair disappeared quickly.  I&#x27;m sure this would work well on the bikini area after a close trim, but it is so small that it would take forever- perfect for the face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time spent: less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total stars: 5 -I am sure there are better trimmers in existence, but the low price, the variety of attachments, and the convenience of cleaning make this a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total euphemisms for the vagina/pubic hair used in review- 7</li>
    <li> Husband bought these for trimming his facial hair.  The different attachments are practical and pretty precise.  We even used them once to touchup his haircut.  Charge seems to hold well.  For the price, these works very well.</li>
    <li> Good shave, you can clean easily all parts.&lt;br /&gt;Not for body hair trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is enough for many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Nice!!!</li>
    <li> So why the 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one about 6 months ago after being impressed with the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about 2 months ago the motor would just not work every now and then. So I put it on recharge and then removed the clipper thingy, rotated the motor rod - which basically is the one that causes the blades to vibrate back and forth- and then it worked. And then after sometime it got completely stuck and i could not even hear the motor sound, so I had to clean the head - pull out the vibrator thingy and clean the whole thing as some hair has gotten into it!!&lt;br /&gt;And then for the last 1 month or so it seems to be working fine.&lt;br /&gt;As far the blades are concerned they are decently sharp and get the trimming work done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you basically get what you pay for. Before this one I had the remington trimmer which was probably the same price or maybe 10 bucks more, and it worked good for about 2 yrs until it totally shut of one day all of a sudden. So next time probably I will go back to remington as this one does not seem to be that sturdy.</li>
    <li> After close to two months using the device I can say that everything is working perfectly. The battery life is excellent, to the point that today, after almost two months of usage I turn it on at let it discharge itself just to see how much juice it still hold in it, and it went on for more than 15 minutes before it ran out. If you want a cheap, good Grooming System, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Great. Please stop making me write reviews. Please. It sucks. I buy a lot of stuff. Isn&#x27;t that enough? ...</li>
    <li> I use this on a constant basis. It comes with a bunch of attachments and I find them very useful. My only complaint is that it is not waterproof.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to use on my arm hair, chest, and face. It had high reviews on amazon and was priced very fairly. Once the item arrived I unpacked it and tested it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strong,sharp,and precise. My biggest complaint is that there are no good heads for facial hair. The heads are decided more for body hair and head hair. If you want nice clean lines this will work but only if you&#x27;re looking at doing a 0 or .5.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.. My son just starting learning how to shave on his own, I have always done it for him and this razor makes it easy for him to do it by himself... Great for all men shaving, but also great for a beginner.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I wanted it to be: cheap, effective, easy to use. The different tops are easy to change and clean. It even came fully charged! I could not be happier with this purchase, especially for the low price.</li>
    <li> An excellent product that performs to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> use it for trimming my beard on a regular basis.  tried a competitive product recently that nearly pulled my beard out rather than cutting it.</li>
    <li> These are overpriced for the quality, it feels like it is made out of very cheap parts would not buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this one after another model of a Norelco grooming system that I had finally gave out after ten years. This one is as every bit of good from what I can tell so far. It has many attachments that allow you to groom beard, mustache, sideburns, trim your hair, nose hair, ear hair or any other hair you may have growing anywhere on your body! Looks like I may be set for another ten years if this one is anything like the last Norelco I owned.</li>
    <li> i use this every other day so far no complaints besides the battery life.. could be better next time around.</li>
    <li> My last trimmer lasted 15 years. This one is lighter, uses a recharger instead of batteries and has a bunch of trimmer heads I will never use. But the price was right and service prompt.</li>
    <li> The shaver and all of the attachments works well, and I like the result of how smooth my face is after using it.  It is hard to find good reputable products, but Norelco is always top notch.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good grooming kit.  Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Holds a charge for ever!</li>
    <li> Terrible battery life</li>
    <li> Great product. Effective, does not scratch the face, light  and easy to handle. The price is very convenient and I do like the extra heads it comes with.</li>
    <li> Norelco doesn&#x27;t put out the quality that it used to.  After using this today for only the 4th time, the motor died out while in the middle of trimming my husband&#x27;s hair.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product at all. I expected to get at least a year out of it while that is the absolute minimum and it is only 6 months old.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool for such a low price. Have ordered another.  Cut my son&#x27;s hair, trimmed up his sideburns and just loved the cord free ability.  Saw it in a store for $20....so Amazon price is terrific.  We will see how durable it is but for now I am happy :)</li>
    <li> At this point with so many reviews of this trimmer there is not really much I can add that will be too helpful I&#x27;m afraid.  Suffice it to say that this is a very well priced shaver/trimmer that has all the attachments one could want for everything from trimming hair, to that of your nose and ears as well.  It&#x27;s small, easy to hold and handle, and shaped in such a way that makes even doing ones back of the neck easy.  It charges up quickly and lasts long enough to do several trimming jobs before you need to plug it in again.  About the only couple of things I can say I don&#x27;t like about this trimmer is there is no stand that comes with it for storing it upright in between charges. (but they do give you a little nylon bag to store all the attachments in). That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, save for the fact that the trimmers bottom is very small and it tips over easily when you just set it down upright.  It would have been nice if they either offered a little stand to store it in, or made the base of the unit a little bigger for stability.  The other is a minor irritant, but one that I am sure many will well identify with.  The instruction booklet is not a booklet at all but one of those big thin fold out papers like the the old road maps.  Its in 40 languages like everything is these days and its very difficult to read it when all spread out and follow it in English or any other language.  And trust me, you should read the instructions on this before just trying it out.  It helps with getting used to how the different heads attach and are most efficient.  All in all however despite these two minor issues this is a very reasonably priced trimmer that will do the job nicely for most of us, and I recommend it...</li>
    <li> My husband likes this grooming set well enough.  His nose hair trimmer piece doesn&#x27;t work, but for the price you really can&#x27;t expect them all to work.  It&#x27;s a good value, but don&#x27;t buy it for the attachments.</li>
    <li> This was fantastic works very well and we have no complaints I would definitely buy it again and I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I already own this item for 4 year now and i had no trouble. Recently ordered one for my dad and he is happy with it. The battery doesn&#x27;t last long as it used to, but it has been 4 years, can&#x27;t really complain about it. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> The only reason I purchased this is that I broke the main comb attachment on a G270 that I&#x27;ve had for about eight years (it&#x27;s still going strong!).  It&#x27;s nearly as expensive to replace the attachment as it is to get a whole new kit.  I&#x27;ve bought two other trimmers over the years that seemed to have a more rugged and professional look to them, but they couldn&#x27;t begin to compare with this one.  I trim my beard one to two times a week, and it&#x27;s a quick, accurate and effortless process.  Not only is this the best for the money -- it&#x27;s just the best!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the identical version that I previously owned for 18 years! I usually keep a beard and use it for trimming. This new version has electric razor attachments that are decent at keeping the smooth parts of my face fairly smooth, saving me money on razor blades. Also, perhaps because I only use it to trim, it keeps a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that when I bought my replacement in March 2012, it was $15, so seeing it at $70 makes me cringe. I think the product is great for $15, but there&#x27;s no way I would have paid $70. I agree with other comments that the little &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; used in the length adjuster for the trimmer could be better -- they can fall out if you tap the thing to shake hair out of it, so watch out for that. So far, I&#x27;ve been able to put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a very good product. I just don&#x27;t think I would buy any grooming system for $70 unless it was made of stainless steel.</li>
    <li> I got this and my only disapointment was that the thing that sold me was that the most helpful rated review said it came with a charging stgand and attachment holder.  Well I know they make a model that has a hard plastic stand that holds everything shown.  But this product does not have a recharge stand nor attachment holding stand!  If you look at the pic you can tell there is no room in the package for such a stand that holds it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the trimmer itself is worth the pricing, just not as much had it had a stand to neatly hold everything so it all doesnt get lost or misplaced.</li>
    <li> excellent cost to value ratio.  Had one of these for 5 years before it died, and then bought another, and look forward to buying again in 4 years when it dies.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  easy to use.  cleaning is simple.  all in one charging and hold all parts in one tray</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 6 months or so.  Still works great, even after a few drops.  It isn&#x27;t quite medium or heavy duty, but it gets the job done if all you&#x27;re doing is cleaning up edges.  I don&#x27;t use all the attachments, but the guard and ear trimmer are both very handy as is the side burn trimmer.</li>
    <li> I recieve this item this day .and the problem is it can&#x27;t turn on while charging that&#x27;s the problem anyways the item&#x27;s cheaply made abviously of the price . Well that&#x27;s why I gave 3 star of this product .</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Schick quattro  because it had a small beard trimmer and was waterproof. It had some great reviews and it seemed like a good product for what it was but I noticed the teeth in the trimmer seemed too tight allow some of my beard hair to trim down to a decent height. This Philips Norelco G370 unit has plenty of space between the teeth to allow my hair to enter and make contact with the cutting blades. The other attachments help make this a fine tuning grooming machine. The mesh micro screen attachment is a little on the small side and resembles a tiny braun razor head. It does cut the stubble and works for small areas but it takes so long for my neck that I tend to use my regular full sized razor instead. So far the battery charge has lasted a long time and it looks simple enough that when it does finally die I think I will be able to replace it with some other solder tabbed rechargeable batteries and a little bench time.</li>
    <li> I hate paying for haircuts. I always feel like I&#x27;m spending money for something I&#x27;m never completely satisfied with, and it&#x27;s something that over the last few years I have learned to do myself (it&#x27;s a pretty simple, short haircut). But I hated how long it was taking me with scissors, so I was in Walmart last week comparing a few different electric clippers. I went on my amazon app, and this was one of them. I thought for sure the $50 model would get better reviews than this little $20 Norelco, but I was surprised that the more expensive one got only 1.5 starts, while this one was 4+ stars! So I figured, what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to read the directions (very glad I did or I would have cut WAY too short). I used the hair clipper attachment, set it to #9 on top and #7 on sides, going over it several times to make sure it was evenly trimmed, and it worked perfectly! And it took me only a third the time it normally takes me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have shaving bumps and sensitive skin on my neck, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to utilize the other attachments as much, but the bottom line is this shaver works like a champ. This is a STEAL at $15-$20!</li>
    <li> The groomer itself works well, holds a charge for quite awhile and is quite compact. Unfortunately, the charger stopped working after two charges. Since I didn&#x27;t use it that much I got about 2 months out of it. Not a great investment.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best grooming systems that I have ever gotten anyone. He truly liked it and will order again if it&#x27;s ever needed.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for my husband.  He uses it for his head, beard and mustache.  It seems to be a good buy.</li>
    <li> very good with all different types of instruments given for proper use.. Actually i love philips products to buy and qualitative for that price</li>
    <li> Excellent buy for the money. I already had a complete set in a stand that I paid 3 times the money for. This just gave me more sharp heads that fit on both motor units.</li>
    <li> My hair clipper comb attachment broke on my old one because my friend didn&#x27;t know how to adjust it. I was searching online for a replacement comb and they were $13+. I came across this one for $20 so I bought it and it works great.</li>
    <li> The first trimmer I purchased worked on for about 10 minutes after a full charge. I charged it again, but only got about 30 seconds worth of manly, trimming action out of the thing before it rapidly ran out of charge. I recharged it, but alas: it died within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the savvy (READ: cheap) consumer that I am, I returned the piece and waited for a replacement. Again, it worked for about ten minutes. Unlike my first trimmer, however, this one wouldn&#x27;t even turn on after the next charge. I&#x27;m not trimming bushes or a Grizzly Adams beard or anything, either; this was all simple trimming work on my neck and around my ears. I liked the size and cordlessnessitude of this beast, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t expect much for $15, but a functioning item is certainly falls in the realm of what I hope to get when I pay for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since moved onto a similarly-priced trimmer from a competing company that works perfectly. This is basically a one-time-only trimmer for $15, so buy away if you enjoy randomly throwing your money away.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s gift. He really loves it. Really good quality stuff. It replaced one other brand which is a little cheaper one.</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer is okay, it is not very strong and it is of low quality.  I recommend you spend an extra $10 and get the remmington, it is stronger</li>
    <li> Mini Foil Shaver.Does not work,Where to buy new,</li>
    <li> Very handy for all trimming, holds charge, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father, he loves it.  Easy to use and maintain</li>
    <li> I would just like to say this is a great product it cuts all the hairs without any problems whatsoever, it trims my mustache and it even clips my nose hair.  Wonderful product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great pick up, it comes with multiple attchements for small jobs but holds a charge right out of the package for several weeks. This is my second one only because the guard broke on my first one and the replacement was only $5 cheaper than buying a new one here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to cut my fiance&#x27;s hair and trim his beard 4 times now. It&#x27;s not expensive and for me it was worth the money. No complaints at all and would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging. I thought it was broken for a minute but you need to charge it while you are NOT using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl I had for 15 years but there was no comparison. The trim guides on the Norelco must be their own system because the \\&quot;1\\&quot; setting is about 3/4 of an inch but should be about 2mm so accurate trimming with this product is impossible - a total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this grooming kit from Philip for getting rid of unwanted facial and body hair which I don&#x27;t want to shave. So far the product has not disappointed and works really well. Although I wish that it could clip hair more closely but I don&#x27;t have any complaints for now.&lt;br /&gt;The heads are pretty easy to change and the variety of attachments is very welcome. Definitely a good buy for the price being offered.</li>
    <li> I purchased to trim hair on chest and stomach. I considered buying a more expensive trimmer, but I&#x27;m glad I opted for this one. It does everything I need and at a fraction of the cost. Very Pleased.</li>
    <li> One of the best grooming sets that you can buy at this ridiculously low price. I bought a second one for a friend, as I am so satisfied with mine.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this exact product 3 or 4 years ago for my boyfriend and we recently lost the charger so I went ahead and purchased it again. My boyfriend keeps a full beard at all times except maybe once a year he&#x27;ll completely shave it off and then let it grow back right away but he likes to change how long the beard is regularly and this gives him the freedom to do that. We only used it to cut his hair once but it worked well for just a basic men&#x27;s fade haircut.</li>
    <li> I have bought several grooming tool in the past two year, this one is the best one! Stable and lasts long. I love it!</li>
    <li> A great product and a must have in any men&#x27;s wardrobe. Philips is surely a master in the grooming products ..</li>
    <li> Good product for the price, resistant, have a good battery life and it keeps charge for long periods.&lt;br /&gt;To give the final shaving, (if used in the face) it might take some time, as the finishing head is small (close to 3/4&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Best used as a trimmer but if u look for a fine finish it works as well in small areas(if u want to save time).</li>
    <li> works great, great value and charge lasts long as well, Thank you</li>
    <li> Why am i seeing a $199.90 price tag on  $15 G370 trimmer? This has got to be some sort of mistake and I hope Amazon.com starts cleaning up a bit. The groomer is great, I&#x27;ve owned one for 4 years but I payed nothing close to this tag. Crazy!</li>
    <li> This is my second one, the first stopped holding a charge about four years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers on this are great.  I shave my head, but sometimes let my hair grow out for a few weeks.  When that happens, I use this guy to cut my hair back down to my scalp for easy shaving.  Works perfectly.  Powerful motor, holds a charge for a long time, and my first unit even survived a dunk in the toilet once.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to let my facial hair grow and I needed to keep it well groomed (I was previously clean shaven).  I have been using this grooming system every day for quite a while, and I am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable battery lasts pretty long.  I have not allowed to battery to wind down completely, so I can&#x27;t say the length of time the battery actually lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with plenty of attachments.  I have used most of them and I have had no problems with them.  The attachments just click onto the shaver and hold fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any problems with this system at all.  This grooming system is certainly not a piece of junk.  I think it can handle pretty much anything you can throw at it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this grooming system to anyone who needs to maintain their facial hair!</li>
    <li> It is a simple product! Nothing especial, but works really well.&lt;br /&gt;It was really what I wanted. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK I guess... I had a Remington that seemed to work better but I ended up looking for a different model as that one broke on me.</li>
    <li> I use it for simple things but Norelco is always doing a good job! this is my second one, the first I bought 8 years ago is still running but it needed to be replaced. I suggest to buy it! M.R. (aldentekitchen)</li>
    <li> Lots of different attachments, good battery life, makes nice clean cuts.  Good for beard or neck trimming, the nose trimmer seems a bit hokey.</li>
    <li> Bought this a year ago for my boyfriend at my uncles recommendation. Both regularly use them and seem happy. They look god to me after using it.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it!  Not as heavy duty as the older T-160 but it cost $25 or so.</li>
    <li> great tool for a low price. as i have a full beard this is a easy to handle tool and the nose hair/ ear hair attachment really gets those tight spots.</li>
    <li> I was a little worries about this clipper because the price is so low. There were a few ratings on here describing it as cheap and easily breakable, but in my experience I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made well, has any attachment you&#x27;d need, holds a charge for quite a while, easy to brush or blow clean and is just an all around amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a nice little clipper to keep in your bag and use here and there or even every day for yourself this is a great buy. I would highly recommend not paying more for the others and trying this one out first.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected, easy to use, and does what it is meant to do. Can&#x27;t say much for life expectancy, as barely got it today.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my teenage son and it came well packaged with directions. Easy to use by anyone. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money with this grooming system.  I recommend it.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Received on time, I just have difficulty in how to use for my goatee. I am not happy with the evenness of the beard.  Otherwise it seems just fine.</li>
    <li> first of all ...i live outside US so like many people from different countries, i had concerns whether it would work or not with 220V AC....?&lt;br /&gt;answer is  IT WILL NOT WORK ...so you will require a step down 220 to110v converter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it ...very cheap ,durable,versatile and does the job perfectly...i use for beard trimming,nose .&lt;br /&gt;somebody told me he used it for 4 yrs and still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended for anyone who has any Hair on the body !</li>
    <li> It has everything I need and is perfect.  The storage bag is key, and is much better than the counter-top storage trays which have to stay out and when bumped everything falls off the tray. This can get thrown into the closet/drawer and forgotten about until needed again, although I do find myself dumping the entire contents into the empty bathroom sink every time I need to find something, which requires a little hair clean-up from the sink when done.  Battery seems like it will last forever as using this a few minutes every couple of days just with the factory charged seemed to last for weeks?  I bought a $50 trimmer and upon seeing this ordered it instead and it is much better!  The possibilities are endless with it.  Also when trimming my beard or goatee it is important to know that whatever size you set this to, it stays put!  I am rough with a trimmer on my face and always worry the size will drop down and cut all my hair off accidentally. This stays put with a decent amount of pressure!</li>
    <li> I mean for 13 bucks I can hardly complain, but the last norelco trimmer I had that was similar to this did the same thing but without all the neck irritation. To be fair, I&#x27;ve only used the smaller head trimmer, but still, it kind of bummed me out. On a positive note, buying this made me realize that it was worth the extra money to get an electric shaver. Just ordered the panasonic la-93-k and I&#x27;m excited to see how that works. Overall, the product is alright, and for the money, I&#x27;m not disappointed that I made this purchase, though I can hardly say that I&#x27;m happy with it either.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after his old one broke. You cannot beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;He really likes the standard trimmer, as well as the nose trimmer. He does not use many of the attachments, but I&#x27;ve started using the hair attachments for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer holds charge pretty well and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> defect: cannot use while charging, time for recharge lasts too long and it can only hold for two times usage, blade head is a little small and weak&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;others are normal</li>
    <li> As the old saying goes, \\&quot;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve owned two of these; to paraphrase a great philosopher, \\&quot;I won&#x27;t get fooled again.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On both units the head with adjustable trim lengths fell apart. Broke. The first time it happened I bought a new set. Not again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the replacement part is a nifty little revenue stream for Norelco. They can charge 66% of the entire kit&#x27;s price for one replacement trim head, so no incentive to change that design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of crummy design, I&#x27;m in complete agreement with those who say the nose hair trimmer is a joke. It&#x27;s weak and useless.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer once a week to trim my beard and my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this model for years and never had a problem.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, works just fine even after a few years. Was very cheap also, when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Checked the page recently, the price seems to have gone up by a lot the last time I checked..</li>
    <li> Gift for hubby.  Uses it a lot, it works well.</li>
    <li> these are good for travel and a semi close shave.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here other than it works well and reliably!</li>
    <li> Does the Job, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Awesome, loved it, it was great, I hate writing these.  It&#x27;s just great, why do I need a minimum of a certain amount of words.</li>
    <li> What a shame, I had a Norleco in the past, I was happy with it because when the battery was dead, you just plug it into the AC outlet, and the motor gets its juice from the wall... For this one, it was not clear from the description, I kind of naively thought that a newer model would be better, to find out it doesn&#x27;t: If it&#x27;s dead you got to plug it into the AC outlet and wait one hour to charge.&lt;br /&gt;I am an electrical engineer, and I know it takes only a couple of parts to make that happen... Easy, but I guess for the price, they needed to save those 25 cents of parts...</li>
    <li> What a good set. You cant do better for the price. It comes very well packaged, the devices are well made and work well.</li>
    <li> It perfectly does the desired job well done if used correctly, the only cons is that your not able to use it while charging which its why I didnt provide 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very good product with a lot of attachments. For the money I am extremely pleased. I would recommend for anyone not looking to spend a lot more money.</li>
    <li> I originally bought one of these 2 years ago. I loved it so much that I was upset when it stopped charging. For the price, I didn&#x27;t mind buying a 2nd one. Once I got it I tested the new charger with my old machined and it charged! Turns out the charger in these are probably not the best, but the machine is great!</li>
    <li> Has everything you&#x27;ll need to shave.  Works wonderfully, charge lasts a while, portable, all in all a great addition for anyone to have.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> The system overall is good. BUT, the nose/ear/eyebrow attachment doesn&#x27;t work too well on ear hair. I STILL get better results just by using my razor on my ear hair...albeit VERY CAREFULLY!! But it works fine on eyebrows and nose hair. The included instructions are lengthy and detailed which I LIKE.&lt;br /&gt;  But here&#x27;s the mess: once you read the instructions, you learn that you should NOT keep the device on power charge via an electric outlet. Seems that will only run down the battery!! Thus, you&#x27;re supposed to use this device until the battery runs down, and ONLY then plug it in to an outlet to re-charge the battery. Well....that is NUTS! We all know what&#x27;ll happen: the ONE time I&#x27;m in a hurry to get ready, with no time to spare, will be THE TIME the battery goes down. Instructions say re-charge can take 10-12 hours. That is NUTS.&lt;br /&gt;  This device is sorely in need of new/better batteries. I should be able to leave this thing on charge whenever I&#x27;m not using it so that WHEN I pick it up to use it the battery is always always fully charged. VERY poor planning on Norelco&#x27;s part.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy about this trimming system. It&#x27;s just a superb, solid and reliable basic system. We got one for our son. My own was supposed to be &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34; Not only did the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; system not compare, it died. I replaced it with this.</li>
    <li> Saw reviews complaining that this is made, largely, of plastic and is not as good quality as more expensive models.  Well, then capitalism seems to be working because I EXPECT a more expensive shaver to be of better quality.  I don&#x27;t buy a Taurus and complain it&#x27;s not a BMW!!  I have used this for a few months now and love the thing.  Yes, I&#x27;m very careful changing attachments because they are made of plastic, but once in place they do the job they are supposed to do.  I, primarily, use the beard trimmer which I find to be excellent.  The nose/ear hair trimmer is fine too.  Saw postings about pulling hair - have experienced NONE of that.  The foil shaver does not give a terribly close shave - not good enough for a primary shaver, but in a pinch will clean you up!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, there are $50 shavers out there that are worth $50.  This is a $14 shave that&#x27;s worth $30.</li>
    <li> Out of the package this shaver is great. It took me a couple tries to figure out how to attach the different heads but it was easier than I was trying to make it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pesonal grooming kit which is really good to have it does its job its a bargain exactly for the price totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I recently bought a [[ASIN:B003XU1BSY Wahl Groomsman]], which is a compact sized groomer, with a nice set of attachments and accessories.  One thing the Wahl didn&#x27;t have however, was a nostril hair trimmer, so when this Philips Norelco groomer went on sale for $10, I decided to get it, mostly because it does have a nostril hair trimmer.  I didn&#x27;t really need another grooming set, but paying only $10 for a nostril hair trimmer, didn&#x27;t seem that outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed, was that the Norelco motor makes a lot more noise, when compared to the Wahl, which makes a low humming sound.  The Norelco motor is raspy, and it sounds like there is a lot of friction.  Strangely, while the quieter Wahl comes with a bottle of machine oil, Norelco claims that their groomer requires no lubrication.  It&#x27;s not the most pleasant experience, sticking a noisy nostril trimmer into your nose, and it gets hot pretty fast, but it does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the nostril hair trimmer, the Norelco has attachment heads for a hair clipper, a precision clipper, and a mini-shaver, with clip on combs for hair, moustaches, and beards.  These seem a bit oversized, but work pretty well, although the spacing between the comb teeth is rather wide.  While Norelco provides 2 comb attachments and a carrying pouch, the Wahl set comes with 7 assorted combs, and a zippered bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At only about 0.6\\&quot; wide, the mini-shaver is quite small.  It works well enough, but again it&#x27;s rather noisy.  The fit of some of the attachments isn&#x27;t that secure.  A little too much pressure in a certain direction, and the mini-shaver, or nostril trimmer pop off.  Putting the release button immediately above the power switch, where it can accidentally be pressed, isn&#x27;t a smart decision, and is another indication that workmanship and attention to detail, is just a little lacking.  The Norelco is decent grooming tool, but it&#x27;s a bit rough around the edges.  Having used both products, I prefer the Wahl Groomsman, but many don&#x27;t happen to agree, as the Norelco is a top seller at Amazon.  My cost of only $10, is a major factor in my 4 star rating.e Wahl Groomsman, but many don&#x27;t happen to agree, as the Norelco is a top seller at Amazon.  My cost of only $10, is a major factor in my 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> is a product of excellent quality and very good price. I&#x27;m fascinated with the acquisition, efeito my child&#x27;s hair very well!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive beard trimmer with good reviews for my husband; this one is just what I was looking for! You can definitely tell it isn&#x27;t great quality but at this price, if we have to replace it in a year we can do that. Gets the job done and would purchase again</li>
    <li> Trims, cuts, and shaves everything I need it to for such a small price.  Even takes care of the hair down there...</li>
    <li> Good quality, wireless and portable.&lt;br /&gt;Only one option is missing (for me), it cannot operate in euro - A.C.  220 volts standard.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean up the stubble (I don&#x27;t shave with a blade since my skin is so sensitive) on my neck and cheeks.  I also use it to trim my beard and sculpt it.  Works great since it&#x27;s so small and I can be precise.  I&#x27;ve not had the battery issue like some folks.  I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and I clean up about once a week for 5-10 minutes, depending, and I&#x27;ve not charged it since the initial charge when I bought it.  It still has plenty of &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; when I turn it on to use it.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t do better if all you need is something to do some cleanup or sculpting (which isn&#x27;t hard use on the clippers since you&#x27;re mostly grazing away at your beard)</li>
    <li> Got this for my teenage son who needs to shave his peach fuzz. The screen shaver does not work at all so it is useless for him. I tried it on my arm with the screen shaver and very little hair was removed. With no attachments it does remove hair but it hurts. Instead of shaving hairs off quickly, you can feel tugs on the hairs as they are caught in the blades. The blades must not be sharp enough.  I chose this shaver over other choices because of the name; I expected much better quality from Norelco. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There are much better shavers/groomers on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I have of the same model. It&#x27;d great for its price, specially for my travel kit.</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it to between barber visits. Holds a charge for quite a while. The beard trimmer guard is a little short in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap trimmer as this to trim mustache and beard and this served the purpose very well.The attachments are easy to handle and it will give a neat trimmed look if used properly.If you want a cheap and good  trimmer, go for it.</li>
    <li> I needed a razor for my first beard and this has worked perfectly. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the different attachments and playing around with the length settings. The battery has a good life.</li>
    <li> I was, and decided to get serious with a rechargeable groomer so I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groomer works great for basic trimming and grooming needs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer appears sturdy and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased - can&#x27;t imagine a better experience!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. It worked fine....until the 4th time it was used! There is a tiny bit of plastic on the guard (the piece that adjusts to give you the right trim height) that slides into the main unit to secure it in place. It broke off! Now the guard doesn&#x27;t stay on. Needless to say this happened a couple of days after my return period expired, grrrrr. I&#x27;m a bit surprised and annoyed that such a critical piece is cheap plastic rather than metal. I&#x27;d send it back if I could, but I wouldn&#x27;t want a replacement since this is a total design flaw.</li>
    <li> I like maintaining a one or two day growth look.  This is very helpful at a very reasonable price using the 9 different lengths you can choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a little bag to store accessories and charger.  Very much appreciate that as there are quite a few pieces.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the trimmer much, maybe 2 or 3 times per month.  The trimmer holds the charge for a long time and isn&#x27;t out of charge when I go to use it.  When I use the trimmer, I use it for short periods (1-2 min) or long periods (about 15-20 min).  The trimmer has not run out of charge during any of my trimming sessions.</li>
    <li> I used to chase my cat with them all the time. Until I woke up with him standing over me with a straight razor in his paw and malice in his eyes. He stuffed a hastily scrawled note in my mouth and disappeared. It said &amp;#34;learn to shave hippie&amp;#34;. So I did. But these were great until I finally did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month, generally those do not last long, but so far so good, will see how long it lasts for.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical of its promise but being on a budget like everyone else, I thought I needed to take a chance. Best purchase I ever made. This works for all areas of my face &amp; body. In today&#x27;s world, that&#x27;s important. I&#x27;m happy that I have an all-in-one tool. Works for haircuts, trimming &amp; grooming facial &amp; hair in other body areas. So convenient, easy to use.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;As advertised! Works great and does what it is supposed to do. Cons: the razor attachment does not work very well and the carry/storage bag sheds threads every time I pull it out. Pros: all the trimming attachments work EXCELLENTLY! Long battery life. I have not had to charge it yet except for the initial charge and have had it about a month. Very good price which was less than $20&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> While the components are more in number, actual usage is little less and hence felt that the pricing is more.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using beard trimmers to cut his head hair for many years and has gone though a few of them. The best one was an old Norelco which you could use off of AC power or on battery power. Unfortunately, someone stole it from him and I hope they enjoyed it because he would not only trim his head hair with said product. Next was this one which lasted quite a few years but just recently stopped holding a charge. Since you can not operate product plugged in it was rendered useless and this new purchase for the exact model is replacing it. He likes the fade ranges and ease of use selecting a trim height. Sometimes your finger could accidently release the trimmer head from the body which is inconvenient. From a quality perspective it doesnt last too long, he is just replacing it because it is familiar to him and he is used to it but do not expect to get 10 years out of this because once the battery goes it is useless. But for 14 bucks the amount of money you save not getting haircuts or getting waxed makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of beard trimmers, and I fell for the low price of this one.  That was a mistake.  Like I always say, \\&quot;Buy Right, Buy Once, Buy Wrong, Buy Twice.\\&quot;    This thing is poorly made, the attachments feel sort of loose when clicked in place, and some of them come off while you&#x27;re using the trimmer.      It will nick you if you aren&#x27;t careful, and the recharge stand is BIG, which takes up a lot of space.  The attachments fit loosely in the stand, which means that every time you brush them with a towel or your hand, or a power cord, they fall out of the stand, which is irritating.    The plastic is cheap as hell.  The trimmer does a good job of trimming, in general, but you&#x27;ll definitely have the feeling that you&#x27;re using a piece of junk.    The charging base gets full of hair clippings, which isn&#x27;t great, and the plastic on the base is about as cheap as can be.      Can&#x27;t anyone make quality products anymore?  What I really wanted was a BRAUN beard trimmer, but they apparently don&#x27;t make the damn thing anymore!  BRAUN makes GOOD stuff...</li>
    <li> This model is one that, fortunately, Philips has chosen not to change because this model works great the way that it is!  If you treat it with care (I&#x27;ve dropped a few and that&#x27;s an immediate action for the garbage can) if you use the model&#x27;s number features to cut hair at different levels, i.e., 1, 2, 3 - 10, I believe is the max setting.  Should you drop it, this plastic trimming head will fall to pieces and your left with a razor that only cuts without any type of guard or trimmer, which I use to shave my head, for example.  Because I use it several times/week, I find that each one of these ~$20 models needs to be replaced every 12-18 months.  This still seems like a good product to me since I&#x27;m saving all of that money getting my head shaved professionally.  Sure, in an ideal world Philips would create a stronger guide/trimmer to prevent people from cutting their hair at the wrong level, but then again, this is a trimmer that&#x27;s not designed to, in my opinion, shave one&#x27;s head with any level of precision so if you use this with the guard on for shaving heads of hair with any kind of cutting style (short on sides, longer on top) then I&#x27;d suggest purchasing a more professional model instead of this trimmer.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Multiple attachments, easy to remove and even rechargeable is a definite extra star for me. Quality feels a little cheap, but hey what can you ask for when it costs 23 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again, and have because I lost my old one when I moved.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model.  I lost the charger that came with the original, so got this updated model.  I had the other one for over 4 years and was very happy it.  This works just as well with a few extra features.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Works fine. My husband uses the nose trimmer as well.  Seems to hold the charge well.  Sure has saved us on haircuts.</li>
    <li> I charged it up once and a month later its still going strong. Its not great but worth the price</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap and I use it a lot, I really like having this, to shave or cut my hair anytime.</li>
    <li> Got here fast, no hassle, and exactly what was shown. Everything went smoothly, and over all great experience. Recommend to anyone needing a trimmer.</li>
    <li> bought it in March, received it in March. So,&lt;br /&gt;- March: can work for about 10 mins or so after a full charge (overnight charge)&lt;br /&gt;- April: can work for about 5 mins after a full charge, will not hold the charge if I left it there for couple days&lt;br /&gt;- May: completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NICE PRODUCT! worst ever I have ever used, lost faith in Philips, at least it just cost me $10</li>
    <li> I was a good buy and works well.</li>
    <li> This was my second time to buy a Norelco G370. The first one was probably 7-10 years ago. The unit still works but one of the grooming comb heads broke. I love it.</li>
    <li> The battery on this dies very quickly. You have to charge it in advance to use it, otherwise it&#x27;ll die while in use, even if it&#x27;s plugged in. If that weren&#x27;t a problem, the set is otherwise comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> battery holds charge and recharges quickly. i think it is a great value for costs and works for my limited use</li>
    <li> This product has a long battery life, and has continued to work great for me, in shaving and in touching up the neck line after haircuts.</li>
    <li> WOW, That price is a BIG JOKE!!! Bought this one 2 years ago on Amazon for $15.16 and now it is $180?! Can I sell my used set back for $50?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still working perfectly. One 8-hour charge last you roughly 2 months (I shave twice a week one is trimming and the other is clean shave, about 3-5 mins shave). Love the Mini Foil Shaver since it get the job done and can be open in 2 parts so you can definitely clean it easily. The trimmer did the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About travelling, just charge it before you go, unless you are going for a long trip. No indication that the battery is full is a small minus but I just left it the night before and can be sure I don&#x27;t have to charge it again for another 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used either of the comb so I have no comments on those&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great set that can be comparable to other expensive Norelco shaver BUT the price here is certainly OUTRAGEOUS. You should not pay more than $30 for this.</li>
    <li> This electronic trimmer is a very good product from Philips. I have been using this for almost 1.5 years now and no problems what so ever. I have bought 2 of these for my friends when I went home for a vacation, they loved it. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair,cheaply made,hard to clean,attachments broke after first use,uneven cut,hair attachment broke loose while cutting hair,horrible product will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. Like it so much, I bought some for gifts</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem as cheap and flimsy as some of the reviews had me worried it would be.&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer works well. 9 length settings is a good feature.&lt;br /&gt;- Nose trimmer is a nice little thing to have, tickles though.&lt;br /&gt;- Mini shaver gets closer than my 3-head rotary shaver and is good for touching up after using the other one.&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a charge well so far.&lt;br /&gt;- Pouch to keep everything in.&lt;br /&gt;- Attachments clean easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Mini shaver takes a while to cover a large area, and you need to get the hair pretty short first for it to work. But that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a mini shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- Probably wont last as long as a more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in constantly, that&#x27;s bad for the battery.&lt;br /&gt;- Keep the attachments clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t try hair clipping.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m a sensitive guy and have not experienced any discomfort/hair pulling from this product. Well unless you count the nose trimmer tickling.</li>
    <li> Really holds a charge. gets into those tight places without nicking ya.</li>
    <li> Been well over a year and still running great! Holds a charge for weeks!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! I have one already that is starting to wear out. I was very happy with it and have used the old one for about two years. This is the best razor I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> Works well, charges well and has every grooming tool a man could need.  I use it weekly for many different things and it works well no matter what function I need it for or what tool I am using.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how good this would be at 14 bucks, but I was pleasantly surprised with its quality. I used it to shave my head just a couple of days after receiving it, and it dominated my thick mane. Also good is it&#x27;s battery life; I rarely have to charge it (which wasn&#x27;t true of my last electric razor). The only negative is the head is kind of small so you have to clean it out a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase. The exchangeable heads/trimmers make it very easy to use and keep a decent-looking beard, with different lenghts and shapes; the battery lasts a lot and it&#x27;s powerful enough to trim even the thickest beards. The only thing I found cheap was the pouch -it tore out a bit within the first two weeks, but apart from that, I have no other complaints. I mean, for the price, it offers a lot more than many more expensive beard grooming kits. I seriosuly recommend it :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like I expect. Very good. Simple, complete and all range use. It has variety of accessories and everyone adjusts like description of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfies my expectations. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one I have purchased in 2 years. I totally still have the other one and still use it. The reasons I got another was- the first one worked so great and I have a larger family I need 2 to accommodate all of the guys in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the hair you can get rid of fast with this is nice. Like everyone else, I cut the guys hair in my family and the Hubby&#x27;s every 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t have to keep running to charge it that often either my Husband can get a few uses out of it before it needs another charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not \\&quot;Pull\\&quot; that often either (only if the hair is super thick or long) which is a major plus for me with the little kids, they don&#x27;t like to get their hair cut as it is. Why make it painful and scare them even more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then their is the attachments for the hair that makes it fairly easy for anyone to cut their own hair or cut the right lengths. I ONLY use it to cut hair I CANNOT vouch for the other attachments and their quality. But if your looking to cut hair and want something simple and cheap that&#x27;s going to last for awhile then get this.</li>
    <li> I have used the Philips Norelco All-in-1 Grooming System G370/60 for over a year now. I dropped the first one on a tile floor after 10 months and broke the head. I immediately bought a replacement because of the excellent functionality of the first one. It holds a charge, cuts many times before needing to be recharged, and charges appropriately fast - it also cuts well!. I most strongly recommend it with its several accessories.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good, i just hope if it can work with an adapter also, as some times there is no enough time to recharge</li>
    <li> I have used the grooming system just 3 times I think, but it seems to be alright considering its price. One of the brooming addons broke quite quickly, it is just cheap plastic. Considering its price, 3 stars \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot; seems to be the right rating for me.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe how well this works, especially for the price. It does a great job of beard trimming, and the shaver attachment works fairly well. Just remember to charge as it says in the instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for almost 40 years &amp; have had many beard trimmers, corded &amp; cordless. This is one of the easiest to use &amp; does at least as good as my sisters professional one. I could buy 10 of these for what she paid for one. These are great.</li>
    <li> Where can I buy just the parts for this I have like 4 of them and the one that cuts hair breaks everytime</li>
    <li> It is good for trimming and controlling a beard.  Wish it had a bigger shaving head, still using straight blades to shave stubble.</li>
    <li> works great, but its a little flimsy and lasted a 6 months. So i would by 2 per year.or maybe the one I received was a lemon</li>
    <li> It has so many uses I can&#x27;t imagine not being without it number one in my book good price to</li>
    <li> This is a great item. Paid for itself.  I save on haircuts cost big time. Can&#x27;t make a mistake trimming up my bald head. Set it and cut. Since the setting are on the clipper head you don&#x27;t have to fumble for different attachments.</li>
    <li> This is a best trimmer i have used so far. Less noice, easy to clean, and easy to handle. More over its battery operated.</li>
    <li> I charged this unit when I bought it&#x27;s still holding a solid charge, and operating at full speed, 3.5 months later even with regular light use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know eventually it will need to be recharged, but I&#x27;ve never got this sort of life out of a single charge on a trimmer before.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard and I am very pleased with it. The battery lasts a long time on a single charge and the attachments are very useful. I&#x27;ve had other beard trimmers before and this one is by far the best. Good enough that I am actually writing a review about a beard trimmer!</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t use it when is uncharged no matter if it&#x27;s plugged in. works great for face but not for my nose trees</li>
    <li> I use this to both trim my beard and cut my hair.  It works well for both, but seems to take forever to charge.  I&#x27;m a procrastinator and so I tend to put off trimming my beard and cutting my hair until the same time(or I used to.  At full charge, and being left plugged in the entire time I use it, it runs out of power about half way through cutting my hair if I have used it on my face before hand.  So you can&#x27;t really use it while it&#x27;s plugged up, it doesn&#x27;t draw power as fast as it uses it.  I have to leave it plugged up over night about before it&#x27;s usable.  But, other than the power issue it works great.</li>
    <li> perfect. i have been using it for almost a year and it is really handy and has many options to use.</li>
    <li> I use full size corded clippers to cut my hair and use this groomer to do the small touch up work. Sideburns, around the ear, and the back of the neck area, where the larger clippers are difficult for me to maneuver. This Norelco product is small and compact and allows me to do touch ups between haircuts which is about every three weeks. I suppose I may use it infrequently relative to other people as I have only charged it the initial time I received it in about ten months. I do not use it for facial hair.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace an old, battery operated Norelco trimmer. A friend recommended this trimmer to me. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in store, but found it easily on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two months, and it&#x27;s been fantastic. I don&#x27;t shave or trim my beard daily, but I use it frequently enough. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it twice, and one of those charges was when I took it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a trimmer that had multiple attachments, and this fit the bill. Multiple setting beard trimmer, multiple setting hair trimmer, large and precision trimmer, small foil shaver, even a nose hair trimmer. All of the attachments click into place easily and are removable. The beard trimmer trims quickly and evenly. The foil shaver works perfectly for small areas. I haven&#x27;t used the hair or nose trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this grooming kit, I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave often, but when I do I use this. Still beards are way cooler, but occasionally you may have a job interview or some event when you don&#x27;t want to look as grimy, so yeah. this.</li>
    <li> This set is a joke, looks like a toy set. No recommended. Buy something better $10 or $20 bucks more.</li>
    <li> This grooming kit works well. The price is right and fast shipping. It has your every need. Easy to change adapters. Also, no batteries. Its rechargeable, so that was a big plus. You can&#x27;t complain considering the cost. Comes with a travel bag. Buy it...my brother in law also got one.</li>
    <li> Great product that works really well! I bought a second one to trim my dog&#x27;s fur on his paws and rear.</li>
    <li> GRANDSON LOVED IT.  HE WAS HOME FROM OVERSEAS AND WILL TAKE IT BACK WITH HIM THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH</li>
    <li> In these days where products last for only few days, this electronic product sustains heavy usage of shaving and trimming for 4-5 years. However the comb is not not so effective.</li>
    <li> works great, attachments are easy to change.  This would not replace your every day razor, but is great for clippers and trims.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily as a beard trimmer and it suits that purpose well enough. It does not choke on my hair at all, and nothing gets caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the hair trimmer had higher settings. I use the hair trimmer comb (It includes a shorted beard comb which is not nearly long enough for me) on the highest setting for my beard. I use the detail trimmer to define the edges of my beard and the foil shaver to shave that down to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They claim 35 minutes of battery and I believe them because I have not encountered an issue with run time. Because it uses NiMH batteries, it does require charging before use if it has been sitting for a while, maybe even a couple of weeks. Because it includes a very simple trickle charge, it should not be left on the charger constantly, or the batteries will wear out prematurely and run times will get unusably short. Unlike other similar shavers, the charger shuts off while the shaver is running, so it cannot be used like a typical plug-in charger. The batteries are also not replaceable. For these reasons, the shaver has a limited lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings about even giving 4 stars for the above reasons, but if you go into it thinking you&#x27;ll have it for a couple of years and toss it and that it costs only $25, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good deal overall.</li>
    <li> I am on my second set of these trimmers. I&#x27;ve had it about 5 years. The only problem is the flimsy head/hair spacers break eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good set though. I use it to trim my beard, trim nose hair and trim my neck between haircuts. It works good for all of these. Just keep in mind not to use it roughly and it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is very good. I don&#x27;t have an outlet close to it so I have to charge it and unplug it to use it. A charge last a month or two with it unpluged.</li>
    <li> I purchased an all in 1 grooming kit &amp; the packaged showed that it had a store &amp; charge stand &amp; it doesn&#x27;t.  The back of the package shows the stand along with 6 other things, which equals 7 like it says. Beside the picture, it says \\&quot;store &amp; charge stand. Conveniently charges trimmer &amp; neatly stores all accessories\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I chatted with customer service.  They stated that it came with a storage bag. That it used to come with a stand. I guess they didn&#x27;t change the package. I stated the package didn&#x27;t say that, that it was false advertising.  They replied...\\&quot;can I help you with anything else?\\&quot;  GRRR.  I asked for stand, they replied that they no longer made it.  Do not expect help from customer service.</li>
    <li> this thing is great, all the attachments work well, i lost my other two, i would buy again for sure</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. Easy to clean, no batteries (rechargable), and many different razor gaurds. plus it is reasonably priced. My sons, nephews, and male cousins keep taking them from me.  If you have a beard, and like to keep it shapped up, this is the product for you.....But if you are looking for a clean shaven, razor close cut....get a razor.</li>
    <li> When I got it, I thought about returning it immediately. Looks so incredibly cheap (which - it is). When I used it the first time, I thought about throwing it away, the blades are not great and I thought it would just get worse. Plus, you can&#x27;t use it while plugged in, you have to recharge it and use it on the battery, which I assumed would die very soon.&lt;br /&gt;Truth is - after months and months of usage, it is still working as the first day. Which is not great, but it does keep working. For the price, just good enough.</li>
    <li> Execellent product with the worth of price. I love this product and I will defiantly recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to use. Great for the price I paid. Would have like stringer blades though for tough beards</li>
    <li> The quality is good and it works perfectly fine. however, the packaging can be improved specially after unpack the plastic packing as it has loosen parts !</li>
    <li> Worked great before I charged it. Now it only works when there are no attachments. It looks like it actually melted the plastic inside the attachments that it attaches to - after only a few seconds of usage! Cheap and not worth it.</li>
    <li> I had an old trimmer/shaver for years, It was alright, but this one is a lot nicer. It&#x27;s built well and easy to use and clean. No complaints.</li>
    <li> i have hard beard, for trimming hard/thick beard is not good, suggest me something better than this and cheap product.</li>
    <li> The Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System is exactly what it says.  It&#x27;s great.  My partner uses the system to trim his beard and to shave his entire head. It takes not more than three minutes and the results are wonderful.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has several different heads that snap on for different uses. Even a nose and ear hair attachment. Charges up quick and the battery lasts till the end of the job. I only wish it came in white.</li>
    <li> received this the other day, and i have only used it a couple times, but it works great so far! i had read some bad reviews, so kept my expectations low, so far this has GREATLY exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- does a much even and cleaner trim than my previous &#x27;walmart special&#x27; trimmer&lt;br /&gt;- seems to have a strong motor, and does not &#x27;pull&#x27; hairs&lt;br /&gt;- CHEAP!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- kinda loud&lt;br /&gt;- kinda messy, in that trimmed hair fly everywhere&lt;br /&gt;- some reviewers have said the guides are flimsy and break easy,..guides do seem a bit flimsy...but it was $14 bux!&lt;br /&gt;- no stand to hold trimmer and parts...but it was $14 bux!</li>
    <li> I got this for ~14$ and it does what it is meant for. Dont expect too much and get disappointed. For the money money spent on it, it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This products works as it is supposed to.  The only downside is the fact that the plastic hair and beard attachments break after awhile.  I wish at least 2 of each of the plastic attachments were included.  It is cheaper to buy a whole new unit than to replace just the plastic attachments.</li>
    <li> I had a earlier model that I had dropped and broke. This model has more rattles and vibrations, and the foil screen attachment doesn&#x27;t come off very easily.</li>
    <li> I have used this kit for several weeks and find it a very good outfit. I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet and all the attachments work extremely well. It&#x27;s hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> The Norelco G370 has provided me with years of reliable trimming and grooming services.  I highly recommend this product.  Incidentally, I&#x27;ve accidentally dropped it several times and it never broke on me.  I&#x27;m amazed how well it has held up.</li>
    <li> Recently bought the item on Amazon as I had it before and broke (bought at Target about a year ago). Love it so much that I decided to try it out again. I cannot say anything bad considering the price point at which this sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great that it comes with a bag and the charge seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable clip&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None for price.</li>
    <li> This machine is reliable, versatile, light, durable and cheap. I have this machine over a year solving my cutting needs all over myself, he he. I recommend widely this item to any one. Its delivery was very fast!!</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.Had it 2 weeks and pieces have broken off already so that only one attachment works now.If you never take an attachment off you might be ok,but then you could never clean it.I don&#x27;t like philips and i don&#x27;t like norelco so i should have known better.</li>
    <li> I do not know why people are complaining, yes it is made of plastic not stainless steel.  I have been using this for over a year for keeping the beard trimmed.  Holds a charge for a long time, have only actually charged it a few times. does what it is supposed to do,  I would not use for hair cuts, its a beard trimmer.  If you want to cut hair get the heavy duty system.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very neat, compact, works well, but clipper attachments which are supposed to take hair off to a specified short length won&#x27;t take off much hair at all, very frustrating.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to handle. It is trimming in a sharp manner. V&lt;br /&gt;We can do trimming pretty quick</li>
    <li> I have used one of these for 5 years for a beard /mustache trimmer . It is the best!  So I saw one at Amazon for a great price and will use it while traveling . The attachment all work as advertised.</li>
    <li> The g370/60 is a great machine and handy at all times. the only drawback to me that it doesnt work while charging, which doesnt help if the battery is empty and you are in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I have had the \\&quot;Norelco G370 all-in-one Shaver/Trimmer\\&quot; for about 3 months now and it does a tight trim with my \\&quot;Pencil\\&quot; type mustache and \\&quot;FORKS down the chin\\&quot; look. I have no regrets whatsoever purchasing the \\&quot;Norelco G370 all-in-one Shaver/Trimmer\\&quot; unit this far. For the money I did excellent with value and the talent the \\&quot;Norelco G370 all-in-one Shaver/Trimmer\\&quot; allows me.&lt;br /&gt;If this unit lasts only a year, I will have done good however I expect it to last longer. I will more than likely purchase then another. The \\&quot;Norelco G370 all-in-one Shaver/Trimmer\\&quot; allows me to get close and tight to the mark. I use a crayon to make the outline for my mustache and forks which are grown very short in length only, and mustache always above the lip for a \\&quot;clean, militarized\\&quot; look. Since I have patches in my beard and mustache, the black crayon allows me to fill in where needed. The \\&quot;Norelco G370 all-in-one Shaver/Trimmer\\&quot; has been helpful in regards to my shaving and grooming needs. 4 STARS</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product for the money. It does a very good job of trimming and keeps a charge for days. It comes with attachments that work well also.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is by far the best ive ever tried, even at any price range. And no i have not tried 100s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, the trimmer and all the attachments really works well. It holds a charge pretty good even left for a while and even in frosty pickup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my beard and Ive trimmed my hair with it. All works good, I did have a hard time using the adjustable deal for cutting hair because my hair is to tough, so I ended up trimming is just about bold. Haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that would most likely work on less tough hair or maybe just hair that didnt get quite that long before attempting to cut it. Im not 100% sure how much cutting time a charge gives, but Id say atleast 30-40 mins and that depends what you do I bet. If trimming light stuff it would be more like 1 hr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, works well and all. Only cons I can see if that it wont cut my tougher hair atleast when I gets longer and that if the batteries are dead you cant cut while charging (as it wont keep up) so you need to have it charging atleast some time before you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 5 stars as I dont see much wrong with it and at this price. Great deal for around 15 bucks.</li>
    <li> buen producto, llego en buen tiempo y condiciones&lt;br /&gt;buen producto, llego en buen tiempo y condiciones&lt;br /&gt;buen producto, llego en buen tiempo y condiciones</li>
    <li> Every attachment works great, It came full in charge (I still didn&#x27;t plugged it to the wall), I use it almost every day and it is awesome, it&#x27;s small and good weight, confortable for my hand. My brother and father envy me xD&lt;br /&gt;And on top of all that, It costs just 14$. If it broke in a couple of month I definetly buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m referring to nose hair, ear hair, and facial hair, but I bet this would be great for manscaping your chest or back if needed. This trims my beard better than Norelco&#x27;s newer \\&quot;stubble trimmers\\&quot; and comes with other attachments for all of your needs. You  can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of looking like I just woke up from a three-year coma in a long-term care facility that is understaffed so it neglects its patients. I&#x27;m also not a fan of scraping little slivers of metal against my skin. So I bought this. And it does exactly what I need it to do: keep my facial hair presentable while not irritating my skin. It&#x27;s easy to use, and can shave you multiple times before needing to be recharged. If I lost or damaged this I would buy the same product to replace it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers who gave it a bad rating are ranting about. This product is perfect. Has lots of options, works perfectly and there has not been a single source of complaint so far. It&#x27;s measurement mechanism is also highly accurate. Read the instructions before you use it and don&#x27;t pull on the plastic parts without reading the instructions, and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t review products very often, but this Philips Norelco groomer worked so well that I just had to share. Incredibly easy to use. On my first beard trim, I did a better job than the barber I&#x27;ve been seeing for the last year. I have very thick and curly facial hair, but the blades were plenty sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having paid as much as $10 a trim at the barber shop, this $14 groomer will definitely pay for itself in no time. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really nice trimmer. A lot of diffrent options for the heads. Even comes with a little bag to put everything in, great even for trips</li>
    <li> using it for the last 3 years .. excellent experience !! and the battery lasts for several days without charging ,, I can say I can use it 7-10 times before charging it again ,,</li>
    <li> a must, my husband has scruff at neck , eyebrows and tops of ears. Makes the job easy and not messy. plus very easy to use. he trust me more with this than with scissors too.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for some time now and really like it! I only use the beard attachment and the miniature clippers (for those pesky hairs that old people seem to be plagued with - aargh) and it trims my beard just perfectly. I then use the edger to keep it nice and neat. Pretty slick clippers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these things in the past. I don&#x27;t remember the brands but they were not Norelco. The best feature of this one, by far, is battery life. This little guy just keeps on going.</li>
    <li> The shaving attachment is not very good,but the others work fine.  This is not great for trimming hair, but works well for beards.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer kit about five years ago and I still use it regularly. The battery life is not quite what it used to be but it charges very quickly so it&#x27;s not really an issue. It&#x27;s just a great product - dependable, easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> My second Norelco trimmer gave up the ghost and they don&#x27;t make that model anymore. This one does the job, but not as nicely as the old one and it&#x27;s harder to clean.</li>
    <li> This is an unbelievable value. First off, you get the groomer itself, which is great to use and cuts through hair like a knife through hot butter. Then it comes with a ton of useful attachments, along with a drawstring bag to contain them all in. The groomer charges on an included AC power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any hair in need of trimming, you should stop what you are doing right now and buy this product.</li>
    <li> As I said OK for the price, but people outside U.S. should know that it operates on 120 Volts, so have that in mind.</li>
    <li> Great item. Has all the necessary attachments. Just don&#x27;t lose any of them..but they provide a little carrying case for them. It&#x27;s a trimmer, cutter, nose hair trimmer all in one. I fully recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had one before, and, i gave it to my brother. He still has his so, i got another for me. The old one did not have all these different tips of features, this one does. I had grown my hair from my head to my neck, and, had grown a beard for Lent. On Easter morning i used it, and, talk about cutting hair. It does wonderful things. I would recommend to any one that wants to cut there hair. For this price you can not bet it.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will and maintains a charge VERY well. I can keep my beard and mustache well trimmed. It&#x27;s easy to clean. This is my second purchase of this item - puppy chewed up my charging unit. Liked it well enough to want to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and easy to use.  I had a Maverick T-1000 that I used for over 15 years that has finally seen it&#x27;s day.  This is a great lightweight replacement that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Not sure what people were thinking when they left negative reviews... heavier isn&#x27;t always better.  This is very versatile and cuts body / nose/ beard hair effortlessly!</li>
    <li> This grooming system is inexpensive, and when I use it to trim my beard I look pretty boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the trimmer is not expensive and all of the beard and nose hair attachments work well.  No need to over think a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?  There are probably better more expensive trimmers out there...</li>
    <li> It is what I expected for this price. Does its job. Good choice for men who do not love razors.</li>
    <li> this electric shaver works perfect does exactly what its supposed to do and it comes with several different attachments great</li>
    <li> I got this because I lost the charger for my old one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Turned out I lost a bunch of the replaceable heads when I moved.  Interchangeable heads for different styles of trimming and grooming, easy to clean and quick to charge.  It makes my facial hair appear MUCH more professional.  When I remember to use it, that is.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for beard trimmer.  Multiple settings.  I use it once a week and the first charge has lasted at least 6 weeks.  The switch to change the settings looks flimsy, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> For the price and the value, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. So many different detachable heads, you can probably cut your hair with this thing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Has everything you need for grooming&lt;br /&gt;-Decent battery and life&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with everything you need to use for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap, poor quality, plastic heads makes it annoying to trim&lt;br /&gt;-Feels like a cheap cut&lt;br /&gt;-Bulky design on the heads/could be a lot more slimline for all the other buzzers I have see&lt;br /&gt;-Detach button is right next to the on/off button and it larger/easier to press in comparison. I detach the head more often than I turn the darn thing on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you get what you pay for. No more or no less. A good value, but given enough time I could have found something better.</li>
    <li> Its good for cleaning up facial hair. But don&#x27;t attempt to give yourself a haircut--I&#x27;m going to school tomorrow with a few lines (read \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot;) in my head. Later!</li>
    <li> I considered several options before settling on this one.  Ultimately, I am very happy with the purchase.  It came with more attachments than I will ever use, but it does what I need it to do very well - trim my beard/ goatee.  I had an older Norelco that I ran until the 2nd replacement battery went bad.  I was not expecting much from the G370, but it has exceeded the performance of the old unit in every capacity, and has exceeded my expectations as well.  The only potential con is the cutting head width may be considered too skinny for some folks.  I only need it to trim my beard/ goatee, and I&#x27;ve found the width to be of no concern in my case.</li>
    <li> really like all the attachments and settings also came with a full charge so i could use it right away</li>
    <li> This is best one till now that I have used. Easy to charge, light weight, Chops your hairs with ease, also easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also pretty easy to use on your boday hairs other then your beard &amp; moustache.</li>
    <li> When I bought my new triple-head shaver, I was disappointed to find that Phillips-Norelco removed the sideburn trimmer. So I went back online to find one. This is a trimmer, and much more, I like the nose-hair trimmer, but I haven&#x27;t mastered the haircutting attachments. It&#x27;s durable, and sized to comfortably fit the hand. Battery life is good. The rechargeable battery seems to go forever on a charge. But be careful, being used to my shaver, this has a much faster action. My loss of eyebrows was purely operator error, and they grew back in no time.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a week to trim up my gotie.  Battery charge lasts months so I do not have to charge it often.</li>
    <li> this set is really really nice and u can take care of every hair on your body with this set!&lt;br /&gt;i bought it for my father bcs he liked my set (which was the same)&lt;br /&gt;small, handy and light but quality is great&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;i realized that the seller increased the price (actually they doubled the price) more than 2X&lt;br /&gt;so for that reason i have to say this item does not deserve this price!&lt;br /&gt;everything is ok but the price is waaay to much for the moment which is 43.99$&lt;br /&gt;i used to buy thisPhilips Norelco G370 at Walmart for 19.99$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just because of the price change, i lowered the stars from 5 to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> It is everything I was hoping for in a personal groomer!  It holds a charge for days, making it great to take on vacations without the charger.  The accessories even make it a great hair clipper, too!</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard nice and trim without any hassle. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but it really needs no maintenance.</li>
    <li> best shaver for hubby, he wore this one out</li>
    <li> Broke down after using less than 5 times.</li>
    <li> I used it to maintain my beard sharp. Great product and battery lasts for ever even using it 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and I dropped the adjustable beard shaver attachment and broke it. I went out and bought a Remington that turned out to be crap. So I bought another one of these off Amazon.com. This grooming kit is great! It glides against my skin easily which the Remington didn&#x27;t. The rechargeable battery lasts forever on this thing compared to the Remington. And I love the molded plastic tray that holds everything- something the Remington didn&#x27;t have. This is the only grooming system you will ever need.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace a G380 that I received for Christmas several years ago, I&#x27;am pleased with both. I hope I never have to do without this product..</li>
    <li> Great product as expected</li>
    <li> I bought this one on amazon for my Dad and he is absolutely loving it. I used a similar one for over 18 months untill a freak accident killed it, but bought another one for myself at walmart.</li>
    <li> Got it few days back.&lt;br /&gt;Charged it as required for 10 hours and have been using it till now (as they mentioned to drain the battery on first use fully, before recharging).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got amazing battery life. Have used it couple of times since I bought, and the damn thing just does not drain :)&lt;br /&gt;All the accessories are useful, though I end up using only one or two.&lt;br /&gt;Product is durable, easy to use, and I know being Philips, it will last me for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value for money product..!!</li>
    <li> Damn good trimmer.  But I paid 30 dollars for mine like 3 years ago.  the $150 price here is AMAZINGLY outragous.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time!. works great and hope it will continue working the same way. we loved it and had very much faun with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to touch up between hair cuts. It comes with quite a variety of attachments. It is still pretty new so I will say it is very sharp now and I hope it stays that way. It is small enough to maneuver around ears etc.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet so it seems it holds a charge very well.</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase of this shaver, used the other for four years before I needed to replace.  Only reason gave it 4/5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand.</li>
    <li> The price and the name brand is what helped me choose this particular item.  the only downside if there is one is NOT the product, but in the user who has no patience.  but with practice, he absolutely loves this.  now he no longer looks like grizzley adams, but is able to trim up quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this item for a few weeks, but I absolutely love it.  In short, here&#x27;s a list of pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;A lot of attachments&lt;br /&gt;Great size and weight&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge&lt;br /&gt;A lot of power&lt;br /&gt;Cheap in price, not in quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> The first reason I was afraid of buying this cheaper model product was that it would fail on me after a few months. But this has lasted over a year now and has definitely proven to be worth value. Does a great job and has not broken yet. But I do use it very carefully.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but the attachments are quite fragile. I&#x27;ve broken most of the beard trimming attachments that I bring when traveling.</li>
    <li> Quality is excellent.  The only drawback was it did not include a holder or rack for the razor and attachments.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for money. Everything you need for personal grooming. Works like a charm, right out of the box. Love it.</li>
    <li> Have been using it from quite some time and it is working great! I love this product. You cannot get anything better!</li>
    <li> A  Christmas gift for my brother...it had to be rechargeable, not always easy to find.  He likes all the attachments and says it&#x27;s easy to use and does the job well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son for Christmas hoping that he would neaten up his beard, and he did. He really likes it so he&#x27;s happy and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It&#x27;s an amazing product that deserves all of it&#x27;s great reviews. This is the only grooming tool he needs now, and he uses it regularly. It&#x27;s durable and works great. Arrived on time and as described. I highly recommend, and so does he!</li>
    <li> works great , quiet, the best shaver i have ever gotten for myself !!! recommend t all men and as grooming tool for pets:_)))</li>
    <li> If I only had a star for each year I have owned this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this in &#x27;08 as a Christmas present..... still using it as of this review 12/17/2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but good things to say about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistent/Constant power after each charge&lt;br /&gt;blades still sharp enough to do the job&lt;br /&gt;got wet on multiple occasions and still works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only maintenance I have done to this is the routine cleaning the should obviously be done after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors/blades still do their job because I don&#x27;t break out in bumps nor do I spend a long time in front of the mirror trying to catch missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that the \\&quot;Shaver\\&quot; attachment will take some time to get the job done if you solely rely on that but in hindsight you should whip out the expensive shaver on the special close shave days/nights anyway.</li>
    <li> It is nice trimmer and it can be washed with anti bacterial after the use. Definitely worth for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my broken groomer.  It is a great groomer and trimmer.  It charges fast and last longer than my old one.  The price isn&#x27;t bad for this small machine!</li>
    <li> I bought the G270 about 8 years ago and it has been slowly dying over the last 6 months. I wanted to replace it with the same exact model since it had been such a great trimmer but it has been replaced by the G370. The difference is the G270 came with an upright stand that held all the utensils while the newer G370 comes with a bag and an extra utensil not included years ago. Lucky for me the newer one fits in the older versions charging stand so I only had to transfer all of the new stuff into the old charging stand and I&#x27;m good for hopefully another 7 - 8 years. I&#x27;ve had nothing but great luck with Philips Norelco trimmers and I strongly suggest this one.</li>
    <li> This is the third beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned and the best one yet. I would recomend this product to anyone looking for a good beard trimmer and one that can also cut hear.</li>
    <li> after doing much comparison, i chose this grooming system because of it&#x27;s versatility. my husband likes it quite well; his only complaint is that the blade size is a bit small for shaving his head and it takes longer than with his old shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this trimmer.  I used the last one for around 2 years, but somehow it got left behind on a trip.  It&#x27;s cheap, but it is quality for the price.  I wish it still came with the stand for all the attachments, but its no biggie. I have used this trimmer for facial hair, body hair, and even for haircuts.  For the price, I definitely don&#x27;t think it gets any better.</li>
    <li> Had got best price for this on amazon and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Came in within few days as free super saver shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Works good, but recommend it only for plain hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;No styling, no beard/mustache styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purely no styling, only for hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;battery is good and but needs longer time to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle as its light weight and small.</li>
    <li> Husband Likes it, Just wish it came with it&#x27;s own stand up holder. But it seems to work good for him.</li>
    <li> It is a nice unit, but the attachments, such as the beard trimmer guide comb, are very fragile and will break after not too much usage.  The replacement part on the Norelco website costs more than twice (with shipping) what you can get a whole new unit for.  Holding it on with scotch tape for the moment.</li>
    <li> My husband could not believe I only spent $15 on this shaver. I comes with lots of attachments and holds a great charge. We&#x27;re thinking about purchasing more to have in the future.</li>
    <li> Battery seems to last forever.  It&#x27;s light and small so you can maneuver it around your face for all the difficult to reach areas.  I use this for my beard and to trim my hail between haircuts.  The attachments look a little fragile but I have had no problems with them cause I make sure I am careful when I attach/remove the various attachments.</li>
    <li> Works very well in trimming long hairs that my electric shaver misses. Works well in trimming nasal hair. I highly recommend the Norelco G370.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon a few weeks ago and have used all attachments. The battery has held its charge and so far none of the plastic pieces have broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some positives are - The precision trimmer does a great job, gives sharp lines and leaves a nice \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look. The adjustable beard trimmer works on many lengths of facial hair, including short. Very good for someone who travels, as it&#x27;s pretty compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives are- The mini foil shaver is only about 1\\&quot; across, so if you wanted a \\&quot;clean shaven\\&quot; look it will take you a couple minutes longer than usual. My beard on my neck and goatee area grow in much thicker than on my cheeks so I have to spend a little more time in those areas if I want a close shave. It also has a different \\&quot;head\\&quot; than the other attachments, which I can see someone mixing up (as I did) and nearly break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mention the plastic docking ridges breaking...I have not experienced this, as there is an obvious correct way to remove each attachment, rather than press the silver release button and try to rip the thing off. And yes, if you are a someone with thick facial hair wanting a close shave, you might have some issues with the mini foil shaver (keyword &#x3D; mini)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid less than $14 for this and so far have been pleased with my purchase, and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I use it to trim my moustache, goatee and sideburns, ear/nose hairs!</li>
    <li> I used this for personal grooming and it worked really well. I just wish it was waterproof so I could use it in the shower</li>
    <li> This item is the complete package and has all the tools necessary to keep neatly groomed at all times.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This little unit is not too bad. The price is certainly right and it does the trick. I would not hesitate to buy it again. No oiling, no sharpening, just turn it on and use it. Rinse blades off with water.</li>
    <li> I have long used Norelco&#x27;s products, and I love their beard trimmers. When I saw the price of this product, I was convinced it must be a really, really low quality product, but the thing surprised me in several different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it comes with several different attachments and features. Here are a few thoughts on each:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Full Size Trimmer - Works well, just as would be expected. It functions well and without issue, which is good, because this is vital to a good beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-Mini Foil Shaver - I haven&#x27;t used it yet, and will update this reviw when I do.&lt;br /&gt;-Precision Trimmer - Works well, haven&#x27;t had issues with pulling or anything of the sort.&lt;br /&gt;-Nose, Ear &amp; Eyebrow Trimmer - I tried it out, just for kicks. I&#x27;ve never used a nose hair trimmer before, and I was surprised at how well it worked. You definitely have to take your time with it, as going to fast proved to cause a bit of pulling, and that was painful.&lt;br /&gt;-Hair Comb - A bit cheaply made, but it works well. The size/length indicator is a bit underwhelming, but functional.&lt;br /&gt;-Beard and Mustache Comb - Mostly the same as the Hair Comb. It does its job well, but the feel of the product feels a bit cheap compared to my last Norelco beard trimmer. In the end, though, it functions much the same way, and the result is definitely acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;-Pouch - Simple pouch, nothing more to it. Size is right and everything fits inside. Nice for travel.&lt;br /&gt;-Washable Attachments - They are indeed very modular and very washable. You can just pull of an attachment when you are done, brush it off, rinse it, and you&#x27;re done. Very nice benefit to the detachable component system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the product is solid. Everything that is seems to compromise it build quality seems to melt away after being used, as the results are great. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the combs slipping while using them, and I like the varied and easy to clean attachments. And at the price it iscurrently at, it&#x27;s a great deal for anybody looking for a good trimming tool, especially for travel.</li>
    <li> Works great and has lots of great attachements.Bought 2 and both were gifts. They love their groomer.</li>
    <li> i bought this trimmer hoping that it was not going to be another bargain trimmer like the ones ive had in the past, but let me tell you this thing works much, much better than a bargain trimmer. first off, the quality of the attachments and the precision they provide you just dont get anywhere else for that sort of price. secondly, this little thing must have a v8 hidden in there somewhere because it will go through anything without pulling or tugging or any annoyance that a less powerful trimmer will cause. lastly, it runs while charging which is a great plus and its very low maintenance. even comes with a travel bag which is a very thoughtful touch by philips. great product, couldnt be happier</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my last cheap shaver when the battery would no longer hold out for an entire shave. I have only charged this to full once and have been using it to trim my beard and mustache every week or so for over a month with absolutely no lack of power. This is great since my bathroom doesn&#x27;t allow me to have it plugged in and on the counter all the time. The attachments are simple to use and effective. Wish it still came with a full stand instead of the bag, but not a big deal since it doesn&#x27;t need charging that often. Could not have been happier with this shaver! I don&#x27;t know what the $100 plus dollar shavers do for you better than this, since I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Pieces are cheap plastic but the razor works as expected. Be careful with it though. Really for beard trimming. I would not cut head hair with it.</li>
    <li> Use it often.  Serves the purpose for quick trims.</li>
    <li> Poorly made. Feel apart after a few months.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> I use this baby on a daily basis, and the battery lasts for weeks, its unheard of in electronic devices today. Easy to use and clean. Definitely recommend for a daily shaver/trimmer like myself.</li>
    <li> Complete champion but the battery life could be better.</li>
    <li> Had for 2 and a half years now and works like new!!! Worth the money</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this and is very happy with it. It has Lots of attachments and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Worth for buying it. I really liked using it. Cheaper than the price in walmart / sams club. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The quality of this project is nice. It feels solid and it is rechargeable too! Has all kinds of attachments to easily groom all types of hair.</li>
    <li> So my trimmer finally kicked the bucket.  I obviously needed a new one (since scissors weren&#x27;t going to cut it).  I checked out some reviews and found this little guy.  It has not disappointed.  It does what it says it will and then some.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend who&#x27;s beard trimmer finally broke after many years. This one was decently priced and had good reviews so I bought it. He likes it. The attachments all work great. This was a good deal.</li>
    <li> a full five. I&#x27;m easy pleased  especially at this price.&lt;br /&gt;could be a gift for that tight penny pinching uncle you know.</li>
    <li> Teh Phillips Norelco Grooming System is so good that after I bought one for my husband, I bough one for my son.  Yes, he sports a full beard and just loves the results.</li>
    <li> Economical and Reliable All-in-1  grooming system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable&lt;br /&gt;-Fast Shipping&lt;br /&gt;-Great battery life (so far)&lt;br /&gt;-Plug in charging&lt;br /&gt;-Wireless (non-batter operated)&lt;br /&gt;-Different head pieces for everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-No charging stand or place to keep them&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving tip doesn&#x27;t shave/cut&lt;br /&gt;(I use a razor to shave anyways so not a big deal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> i had the Norelco G270 for about 4 years and i loved it, but unfortunately the battery had weakened over the years so i had to replace it. i decided to go with the Norelco G370 and im glad i did. feels a bit more sturdier and works great. for the price it is nice</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t understand the favorable reviews on this product.  The beard and mustache attachment leaves hair much too long even at the shortest setting.  If you want the stubble look, forget it.  Return shipping charges are almost as much as the product.  Buy the Remington MB 200.</li>
    <li> I purchased this exact same unit around 5 years ago.  It finally began to have issues.  Would not hold charge etc.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking at in online it appeared to be the same as the one I had.  So I ordered one.  Glad I did!!  In looking at the brand new one and comparing it to my 5 year old Norelco they appear to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that 5 years of good use out of something like this is fair.  I used my old one almost everyday.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are very good.  You can do just about all of your daily or weekly grooming with this low priced device.</li>
    <li> I have the facial hair growing capabilities of a thirteen year old despite my being roughly twice that age.  The product performed exactly as I would expect it too and the multiple tools it came with were icing on the cake, even if I really don&#x27;t need a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Yo dude, this stuff is great. Really inexpensive and all the heads get the job done. I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Wow is such a simple word but it&#x27;s a powerful word. For the price I would say this groomer is powerful. It meets and fullfills my every needs. As far as grooming that is.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow it trims closer than my Wahl hair clippers that I used to groom my beard. The Wahl clips faster but this cuts closer. I didn&#x27;t get any snagging. Has lots of attachments and a little carrying bag.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if you have a thick heavy beard this might not be for you. Maybe spend a little extra but when it comes to clipping nose hairs I&#x27;m sure it could handle all contenders.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rechargeable to real impact so taking it the road would be ideal.</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t believe that this was so cheap. I&#x27;ve been through so many razors and trimmers in my life and have spent so much money on them. This one takes the cake for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many tools for trimming and close shaving makes this such a versatile tool for grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that kinda stinks is that it recommends that you charge it for 10 hours and only when it is completely dead. I&#x27;m worried about the state of my facial hair when this happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t ever have to oil the blades and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this for any guy with a beard or mustache to maintain.</li>
    <li> Only reason I had to buy this was b/c my last Norelco shaver stopped working after 6 years!&lt;br /&gt;This All in 1 system is actually better then my previous one b/c it has multiple heads for your neck, nose, and ears.&lt;br /&gt;No need to have various grooming sets.  The Phillips Norelco All in 1 has all the needs for a guy.</li>
    <li> All attachements are made of cheap plastic that fit very loosely on the base and make very loud rattling noise.</li>
    <li> Solid beard trimmer.  The first charge lasts quite a while, after that, the recharge isn&#x27;t fantastic, but just plug it in and its back in action for a few trims.  I wish the shaver was better for close shaves.  It&#x27;s either down to a light beard or a patchy close shave.  Needs a solid attachment for something to rival a razor blade.</li>
    <li> I loved my old one, and still prefer some of its features, but I lost it after nearly twenty years.  I looked everywhere for a decent replacement and found this one on Amazon only, and at a very reasonable price.  I have yet to charge it as it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good versatile clipper system with many attachments and uses.  This works well on body, facial, ear and nose hair. And being rechargeable is an added bonus (but follow the charge/discharge instructions to maximize battery life).</li>
    <li> I have previously owned the g370 and was looking for a good deal on a new one. alas, I have found it!</li>
    <li> I have not experienced any problem with this product. It comes with many cool additions that I do not even use; however, you might want to use them one day. It has a rechargeable battery and comes with a carrying bag. Moreover at that price it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> I have this same all-in-1 for at least 5yrs.  Until it got shorted out.  Instead of just buying the plug, I bought this and will have spare parts.</li>
    <li> The bag it came in is falling to shreds, and there are too many pieces not to have it in a bag, but I have no complaints about its cutting ability and the variety of tips. Totally replaced my razor&#x27;s flip-up tool. And it&#x27;s about time we all start using the nose hair trimmers.</li>
    <li> ES UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO C O N CALIDAD GARANTIZADA LO RECOMIENDO CON LOS OJOS CERRADOS 100 % DESDE VALENCIA, VENEZUELA</li>
    <li> This is mostly my 10th Grooming system.  Many cost so much more then this one but did alot less.  It works really good,  does the job and is really  Cheap, but in a good way.  The only thing I would add is a holder for the unit and all the accessories but having do many others  I had one perfect fot iy .....  That is the only reason it got a 4 instead of a 5 .... I just like the things laid out in front of me instead of a bag,  but the bag works great for other things so it is a win win .  Thank  you for reading  and to all Vets  welcome home........</li>
    <li> Greta product for the price</li>
    <li> My husband had this same model for a couple of years and finally gave out on him. He really loves this thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about three years, the ni-cad battery eventually wore out and the trimmer would no longer hold a charge. Instead of throwing in the trash, I decided to try and replace the battery, after prying the trimmer apart with a small screwdriver I discovered that it uses a ni-cad battery the exact same size as a standard AA battery, I peeled off the soldered connections and installed a new energizer AA battery, now it works fine with no charging needed.</li>
    <li> I had a Remmington beard trimmer prevously that had slow cutting spead compaired to this. I love the fact too they made it easy to clean and all the different attachments. It is still working great for me.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s well made. i&#x27;ve used it about 8 times and the battery is still going strong (after an initial 10 hour charge). this has already paid for itself since i used to pay my barber $5 to trim my beard.</li>
    <li> The best where personal grooming is concerned. I&#x27;ve had other models including the wahl and t-outliners but honestly after using this for a complete grooming test i can confirm that this little guy packs a powerful punch. I&#x27;m still wowed by how much value i got for my money, with the price at $13 its definitely a steal.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. The price was right. Great for beard, nose and I use it for my hair. Lots of attachments if you need them, plus a bag for them which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wahl user for over 10 years. I still have &amp; use their larger clipper but when my Wahl cordless AA battery machine broke I decided I&#x27;d try a Norelco instead. I found this one and thought it reminscient of my Ridgid JobMax system which has done IT&#x27;S job very well...lol I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, this is as complete a beard &amp; moustache trim kit as I can envision. The nose hair trimming attachment isn&#x27;t that great &amp; even a little bit painful, (maybe I have tree trunk nose hairs or something). The shaver tip isn&#x27;t bad at all and this an electric \\&quot;shaver-h8r\\&quot; telling you that. Amazon&#x27;s price on this item is way below retail...in a great way. Much more powerful than it looks and the attachments work flawlessly (- the nose hair trimmer). Recommended by this stickler for perfect facial hair...;-).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] for almost 4 years now. And when I say I&#x27;ve used it, I mean I&#x27;ve used about 3-4 a year because I cut my own hair with it once a week. I also use it in a manner NOT recommended by Philips Norelco - I use it in the shower with wet hair (&amp; conditioner for cutting ease) the majority of the time. Over  3-5 months of usage, there is no corrosion or anything else. It holds a charge wonderfully and just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only faults I&#x27;ve had with the G370 is that the &#x27;spring&#x27; mechanism on the guard that allows you to vary the cutting height no longer provides the proper resistance after a couple of months/many uses - resulting in some slight varied height. Again, I used the G370 once a week+ to cut my hair as well as to manscape. This is why I usually buy 2-3 at a time so I can just chuck one into the electronics recycling bin at my local big-box store and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $15-$20 each, the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] is worth the price. Yes, the G370 has some faults but it just works. It is a great price for around $15 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there is a product similar to this one, the [[ASIN:B000FED5DK Philips Norelco G380 All-in-1 Grooming System]] and it is almost identical to the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] except for the color and the stand but be wary because it is priced a lot higher (~$80). This is not an upgraded G370 and is not, in my opinion, worth the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/16/13&lt;br /&gt;One more addition is that I started to search for a &#x27;stubble&#x27; trimmer for my face and the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] without a guard works wonderfully for that! Just awesome, actually. The edges of the blades are covered enough so it maintains the short look we love and without having to be so precise with holding it.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for whatever needs to be trimmed.  Price is phenomenal for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought one in 2007 that had a NiCAD battery that died fast, this one has a NiMH that will last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI if you use in the shower or wet environment, the blades and blade mechanism will die faster.  My old one buzzed just fine except the blades got crusty and wouldn&#x27;t work after a few years of shower use (even after oiling them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t believe the self-sharpening blade thing, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s mechanically possible with this design, good thing its cheap!</li>
    <li> The many trim heads has made this a wonderful tool.  I liked it so much I got a 2nd for my son&#x27;s Christmas gift.  Only wish the tight fit of the snap-on trim heads last longer. For the cost it has been well worth it.  Also a great traveling companion.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice beard trimmer.  It really does provide a nice trim on that lowest setting.  I&#x27;ve had trouble with other trimmers not having a low enough setting and this thing will get you down to a 1-2 day scruff, dependent on how quickly you can grow your beard out.  The only thing this doesn&#x27;t do well is trim nose hairs.  I couldn&#x27;t ding it on the star rating for that as that functionality is a bonus item in my minds eye.</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer works OK but it&#x27;s the rest that work very well. I especially like the beard shaver attachment. Very smooth cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this device for a few months now, and only used it about once every other week.  The part that adjusts the trim length has now broken off and I can no long set a trim length.  This pretty much ruins my ability to use the device, which is why I have to give it a one star.  Before this part broke I would have given it four stars, but the part was cheap and should have been foreseeable that it would break.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $10 set of Conair clippers purchased from a grocery store for the last two years. Using the Philips Norelco G370 was like trading in a crappy old car for, well, something much better! I didn&#x27;t realize how bad I had it until I bought these.</li>
    <li> I use this grooming system to cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair at least one per month.  I like this system better than my Wahl because I can easily fade from one length to another with just a slide of the thumb.  The height adjuster is thin plastic so you have to store this some place it will not get broken.  I have already broken one on my other grooming system (same model) and Norelco was fantastic at sending me a new one, no charge, right away!</li>
    <li> This is a cheap product, so it isn&#x27;t a perfect, top-of-the-line profesional tool. I just use it for occasional beard and hair trimming though, so it&#x27;s more that enough!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about 3 years ago at a Walgreens because I was in desperate need of a beard trimmer (the regular electric shavers just don&#x27;t work for me at all)and this thing works great.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with trimming or shaving off a full beard down to light stubble. For the price, (I paid about $20 for it)you can&#x27;t beat it. The kit comes with a stand and a few extra heads (a nose hair trimmer, 2 different adjustable-length heads, a small and a large trimmer head, and a covered head for touching up stubble)and and AC power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints with this trimmer (if you can even call them complaints) is that the plastic base it sits on if kind of flimsy and this trimmer can be a bit messy to use since the trimmings just fall off onto the counter so you&#x27;ll have to sweep up the shavings if you want to keep things neat around the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this thing is awesome.  Probably the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
    <li> This is my second system I&#x27;ve bought. My first one lasted 3 years and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> my brother needed one so i bought as a b/day gift awhile ago.  he really likes it though i think he said it didn&#x27;t have a stand, but that he just used the one from his old trimmer.</li>
    <li> Solid trimmer that does what is says.  Trims bread well with several setting.  Does a good job at lowest trim size.  Feels a little flimsy but it is made out of plastic.  I have had no problems with it and works well overall.  Recharges quickly and has held charge very well.</li>
    <li> i love it, it is simple and great. i do  not need any other grooming system than this. All in one .....</li>
    <li> I got this Norelco as a small add-on to a larger purchase and I thought that I would give it a try. It has been 4 years since I purchased it. The thing runs like a champ. It has many attachments and will groom just about any beard.</li>
    <li> This grooming system is a very good bang for the buck. The trimmer with adjustable settings in very useful. It comes handy for trimming moustache, stubble and the side burns. The eye brow trimmer was useful too.</li>
    <li> love this product, small but has a lot of power, its been a week since i charged it and it is still working great.  so glad i don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
    <li> Runs very smooth.No issues at all.Multiple options.charge lasts reasonably well. very handy to pack with.&lt;br /&gt;great product to use .thank  you.</li>
    <li> Battery life is great! I can use it 4 or 5 times at least until I need to charge it. The variety of tools that come with it make it very versatile for any shaving/grooming job. The foil shaver is quite small, but suitable for doing smaller areas like between the brows or mustache area.</li>
    <li> Quiet compared to a whal I had owned, many attachments although it seems a little slow cutting but nice for the price</li>
    <li> Works well as a beard trimmer! Still going strong years later.</li>
    <li> Nice little razor. Good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wore out the first groomer after several years and definitely wanted to purchase this again. The attachments are all excellent.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had it for several months now and its going strong.  i use it for daily saving and its good enough for me.  i get good usage off of one charge.  given the price and its other cutting functions, i&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I chose this rate because i&#x27;m very proud of if.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have time to go the barber, i do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I had a Philips Norelco 20XL which served great for 10 years until the guard comb eventually broke. Bought this one and hoped it would as good. No way! This thing seems to be engineered by people who never used it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;1. The power switch and head release buttons are next to each other, so I kept pushing a wrong button.&lt;br /&gt;2. The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!&lt;br /&gt;4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.&lt;br /&gt;5. IMHO, all-in-one thing is wrong if you cannot use the product for it primary function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful product, terrible engineering. Shame on Philips. I do not care of its low price. I would happily pay twice the price to get a decent one.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I originally wanted the beard trimmer. But this can be used for cutting your hair also. The Adjustable size selection is a good invention. Hope this last long</li>
    <li> I was using it with no problem for 5 or 6 months and It was shaving good enough for my beard but then the charger stopped working and It&#x27;s NOT under warranty, so I need to buy a new one now, waste of money!</li>
    <li> It is gooooooood. I am vewy vell It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good. It is good.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a</li>
    <li> this product until it both of the beard guards broke. On one, the spring done sprung!  Meaning, it broke completely. So, I was reduced to using the other beard guard which is primarily used for longer beards, which I do not have. But that guard got stuck onto the shaver! I cannot get it off without breaking one piece or the other! Planned obsolescence perhaps?</li>
    <li> I went with this trimmer in an attempt to be thrifty.  Bad idea.  This trimmer is battery powered and will not work if it&#x27;s not charged, even if it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.  Really a pain if you&#x27;re in the middle of using it and the battery dies.  Second issue, the tab broke off of the guard.  The only way to use it now is to hold it in place with my finger and I don&#x27;t trust myself with that.  I only use it on the lowest setting now.  Then there&#x27;s the nose trimmer.  That was a one-time experience I would like to forget.  Ouch!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Norelco G370.  You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a worse product.</li>
    <li> I live in LA and decided that it would be really cool to become a hipster and grow a beard. I have since switch the original application of this device to impress the ladies. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my old one I bought at a drug store eventually went out, but with lots of daily use. This is a really good grooming tool...attachments come in very handy, plus of course the groomer itself has a long life rechargeable battery ( and holds its charge for a long time ). Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> We had one set like this for the past 4 years. It is still working great and this is a quality product. But my husband has given this to his friend thinking that we can get another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new one we ordered came today, this one is a low quality product not like the one we got it 4 years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we understand what other reviewers mean when they say &amp;#34;This set is NOT coming the way it use to&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Who wasn&#x27;t affected by the past recession? My fiance needs his hair cut every 3 weeks-1 month, which means $15-20 a month. I am a girl and haven&#x27;t had my hair cut in 2 years... I was rather jealous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I spent the next $15 on this trimming set, and I watched how his hair was cut at the salon. It runs great and is easy to clean and use.</li>
    <li> this item was a necessary for taking in the camper.  it makes it very easy to clean up after fishing and hunting.</li>
    <li> Honestly I thought I would receive a cheap device... Well it&#x27;s pretty nice with many features. Plus it&#x27;s wireless! Easy to clean. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Very affordable trimmer/hair cut device. Cheaper to buy than a decent haircut in a civilian barber shop incliding gratuity tip. Just purchased one to replace the third I&#x27;ve owned in 5 years and have replaced several times due to the hair cutting comb breaking and the new one broke upon first use. Would give five star rating if the hair cutting length attachment wasn&#x27;t so flimsy that they break so easily. Suggest that Phillips use a stronger material when casting the parts and charge a higher price as the improvement would be worth it. Now I&#x27;ve got seperate motor handels for nose trimmer , Stash trimmer Etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this trimmer before. It&#x27;s an excellent product for the price, holds a charge for a long time, and comes with numerous attachments.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, charges quickly and attachments change with ease. The &amp;#34;storage bag&amp;#34; is flimsy and I changed it out right away.</li>
    <li> Meets the expectations. Only issue was when I travelled to India I fried the power adapter (only 110 v is supported). I could not find any replacement adapter in India since the pin is unique and is not commonly available.&lt;br /&gt;Another drawback is that it does not work when connected to the power and charging.</li>
    <li> Has all kinds of heads to work with, battery lasts alright&lt;br /&gt;great to shave or even trim and cut hair!&lt;br /&gt;SUPER RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient product whit the multiple heads and being cordless. My only complaints about this is that the battery life is severely shortened when being used on thicker hair, and since the battery is not lithium-ion, you can definitely tell as the battery is dying with the power drop off. Other than that this groomer is great for personal use and would make a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Very powerful, cuts cleanly.  I recharge so rarely I can&#x27;t remember doing so anytime soon.</li>
    <li> It takes care of every piece of body and face hair you&#x27;ll ever need taken care off. I&#x27;m impressed by the strength and longevity of this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ask much of clippers and rarely use any of the attachments, and this one served me just fine while it was working.  Unfortunately, after I had it for about 9-10 months, the charge began to last shorter and shorter until now when it will last less than 30 seconds before it&#x27;s dead.  If I could recharge this damn thing, I&#x27;d give it a fine review.  As it is, just know that you might be lucky to get a year&#x27;s casual use out of it before the battery is dead and it is NOT replaceable.  The instructions say to just throw it out when it&#x27;s no longer charging which happened too soon.</li>
    <li> A while ago I purchased the cheapest battery-operated CONAIR trimmer available at Macy&#x27;s because I was on a trip and I got tired of shaving. I used it for a while after that, and one day, for some mysterious reason, decided I wanted a bit of an upgrade (tired of replacing batteries, mostly). This was not really an upgrade at all. It didn&#x27;t trim any better. Still gives nicks and cuts. This is bottom-of-the-barrel cheap, and don&#x27;t imagine otherwise. The trouble is that because it is so so cheap I&#x27;m now turned off from upgrading to the more expensive Phillips products, which I probably should have tried in the first place.</li>
    <li> Obviously you can&#x27;t abuse an inexpensive product like this. If you treat it gently, it will last. For the price, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Over a year later, I&#x27;m still using this thing almost every day with the different attachments and it performs just as well as it did the day I got it.</li>
    <li> This was my second time buying this exact style...comes in handy and is exactly what I need. Will get another down the road.</li>
    <li> I had been using a more expensive li-ion trimmer from Wahl when it suddenly died.  I didn&#x27;t feel like spending $69 for another Wahl li-ion trimmer so I opted to try this one because of the high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did this one cuts better and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like my Wahl did, the battery takes longer to charge but it lasted long enough for me to do at least 10 trimmings.</li>
    <li> For such a low price, it performs really good and it has become my best companion. I love it. I got 5 of them for my friends too.</li>
    <li> this is item is ok for the price, but it is too harsh on skin, it gets uncharged sudenly, and it takes to long to recharge</li>
    <li> I have a large beard.  I have spent tons of money on these.  This is the best one I have found, and the cheapest.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget this item will work well, but I highly suggest paying extra for something less sloppy.  The carrying case for this is a bag made of cheap material.  The parts look cheap and flimsy.  I sent this back.</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it to at a great price. The attachments are nice and easy to clean using the sink. Haven&#x27;t found a single problem with it yet.</li>
    <li> Norelco lived up to its reputation for quality with the grooming system.  I have a Norelco electric shaver that has lasted for years and I expect the grooming system will be with me for many more years.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my hubby&#x27;s conair grooming system. He has been using this for quite sometime now and he is very happy with it. we are hoping to get the most out of this. We&#x27;re just happy that he doesnt have to spend $10 every 2 weeks for a haircut that we can actually do ourselves.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works fine, but it has no battery life to speak of.  You have to leave it plugged in or when you go to use it, it will be dead.  If you have a larger beard that covers a good portion of your face it might even die before finishing and it takes awhile to recharge.  I had it die on me and 30 minutes later it still didn&#x27;t have the energy to finish and i had to go to an event a little uneven which was unfortunate.  I am writing this review while searching for a better model, so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that I bought retail and the battery didn&#x27;t hold up so I went on amazon to buy another.  Great product thanks!</li>
    <li> Is it me or does the product cost $160?. I&#x27;ve had this previously and i bought it for like $20 at walgreens. Very good product.</li>
    <li> The product was good, but the adapter stopped working within six months of buying the product. i could not get a seperate adapter. Wont recommend it.</li>
    <li> $179 Ha! I got this razor at Target or something for $20. It&#x27;s a good razor. It lasted me 5 years. Just remember to keep it charged! It only runs off of the batter, so if you have a dead battery it wont run, not even if it is plugged in.</li>
    <li> Owned for a year and still going strong!!</li>
    <li> this product is garage, brand new it wont charge or hold its charge for longer than a few mins</li>
    <li> I owned this for 2 years and totally loved it. Unfortunately I lost it during travel and wanted to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I bought it for only 12 bucks and not it&#x27;s hoping 100+ (price changing everyday), what&#x27;s going on? Why the hell price increased so much for the same product?</li>
    <li> Does an okay job for light stubble but has cut my penis more than once even with the guard on. Still in search for the trimmer I once owned that worked great on my pubic hair</li>
    <li> This is a good groomer that does everything it is supposed to do. It has many different grooming heads.</li>
    <li> This product has paid for itself many times over!  I use it to keep my thin hairline short and the ease of use and long charge has it running for over two years. I haven&#x27;t visited a barber shop in years and this product will continue to save me money.  Looking for a good price to buy another one in case this one goes.  So far there is no sign of it slowing down.  Highly recommend to do it yourselfers!</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive about buying since I had not used on earlier, but went ahead given the extremely low cost of the product. And the product is really good. It gives you all you need - is a real deal.</li>
    <li> Well, I had gone around places searchin for a reasonalbly cheap trimmer. This product indeed is the lowest price you can get in the market.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these myself for me and my brother. First 6 months it worked fine but after that charger for both of machines went bad after that. Now I have two machines and I am not able to use any of them. Since I faced with both the machines, it is highly likely that it will be the same case with many of others</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco G370 AIO we&#x27;ve owned.  My husband really likes it and when we misplaced the power cord for his old one and he confessed that he had broken some of the attachments, it was time for a new one.  If the product was more expensive, I would hope that the attachments would hold up longer, but he&#x27;s had his for several years and I don&#x27;t think we spent more than $30 on it originally, so a $13-14 replacement is a pretty good deal.  Does what it is supposed to and he is happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to trim my beard and it does a great job. The many attachments are also a plus, particularly the shaver and nose hair trimmer. It is light, compact and powerful. I highly recommend it for anyone needing and all around trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product gets rid of ll my unwanted hairs easily and safely. The instruction booklet is a bit lengthy but it&#x27;s well worth the read so you properly use it. At first I was nervous to try it but as long as you&#x27;re careful, no harm will come to you. I&#x27;m glad I have this product and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> after a few recharges the battery died but it was my fault as i left it recharging too long but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you open it up with a small kitchen knife (take the head peace off and prise open the 2 sides)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then take the old rechargeable battery out - \\&quot;peel off\\&quot; positive and negative connections gently with small pliers and then reconnect a normal AA battery ( white cable (+) black one (-) from your remote control for your example&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now it works perfectly and it only takes 5 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of course every time it dies you will need to use a new battery but if you only use it a once a month like me thats cool as its better than throwing the whole thing away and now i dont need different adapters when i travel to other countries .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please dont throw the rechargeable battery in the bin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recycle it please</li>
    <li> Im very pleased with this product! cheaper, nice and easy to use! I have mine like two months ago, still works as new.</li>
    <li> I just use two times, because my hair is dense the head is very hard to pull out from shaver, it broke soon. I wonder if possible to buy some new adjustable head or my shaver is not useful at all.</li>
    <li> Does great close shaves without nipping. This is great to women to want a low cut down there without the side effects of shaving. I especially like the little bag that it comes with to contain all of the pieces once it is taken out of the container.</li>
    <li> I followed the manual. It failed to charge after the initial charge. I sent 2 of these units back and got the 3rd unit right now. I have no idea what was causing this issue but I don&#x27;t think I can recommend this to anyone. I found similar charging issues reported elsewhere online. Do your research before investing in this low cost grooming system.</li>
    <li> Works great. So far, Ive used to shave my head and a size 2 haircut for myself as well as facial hair uses and it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this does not receive a 5 star is because the closest cut isnt very close? AND because the plastic guard for cutting hair is bendable so I made a mistake by flexing my forehead while cutting my hair and that caused the plastic to allow skin in between and so I had a bald line... So I just shaved bald afterwards &amp;#62;.&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, great experience... Dont flex your forehead because it flexes your whole head.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well for eyebrows, but works amazing for nosehairs and trimming in general. Very pleased with my purcahse.</li>
    <li> I love it because it made well and price is right. And it still works after one year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the part that used to cut nose hair does not work well. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This razor/groomer greatly exceeded my expectations. Especially for the price. I definitely got more than I paid for with this groomer. It has a long lasting charge, the perfect amount and choice of attatchments, and has the closest shave of any groomer I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I highly reccommend this product to anyone wanting a top of the line groomer at a low price. I even bought a second one a gift because it dosnt get much better than this!</li>
    <li> Really nice! wanna buy the same one more, but not available at the same price</li>
    <li> el producto es de muy buena calidad y cumplió con todos mis expectativas y mas muy buena calidad  z z</li>
    <li> Poorly designed in that the button to pop the top off is right next to the switch to turn it on and off.  It works okay but the blade doesn&#x27;t get very close to the skin, so y still have an eighth of an in or so of hair left on the neck after using it.  Better to save the money that would have gone toward this and invest in a better one.</li>
    <li> SAME HERE JUST REALLY DONT KNOW BECASUE NEITHER OF THE SONS HAVE USED THE PRODUCT AT THI TIME. THEY LIKED IT WHEN THEY OPENED IT BUT NOT SURE AT THIS TIME IF IT WORKS FOR THEM AT THIS POINT.</li>
    <li> i love it. thanks so much. wonderful. thanks. thanks. thanks. thanks. keep it coming. love it for sure. thanks. thanks</li>
    <li> Trims just fine. Wide assortment of attachments. Battery holds a charge for me for about 4 days. For the price it is more then I expected. If you&#x27;re looking for the Rolls Royce of beard trimmers for 14 dollars you won&#x27;t find it. Try dropping 70 bucks on a Panasonic Milano All-in-One Trimmer..</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. It holds a charge for a very good amount of time. I use it about every two to three days to trim my beard. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> You get more than what you pay for, It has all the trimmer and with the levels,&lt;br /&gt;Good for beard shorten, trim and nose trimmer is also good,, I recommend.</li>
    <li> does everything a trimmer should do, is fairly priced, and compact.  I also use the nose hair clipper like once a month, it is the bomb, buy it.</li>
    <li> my old G370 just died, after having it for 8 years +/-. used it fr my moustache, beard, haircuts, nose and ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;the only problem with it was the recharge time, took a while, when I needed it asap many times. but for the price how can I go wrong??</li>
    <li> The only problem with this is that when you go to adjust the length, it is ridiculously easy to pull the whole head off the thing.  You have to very gently and carefully move the guard to the right setting to avoid this.  You should have to depress the button to remove the head, but you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> best rechargeable grooming system ever! easy to use, convenient and compact for traveling!better quality than a corded grooming sytem for a spectacular price! amazon is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Only charged it once, after the initial charge.&lt;br /&gt;Use this maybe three times a week for bread trimming, tree trimming, cat shaving and as a bug repellent.&lt;br /&gt;No, but seriously- fast, quiet little motor, awesome attachments come with it- super happy so far.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive about how good a 14 dollar set of clippers could be but they&#x27;ve done the job great.  I use several of the attachments.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver that does what it tauts  but have to say the attachments are pretty cheap and break easily.  but for the price you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I have read a whole lot of reviews on amazon and elsewhere before buying one. I wanted a no-nonsense trimmer that does the job and requires minimal maintenance - this one fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> This item arrived a couple days after placing the order. This is a high quality item with multiple attachments. It was an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a flimsy piece of equipment and a bad mustache trimmer...I had to shave my mustache off after using this thing and re-grow it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for grooming once every 2 months.  It&#x27;s been working great!&lt;br /&gt;I love the interchangeable adapters.  The comb is a must to get things right!</li>
    <li> This is a direct replacement of a unit I&#x27;ve had for about 10 years. Exact same fitments and attachments. REALLY glad I didn&#x27;t throw away the original unit&#x27;s handy base (holds 5 attachment, acts as a charging station and has room for mini brushes and combs - very handy). The new one doesn&#x27;t have this feature. Does have a nylon bag (so did the old one), but not having the base is a bit of a rip-off. Nevertheless, the unit performs flawlessly and holds a charge for weeks. It met all my needs, but only because I kept my old base. Too bad for new buyers. Would recommend (with caveat) to friends/family.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t bought a beard trimmer in about 10 years.  technology has changed! this thing does EVERYTHING and seems to do it well.  very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this tool for trimming my facial hair and it does a wonderful job doing that and a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get it follow the directions for charging up the battery and you will find it works for months on a single charge if your only using it to trim your facial, nose and ear hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even had a friend use it and he too purchased one from Amazon and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> This is really nice product. I just loved it. What u can expect u in 15 bucks. It does it job very well.</li>
    <li> The dry shaving comb doesn&#x27;t work so well, but all others does the job really well. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with that and recommend. Using for almost a month and never had to charge yet.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this grooming set, works wirelessly and is super light and easy to use. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does what it is for. I can even trim my hairs myself, its that handy and light weight. It was recommended by my friend to me and i definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. I am still learning to use it but that is only because I am a novice. The trimmer itself is very easy to learn and use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, some at much higher prices, but none functions as well as this one does.  I actually came looking to replace my old model G270, because after years of use, the batteries didn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.  You can&#x27;t just pop out the batteries and replace them, although there are Instructables on how to do it.  Not really worth doing though since you can buy an entire new until for $10.  Versatile and effective.  I have very short hair (what there is left of it), and use this to keep it trimmed.  Other groomers didn&#x27;t cut as evenly and were hard to get to placed like behind the ears.  Also, this one lets you easily adjust the length, for trimming closer around the ears, for example.  Great value, because the function is better than groomers costing 3x as much.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says. I bought this unit to replace the previous model when it broke, and it&#x27;s great - good trims, easy operation. Additionally, it comes with a screen shaver attachment that my old one didn&#x27;t have, but which works really well - it shaved almost as well as my manual razor.</li>
    <li> I could not find anything better in the price range...it just what I need very frequently. Easy to maintain and just do what it supposed to. I did not find any issue with battery life yet..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for about a year and for what I paid, it does the job decently, although none of its functions do a very good job like more specialized and expensive units would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mean by this is that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Nose Trimmer; but it kind of pulls your nose hairs rather that trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Mini Shaver; but if you decided to use it to actually dry shave you&#x27;d spend at least half an hour trying to get a clean shave,  your skin would be VERY irritated, and you&#x27;d still have a few hairs left that won&#x27;t get clipped no matter how many passes you give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Beard and Moustache trimmer; but the blades are rather dull and the attachments kind of flimsy and not too secure. Also, the attachment is rather large, so you can&#x27;t expect to get a very precise trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Hair Clipper; but this is just an attachment (ie. a GUARD) which goes on top of the Beard and Moustache trimmer. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever use those dull blades to cut actual head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a Precision and Detailing trimmer; which is probably the best accessory -its blades are somewhat sharp enough and the size is appropriate- but it doesn&#x27;t have a guard to use at different lengths. This sucks because this is the accessory that I would like to use as a beard trimmer, not the other larger and grotesque attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they could have designed and made better decisions with this product but overall it is somewhat acceptable and the competition is not much better at best. However, if you expect a very good shave or precise trim then this product is not for you; you&#x27;d need to spend more money and get a more expensive and specific product.</li>
    <li> The trimmer and the accessories work very well, and the charging is easy. I was disappointed by the packaging and the little satchel they gave - you basically just throw everything in rather than a somewhat organized pouch. I also found a couple of the accessories to be exceptionally loud (especially the mini shaver). I understand trimmers are generally noisy, but the basic trimmer and precision trimmer were of acceptable volume while a couple of the other accessories for some reason were surprisingly loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance-wise, it is a good product and I would recommend it. For the price I expected slightly more power out of this than it had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 for loudness &amp; performance, -1 for packaging &amp; carrying case.</li>
    <li> Still using this product and doing great, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet. Hope it last as long as the other one.</li>
    <li> I used several products for trimming. But this is the best one. also it holds charge for more than 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;amazing product.</li>
    <li> For some minor (and major) jobs, this thing really works overtime considering the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; cost of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for trimming facial hair, and even giving myself a haircut every couple of weeks, and it does the job flawlessly. I&#x27;ve used my current one for over 5 years, and not once has it given me any issues. I recently bought another one due to the price of the item being so low, and it&#x27;s always great to have a backup! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this product ,,, it works fine ,,, easy to carry ,,, I recommend this product for people who travel a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the unit I dropped and subsequently broke.  It was the same model.  I like it.  It&#x27;s simple and does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace a different manufacturer and I&#x27;m delighted that I did. This razor works beautifully! It is lightweight for travel and the battery charge is long-lasting. The four attachments slip on and off easily and it is a pleasure to operate. Keeps me neat and trim on the road in my toilet kit. Excellent value!</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer you can get for the price. Don&#x27;t think twice about it and put it in your cart right now.</li>
    <li> Only  problem is the on off switch sticks .</li>
    <li> Decent groomer.  One of the plastic tooth in the attachment broke, but other than that, it does a decent job.</li>
    <li> This review is from: Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;Got here fast, no hassle, and exactly what was shown. Everything went smoothly, and over all great experience. Recommend to anyone needing a trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awful. It pulled out my hair, made it thinner and has a horrible battery life. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Very nice grooming system - I did lots of reviews and ended up with this one - super pleased I did. Great beard trimmer and all the other accessories work great. Takes some time to learn the length of the cuts for each setting but after that it is gold. I did a lot of research on this and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was reticent to buy another cordless beard trimmer when my cheap one died after only about 8 uses. I was also unhappy with the idea that when it runs out of power, you have to wait until the battery recharges until you can use it again. The thing is that I&#x27;ve been waiting and waiting to review this hoping that the battery will run down and I can see how it behaves on recharge, but the battery is still going! It does everything too! Excellent beard trimmer attachment with adjustable head. Excellent attachment to trim nose and ear hairs. Shaver is a little cheap, but then this is not a dedicated razor and I didn&#x27;t buy it to shave with. I love this trimmer!</li>
    <li> I have this razor going on three months now and except for the initial charged, i recharged it for the first time today.  I shaved before I recharge it and I only charged it because I thought the batteries may be running low, not because it died.  I am a black man and I use this razor to shave my head and face.  It doesn&#x27;t give you the closest shave, but having your hair cut slightly above the skin prevents bumps for many black men.  I strongly recommend this razor.  Again this rancor will not give you a smooth shave but it will get you close.</li>
    <li> Great for &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; as it were.  The guard gives you a nice sense of security.  Holds a decent enough charge to get the job done (unless you are a gorilla).  Only downside is the charge time and indicator.  It takes AWHILE to charge it back up and you don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s done charging (the light stays solid, no blink or color change to let you know it&#x27;s done).  I bought 2 so I always have one ready to go.</li>
</ol>
