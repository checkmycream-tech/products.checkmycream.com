      <li>*AWESOME</li>

      <li>She loved it!</li>
      <li>THIS SEEMS TO BE A GREAT COMPANY WITH INCREDIBLE ROOM FOR GROWTH, AND DEVELOPEMENT INCLUDING EVOLVING THEIR PRODUCTS...    </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this is a very good sponge for bath or shower.  </li>
      <li>A great gift for a youngster transitioning from tub to shower.</li>
      <li>lol We have used the sponge for 10 baths or so and it is showing no signs of giving up.</li>
      <li>He loved it and loved that it already had soap in it</li>
      <li>the kids loved bathing with the spongebob sponge</li>
      <li>MANY PEOPLE SOOOOOO HAPPY WITH THEIR PRODUCTS</li>
      <li>&quot; when I gave him the SpongeBob Square pants sponge he was more than happy to climb in the tub...</li>
      <li>Give us more SpongeBob cartoon guys!</li>
      <li>Nice going SPONGTECH.</li>
      <li>BUT,I MUST BE HONEST AND SAY THAT I BOUGHT 5 SPONGEBOB BATH SPONGES</li>
      <li>I have the sponge now almost 2 months, and believe me or not, the sponge still has soap coming out of it, and best of all it has held up nicely, still in perfect shape, still has soap, doesn&#x27;t smell moldy, looks as new as it did right out of the box, and the most important item to me....</li>
      <li>This is an amazing way for your children to get excited about bathing!  </li>
      <li>WELL EITHER, YES THE VERY COUPLE OF TIMES, THEY ALL WORKED GREAT</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s cute.</li>
      <li>The sponge is really cute though.</li>
      <li>We have 3 kids and they all absolutely love the sponge.</li>
      <li>kids love it, and wonder where the soap is coming from.  </li>
      <li>OK...I WAS HOPING FOR A BETTER PRODUCT</li>
      <li>My kids now love bath time.  </li>
      <li>soap has lasted through more than a month of showers..</li>
      <li>You can get much better with the eight bucks you&#x27;d spend on this.</li>
      <li>We love it.  </li>
      <li>However after using it many times and seeing that the soap seems to never end, I am convince this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>My kids love this bath toy.</li>
      <li>SURE....</li>
      <li>They have so much fun in the bathtub now!!</li>
      <li>sure hope that there&#x27;s more available</li>
      <li>My kids love it and I am getting ready to purchase it for my Nephews!!  </li>
      <li>so much it&#x27;s worth it :-)</li>
      <li>very well made sponge!!!</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how much they have enjoyed this product, I have to literally pull them out of the tub, kicking and swinging..</li>
      <li>My 5-year old loved and enjoyed this for quite some time, but over several months it began to deteriorate somewhat.  </li>
      <li>my daughter is a spongebob lover made bathtime lots of fun</li>
      <li>Pretty cool.</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>They love spongebob more than any other cartoon.</li>
      <li>With a quick scrub under the tub faucet with Spongebob, I&#x27;m ready to cook and have a leisurely bath after dinner.  </li>
      <li>the soap ran out after a while (not like some of the reviewers who said it was out in a day), and it&#x27;s pretty durable to have lasted a year.</li>
      <li>They need a toothbrush to create this much enthusiasm!</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s Spongebob, but the shape and texture are the same as the sponges I use to scrub my kitchen.  </li>
      <li>This does exactly what it claims it does.</li>
      <li>AS I HAVE 5 KIDS, AND MY 3 YR OLD WAS INTRIGUED BY IT, AND HAD FUN WITH THE SPONGE IN THE TUB, RIGHT</li>
      <li>used it for 14 straight nights and it still has bubbles coming out of it.  </li>
      <li>Absolute quality, every parent needs to try this product.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve gotten these before and once the soap dries out the whole thing dries and gets kinda yucky, but the kids like it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>AS I SEE IT, AND WISH I HAD A BETTER REPORT TO OFFER, AS I SAID I AM HEAVILY INVESTED IN THEIR STOCK...    </li>
      <li>my 3 year old son!    </li>
      <li>Such a inexpensive toy and the kids get clean at the same time.</li>
      <li>I WOULDNT BUY MORE, AS THEY ARE A LITTLE ON THE PRICEY SIDE FOR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET....</li>
      <li>MY 9 YR OLD GIRL TRIED IT, AND WHEN SHE WAS DONE, I NOTICED THERE WASNT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m running late, no time for even a quick shower, and my feet in my Crocs are just gross.  </li>

<li> Nothing worse than getting something for the kids that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> Hi,    When I bought this product I was skeptical.</li>
<li> I AM SHOCKED TO SEE SOOOOOOO  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My 5-year old loved and enjoyed this for quite some time, but over several months it began to deteriorate somewhat.  But, it is something that is not designed to last forever anyways.  It was definitely worth the money.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome gift that keeps on giving!!  My kids love it and I am getting ready to purchase it for my Nephews!!  They have so much fun in the bathtub now!!</li>
    <li> I bought it on a lark after reading the other reviews, I figured it would be out of soap after the second shower but after 8 showers there are still suds. So now I&#x27;m going to buy some for the kids since I have now tested it out. Nothing worse than getting something for the kids that doesn&#x27;t work. This does exactly what it claims it does. Pretty cool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these sponges on both my kids.  We love it.  This is a perfect item to put into Christmas gift baskets for friends, family and neighbors.</li>
    <li> Not sure how long it will last but it&#x27;s cute. The sponge is really cute though.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing way for your children to get excited about bathing!  They need a toothbrush to create this much enthusiasm!</li>
    <li> A friend gave me the Spongebob sponge as a joke - I don&#x27;t have any kids.  This summer, I would come in from the garden when it was time to cook dinner.  I&#x27;m running late, no time for even a quick shower, and my feet in my Crocs are just gross.  Spongebob to the rescue!  With a quick scrub under the tub faucet with Spongebob, I&#x27;m ready to cook and have a leisurely bath after dinner.  The sponge has also stayed soapy and mold-free for months.</li>
    <li> My kids love this bath toy. They love spongebob more than any other cartoon. The soap in the sponge seems to last forever too. Such a inexpensive toy and the kids get clean at the same time. I keep a few in the closet for birthday presents.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this is a very good sponge for bath or shower.  They need to make one for adults.</li>
    <li> We have 3 kids and they all absolutely love the sponge. I cannot believe how much they have enjoyed this product, I have to literally pull them out of the tub, kicking and swinging..lol We have used the sponge for 10 baths or so and it is showing no signs of giving up. Absolute quality, every parent needs to try this product.</li>
    <li> Sure, it&#x27;s Spongebob, but the shape and texture are the same as the sponges I use to scrub my kitchen.  The soap bubbles are nothing to write home about either.  You can get much better with the eight bucks you&#x27;d spend on this.</li>
    <li> Hi,    When I bought this product I was skeptical. However after using it many times and seeing that the soap seems to never end, I am convince this is the way to go. It has antibacterial qualties so it can be squeezed and left to dry. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> used it for 14 straight nights and it still has bubbles coming out of it.  kids love it, and wonder where the soap is coming from.  Can not wait for the Dora sponge for my little girl.</li>
    <li> OK...I WAS HOPING FOR A BETTER PRODUCT AS I AM HEAVILY INVESTED IN TO SPONGETECH STOCK (SPNG) BUT,I MUST BE HONEST AND SAY THAT I BOUGHT 5 SPONGEBOB BATH SPONGES AS I HAVE 5 KIDS, AND MY 3 YR OLD WAS INTRIGUED BY IT, AND HAD FUN WITH THE SPONGE IN THE TUB, RIGHT AFTER HE USED IT MY 9 YR OLD GIRL TRIED IT, AND WHEN SHE WAS DONE, I NOTICED THERE WASNT ANY \\&quot;SOAPY BUBBLES\\&quot; JUST LIKE IHUB.COM BOARD    I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT SO FAR, HOPEFULLY I JUST GOT A BAD ONE, AND THE OTHERS WILL DO BETTER, I WILL TRY ONE IN THE SHOWER MYSELF TO MAKE SURE....EVEN THOUGH I HAD PREVIOUSLY BOUGHT 3 CAR WASH KITS, AND THEY DIDNT WORK SO WELL EITHER, YES THE VERY COUPLE OF TIMES, THEY ALL WORKED GREAT BUT DIDNT NOT ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT THEY CLAIM...OR THAT I HAD EXPECTED!    SO FOR THE MONEY, IF THEY DO NOT IMPROVE, NO\\&quot; I WOULDNT BUY MORE, AS THEY ARE A LITTLE ON THE PRICEY SIDE FOR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET....I AM SHOCKED TO SEE SOOOOOOO  MANY PEOPLE SOOOOOO HAPPY WITH THEIR PRODUCTS, I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG, MAYBE SQUEEZING TOO HARD....    ***AWESOME $TOCK OPPORTUNITY THOUGH, AS I PLAN ON RETIRING ONCE, THEIR ANUAL FINANCIAL REPORT IS FILED!!!!!!!!!    SORRY FOR THE NEGATIVE REVIEW, I AM JUST TELLING IT AS I SEE IT, AND WISH I HAD A BETTER REPORT TO OFFER, AS I SAID I AM HEAVILY INVESTED IN THEIR STOCK...    THIS SEEMS TO BE A GREAT COMPANY WITH INCREDIBLE ROOM FOR GROWTH, AND DEVELOPEMENT INCLUDING EVOLVING THEIR PRODUCTS...    PEACE BE WITH YOU...    SJJNAMARTIN</li>
    <li> This is the best sponge ever made! The soap is like never ending, lots of bubbles and suds.your kid will have a blast with this instead of a loofa!definitely buyin another.</li>
    <li> The sponge was a gift for one of my grandkids.  He loved it and loved that it already had soap in it so Mom didn&#x27;t have to help him.</li>
    <li> Excellent product my child loves using in the bathtub sure hope that there&#x27;s more available, why are they not in the stores</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered the SpongeBob and thought it was just another gimmick...  Well I got the SpongeBob and gave i to my tester...my 3 year old son!    He wasn&#x27;t the happiest little kid when it came to bath time. \\&quot;BUT\\&quot; when I gave him the SpongeBob Square pants sponge he was more than happy to climb in the tub... And he all of a sudden wanted wash himself, instead of me or my wife washing him.    I have the sponge now almost 2 months, and believe me or not, the sponge still has soap coming out of it, and best of all it has held up nicely, still in perfect shape, still has soap, doesn&#x27;t smell moldy, looks as new as it did right out of the box, and the most important item to me....My little boy still looks forward to using the SpongeBob sponge!    He likes it...I will buy another as soon as this one falls apart....by the looks of it, it&#x27;s going to be a long time...very well made sponge!!! Nice going SPONGTECH. Give us more SpongeBob cartoon guys!</li>
    <li> My kids now love bath time.  They have even begun looking for commercials on TV.</li>
    <li> My grandson loves to shower with Sponge Bob.  A great gift for a youngster transitioning from tub to shower.</li>
    <li> the soap ran out after a while (not like some of the reviewers who said it was out in a day), and it&#x27;s pretty durable to have lasted a year.</li>
    <li> soap has lasted through more than a month of showers.. i&#x27;ve gotten these before and once the soap dries out the whole thing dries and gets kinda yucky, but the kids like it so much it&#x27;s worth it :-)</li>
    <li> the kids loved bathing with the spongebob sponge my daughter is a spongebob lover made bathtime lots of fun yay</li>
