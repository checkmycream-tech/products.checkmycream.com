      <li>Great delivery!!  </li>
      <li>Great sale!!  </li>
      <li>They do a perfect job of keeping my hair in place!</li>
      <li>Great product!!  </li>
      <li>I especially love the &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>These are perfect for hair that you want to pull away from your face.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my use.  </li>
      <li>Good colors.</li>
      <li>NEEDS----I LOVE THEM--!</li>
      <li>The color assortment is nice and they are good for fine hair or for keeping bangs off the face.  </li>
      <li>Am ordering two more packs.  </li>
      <li>so I was glad to find them.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more from Amazon</li>
      <li>and I am so happy because I have thin and fine hair and these are actually great to keep that hair out of my face without falling out like heavier options.</li>
      <li>The size is the important thing for me</li>
      <li>These are great for holding back unruly bangs!</li>
      <li>For the money, these are good clips and inexpensive enough not to worry about breaking or losing them.  </li>
      <li>I bought nearly ten different brands and sizes of this style, and these are the best by miles.  </li>
      <li>Exactly the size I needed.</li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t hold as much hair and tend to slide out of place.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, depending on your hair type, YMMV.</li>
      <li>However, I still have a few of them, and the quality of the Goody clips I purchased years ago, is far superior to these.  </li>
      <li>exactly the size i was looking for, very hard to find in stores anymore the tiny ones are more popular</li>
      <li>I purchased them thinking that they were the same as the clips that I use to be able to find locally.</li>
      <li>I particularly like that they grip my hair well, so stay in place.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty thick and these hold them back nicely.</li>
      <li>These hold your hair back ok, but kind of painful to wear...</li>
      <li>Durable so far.</li>
      <li>I really like these for my thin fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I suspect that I will be lucky to get a few months use out of these before the teeth or springs break.</li>
      <li>I have been looking everywhere for the 1.5 inch mini clips without success for the past 6 months...</li>
      <li>The size is not too long or short, not too high or flat.  </li>
      <li>I have Goody clips of this size that I purchased years ago, and I was purchasing new ones as most of my previous set have broken by this time.  </li>

<li> Oddly enough, these exact clips are hard to find.  </li>
<li> Of course with this size I can only take small sections at a time, but these hold really well.</li>
<li> They&#x27;ve lasted me a long time already.</li>
<li> They are loose and do not hold my hair up well.</li>
<li> While they certainly *appear* to be the same, sadly their holding strength is not.</li>
<li> I can get something similar to this quality at other stores for less.</li>
<li> Delivery was prompt and item as expected.</li>
<li> The only thing is these seemed a little cheaper made than the ones I ordered previously.</li>
<li> The clasp is not too stiff or too loose.</li>
<li> I have short, thick curly hair.  </li>
<li> However, I wish the card had all black ones.  </li>
<li> The finger crossover is not too deep or too shallow.  </li>
<li> I feel like I waste money when I have to use the black ones from two cards.</li>
<li> Others fall out of my hair or are too big for my thin hair.  </li>
<li> They are a little difficult for me to open with my weak hands.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got thick wavy hair</li>
<li> Very hard to find them in any store.</li>
<li> For $6 I believe these clips should not be so flimsy, thin, and weak.</li>
<li> These clips are very poor quality.  </li>
<li> I was somewhat disappointed in these clips.</li>
<li> I am disappointed by the quality of the product.</li>

    <li> I particularly like that they grip my hair well, so stay in place.</li>
    <li> I really like these for my thin fine hair.  One of the only kinds that I can use.  Others fall out of my hair or are too big for my thin hair.  The only thing is these seemed a little cheaper made than the ones I ordered previously.</li>

    <li> Great sale!!  Great delivery!!  Great product!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> For the money, these are good clips and inexpensive enough not to worry about breaking or losing them.  The color assortment is nice and they are good for fine hair or for keeping bangs off the face.  Goody clips are practical and get the job done.</li>
    <li> Yeah!!!  I have been looking everywhere for the 1.5 inch mini clips without success for the past 6 months...finally I thought, try Amazon, they had it and I am so happy because I have thin and fine hair and these are actually great to keep that hair out of my face without falling out like heavier options.</li>
    <li> Exactly the size I needed. Good colors.</li>
    <li> USED THESE FOR YEARS ----GIVES MY HAIR THE LIFT IT NEEDS----I LOVE THEM--!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed by the quality of the product. For $6 I believe these clips should not be so flimsy, thin, and weak. They are loose and do not hold my hair up well. I can get something similar to this quality at other stores for less.</li>
    <li> They do a perfect job of keeping my hair in place!</li>
    <li> I use these claws all the time in my hair.  However, I wish the card had all black ones.  I feel like I waste money when I have to use the black ones from two cards.</li>
    <li> I have short, thick curly hair.  Cannot find these anywhere else.  They are perfect to hold my hair in push waves as my hair dries .  Could not do without them!  Am ordering two more packs.  I especially love the &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; colored clips as the are literally invisible in my hair when clipping from underneath for lift or to hold hair in place.  Grandma</li>
    <li> These are perfect for hair that you want to pull away from your face. My hair is pretty thick and these hold them back nicely. Very hard to find them in any store. I will be buying more from Amazon</li>
    <li> These hold well.  They are a little difficult for me to open with my weak hands.</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, these exact clips are hard to find.  The size is the important thing for me so I was glad to find them.  The teeth do tend to break after a while so I bought 2 sets.</li>
    <li> exactly the size i was looking for, very hard to find in stores anymore the tiny ones are more popular</li>
    <li> These are great for holding back unruly bangs!</li>
    <li> These hold your hair back ok, but kind of painful to wear...</li>
    <li> These arrived on time but they are tiny and flimsy.  I guess I missed that part in the description?</li>
    <li> Perfect for my use.  Item meets my expectation.  Delivery was prompt and item as expected.</li>
