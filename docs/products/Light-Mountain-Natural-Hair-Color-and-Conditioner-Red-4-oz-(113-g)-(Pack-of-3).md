<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using henna for 30+ years and I especially like this brand though 100 percent natural henna is pretty much all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many home coloring treatments, you have to get used to mixing and applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put some of the henna in a glass bowl. You will have to experiment over time in terms of how much to use. I put perhaps a quarter to a third of a cup (dry measurement) into the glass bowl depending on the length of my hair which can vary from above the shoulders to three inches below the shoulders. I have fine wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat a cup of water in the microwave. Do not make it super hot because you are going to put it on your head but it has to be warm enough to mix with the powdered henna. Add some of the water to the henna and whisk around with a fork. If it is lumpy, add more water. If it&#x27;s too liquidy, add more henna. You want the consistency to be liquid enough to spread into your hair from roots to tips. Too liquidy will make a mess. Too lumpy will mean you won&#x27;t get good coverage of your hair. Henna does NOT stain glass or metal utensils. It will wash away clean with hot water. (I do this b/f putting the bowl and fork into the dishwasher.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need gloves to apply the henna. You will also need plastic wrap or a disposable shower cap. Once the henna is on your hair, wrap it. Use warm water and a towel to wash the henna off your face, ears, and neck. Henna comes off the skin easily so don&#x27;t panic. Henna comes out of most fabrics too but I use old towels and an old shirt when I put henna in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have left the henna in my hair for as long as five hours. If I&#x27;m home doing work, I just leave it in. You can also wash it out in ten, fifteen, thirty minutes. The resulting color will be about the same no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re ready, wash the henna out with warm water. I use the sink rather than doing this in the shower because it can get a bit messy. Once you wash the henna out, use your regular shampoo and conditioner and wash your hair as you usually do. NOTE - for the first few washes, the henna color will come off on your towels. In the 30+ years I have used henna, I have never ruined a towel or clothing. It washes out but as I said before, I use old towels and wear an old shirt when I do henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair may smell &amp;#34;henna-ish&amp;#34; until you wash it a couple of times. It&#x27;s not an offensive smell and I have never had anyone say anything about the smell. Put  some product in your hair if you want to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unhappy with the color, add baking soda to your shampoo when you wash your hair and it will come out quite quickly. Remember - henna is not a permanent chemical dye; it washes out quite subtly over time. If you have grey, henna will color it but it will be a &amp;#34;lighter shinier&amp;#34; color than the rest of your hair. I have grey and I use red henna. My real color is a couple of shades darker than the henna. After using henna, my hair looks lovely because the grey hair is a tiny bit accentuated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my hair grows out, I do not get that telltale line of &amp;#34;here&#x27;s my (chemical) hair dye and here&#x27;s my real color.&amp;#34; I usually do henna every six weeks and sometimes in between I will just do the roots and around my face. My hair grows quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up on henna after using it just once. Get used to mixing and applying it before you decide if henna is for you or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT NOTE - This review is about red henna. If you want to use black henna, do a lot of research first.usually do. NOTE - for the first few washes, the henna color will come off on your towels.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE - This review is about red henna. If you want to use black henna, do a lot of research first.</li>
    <li> I am using Henna to dye my hair in a very natural shade and it works - just need a very good rinsing and the hair will not spot anything afterwards</li>
    <li> You look like a mud monster while applying it, but the color comes out beautifully and does not fade. I have been using this product for 4 or 5 years now: I have naturally light brown hair and this colors my hair to a very natural red color. Always buy it in bulk, follow the directions, and after your first application use only as much powder as you&#x27;ll need. Instead of water I use red zinger tea to help bring out the red tones, as was suggested, though it may not make any real difference. I do it out of ritual now.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using any sort of henna on my hair. My hair was previously bleached platinum blonde, and extremely damaged. I did two henna applications over the course of three days. The first time I mixed it up with the water, an egg, and some ginger and only let it \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for about 20 minutes. I applied it on my hair, it was a lot creamier than I was expecting, and left it overnight. I rinsed it in the shower the next morning with some conditioner while combing out the larger chunks. The results were a very foxy red which almost looked natural. I would have left it, but I wanted a darker, richer color. With the next application I mixed only with water and paprika and let it \\&quot;cure\\&quot; in the refrigerator all day, say 8 hours? I applied that night again and rinsed in the morning the same way. It&#x27;s now exactly the shade of red I wanted, and my hair is in much better shape. It even brought out my natural curls which I lost with all the bleaching. Love it!</li>
    <li> After reading some of the bad reviews, I was very hesitant in trying this color, but I figured what the heck, if I don&#x27;t like it. I just won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I just finished using it for the very first time and .. I LOVE IT. I have no idea what the bad reviews are about, maybe just peoples inability of reading instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long curly and dry hair ( reddish blonde), that I have been chemically coloring forEVER. Which left my hair in not too great a shape, which is why I wanted to try this.&lt;br /&gt;I brought some destilled water to a boil in the microwave in a pyrex measuring cup, then added the powder henna and some allspice ( it has tips for adding other spices in the instructions) stirred it for maybe 3 minutes, added a little more water, till it became the right consistency. I clipped off a curl of my hair and coated it in the mixture to make sure I wasn&#x27;t gonna look like ronald McDonald, I left this for about 30 minutes and checked, it had a great shade of red. So I washed my hair, put on the gloves and slathered on the \\&quot;mud\\&quot;, it does have a grassy smell, but that was actually nice. It went on with minimal mess, I used a colorist brush for the hairline with no problem, wiped off the excess on my skin with an old wash cloth. I have NO clue where the clumpy messy comments come from, my mixture was smooth and went on pretty easy. I actually had less mess in my bathroom with the henna than with chemical haircolors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on my hair for one hour, and rinsed with a little shampoo, then put on some conditioner, rinsed again ..and WOW.. my hair looks stunning, it&#x27;s the prettiest shade of red I have EVER had on my hair, very natural even color ( and yes my darker roots did also turn up the same red as the rest of my lighter hair). My hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe people should read the instructions and description of this, before writing horrible, false reviews about how their BLACK hair was still black and how clumpy it all was.. One it clearly states what color results to expect on what color and if you get clumps like that you simply didn&#x27;t do it right :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars and 2 thumbs up, easy to use great results. I will NEVER buy anything else again and most certainly my \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; days are over for good.tes what color results to expect on what color and if you get clumps like that you simply didn&#x27;t do it right :)       I give this product 5 stars and 2 thumbs up, easy to use great results. I will NEVER buy anything else again and most certainly my \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; days are over for good.</li>
    <li> This henna is very gritty and difficult to apply. I&#x27;ve used other henna that, while messy, goes on smooth. Additionally, I followed the instructions to a T each time I used this (gave it three tries) and each time it left my hair with very inconsistent color, even though I carefully applied it very thoroughly each time. It rinses out a little easier than other henna I have used, but that is the only pro and not enough of a pro that I would continue buying it. I would not buy this or recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s a gamble as to how much it&#x27;s going to color the hair…I left the heat on with a heat cap (to better contain the head) and it still was not consistent. Opt for an organic henna that allows you to not use heat. So much easier all around.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to the horrible-for-your-hair dyes I had been using, and had hoped I&#x27;d at least see healthier hair if nothing else.    I let the color stay on for six hours, and conditioned it for eight. The color was wishwash, nothing very impressive, but the worst part was I ended up with hair that felt like STRAW for MONTHS.    I had to deep condition every night for god knows how many weeks to even begin to get it back to normal, I ended up having to dye my hair with Garnier for it to feel healthy again... and that&#x27;s sad.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that Hennalucent discontinued Sunset Glo, so I tried this product last night.  It was definitely henna, with the mud-like texture and the grassy smell. I had a really difficult time getting all the grit out of my hair when I rinsed it, but the effect when I was finished was well worth the struggles.  My hair is conditioned, and the color is very natural and beautiful.  The sand-like grain brushes out very quickly when you allow the hair to dry.  I will be using the product again, it is really a beautiful result.</li>
    <li> So this is the second time I&#x27;ve used a product from this company, and also the second time I&#x27;ve been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, it&#x27;s only the third time I&#x27;ve colored my hair in my entire life, so my technique may be somewhat lacking.&lt;br /&gt;My first adventure with this company&#x27;s products involved their black dye. Not only did the stuff smell like rotten spinach (a smell which lingered for roughly two weeks), it made my scalp itchy and dry, dried my hair out horribly, and gradually turned my hair a dark shade of green. Yes, that&#x27;s right. Not black, GREEN. While I will acquiesce to the fact that many people might enjoy having dark green hair, it was not the effect I was going for. In any case, I chalked the experience up to something that I must have done wrong. Though I&#x27;m usually quite the stickler for following instructions and I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out where I&#x27;d futzed up. But still, with my inexperience I just assumed the results must be due to user error.&lt;br /&gt;  Fast forward several months and I&#x27;m thinking of trying a red color for my hair. Just for fun mind you. I&#x27;m not horribly invested in the outcome, thankfully. Well, after acquiring yet another box of their mysterious powder I once again set about stringently following the instructions. I mix it whilst making sure to avoid metal objects. I let it sit for several hours to...cure I guess? And then I let it sit on my head for another two after VERY carefully applying it to every inch of my hair. I made absolutely sure to do everything the box asked of me, strand test and all.&lt;br /&gt;The tragic results of my repeat experiment with Light Mountain products?&lt;br /&gt;  I now have carrot colored bangs, vaguely reddish ends, and extremely dark greyish hair in the middle. The effect is an odd one indeed, though my sister assures me that it&#x27;s very punk. Please note, I am normally a dark blonde. Not a dark, greyish haired person. And it has been months since my experience with the \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair dye, which thankfully has faded. So I have no explanation for the odd patch of nearly black hair that now adorns my scalp. Really, I&#x27;m not sure why I keep getting these odd results. Perhaps I have weird body chemistry. Magical anti-hair dye stuff in my skin. All I know is that the bizarre results, coupled with the spinach smell (which, to be fair, isn&#x27;t as bad with the red as it was with the black) and hair that feels like I stripped the oils out of it with paint thinner will probably prevent any repeat purchases. In the meantime, I will be researching ways to remove the orange-dark-gray-reddish plague from my follicles.explanation for the odd patch of nearly black hair that now adorns my scalp.

    <li> It will give you a great gorgeous color if your hair is right.  It might give you some red mess if it is not.  Is your hair right? I have no idea.  The only way is to try.  I have tried all shades that Light Mountain makes (except black) a few times.  Also I have a few friends who use this brand.  If I have learned anything that would be:  these shades work differently on different hair.&lt;br /&gt;Mine is dark brown with a bit of red, plus a few gray strings (5%).  I mix my henna with yogurt, egg and lemon juice.  I don&#x27;t use any water, at all. Then I keep the whole thing very warm - on top of slow boiling pot.  I keep it on my hair 2-3 hours, as long as I have time. The result is absolutely natural brownish reddish shiny color.  Nobody ever guesses that it is not my natural color.  People always ask me if I am red after my dad or my mom.  I will use this color as long as they make it. I also put it on my brows which is not recommended, so maybe you shouldn&#x27;t. But it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now my friends with really light hair or much darker follow my exact directions and come up with something rather ugly.  They think I hide some secret.  I really don&#x27;t, it is just a very capricious color.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, maybe it will work for you.  If not, try another color.  They make it great, just find your shade.</li>
    <li> after using this product, i&#x27;m saying au revoir to chemical dye! this gave me such a bright, natural looking red! i absolutely love it! the directions that came with it are very easy to understand and even have suggestions on what to mix with the henna to help with dry hair, oily hair, etc. i have brownish/auburn hair and to enhance this product for me personally, i mixed in 1 egg, some vanilla yogurt, cinnamon, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar and the most important ingredient, red zinger tea! i used the red zinger tea instead of just plain water and it produced such a difference! i also rinsed the henna out of my hair with the tea and that seemed to help as well. plus it gave it a nice raspberry smell. i would definitely recommend using the gloves that come in the box. especially when rinsing your hair out. my hands are bright orange! but somehow, the henna didn&#x27;t seem to have any staining effect on any of the clothing or parts of my bathroom that i spilled it on. it was a very easy clean up! i will be ordering this product from now on!</li>
    <li> Recently, all Hennalucent Sunset Glo color users were lost as this beloved color was discontinued. The frantic search has begun to find a replacement! And I am happy to announce that this Light Mountain Natural Hair Color in RED is a perfect alternative to Hennalucent Sunset Glo. The package has twice as much henna as hennalucent and it is good for all of us with long hair, it is soft, easy paste to apply, good smell. Please read all instructions. After 45 minutes the desired color is achieved, but for thicker hair they recommend up to 3 hours wait. They also advice heat application but I have not done it and the results are excellent. Wear gloves, cover the hair line with Vaseline to avoid staining. It washes out easily, wait 24 hours before shampooing to make the color last even longer.     Well, I am thrilled I can continue to be a redhead with no harsh chemicals  on my hair. Thank you Mountain Natural Hair Color in RED!</li>
    <li> What really bothers me is how people on amazon, leave hair product reviews without describing their exact hair type, which would affect the outcome of the product. Therefore, i will give you as much info as possible, so that you can decide for yourself if this product is right for your hair type.    My Henna Review - Light Mountain (Red)  In order to make a descent review, i will describe my hair to you and list the pros and cons of my henna experience.  -My hair is thick and curly.  -My natural haircolor is dark brown, but it had been previously dyed dark auburn (with permanent dyes) and my naturally dark brown roots had grown about 1/2 an inch on my scalp.    PROS    All Natural. I really wanted to find something eco friendly and safe for human use. So I was very excited to use this product.  The kit comes with gloves. Weeeee.    CONS    THE CONSISTENCY  The instructions say the consistency should be \\&quot;similar to softly beaten egg whites or yogurt after it is stirred\\&quot; Well, the consistency is like brown mudd and it looks a lot like diarrea and cottage bits. It took a long time to apply this thick mixture onto all of my hair. And I felt like the cavewoman from Encino man.    THE SMELL  I tried to like the smell. But I just could not get used to it. It smells like mud and moist cave, mixed with rotten green tea. Not good. And the smell did not want to get out of my hair after the first wash.    THE TIME  The directions say to \\&quot;let mixture sit covere for 1 to 3 hours\\&quot;. Good lord. Who has that kind of time? Well, i was disappointed to have to wait so long until applying it. Which took me another 1 hour and a half.    KEEPING CLEAN  This was so messy! Not fun at all!    COLOR RESULTS  The henna did not dye my roots. My hair had been previously dyed with permanent haircolor a while back. So i covered all of my hair with henna, but the henna had no effect on my black roots.  The henna did not dye my hair any redder than it had been. I wasted my money and my time,as well as my youth.  I would not recommend this henna to anyone who wants to see actual results. Or anyone with dark hair.    RINSING OUT  Rinsing this out of my hair was a b***h. Make sure you have another hour or two to try and take this product out. The water did not want to run clear any time soon. And my hair felt soooo dry. I dont think my hair was happy.    MY CONCLUSION  I feel bad giving this product a 1 star rating, but it didnt work for me not even a little. I do give the idea of the product 4 stars because the concept of having a natural and safe hair dye is a great idea. With that said....  This product was not for me. But maybe it is good for pregnant women and people who are ill and want to dye their hair without the usual harsh fumes (like with permanent dyes). So, I don&#x27;t want to dissuade people from using it if they think it might help them. And some people on here claim that it works for them.  But what I can say is....  If you are looking for vivid and bold color results, do not use this.  If you have dark hair, please dont bother. I did not expect henna to lighten my dark hair, but I did expect a red tint, which did not occur.    I really had high hopes for this product and it let me down big time. All i wanted was to continue having dark auburn hair, but in a natural way. Oh well, back to toxic permanent hair colors!    Let me say hello to my old toxic friend!</li>
    <li> I just love it, after years of using chemical dyes to color my hair I&#x27;ve switched and it&#x27;s awesome.  A bit more time consuming but well worth it.  My hair has never felt softer or healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing the same review for both the auburn and red colors because I got both and mixed them half and half. I have fairly thick, waist-length hair that is (naturally) about 30% grey and has been color treated with commercial/chemical (store bought) hair color for years. First, this covered the grey beautifully (actually better than several of the store brands I&#x27;ve used). It is messy, but, really, no messier than any other color at home product (in my opinion -but I tend to make a mess regardless). I did not experience any problems whatsoever rinsing this out, no grains or clumps, but I stirred the heck out of this when I mixed it. I saw someone say they made it the consistency of mashed potatoes and that helped them, I made it a bit thinner than than yogurt (it mentions yogurt consistency in the instructions) so that I could use a squirt bottle with it. There was MORE than enough in one packet to do my hair. I SOPPED my hair and still had some left over. I probably could have used half as  much and I have a lot of hair! The smell isn&#x27;t bad - if you don&#x27;t like the smell, add cinnamon. The package comes with a cap, gloves and very complete/detailed instructions. And the price is amazing compared to what I&#x27;ve spent for one box of hair color at walmart just to get home and find out I should have gotten two to adequately color my hair! I&#x27;m now a loyal fan and this will be my hair color from now on.</li>
    <li> I have so much praise for this product. I am a redhead, but wanted to get a bit more brilliance. What I got was a perfectly natural-looking slightly-redder shade, plus volume, softness, and shine (I use a third of a packet and leave it in for 20 minutes, no heat). The color lasts so long on me too, so I only have to reapply once every two or three months (my hair is rather thin, and I assume porous). The application process does take some careful attention, however. Use gloves, and don&#x27;t apply directly over your porcelain bathtub, because the drops will stain it. The stains come out when drenched in bleach, but it&#x27;d still be better to avoid. So I put down a trashbag to catch the drips. Application is easier with a bottle, too. For your first time, definitely try it out on hair from your brush so you know how long to leave it in/whether you want to add heat or not to make it brighter. The first few times my hair ended up rather orange, but you can wash your hair within 24 if you&#x27;re worried you did too much and some of the effect is washed away. But basically, the effort four times a year is most definitely worth it - I get so many compliments, and many people say it is the best red hair they&#x27;ve ever seen! I love to see it in the mirror and to run my hands through it. I&#x27;m positive you will love it too.</li>
    <li> This is something my sister loves.&lt;br /&gt;She says it leaves her hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the color.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this for her several times.&lt;br /&gt;She says to bring her this product when I go see her or when I send her things.&lt;br /&gt;She does recommend to use other gloves, the ones that come with it are very thin.</li>
    <li> I have natural Strawberry Blonde hair and have been using henna for years.  When I opened up the package, I was really scared to try it solo since the color of the henna reminded me of Hennalucent Sunset Glo and some of the Avigal hennas out there.  Memories came back when Hennalucent Sunset Glo made my hair the same color as Ronald McDonald.  The perfect color for me was using Hennalucent Blush Blonde with 2 TBS of Sunset Glo.  Unfortunately, my stock of Hennalucent products have run out after finding every discontinued box that I could.  I decided to take a chance and mixed the Light Mountain Red henna without adding any additives to it; I used standard hot tap water and let it cure for an hour.  I applied it, wrapped my hair in saran wrap and waited an hour.  It rinsed out well and better than Hennalucent.  The comforting feeling was seeing it after I rinsed it well and not having that severe Ronald McDonald shock factor.  It made my hair a nice bold, vibrant red color.  It really covered my white/gray hair well compared to hair dyes.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, but may try out the light red color next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year and a half now. I&#x27;ve used various brands and types of red dye over the years and by and far, this produces the richest, longest lasting color. Also, my hair feels great after I&#x27;ve used it, even without conditioning.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair and people often guess that it&#x27;s my natural color (which, alas, is a smokey ash color.)  The color is a bit intense for the first week or two, but fades reasonably while still having a pure, saturated color. It seems to remain true and red for months--until my roots get intolerable and I need to do it again.  It *is* a bit more work making the pulpy, mud spread and it takes a bit more planning and patience than ordinary hair colors. Now that I&#x27;ve done it and am used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal. I do smell like something I would feed to my rabbit for the first few days--sort of an herbal, grassy smell.  Another bonus: you can make up however much dye you want. I have shoulder-length, fine hair and found that using an entire box made too much. I just measure out accordingly and save the remaining henna for the next time.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels and shines after using Light Mountain.  Sure it&#x27;s messy, stinky, and time consuming but the results are so worth it!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product every 4 months for about 2 years now and my hair is so much shinier and I have very few split ends now.     Previously I had used Hennalucent Sunset Glow until they stopped making it, but never saw the drastic change in my hair condition that I have with Light mountain, total strangers approach to tell me how nice my hair is and what great natural color it has(most people shocked if I tell it&#x27;s colored, even people I know well). My hair naturally is Lt./Med. brown, and It turns a lovely Irish Setter red, which is a bit darker than the color the Hennalucent turned my hair. My mother who has been a chemical dyer for over 30 years switched to this product last spring and I&#x27;ve never seen her hair looking better!</li>
    <li> I used to Henna my hair 20 years ago but switched over to chemical hair color when I could no longer get good Henna locally.  When I found this on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The color is beautiful.  I haven&#x27;t had this color red in 20 years and it actually brought tears of joy to my eyes.  My hair is soft, healthy and shines. The red is rich, vibrant and looks natural. I will never go back to chemicals.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, rich color; soft, conditioned hair; and natural and cruelty-free product. Nothing more you can ask for!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 10 years. I love that it is all natural. It can be messy, and it will stain things if you drip on it. Use an old towel for a few washes after because it will stain the towel. My daughter actually tried it for the first time last month and was impressed at how healthy her hair feels. I very fine hair but this product really helps my hair stay healthy. No ammonia smells. No fired hair. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Redheads know that as they age, they tend to lose the redness in their hair and turn brown on the way to silver or grey.  My wife has been using henna to reclaim her original hair color ever since she started to turn brown.  Her old brand became unavailable, so she switched to Light Mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news about powder style henna like this one is that she is able to cover the grey in her hair as well as the brown.  Silver or grey hairs don&#x27;t take as much of the dye as brown hairs, but as a result they end up looking like strawberry blond highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be willing to follow directions, and you will have a muddy head for a few hours.  However, the colors don&#x27;t fade as much as artificial dyes, we only have to retreat because her roots show, not because the color has faded.  This product also acts more as a conditioner on your hair than a drying agent.  Your hair will not be damaged and fragile like it would be from artificial dyes, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is always very concerned that drops of henna that get on her skin might dye her skin, but we have actually never encountered this happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a bit of a mess, and I recommend having some sort of cape around your shoulders to keep it off your skin while you apply it, but it is a world safer and easier to use than any artificial dye, and it gives much better results as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair color every three months or so for over a year. It&#x27;s the best! I used to think I had to pay $60 to have a stylist douse my head in chemicals to be the red-head I long to be. But since I discovered Light Mountain, I color my hair myself for a lot less money and with no harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s fun to concoct my own brew by adding plain Greek yogurt, powdered ginger and lavender essential oil to the henna powder. The first time I tried it, I was very nervous about how it would turn out, but it&#x27;s really fabulous! The color is rich and natural and my hair feels smooth and frizzless. Each time I re-do it, I get neater and faster. So now it&#x27;s no trouble either. The results are really worth putting in the practice. The scent is kind of like hay for the first week or so after coloring, but the lavender oil helps with that, and I rather like the smell. It&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> I love light mountain. Not only is it natural - without garbage in it - but it comes with handy gloves and a plastic hair cover. I use it more to add thickness to my hair (it does!:) than for the color, though the color is nice, too. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this one thickens up my hair the best. I&#x27;ve noticed that the chestnut thickens better than actual red henna (the chestnut isn&#x27;t henna but another herb), so I mix chestnut and dark red). AND, you can find it at a local health food store. However, it is usually cheaper to buy online if you use it alot. I find that I need a new dose after 1 month for thickening.</li>
    <li> At first, I was unimpressed. It looked like mud, took longer than a box dye to apply, and made my hair smell \\&quot;planty\\&quot; for a week. But a month later, my naturally brown hair is still red, which never ever happens with a box dye. Red just bleeds out of my hair. Also, I only needed one box for all my hair (it&#x27;s thick and halfway to my waist), which makes the henna dye a lot cheaper also.</li>
    <li> I was seriously highly surprised but the way it turned out! I never wrote the reviews. But this colour has made an impact on my life. I compete in fitness shows and for me to keep my hair healthy is very difficult with all the chemicals I put on my hair. And I have been trying to keep it red and it dries my hair so bad. I love everything natural. And this henna dye has actually made my hair not only red, naturallly looking red but also kept my curl very well, which was very difficult for me to obtain with all the products I&#x27;ve been using. I let however the dye to sit overnight in the bowl (due to the fact that my water was out for a day. Lol) and then I added papirika and left on my hair for an hour. It came out beautiful. I don&#x27;t know how long the colour will last but it doesn&#x27;t matter since it was not expensive and healthy.</li>
    <li> I use this with Light Mountain Natural black to cover my grays and give my hair a beautiful shine. Since I&#x27;m only using the henna on my roots, I can do three or four applications with one box. I mix the entire box up, then freeze what I&#x27;ve not used in an application. I wrote a detailed review on how to do this on the Light Mountain Natural Black page.</li>
    <li> Love the way this color covers grey hair</li>
    <li> works better than chemical dyes. the color takes to my hair really well and it conditions and improves my hair. most chemical dyes dry my hair out and cause damage over time.</li>
    <li> I first began using Light Mountain Natural Red Henna (100% lawsonia inermis, aka henna) twenty-mumble years ago when I was a teenager going through a hippie phase. Honestly, what attracted me to this brand in the first place was the art on the boxes-- compared to all the other henna boxes at the natural foods co-op, Light Mountain looked the least outdated with delightful artwork of different animals for each shade. I grabbed the box with the fox on it (Red) and started a two-year journey of putting muddy goop on my head every couple of months. After a few years, I got lazy and stopped using henna, transitioning to another long stretch of years of traditional chemical dyes (both drug store and salon). Then I got a random whim the other day to make another go with the henna, but couldn&#x27;t find &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; brand at my local Whole Foods. Wary of trying an untested brand, I opted to order the Red (Fox) henna from Amazon, which thanks to the Prime account I always forget to cancel, it arrived on my doorstep in 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now that the preamble is out of the way, here&#x27;s the low down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had been recently chemical dyed with a drug store dye (dark brown, Garnier Nutrisse), but I figured enough time had lapsed (about a month) that it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Some sources say not to henna over chemically dyed hair, others say go for it, so being an optimist, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of mixing and applying the henna sucked, which is why I took off one star, but that&#x27;s to be expected with this method. It is definitely more time intensive and messy than a drug store brand chemical dye. Mixing the powder with hot water requires you to stir it constantly for several minutes to get the consistency of pancake batter. I considered using the electric mixer, but decided against it because 1) it&#x27;s metal and 2) my fianc&amp;eacute; would kill me. So I just stirred and stirred and stirred ... and stirred until it smoothed out. Then I had to cover it and let it sit for an hour before I could apply the goop to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is messy. It&#x27;s basically mud. I do suggest using Vaseline around the hairline, because anywhere the mud gets will dye your skin orange. In my past experience, it fades pretty fast from the skin, so while I tried to be diligent about catching any spills, I accepted the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world if I missed a few splats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a hair dye applicator brush to apply the henna to my roots just like any other dye, and then worked my hair in sections. Scoop up some mud with the brush, slap it on the hair, work it down to the ends, repeat until hair is entirely coated. The thing with henna is that, unlike chemical dye, it doesn&#x27;t penetrate clumps of hair quite as easily, so you&#x27;ve got to be careful getting the hair coated evenly so you don&#x27;t wind up with stripes. Unless you&#x27;re going for that sort of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 30 minutes to get my hair entirely coated (I ended up using about 3/4 of the product on my shoulder length hair). I put on an old shower cap and set the timer for 1 hour (the instructions advise 1-4 hours for reds, depending on how vibrant and dark you want the color. Since I was working with dark brown hair and aiming for red highlights, I figured an hour would be enough). Every 10-15 minutes or so, I&#x27;d use a blow dryer over the shower cap to heat the henna (a step I don&#x27;t recall doing as a teenager, but maybe I missed it back then), which apparently helps keep the dye active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my hour was up, I rinsed my head under the shower for-freaking-ever (about 10 minutes, give or take) until the mud was out. Still leaching dye, I worked some non-silicone conditioner through my hair and kept rinsing until the water ran pale orange and I figured I&#x27;d gotten the vast majority of the dye off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting my hair air dry while cleaning up the mess in my bathroom, it was ready for the big reveal. Yep, just about what I had expected: A dark brown with fiery red highlights (what I think of as a natural auburn with more punch). Pretty much exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, would I recommend this product? Absolutely. Great color results, consistent (if not messy) application, and if you&#x27;ve got a couple hours to kill playing with mud, then you&#x27;re not going to be disappointed.out what I had expected: A dark brown with fiery red highlights (what I think of as a natural auburn with more punch).

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand several times, and have always had good results.  Preparation is very important, though-- most recently, I let the mixed henna sit for ~1 hour and used a blow-dryer to heat my hair (wrapped in plastic) while the paste was on.  This resulted in a really vivid auburn in my medium-brown hair, which also became quite shiny and soft.  When I&#x27;ve used this product previously, the color has not always been so vivid-- I think the heat from the hair-drying really improved it.    One reviewer was quite negative, due to the messiness, time, and smell associated with the process. While this is all true, it is NOT product-specific: if you want to use henna, you just have to live with the inconvenience.  (I am personally not bothered by the smell, but my roommate was not a fan.)  I think it&#x27;s worth it to use a dye that actually improves the look and feel of my hair, rather than damaging it as chemicals would.</li>
    <li> Easy to use Henna that is all ready to go for you. My suggestion is to add a cup of warm coffee instead of water and add some cinnamon and essential oils for a nicer smell.  Also leave this in your hair for as long as you can stand it for best results. (Stronger color.) By the way for those unfamiliar, henna doesn&#x27;t just color your hair, it conditions it. Makes your hair so healthy and strong you won&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> I had been considering dying my hair with henna for about a year, and when I saw this in a store, I decided to give it a go. I prepared it with a mix of both the product&#x27;s instructions and other instructions I found online. I mixed the powder with a bit of warm (not boiling) water and mostly lemon juice, then let it sit for 3 hours. I kept the product on for 4 hours, covered with plastic wrap and then the added baggie included in the box. It rinsed out very easily, probably within 20-30 minutes - the plastic wrap helped to keep the henna paste moist and not dry out, as the bag was loose-fitting. My hair is naturally brown, and my hair now is leaning towards bright auburn. It&#x27;s a messy process, and while a lot of time is needed to use henna, most of it is \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; time, where you are just waiting around, and the results are great.    I just want to add that I had a bit of trouble with the strand test. I applied some paste onto a bit of hair I cut off and saw absolutely no change in my hair color except that I had lightened the browns - I let it sit for 8 hours too! I think it is best to wrap the hair in plastic wrap and apply near-constant heat, to come close to what happens when you put the paste on your head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna dye for three years now and it keeps my hair bright red and healthy as well! The application process takes some time but the results are worth it since this dye does not damage hair. The kit comes with plastic gloves so that you won&#x27;t get color on your hands. I like how the color does not fade at all and this is a product I know I can rely on.</li>
    <li> Great all natural product. I have dark brown hair, I used their red henna to get some color. I left it on for an hour with applied and consistent heat, the color of my hair didn&#x27;t change all that much. I have a beautiful auburn color now, but its only visible in the sunlight. Im gonna leave it on for longer next time, maybe 2 hours or so, so that I can get a better more visible color without the direct sunlight. Would buy again :)</li>
    <li> First henna attempt. I think it was quite favorable. This was my natural color pre 35 years old. After natural red hair fades and goes a dingy brownish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed the night before, added a couple cap fulls of cider vinegar. 20 minutes to apply and 20 minutes under plastic wrap. Rinsed and rinsed and rinsed. Was shocked at first and thought it looked like a purple tinge. Now its day 5 and I think the &#x27;oxidation&#x27; people refer to has occurred and I don&#x27;t see that purple tinge anymore. Thought the hair was supposed to be dry. Probably a mistake, should have been at least damp. My husband had a hard time making it stick to the hair. Could have been I didn&#x27;t mix enough liquid into the mixture. He said it was like putting grass into a blender and trying to make it stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time around I believe I will mix some &#x27;amla&#x27; powder. Supposed to tone it down a bit but moreover helps to retain any curl that you might have. My hair has some natural curl and I&#x27;ve noticed that straight henna has relaxed it somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took five swim days before the there were no drips of orange when coming out of the pool. I do wear a latex cap. It wasn&#x27;t really noticeable but don&#x27;t bring a white towel and you have to blot your head as soon as you jump out of the pool or risk embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: Its pretty messy. Cover ALL of the bathroom floor with plastic or old newspapers and don&#x27;t track it throughout your house.  Second application I sat in the tub. Much less messier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Application: This will deepen the red so if you don&#x27;t want that then do only the roots. Does it fade? I&#x27;m still not sure if it fades that much or I just got used to it. I did a second application at 3 weeks but this is because I felt the first time not everything got covered we were rushing a lot. This time around I clipped the hair in many sections and thinned the mixture. My husband said the application went on much, much easier.</li>
    <li> Everyone I know has told me this is their favorite hair color on me.  I like it, alot too. It leaves my hair shiny and manageable. l  It&#x27;s not as convenient as &amp;#34;cover only the gray&amp;#34; and does&#x27;t last as long either.  It is also less convenient than the name brand unnatural Nice n&#x27; Easy I used to buy. It takes me 2 hours to get the results I like, and it&#x27;s messy until I got the hang of it. However the benefits are worth it got mr.  If I had read the instructions before buying I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  In this case it was worth it!  I&#x27;m ordering more again today.</li>
    <li> This product works great, and is way better for your hair because there are no chemicals.</li>
    <li> Went on easy and didn&#x27;t smell too bad. It was difficult to rinse out and left my hair feeling course until I shampooed it a few times. After a couple of washings my hair felt soft and smooth again, but the color had faded dramatically. At first my hair was a lovely even color with a nice orangey glow, after a few washings it was dull and you could see my roots. I don&#x27;t know if I did not buy a dark enough shade or if it was my love of boiling hot showers, but I had to redo my color in a different brand/ shade to get the desired results.</li>
    <li> No nasty smells! Great color! Long lasting! Why can&#x27;t I find it in stores anymore?</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You see all kinds of bottle red heads out here, now that red hair is popular.&lt;br /&gt;Many times the colors will look a little too bright, a little too purple-toned to my eye.  That&#x27;s okay&lt;br /&gt;if that is the effect one is going for.  But Light Mountain Natural Red Henna always comes out with a lush color&lt;br /&gt;that is completely believable.  In addition, it coats the hair with a conditioning and protecting layer of color - instead of opening up the cuticle to deposit color as in chemical dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is a lot messier than the chemical one, so be warned and have plenty of newspapers on the floor, a garment and towel separated out just for this and a pail or plastic tub to keep the first rinse from going down your drains. (The compost pile is the ideal place to throw this first rinse off). This is a pulverized vegetable product, so once wet it will feel like putting a mud pack on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what woman is averse to such small sacrifices to keep her locks babied by mother nature&#x27;s own hair dye that even Cleopatra reportedly used.  I sometimes combine this product with some strong coffee (in the mix, not in my body) to darken the tone a bit.  I&#x27;m always happy with the results of Light Mountain Natural Red Hair Color.</li>
    <li> How long have I dyed my hair?  Probably only myself and my mom knows my true hair color at this point.  Naturally I have this dirty brown color.  Never quite happy with it (probably because I had such a pretty color when a baby / toddler and ended up angry over how blah it decided to turn as I hit say 6) I started playing with colors at about age 13.  I&#x27;m talking a lot of colors.  When I was that young my mom, of course, didn&#x27;t let me use \\&quot;real\\&quot; dyes so I started with things like lemon juice while we were out in the sun.  I eventually graduated to drug store dyes.  Bleach.  Bright bright colors.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  From every \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair color - blonde, red, brown, black.  To funky colors: Vampire red, Napalm Orange, a purple color whose name I&#x27;ve long since forgotten.  Yeah, colors do not scare me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I do have two auto immune diseases.  I&#x27;m sensitive to chemicals.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.  Sometimes my body just flat out says \\&quot;That&#x27;s nice\\&quot; to those dyes and my hair won&#x27;t even take them.  It&#x27;s getting to be a bit much.  Still, I don&#x27;t want to stop having pretty hair.  So I decided to try natural dyes.  This one is available at a store I go to regularly.  I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews on henna sites about Light Mountain.  But I figured what the heck, it&#x27;s very easy for me to get locally and it&#x27;s on Amazon both.  I figured I&#x27;d start here and if I liked the concept but not the brand, move on to products that are tougher for me to get afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results and am posting just a small example of the before and after in pictures here.  The lighting didn&#x27;t line up perfectly though the pics were taken in the exact same spot, with the same headphones on for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is messy.  I was fooled for a moment thinking to myself \\&quot;HA, this is nowhere near as bad as the liquid chemical&#x27;y dyes I had been doing\\&quot; and then some of the liquids started to well, dry up a wee bit. and I ended up with sort of chunky (?) umm... no... clumpy (?)... well... a mud dye mess.  I then got smart and realized hey, this is not usual dye.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have to follow directions perfectly.  I can add more of this or less of that and really cannot hurt much.  In fact, I hadn&#x27;t even mixed mine with water, but lemon juice as every \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; I&#x27;d found online that I&#x27;d liked seemed to be made with all lemon juice or half that and half water.  Sooo, as the juice seemed to get soaked into the paste I just added a tiny bit of water here and there, making it easier to spread. I also added a spoonful of yogurt in my mix for extra conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to do this on a day where I&#x27;d have nowhere to be having read that the longer you can leave it on the better.  At about 7 1/2 hours I&#x27;d felt yeah, I was done.  That was a good length of time for me and having used other plant based dyes (the bright funky color ones) it does seem like using them for 4-8 hours yields the best results).  I do not own a hairdryer but do understand that adding heat can shorten that time or yield even better / brighter results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hair has never felt better and for a fairly natural looking color has never looked better.  I&#x27;ll be using this one again.f chunky (?) umm... no... clumpy (?)... well... a mud dye mess.  I then got smart and realized hey, this is not usual dye.

    <li> So I&#x27;ve recently gotten into henna hair dye because, like most of you, I want an environment friendly, chemically safe hair dye alternative. I have no problem putting the time and effort into a product if its worth the result, and my results with this were decent I think. I have normal (Neither thick nor thin), light brown and/or dirty blonde hair. I&#x27;ve used henna dye before with great results, but this came out a bit mixed up. First, it didn&#x27;t even stain my roots red, and I don&#x27;t consider my hair dark at all. Secondly, there are blond patches in my hair now, but don&#x27;t be terrified yet because I think I know why.... Thirdly, rinsing it out is very difficult, my hair is still crunchy-feeling.&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the good news, as far as the smell, to me it smells EXACTLY like fresh mowed grass, so if your fond or tolerent of that, the smell shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Now the blond patches, in the directions there is a special effects portion that says that by adding a bit of ginger, paprika, or some other herbs I can&#x27;t remember you can enhance the red tones. So I added a teaspoon of ginger, however I think chemically the henna mixture pulls pigments from whats added to it. The powder was yellow. T,T So be cautious there! Also be gentle with the heat you use because more heat in a particular area can change color results.&lt;br /&gt;  I couldn&#x27;t outright condemn this product because I don&#x27;t think I gave it a fair chance, I&#x27;m currently making another batch that I will let sit in my hair for the 3 hours instead of using heat to speed the process. However the effort, and varying results of this product make me think its not for every hair type. If your looking for an easy to use, reliable if not botherless natural hair dye product I highly recommend Surya henna hair dyes. They smell amazing, go on and wash out easily, and leave your hair thicker than previously.</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair for years with chemical color- which left my hair fried!  I was in the process of growing it out and thought I was going to have to cut it all off after my last chemical coloring. My hair was breaking off and falling out! A friend of mine recommended Light mountain henna in red, so I tried it. I will NEVER go back to chemical color again. The process of hennaing is not for the person wanting a speedy coloring. I mix my henna with yogurt, chamomile tea and paprika- then let it cure over night to release the dye. In the morning, I put it on my head (actually my husband does it for me!) and let it sit for four hours while wrapped in plastic. I usually wear a cold weather hat over it to lock in the heat- this helps the henna work better!  After four hours, I wash it out. It is kinda hard to get out since it&#x27;s like mud, but if you use conditioner as a rinse, it comes out easily. I usually wait at least two days afterward before shampooing my hair again because I want to lock the color in. What I&#x27;m left with is a beautiful dark auburn hair color that is as soft as my four year old daughter&#x27;s hair!  I kid you not! The transformation my hair has undergone while using henna is incredible. Before, it was a fried, dry mess that I thought I&#x27;d have to cut off- now, it&#x27;s a beautiful shade of auburn and the most conditioned it&#x27;s ever been! I highly suggest Light mountain henna in red!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted Light Mountain Henna customer since 1997.  This stuff rocks.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on my hair - it&#x27;s so shiny and soft.  My hair dresser has never even tried to convince me to abandon my home coloring with henna to make me buy expensive chemical highlights or color.  The color is gorgeous - what you get will depend on what you start with however.  Henna is more of a tint than a real dye.  My original hair color is mousy light brown.  With this red henna, it gets this lovely auburn with bright highlights.  Now that I&#x27;m graying a little, the gray gets covered pretty well as reddish light highlights.  The best part about using henna and this brand specifically is how good it is for your hair.  No split ends, no fried look, no frizz.  Your hair gets gorgeous color but doesn&#x27;t get damaged at all.  The color fades very gradually over 2-4 months - so by the time you&#x27;ve got terrible roots, it isn&#x27;t as obvious.  (You can certainly touch up more often.  It&#x27;s just nice that you don&#x27;t HAVE to.)&lt;br /&gt;There are a few drawbacks however, to be fair:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is messy as hell, you&#x27;ll want to drape the bathroom well and wear good gloves (don&#x27;t bother with the silly ones that come in the box).  Light mountain has improved their formula and it is much easier to work with than other brands&lt;br /&gt;2.  Once you start using it, it is hard to stop - you can&#x27;t use chemical colorings over it - you have to grow your hair out if you want to switch to traditional chemical coloring.  I don&#x27;t know why you would, honestly, but there you go.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It will stain your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful - follow the directions and wipe up any spills post haste.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your shiney happy hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a nearby health food store. To ensure that it is the right consistency and is properly made, make sure you read the instructions. You cannot use any metal to mix or boil the water in, and you have to let the mixture sit covered for several hours before applying it to your hair. So, if you miss something in that process and it doesn&#x27;t work for you, don&#x27;t blame the product. Also, this process will take up your whole day. So if you are looking for a quick way to dye your hair, this is not for you haha. Henna does color hair, it has for centuries. But, henna is a power made from a plant and you are mixing it with water. That means you will be applying a strong smelling paste/mud to your hair. It is a very muddy paste. It will also leave the smell in your hair for a while. I like the smell, so it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me. If you are looking for a natural red hair color, this is the color I recommend. I have an in-between of thick/thin hair. Naturally it is a mousy brown that lacks any red hues. I have been dying my hair blonde for years before this and have just recently been changing my hair to brown. Before using this product, I had blonde hair that I dyed red-brown at the salon. I then used this henna product and not only did it add a vibrant and natural red color to my hair, it conditioned it as well. I have also gotten so many compliments on my hair from strangers. It is a very natural red color. People are shocked when I say I am naturally not a ginger. One thing I will mention is that the non-virgin part of my hair (the chemically dyed part) faded faster than my natural color and new hair growth at my roots. It isn&#x27;t anything noticeable to other people, but just something I noticed. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just because that hair is so damaged and dry that it didn&#x27;t soak in as well as my healthy hair. LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Also love that there is no animal testing. That is so awesome. I highly recommend this to people who dye their hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful rich red color that even covers the greys! Here&#x27;s what I do...Mix with warm tap water to the consistency of yogurt, stir well and let sit overnight covered in a warm spot in your home. Apply henna to hair section by section until entire head is completely coated. Remove any henna on skin, or else it will stain for a few days. Cover hair with plastic cap and let sit for 4 hours. Wash well, shampoo and condition and enjoy the brand new you! P.S. The color does not wash off or fade like other red hair dye products. Your roots will grow in and it will be time for a retouch like any other permanent color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now, the color is very natural , my hair becomes strong, healthy and shiny, I get a lot of compliments on how pretty the color is. I mix two egg yolks, some honey and olive oil along with black tea water , it conditions my hair very nicely. Will recommend to everyone, you&#x27;ll love this product .</li>
    <li> Having used Henna before to color my hair I was very excited to try this brand based on the reviews. (Plus a 3 pack for around $20 seemed like a great deal). Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. I wasn&#x27;t sure of the texture, since it wasn&#x27;t similar to other brands I have used in the past. The color fades at (what I felt to be) an alarming rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the 3 packets was a good deal, I didn&#x27;t like the quality of this brand. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve henna&#x27;d my hair about 20 times in the past half year- every wk or 2 wks, to cover about 30% snow white (big chunks, not single strands- go figure) in naturally very dark brown-black hair.  i had jet black chemical dye in at first, and became allergic to it suddenly!  i removed (color remover-2-3 times) and then bleached out (2 times) as much of the black as I could (so i wouldn&#x27;t have henna roots and black bottoms), leaving a freaking mess, really, of mismatched, light orange-y white, bleah, damaged hair (nightmare).  i then henna&#x27;d my hair using this product (Light Mountain Natural Hair Color &amp; Conditioner, Red, 4 oz (113 g) (Pack of 3)).  the first time, my hair was a bright, scary orange- not red like ronald mcd, closer to neon orange moving to brassy orange over 3 days.  since i could not use any more chem dyes, and had to do something, i henna&#x27;d over and over again (lived with yucky wacky orange), which, gradually darkened after about 5 applications in one mo., and amazingly turned a very very pretty true red. I kept henna-ing, and it got even darker over time.  now, it is a really lovely auburn with lighter red highlights, and the condition of my hair is shiny, soft, and strong.  people comment on how they love my hair all the time- random strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super-pleased with this product, but you need patience.  i would not want to live the last half of this yr. over again hair-wise, and am not sure i would have had the patience to do this, except for the predicament i was in (btw, the whole time, I&#x27;ve had longer than shoulder-length hair).  all the new snow white growth is perfectly covered (single application- absolute coverage), the new growth dark/brown black parts actually match, and i&#x27;m only doing the roots now.  i imagine if you didn&#x27;t have the same problems i did with the dye removal and bleaching processes, you&#x27;d start from a much better place, and get better results early on. i&#x27;m very efficient at henna application now, after so much practice, and i mix it a little bit thicker than the recommended yogurt consistency.  I use about 2 T of corn syrup (so it doesn&#x27;t flake- i don&#x27;t measure carefully)and boiling tap water from my metal teapot.  i tried other additions such as lemon juice, paprika, and oils, but i don&#x27;t believe there was any real difference.  I let it cure 3 hrs minimum, or overnight, and then keep it in my hair 3-6 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recently, i mixed 50g harvest moon henna-hut&#x27;s deep red product (which has other natural, but non-henna ingredients like indigo and clay)with the 100g of this product, and the power of the color was at least twice as strong-perhaps it&#x27;s the indigo.  i will definitely continue to add in henna-hut&#x27;s product, which is substantially more powerful a color. anyway, my 2 cents.  this product has saved me, actually, and I&#x27;m sooo happy that i didn&#x27;t just quit when i looked like a clown.  in retrospect, i probably should have used an auburn to begin with, but i was fearful of additional ingredients causing me reactions.  it also allowed me (without knowing this in advance) to control the color outcome gradually, since this stuff really is fairly permanent, at least in my hair. in the sun, it&#x27;s a stunning red!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, i waited a few days with the nasty bleached-out color removed hair, and could stand it no longer, before i henna&#x27;d. i did do a strand test the first 2 times (yes, i knew it would be orange-y, but i was desperate, remember) but not since.  i know i&#x27;m probably breaking all sortsa henna \\&quot;rules\\&quot; here, but this is just my experience. it seems that the key to the correct color for me (for those of you complaining about an orange, not true red color), was simply the repeated applications, gradually building up to a beautiful, amazing deep reddish brown (no need to wait for 20 applications- 5 really was truly beautiful). i wish i had known about this the years i was dying my hair black with poison. i realize this sounds like a crazy amt of work, but it&#x27;s very minimal maintenance now (roots every 2-3 wks), and it was worth it for me, since i had no other options for dying my hair--i&#x27;m just not quite ready to go w/ chunky white yet- i tried that first, and i looked like a skunk.nce now (roots every 2-3 wks), and it was worth it for me, since i had no other options for dying my hair--i&#x27;m just not quite ready to go w/ chunky white yet- i tried that first, and i looked like a skunk.</li>
    <li> If you want natural looking red hair this is what you need to buy.  You def need to follow the instructions.  DO the strand test because henna is powerful!  With this I cured it for 2 hours and then left it on my hair for 1 hour.  The results were what I call &amp;#34;florence and the machine&amp;#34; red.  Natural and beautiful.  Absolutely wash off any &#x27;mud&#x27; that gets on your skin IMMEDIATELY for it will dye you the second it hits your skin.  I dyed my hair in my bathtub because this is MESSY but FUN.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve followed instructions to the letter and product did not work at all. I have medium blond hair, never been colored nor permed. I could not find an expiration date on the box, may be the henna was too old, may be something else was the matter with this product. On top of everything, Amazon did not handle return too well, so I am not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> First of all, this should really be 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many who have reviewed this product, I decided to switch to natural dyes after reading horror stories about all the bad ingredients in chemical dyes. I have been chemically dyeing my hair a light reddish-brown for years (I was born a redhead and it faded to a light brown as I got older), but I heard good things about Light Mountain and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I think I chose the wrong shade for my skin tone. It took about 15 minutes to apply the product, and I left it on for 15 minutes (as indicated by the strand test), so the total time was about 30 minutes. It turned out a bit too orange for my taste. It could be because my hair is very fine and was probably porous from the chemical dyes (and my hair tends to take VERY strongly to red), but I was wary about leaving it on longer for fear it would turn an even brighter shade of orange. I think if I had gone with a reddish-brown shade, like the Auburn or the Mahogany, I might be happier with the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process itself was messy, but in my opinion, not much messier than chemical dyes. And yes, you will smell like a barn (though the smell isn&#x27;t that bad). I bought a roll of brown packing paper (the kind you wrap around boxes to ship) and rolled that out over the sink. I put an old towel down on the floor. I mixed the henna with distilled water that I had boiled in the microwave. I let it stand for an hour before application. I then used a bamboo skewer (there are ever-so-handy hair-dyeing tools around your kitchen) to section off the hair, and then applied the henna with my fingers. Once it was saturated, it felt like a mud pack on my hair. I covered my head with the plastic bag provided and waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen minutes later, because I was paranoid about the color, I snipped off a tiny bit of hair, rinsed it out, saw it had turned orange, and decided to rinse my head. I crouched in the tuband used the shower head (hand held) to rinse it as best as I could. Then I applied conditioner, rinsed, applied conditioner again, and rinsed a final time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels great--incredibly silky and soft, and it looks SO shiny and healthy. I never get shiny, silky hair from chemical dyes! I&#x27;m just not too happy with the color. But I read that it will tone down if you shampoo within 24 hours, so I might do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will definitely use this product again, just a different shade that&#x27;s better for my skin tone (pale, pinkish undertones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 hours later, and the color has oxidized to a deeper reddish-orange tone. This tone is much more complimentary with my skin. I was reading about henna online, and one resource said not to \\&quot;freak out\\&quot; over the initial orange color because it will \\&quot;settle\\&quot; and oxidize into a deeper tone over the next two-three days. I still think I would mix two together next time (red and brown), but I must say, the reddish-orange tone it is now looks gorgeous in the sunlight--like a newly minted penny!</li>
    <li> Being a ginger hairdresser, I can say that this is the best henna on the market. It is very hard to find elsewhere and Amazon has good prices compared to the health food stores where this is usually found. Even with some grey, it still comes out believable, though different on everyone.It lasts a good 6 weeks before washing out and lasts even longer if used consistently. I always get compliments when I use this henna. I&#x27;ve been using this since the 80&#x27;s and the product hasn&#x27;t changed a bit, which is unusual.</li>
    <li> Just switched to henna and I love it. This brand comes with clear &amp; helpful instructions for use, and one box was more than enough to cover my long hair -- I even had some left over! The process is a bit time consuming and messy, but it&#x27;s so much healthier for your hair! I love that I can give my hair beautiful color without chemicals. No burning or stinging on my scalp! I&#x27;m not really a fan of the plastic gloves and cap that it comes with, so I use a disposable shower cap and my own reusable black plastic gloves. Using a plastic brush applicator was good for around the hairline, but I found it was easier to apply with fingers for the rest of the hair. Make sure you put Vaseline or coconut oil around the hairline, ears, etc. because this WILL stain your skin, or anything else it comes into contact with. Lay some newspaper down on your work surface to catch spills. I used the Curlformers Softhood to apply heat periodically during the application. Best to do this on a day when you have enough time -- once mixed it takes 3 hours to cure, then another 3 hours on your hair, then extra time in the shower to rinse it all out. Overall, I love my results and I&#x27;m excited to see how my hair turns out with continued use.</li>
    <li> Chemical free, can&#x27;t beat that. It turned my medium brown hair a dark red, which changes to bright red in the sunlight. It is exceedingly messy, smelly and time consuming to apply but I prefer that to the lymphomas linked to chemical dye. It dyed my greys well, they turned out to be bright orange compared to the darker red of the rest of my hair, but it blends well and looks like natural highlights. I have to use two boxes for my shoulder length hair and leave it in for six hours.</li>
    <li> I used directions from a different type of henna, yet it came out great! I used a mixture of cold filtered water, lemon juice, and ginger, then let it cure for 24 hours before applying it. The texture was much smoother and it kept running down my face, but it was very easy to rinse out after 2-3 hours. My only complaint is that the kit includes only one pair of very flimsy gloves and a plastic bag for a cap. This means that you either have to try to put back on a goopy pair of plastic gloves for rinsing, or rinse without touching your hair. Buy plastic wrap and a couple of pairs of better gloves before using!</li>
    <li> Love that I can naturally color my hair - even though it takes five hours and if I mix it a little too runny my neck turns orange. haha! My hair is fine and thin enough as it is without putting it through the chemical wringer that is most hair dyes, and this was the perfect solution for me. And the bonus is that the henna in it is a natural conditioner as well. As for the smell, I mix some ground cloves in there and mm mm.</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant to buy this in red, but went ahead anyway. I have very long, very dark, ash brown hair. When I was a kid, I had all kinds of gold and reds running through it naturally from always being outside. In my 20&#x27;s I got a job that required me to wear my hair in a tight bun and I pretty much didn&#x27;t see much of the sun for about 4 years. Because of that, my hair darkened a LOT. It lost pretty much all of the natural highlights and warmth. I didn&#x27;t want to go the chemical route, and I wanted to have a bit of fun, so I chose henna.&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of debate, I chose RED henna. The hardest part of the entire process was impatiently waiting for the mix to cure before I could apply it. I did a test streak through my hair, loved it and decided to do my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;It is MESSY! Don&#x27;t think you can get away with &amp;#34;being careful.&amp;#34; Take precautions - wear clothes you don&#x27;t care about, put an old towel on the floor, and WEAR GLOVES! (Unless you&#x27;re into having orange hands.) I added chamomile tea and cinnamon to my mix and I let it cure for an 1 1/2 hours, then sit on my head for a little over an hour. I wanted to be conservative in case it was too drastic. In hindsight, I&#x27;ll probably let it cure and sit on my hair longer next time. Some people are complaining about the smell, fah. It&#x27;s really not that bad. I personally like the earthy/hay smell. The next morning I didn&#x27;t smell anything at all. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that my scalp took some of the dye, but I think it&#x27;ll go away when I wash my hair next. It&#x27;s not shockingly noticeable to anyone except to me.&lt;br /&gt;While it didn&#x27;t lighten my hair, it made it warmer looking, and thus it feels a bit lighter looking. It&#x27;s dark still, but there is a soft dark auburn glow to it. And it looks natural. It&#x27;s not ronald mcdonald red or kool-aid orange even in the sunlight. My hair still has subtle highlights, it&#x27;s not just a flat matte color. Best of all it&#x27;s shiny and glossy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect color, nice coverage, easy to use, and only need about half a box to to your entire head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years!  It covers the grey well and leaves my hair very soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> Ignore the directions, mix with coffee, I add a few drops of clove oil or powdered clove - that makes it smell really nice - as opposed to smelling like dirt...let it sit for at least 2 hours, or overnight, and leave on hair for 2-3 hours. It will NEVER fade. I have to do my roots often because my hair grows fast, I&#x27;m about 30% gray on 70% brunette, so every 4 weeks I just apply to the roots, because, again, it DOES NOT FADE. I swim in highly chlorinated pool water 1-2xs a week for 30 min.s, no cap, no fade. I did quite a bit of research, this product is the s***, very pure and totally consistent. The color is gorgeous, it will vary according to your own color, for me it&#x27;s new copper penny, super healthy and people think it&#x27;s natural (I tell them it&#x27;s henna because I&#x27;m a huge advocate of not putting poison into our scalps). Three of my friends are converts, you will be too ! I have applied it myself, it&#x27;s not too bad, but usually I mix it up and bring it to my hairdresser to apply, go home with&lt;br /&gt;a plastic cap and a doo rag - just like Lucy : ) kill a couple of hours, then rinse out it the shower with several hits of cream rinse (I like coconut). It goes right down the drain, a bit of a hose down of the shower, and Ta Da ~ it&#x27;s beautiful ! Do It !!</li>
    <li> JIve been using light moutain red henna for ovrer a year and the color is beautiful.I get complmentd every where I go. I was already a redhead when I was younger and this color was my color naturally.I also used it on my daughter which is brown headed and it is also beautiful.When I started using it I was wondering if it would cover up white hair.At first the white was kind of orange but after a couple of times it was beautiful.</li>
    <li> Exceptionally good for coloring the natural way. If your hair is not completely white you can get a nice color that looks natural. And there are no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I started using Light Mountain red henna after my local grocery stopped carrying Rainbow henna. It&#x27;s been two months, and I&#x27;m ordering a pack of my old brand now. Light Mountain leaves my (naturally light brown) hair barely tinted auburn, not the stand-out red I was used to with Rainbow. My roots and scalp stay resolutely brown. I will say that it&#x27;s nice that they include the gloves and cap, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never &#x27;dye&#x27; my hair with anything else ever again. Its the perfect color, all natural, and is just perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I use Light Mountain Red Henna and have always bought it at local health food stores.  I bought it at a competitive price through Amazon Prime this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna does not damage your hair and it doesn&#x27;t change the underlying color of your hair.  If you have dark hair, you&#x27;ll only see the results under bright light. It leaves all the natural gradations of dark and light hair and covers them with a translucent henna color (orange, in my case).  Over the years as my natural hair color has become grayer - the results of the Henna dye have become brighter.  When my hair was ash brown it looked auburn after using the henna red, now it is a much brighter orange (because redhead&#x27;s don&#x27;t really have red hair) as my roots are largely light in color, rather than darker as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Although I am over fifty, my hair still has a healthy shine and the color looks natural, as it is not a solid opaque uniform dye color. When my own hair color was darker I used the henna, once every couple of months. Now that my roots are lighter (stick straight hair) I touch up the roots every 2 or 3 weeks. Sometimes I also do my eyebrows. Apparently Light Mountain has another formula for hard to color grey hair. I still use the regular formula as my hair, though it&#x27;s turning grey, is still soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I use Petroleum Jelly on my face, nape and ears to protect the skin near the hairline and keep it from absorbing the dye. The Light Mountain directions recommend you mix the henna at least one hour before applying it; I have mixed it up to 8 hours before using it without any noticeable degradation. The henna is ground into a fine powder and I mix it with plain hot tap water into a loose wet paste. I don&#x27;t add anything else to the mix.  When I apply it I use a rattail comb to part my hair and apply the henna to the roots, section by section. I cover my head with Saran Wrap or sometimes just with a plastic bag and I leave it on from 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I rinse the henna out, I do it in the kitchen sink because over time it can stain your shower&#x27;s caulking orange, and if you are using a lot of henna you don&#x27;t want to clog the drain. I just use a combination shampoo and conditioner in one and shampoo and rinse it twice.  Then I towel dry and let my hair air-dry, the henna can leave a subtle smell of wet cut grass on your hair the first day you dye it, but it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Henna is less expensive than chemical dyes.The amount of henna that comes in each Light Mountain box is enough for 2 complete hair dye jobs and about 4 root touch ups, (at least in my case). If you don&#x27;t know how to mix the henna or part your hair and apply the henna, you can find several tutorials on U Tube, which show all the steps.nd 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When I rinse the henna out, I do it in the kitchen sink because over time it can stain your shower&#x27;s caulking orange, and if you are using a lot of henna you don&#x27;t want to clog the drain.

    <li> This stuff is absolutely wonderful.  I have been using Hennalucent Sunset Glo on my hair for about 18 years.  I was so upset when I was told it was being discontinued.  I&#x27;ve never used anything else.  I also knew that I couldn&#x27;t use any other type of color on my hair since you&#x27;re not supposed to use conventional color products over henna.  I did some research.  I asked Light Mountain customer service and SEVERAL hair stylists if I could switch to Light Mountain.  I received a unanimous answer that yes as long as you are using henna on henna there would be no problem.  I was still hesitant. I reluctantly used Light Mountain red on my hair this weekend.  I seriously could NOT be happier.  The color is beautiful.  I have dark brown hair, so I now have a lovely auburn color in my hair.  Not to mention the amazing shine.  Hennalucent always made my hair shiny as well, but I am finding Light Mountain to be a superior product.  Thanks to its creamy consistency it&#x27;s a lot easier to apply, and I had no trouble rinsing it out although you do have to rinse for a while.     After I would use the Sunset Glo I would have to wash my hair at least twice and condition it so I could at least pick through my hair.  Not the case with Light Mountain.  I panicked when I read that you don&#x27;t even wash your hair for 24 hours after using the henna.  I figured I would never get all the tangles out of my hair (which is fairly long).  Wrong again.  I had little to no trouble combing through my hair.  What an amazing product.  Another plus is I bought it at my local health food store, so I know it&#x27;s natural.  I used to dread coloring my hair because it was such a pain.  Now I find myself looking forward to it.  I can&#x27;t express how much I love this product after only one application.  If you are considering using henna I would highly recommend trying Light Mountain.  I was a Hennalucent supporter for 18 years, but now even if it wasn&#x27;t being discontinued I would never go back to it.  Light Mountain has won me over completely. One last positive is that even though it is a dollar more a box than the Hennalucent, it&#x27;s still a better bargain since you get twice as much in the package.  I could go on and on about Light Mountain. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Standard henna product, but high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to dye my hair with box dye ( I know I know, you aren&#x27;t supposed to ) and while it didn&#x27;t take because of the henna I didn&#x27;t have breakage or color change ... this was about 6 months after 1 application.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. All natural and works great. A bit messy but worth it.</li>
    <li> It has been years since I used Henna to dye my hair and I remember it being a total mess that was not worth the outcome. I&#x27;ve stopped chemically dyeing my hair over the last year or so wanting to keep toxins as much at bay in my life as possible. I bought this product because I just couldn&#x27;t live with all the premature white hairs I was getting (at 36 I shouldn&#x27;t have to look this old). My hair is naturally a lighter auburn. I followed the directions on the box exactly except used a little lemon juice in place of some of the water and cayenne (since I didn&#x27;t have any paprika like it suggested) and the color is amazing. 24 hours later it is just getting better! Bright rich red with gorgeous coppery highlights. And as far as the application~it was so much better than I remembered. The henna is a fine powder so it doesn&#x27;t make such a mess ( I remember the stuff i used to use had big chunks of vegetation in it~eww). Also, for anyone wondering about how much to make: I have really thick hair that is about two inches from my waist and one box was all i needed. I made two boxes thinking that i would need a lot but I just froze what I didn&#x27;t use for later (read about being able to do this on some blog). Anyway, this stuff rocks! Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> USDA Organic, after following directions to the tee it absolutely resulted in how I expected. I have dark hair to begin with, and it STILL tinted it red. Will buy from Light Mountain again!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product. I wanted to put some color in my hair without using harsh products. Unfortunately, my hair is still jet black and the henna was very difficult to rinse out of my hair. I let the henna sit for 3 hours before applying and I kept it in my hair for an hour. I have 2 more boxes so I&#x27;m gonna hold out hooe that the 2nd and 3rd time around will bring a color change to my hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and product was as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about five years or so and have a great result every time.  I get a good rich red color that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this henna for years. It has never let me down, I have light mouse brown hair shot with lots of pure white hairs. This makes my hair look like a natural light auburn and the white hairs go a really nice translucent red to highlight it. Now I do add fresh squeezed lemon juice to the mix and let it sit for a couple of hours before I dye and then let it set on my hair for as long as I can stand it (I can usually last around 3-4 hours) All of this is in the instructions though so it is not just something that I do. This typically lasts me a couple of months then starts to be noticeable in the roots, the dye in the hair lasts longer than it takes me to redye around every couple of months.</li>
    <li> I bought the product with my sister. We are/were heavy chemical dye users, her and I hadn&#x27;t dyed our hair in about 4 weeks. We had mixed it and let it sit overnight and applied it in the morning. I have super long thick hair down to my middle / lower back . My sister has shoulder length hair and very thick also. We kept this on for 6 hrs until our necks felt like they were going to break. We both were very un happy her brown was very dull and looked almost green and my red Hardly visible . Only my roots turned a slight auburn and the rest of my hair was like a milky brown. Not only did both our colors come out horrible this product was such a pain in the butt to wash out. I was in the shower close to an hr washing my hair with conditioner. I must have done it over 10 times. Overall not pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> It turned my hair neon orange!</li>
    <li> I have used the red henna from Light Mountain before.  It has great color and leaves my hair soft and silky feeling.  This company is reliable with product purity and freshness.  They also include a nice kit with each package, gloves and a cap for applications.  I will continue to purchase their products.  I have shoulder length hair, thick hair and there is ample product in each kit.  I use 1/2 to 2/3 for a single application.  I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> This is time consuming and messy but the results were amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a red head (coppery red) and was spending $240 every eight weeks getting my hair professionally colored. There are a lot of tone varients in red hair, so you can&#x27;t just dump a bottle of colorsilk on, cross your fingers and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my hair is fine, so any chemical treatments... no matter how well done (which it always was), my hair would be left with damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t distribute the color evenly. Luckily you can do this as often as you want. Time is a real factor though, start to finish is 3 hours for me. I&#x27;ve read you should really let it sit for as long as possible but I rinsed in an hour after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked perfect. But I did not follow these mixing directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured it would need some sort of acidic agent to penetrate the hair shaft without damaging it. I chose lemon juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 oz lemon juice, one pack of red henna, 45 minutes later I put it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE A LOT OF SHAMPOO when rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stood underneath the shower head letting the henna be washed away by the water. When I was clumpy mud free, I gently shampooed my hair (being careful not to tangle my fine hair). When the water ran clear I added a bit of conditioner then towel tried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOWeee. My hair had so much more depth, it was silky, shiny, and the shade of red I always wanted :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not get hard core noticeable everyone asking you about your hair results. You will get some \\&quot;Boy you look nice today, what&#x27;s different about you\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try henna hair color for some time now since it is natural and won&#x27;t damage my hair. After seeing other glowing reviews on this brand, I bought it in red at my local health food store. It is a great product. Do not expect a speedy dye job though. It is sort of like a grade school science project. In the kit is a bag of powder, you mix with distilled (or in my case filtered worked fine) water, and then cured for 2 hours. Then I applied to my hair and left on for two hours. A pair of gloves and a plastic cap are attached to the direction sheet. Try your best to keep this off your skin, it really grabs onto it- use a barrier cream around your hairline etc. And try to keep as much hair covered by the cap as possible. It is much easier to rinse out moist henna than dry crusty henna! My hair is very dark brown and in a shaggy pixie cut. It came out a lovely deep auburn after 2 hours. I also tinted my brows, although it says not to, and I don&#x27;t recommend if you have never done so before. I could have gotten 3 uses out of this one kit! Also note that while most henna is permanent, in the directions it states that this lasts 4-6 weeks. Works for me since I am trying to grow out my hair, and am easily bored! I&#x27;ll be trying the burgundy next!!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this color along with the Medium Brown color, so that I could mix the two and get an auburn shade. I brought the products to my salon and my stylist did the application for me. She mixed 2 parts red with 1 part brown and the color came out a rich, multi-toned auburn that is exactly what I wanted. And, my hair is so soft and conditioned as a result of the treatment. I will definitely continue using henna and never go back to chemical processing (which never came out exactly the color that I wanted and uses all those harsh chemicals!)     My natural color is a medium brown with auburn highlights and a few grays mixed in. The henna will cover the grays and give reddish highlights, and make the natural brown more of a richer tone. Very natural looking and there was no adjustment period where you have to wash your hair a few times because it came out too dark!</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: No matter what you do, any boxed henna will be a pain in the butt to wash out, and there&#x27;s nothing you can really do to get rid of the smell if it&#x27;s not your cup of tea. Also, let it be known that henna is semi-permanent. Therefore, it will gradually bleed out/emit a slight odor whenever you get your hair wet for the first week and a half or so before settling to a more natural looking color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, many people don&#x27;t realize that there are ways to make the application process much easier. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair with Light Mountain for years and while at first the mixture often ended up too dry and clumpy, I&#x27;ve finally achieved the perfect dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I mix about a box and a half of this henna for my long hair, using ginger tea (made with boiling hot distilled water), lemon juice, spices, and a little bit of plain yogurt. I make sure to stop adding in things when the mixture is thick and creamy, and take extra care to make sure all powder has been mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;2) Then, I let the hot mixture sit there for about an hour, covered with plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;3) While the mixture is steeping, I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner, then blowdry it until it&#x27;s almost fully dry and add in some argan oil to the bottom 2/3 of my hair, skipping the roots (I have a LOT of hair).&lt;br /&gt;4) When applying the henna, I section my hair bit by bit from the bottom up using hair ties. I use my left hand to tug on the section I&#x27;m working on to make sure I&#x27;m hitting every side of the roots, and use my right hand in a plastic glove to glop on the henna.&lt;br /&gt;5) IMPORTANT TIP: As I&#x27;m applying the henna, I also found it helpful to stir and add a little spoonful of yogurt as I go if the mixture starts to become dry in some parts.&lt;br /&gt;6) When all roots and most of the body of my hair have been covered, I wrap my hair up in plastic wrap and sit under a bonnet dryer for a full hour under the hottest setting.&lt;br /&gt;7) When I rinse out my hair, I don&#x27;t use shampoo at all. I generally use conditioners that have tons of oils in them (e.g. coconut and argan oil) to facilitate the detangling process. It still takes forever to get it all out because my hair is so long and thick, and when I&#x27;m finally done with the second rinse I pat my hair dry and put in more argan oil to rescue it from the damage.&lt;br /&gt;8) I try to wait at least a day and a half to wash my hair, and when I do I sometimes only use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes it sound completely awful and while those 4 hours of mixing and applying and sitting and washing suck, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Henna has done wonders for the health of my hair and makes it look absolutely spectacular in the sunlight. I&#x27;ve received so many complements by friends, family, and hair stylists. Chemical dies are NOT worth the convenience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: Make sure you&#x27;re allowing the henna enough time to sit to release it&#x27;s color. Use yogurt to make the mixture creamier and easier to apply/stick to your roots. Also use lots of oil when washing it out and afterwards to complement the conditioning properties of henna.t my hair, I don&#x27;t use shampoo at all.

    <li> This henna is amazing!  Great even color.  Keeps it color for a long time.  It&#x27;s been two months and it&#x27;s still vibrant.  Leaves hair feeling very smooth and soft.  Makes a bit of a mess, but you can clean it up.  Does have a very strong herbal tea scent which goes away after about two days.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> This is real henna and not another form of compound henna. This brand is one of the only brands that actually has the powder straight from the plants. Many other products will claim that their products are henna, but they are really just progressive dyes. Light Mountain helped me regain my hair strength after it has been chemically dyed and bleached. Before that, I had hair loss problems and damaged hair. Thankfully, Light Mountain restored my hair, stopped it&#x27;s loss, thickened it, and gave it a lovely color as well. I definitely recommend this product and am highly pleased with it. Henna, Lawsonia Inermis, is the only dye out there that will help your hair and it is great for your hair. No chemicals. No chemical smell. Just pure henna. I am very pleased with its results. Thank you, Light Mountain!</li>
    <li> I did some research before using this.&lt;br /&gt;I found several tips and this is what I did&lt;br /&gt;I allowed it to cure for 3 hours before application. and let it stay on for another two and a half hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naturally have &amp;#34;dishwater blond&amp;#34; hair (I hate that name, ew)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in a few years so this was all virgin hair and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using  this product for almost 20 years and I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this henna right here for a couple years now, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop loving it. Box dyes burn my scalp a little, you never really know what color you&#x27;re really going to get and they&#x27;re pretty pricey for what you get (not to mention all the hazardous-waste-style trash to get rid of!) The red is a brilliant, lovely red that looks fantastic over my natural light brown, and I actually really like the smell. It&#x27;s a bit earthy/plant-y for some people, but hey, different strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To note though: take other henna users&#x27; advice, and spend more time on it than the instructions say. I mix my henna with boiling water I heated up in a glass measuring cup in the microwave, let it cure overnight, then warm it up a bit in the morning and mix an egg into it (for a little protein, and it seems to me that it makes the texture easier to apply). Then, once I&#x27;ve applied it and wrapped it up, I run a hair dryer over the outside to get it nice and warm once more, wrap a towel around my head and sit around for about five hours eating ice cream and watching anime (anime optional, ice cream not optional). It&#x27;s a good excuse to sit around in PJ&#x27;s all day. A good thorough rinse and I&#x27;m a vibrant red-auburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color does fade a bit over time, but it never gets anywhere near my natural color before my roots have grown out enough that I decide to dye it again. Also, your skin can stain, but unless the henna&#x27;s been sitting on it long enough to dry it should come off pretty easily. I don&#x27;t bother with petroleum jelly or any of that, I just make sure to scrub all around my hairline in the shower after I&#x27;ve rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, lovely product and perfect price. I&#x27;ll be a customer for years to come.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Smells great. The red color looks natural and pretty.</li>
    <li> This is great henna and some of the most affordable on the market (hint: you can find this same product for about $5/box elsewhere online. I ordered it from Amazon this time because of the super fast and free Prime shipping :)). My family has been using this henna for about 3 years now after trying every henna available from the cheap bulk powder sold at a local health food store to the ridiculously expensive henna with cute packaging (think mermaids).  We read all the info at sites like Mehandi and got very educated before settling on a product and a procedure. This LMN &#x27;red&#x27; in the fox package and the &#x27;bright red&#x27; in the wolf package produce the same results for our dark blond and light brown hair. By the way if you can get someone to do your henna for you, it will be much easier! We mix the powder with half lemon juice (buy bottled lemon juice don&#x27;t waste fresh lemons) and half water and let it sit overnight. The pigment will release sooner but the longer it sits the better the texture gets and the less messy it will be to work with! If you find it just too messy we have had great luck *mixing the product with a vegan egg replacer powder*. This has changed our henna process completely. Right before you apply the henna, add a 1/2 cup or more of egg replacer – it will thicken and smooth the texture of the &#x27;goop&#x27; and make application so much tidier and the whole process so much faster. Otherwise be prepared for a pretty messy bathroom - well worth it but it is messy and can stain your skin, towels and even grout! However you do it, be prepared for gorgeous shiny healthy red hair! The color will be more brassy for the first 3-4 days and then settle into its &#x27;real&#x27; color. After you&#x27;ve been doing it for awhile all you have to do are root touchups every few months. About once a year you can mix two boxes together and coat the whole head ( leave it on for 3-4 hours) for a super deep conditioning and allover color refresher. You will not be disappointed with this hennaand will likely never go back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, but in the last year the quality has gone way down. The henna is no longer ground into a fine powder but has coarse pieces which makes it very hard to apply. It&#x27;s really too bad because other than this issue it was an excellent product with outstanding shine and hair-strengthening qualities. I am now looking for alternatives at the local Indian and Middle-Eastern grocery stores.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, but the henna quality is lacking a bit.  I used a mixture of camomile tea, cinnamon (for smell), and low fat plain yogurt.  I let the dye release for 3 hours (at sat the bowl in a sunny spot out on my deck while covered in plastic wrap on an 80 degree day). I put the henna on before bed and let is do it&#x27;s thing for 7 or 8 hours. My hair was very lovely feeling, but the type of henna used in this product is very very orange. I usually use BAQ Yemini henna and I get a nice deep red on my already strawberry blonde hair, I would recommend this product, however. Just beware if you have very light blonde or strawberry blonde hair, use a color mix or BAQ henna instead.</li>
    <li> this product was very cheap so i was hesitant about buying it in the first place. but on top of being cheap, it smells, its chunky, its an absolute mess, and it doesnt work. I left the product on for an hour or so, which the directions dont really give you a clear indication of. when i washed out the product, i couldnt get the smell out for days! my hair had a stringy consistency, and the henna chunks were EVERYWHERE! my hair is dark brown naturally, but over the years i have lightened it a few times. so i thought that i could get some nice red highlights. the product did not change my hair color at all, and left me disappointed and stringy, smelly haired.&lt;br /&gt;my advice is to NOT buy this product unless you have very light hair and your willing to waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural unpermed hair using this product. I did like the fact that it came with multiple dyes Bc I tried using this twice on my hair on two separate occasions. First of all, the smell is very strong, and not in a good way. I tried leaving the product on as long as 3 hrs and could barely see the red color in my hair even after the 2nd attempt which I did only a few days after the 1st attempt. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for AA natural hair girls,  it did work for my Asian friend though which is why I&#x27;m giving this a 3 and not a 1</li>
    <li> I use this dye for many years and love it. It is messy, but if you use it properly, it&#x27;s great. Makes your hair healthy, covers gray and the color is great.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes and high expectations after reading so many great reviews everywhere about how life changing this is. I read the instructions to the t in order to make sure that I would get the best results. The product was drippy, runny, gritty, smelled like hay, and it stayed in my hair for days. It didn&#x27;t change my hair color in the least. I immediately contacted the seller and had the manufacturer refund me. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Henna on my hair for years, and this one was the first one I used that got me hooked. I have used the Body Art Quality henna, too, and have found the color to be similar. However, now their product sucks. I think it&#x27;s actually cut with sand, because I soaked the product with vinegar (acids help the dye release and stick to your hair better) and water with some olive oil. It was clumpy and sandy going into my hair and a total mess. When I rinsed it out, the bottom of my shower looked like I had just gotten back from the beach. Sand. If it was plant material, it would have absorbed water and not looked like that, which leads me to conclude that they are being cheap and cutting with sand. Very lame, I will pay more for a better product and not be buying this again. The color did come out bright red, but not of an even coverage.</li>
    <li> My hair is longer and starting to show signs of damage. I want to keep growing it. My hair type is 1bfii, and about 30\\&quot; long.( just brushing waist length) I have fairytale ends beginning, and they just looked too thin to me. My color also has been fading. So after some research I decided to try henna. I am SO GLAD I did! My very dark brown hair glows red in the sun anyways, so henna just deepens the glow. My hair is softer, less frizzy and healthier than ever. I did my first application 2 days ago, using Chestnut. I only let it cure for a couple of hours and then only wore it for 3-4. The color was fine, but not what I wanted. So last night I bought the red, with the fox on the box... cuz who doesn&#x27;t want to look foxy right? ( Hope my honey likes it! ) - and I just love the color! I let it cure for 4 hours, and put it on my head and slept with it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added apple cider vinegar, coffee( because I had old coffee, but no distilled water... and already have brown hair anyway...so) I also added paprika, ginger, cinnamon and allspice. I like to smell spicy! I only needed to use half a package on my hair, and will be applying the rest when needed. Though I have read many folks say its better to use BAQ ( Body Art Quality)  henna for hair, I have never tried that, and am fine with this. I think I&#x27;ll be using this for life. I posted a picture above of my hair before any henna, after chestnut, then after fox red, in sun and out of sun. It is a bit cheesy because I pasted them all together, but at least it shows the colors. Out of the sun, my hair was a dark brown, and now is a very even dark brown with a slight cast of copper. Oh! - and I smell like gingerbread,now! Seeming as it&#x27;s that time of year, it&#x27;s a cool bonus.</li>
    <li> Beware:  the brown shades contain indigo.  Leave it on too long and your hair will turn almost BLACK.  Red shades that don&#x27;t contain indigo will stay red even when left on for hours.  Colors are made from combining henna, senna, indigo.  Natural plant leaves crushed into powder.&lt;br /&gt;Messy process that makes hair full, soft and feeling luxurious.  Funky smell like hay or cut wet grass lasts a few days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave product reviews, but in this case I felt I needed to share my appreciation.  I have tried several other hennas ( since egyptian no longer sells) without much luck.  but finally,  this henna works beautifully on my fine brown hair- it feels thicker and the color is that rich reddish henna brown color I love!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using any type of henna.  I absolutely love the color, although it is in no way red, like i ordered.  Instead i have this traffic cone orange. I&#x27;m not sure if it was my own fault or if it was the henna.  I followed the directions carefully and added distilled water as well as about 5oz of brewed chamomile and mint tea. The tea itself is a almost a crimson red, so it was weird to me that it came out as orange as it did. I do love the color, but unfortunately i cannot keep it for it is deemed \\&quot;unprofessional\\&quot; in my line of work. :(&lt;br /&gt;Below is a picture taken a few hours after dying my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I decided to try a different red henna since I was out of my usual and I needed a replacement fast.  I read several reviews on it and it was as described....messy and clumpy.  The color came out darker than expected and that was okay.  I dreaded the process the next time I used the product.  I didn&#x27;t like all the prep time to ensure my bathroom wasn&#x27;t splattered with henna or the clean-up afterwards.  It didn&#x27;t seem worth it so I went back to my usual product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, all natural and great color</li>
    <li> Ok. So it&#x27;s my first time using this stuff. So here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: no chemicals, nice gloves, and plenty of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It stinks and the color is not natural. I am going to wait a week and hope the color tones down. I feel like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at your own risk. FYI it&#x27;s only about ten bucks after shipping at iherb.com.</li>
    <li> I am a natural med/dark brown with straight fine thick hair.  I have been coloring my hair with demi permanents for years every two months with brown/reds.  However, the older I get the more cautious I am getting about all of the chemicals and added ingredients in everything we consume on a daily basis.  This had good reviews and I liked the user submitted photos.  I decided to write a review after my second time coloring with Light Mountain Henna in Red.  I read the instructions and mixed accordingly.  I boiled my filtered water in a glass bowl in the microwave and slowly added it to the mix until I got the right consistency.  I also added the paprika and yogurt as suggested.  I waited an hour to let it cure and tested on my hair every hour until I got the color I liked.  My perfect recipe is to let the mixture cure for three hours, stirring every hour adding water if needed.  Then I apply with a color brush and let it sit for 2-3 hours.  This mixture is basically mud (see my user submitted photos).  I did put vaseline around my hairline and neck because this stuff does stain so use the gloves!  It will wash out in a few days though.  Anyhow, I covered my hair withe the plastic cap but did not apply heat. The hat kept moisture in the mix and kept it a little warm.  When it was time to rinse I used a 5 gallon bucket because I was not washing this mud mess down my septic tank.  Then I used quite a bit of conditioner to get the grit out of my hair until the water ran almost clear.  I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for two days.  It did smell like fresh mowed grass for a few days but I&#x27;m a country girl and like that smell!  This stuff is great.  It colors just as well as the demi permanents but gives a more vibrant-natural tone to the hair without damaging with chemicals.  Not to mention that one box is more than enough for my long hair.</li>
    <li> gives me the perfect natural shade of red ♡ makes my hair feel stronger and thicker!</li>
    <li> Gives my red hair some oomph and shine when I&#x27;m feeling blah. I often use it as a rinse rather then a pack to amplify the shine.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the gorgeous, natural red color I have achieved with Light Mountain Natural-Red!! NEVER going back to chemical hair dye!</li>
    <li> I used to use this product for years and then used a different brand. Recently bought this one again and I think the formula has changed or maybe I just got used to better stuff. I don&#x27;t remember it being this messy. The texture is awful to work with. I have long, thick hair and usually need every bit to color my hair but this stuff will not stay on my head for anything, no matter how thick or thin I make it. More ended up in little gobs on teh floor, on my arms, on my sink, anywhere except where i put it. I didn&#x27;t even bother trying to put it on the ends and threw a third of it away. It&#x27;s too much trouble. The color is nice but not any better than any other brand. I will be paying a little more for the brands I know to be more finely ground and stay put better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s so much heathier than regular hair dye. The color is incredibly vibrant and looks natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on as a mud and makes a real mess if you&#x27;re not organized, but that&#x27;s just part of the fun. I usually do it naked and use a dark colored cloth to wipe the stuff off your face, ears and wherever else it ends up. Then I take a long bath for about 60-90 minutes with it in. I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by it being a conditioner, because I find it takes a lot of traditional conditioner to rinse it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the \\&quot;fox red\\&quot; color and get compliments on it all the time. The red does sometimes look a little extreme for the first week (which is fun), but after the first few shampoos the color chills out and looks pretty natural. It also fades out nicely so you don&#x27;t get really obvious roots, although it never fades out entirely.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been a henna user for over 30 years. I was disappointed when Hennalucent discontinued Sunset glow. I am so thrilled to find this brand and the color red is absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> This was definitely kind of akin to putting a mud mask on my hair, and the smell was... akin to a spicy bog (my husband called me bog-head for a day or two) but the color, over my dark dishwater blond hair, was a very pleasant and natural looking red. I added an egg and some lemon juice to the recipe (there are directions for all sorts of additives and whatnot) and was pleased with the results. Next time I&#x27;ll definitely try adding something to mask the smell. Also, I live in the country with an old septic system and I have to wonder how septic-safe this stuff is. Obviously it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but that doesn&#x27;t always mean septic-safe. Despite the difficulty of use, the fact that this has no hormone-disrupting chemicals in it (as opposed to conventional hair dye) is enough to ensure that I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used henna for 37 years and this brand for 25 or more. It is not available where I live, so the convenience of purchasing through Amazon is great. The price for three is as good as I can get in a store an hour (each way) away. Obviously I find the product effective.</li>
    <li> I got this and used it for the first time.  It worked great!  My hair is brown now but used to be red and this made a beautiful red color and I did not have to use the harmful chemicals.  My hair is not long and not thick so I should have only used half a box instead of all of it.  I followed the directions for letting it sit for awhile to cure before putting it on my hair and I added chamomile tea for gold tones instead of plain water and some lemon juice.  My hair is soft, pretty color tone and the henna makes it have more body so it helps my very fine and sparse hair to seem thicker.  Great product.  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Light Mountain&#x27;s henna for hair. I love the intensity of the color, yet I&#x27;m still regularly asked if its natural. The conditioning effect is great too, I used to chemically dye my hair and damaged it. Henna makes it healthier. I highly recommed this brand, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the local health food store just to try out a single box before ordering in bulk online.  I&#x27;d been wanting to find an organic, natural, cruelty-free alternative to harsh, chemical hair dyes that leave an ugly carbon footprint. So I finally took the plunge this afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if I should wait the two or three days for the famous &#x27;oxidation&#x27; (darkening and mellowing) to kick in before posting this review but I am impatient so here goes. (I may revise up or down a star after a couple of days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: My hair type is fine, there is lots of it, and it is unruly and flyaway in this harsh, dry West Texas climate. Iv&#x27;e been coloring it with chemical dyes for several decades, and somewhere along the line it began going silver-white :O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was sort of three-toned before applying the henna: a dark reddish brown lower down where it&#x27;s been over-dyed numerous times (a Garnier Nutrisse auburn that&#x27;s gone dark and dull from build-up);  a lighter auburn above that (dyed only once...Sassoon does not cover Garnier, apparently); and WHITE ROOTS! (White roots because I waited the recommended 5 weeks from my last dye job, like the instructions say to do. I can read instructions). Soooo, with three-layered hair,  I knew I was in for a carnival ride. (It wasn&#x27;t THAT crazy-looking. But folks were starting to treat me like an old lady with the white creeping down my head.)  I guess I could&#x27;ve gotten the local stylist to whack off the darkest (build-up) part but I don&#x27;t trust these rural Texans to give me a passable short bob (just kidding, Texas ;-) I do like my hair long, being an outdoorsy grrl and all. But what the heck, I live in the country, the raccoons and bunnies won&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m not going anywhere important in the coming weeks, and I&#x27;m up for an experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I did some research and read what was in the box (!), I never expected henna to act like a commercial dye. I was not put off by the time involved (come on, people, it&#x27;s not THAT hard to put in the work--I found it kind of fun and old-timey), and I actually LIKE the smell of freshly-mowed hay. I didn&#x27;t expect the henna to cover my three layers equally--and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I chose the Original formula over the Color the Gray version because I didn&#x27;t want to intimidate myself with too many steps and variables before I&#x27;d gotten a feel for the henna process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used distilled water only (no tea or cider*), I&#x27;d done the strand test and sensitivity test, and I was good to go. But hey, I am the type who thinks that if a thing is good, then ten times that thing will be SO MUCH BETTER. So I let the mixture stand in the bowl for two hours, I left the henna on my hair for three hours just for good measure (only one hour in the strand test), AND I was rather liberal with the blow dryer--I used more heat on the roots. I really REALLY didn&#x27;t want the roots to stay WHITE.  I didn&#x27;t know until later that uneven application of heat was a bad idea, that heated areas, being activated longer, can turn a different, brighter shade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result: my white roots just DRANK up the henna. Can you say popsicle red? Can you say ORANGE CRUSH? Can you say Carnival Clown?? (Okay, it&#x27;s not really AS orange as a carnival clown.) The darker layer from die build-up is now a dark mahogany/rosewood color. The lighter, dyed-only-once layer is a bright coppery color and has blended in with the formerly-white roots, which are a gingery copper too. So now my hair looks two-toned rather than three-toned. (Maybe I will go up to Dallas for that stylish short cut after all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks in the reviews have said not to panic at the shocking RED you&#x27;ll get right out of the gate.  Don&#x27;t judge until it&#x27;s had time to oxidize. Well, it is very, very orangy-red at the roots, over my white hair--especially in the sun. So I won&#x27;t panic or judge yet. (I also have a box of Light Mountain Color the Gray Auburn on hand in case the bright red does not tamp down in a timely manner.) At this point I&#x27;d have to say that this is not a natural look. But I am an artist and not a banker so I think I can live with the Tori Amos locks for a little while. I will give it a few days to oxidize and darken, and if it&#x27;s still bizarre and unnatural after several washings, I will just use the box of Color the Gray Auburn sooner than I&#x27;d planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I won&#x27;t leave the henna on my head as long, I will most likely use the Color the Gray version (Auburn, for a less flamboyant shade), and I will not apply the heat unevenly. I will also use a deep moisturizer like coconut oil afterwards. My dry hair really needs it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use Light Mountain Henna again. I am happy enough with the results (so far), I don&#x27;t mind the work involved, I like the smell, and I am delighted that no bunnies have suffered for my (dubious) beauty. :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Later that same evening...Doing more research, I discover that I should&#x27;ve mixed the henna powder with something mildly acidic like cider or a lemon juice/tea concoction instead of boiling water. Why didn&#x27;t the instructions say to do this??? :-/ Now supposedly it&#x27;s not going to oxidize, so no rich, deepening of the color; it will turn a brassy orange instead and then fade right out(??) If this happens, NO EXTRA STAR for YOU, Light Mountain Henna :-( Stay tuned to my saga to see what happens next...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Update 4/18 Five days later: The orangy-red toned down a little after I washed my hair but it&#x27;s still pretty BRIGHT. I will be using the Color the Gray AUBURN soon to see how that goes.nd in case the bright red does not tamp down in a timely manner.)

    <li> I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t use distiled water. I have red hair but its more blond. It was brite red orange after I was done. I did test hair but its hard to tell what it will look like when on your head. Once a few days went buy it looked more red. So I will be buying again. My daughter has dyed her hair bark brown and it was growing out her hair is dirty blond. She used this hair dye with distiled water and let it set for an hour. Her hair turned a nice dark red and the black part a darker red. It looks great on her. But much different then mine. You have to play with it and test it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 years with great success each time. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve fund that is 100% henna. I don&#x27;t follow the package directions and do my own version with it (mixing it w/equal parts lemon juice and water the night before, leaving it on for at least 2 hours, not shampooing for an extra day) and it works permanently. I have naturally light brown hair and their color chart is mostly accurate for me. The only difference is that it got a lot darker with repeated dyeing. Don&#x27;t use it right before a big date though- it looks frighteningly orange for the first couple of days and it takes multiple shampoos to get the smell out completely. As a bonus, my hair is also permanently straighter and shiner from using this.</li>
    <li> I read that naturally red hair is harder to dye and that is definitely the case with mine. I tried to skip the salon and darken a bit using this at home but it just didnt change anything and the smell lingered in my hair for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it ,love it!!Best henna quality ever! Very pleased with purchase. Leaves milled very small almost to power, that makes rinsing easier. Color sets evenly.I had highlights prier to coloring, works great! Hair feels like a hay for awhile, don&#x27;t get scared it will be soft and  beautiful next day( do not use hair conditioner!!) ! Let henna do its magic!</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I decided to stop having my hair colored professionally. I didn&#x27;t like the expense, the commitment, or the idea of using all those nasty chemicals. I remember my mother using henna when I was a child, and I experimented with it myself as a teenager. I made the decision to try henna again, and I am so glad I did! Light mountain henna is 100% natural henna (the red is just plain henna, while other colors have plant-based colors added). None of the products contain mineral salts or damaging ingredients. Using henna IS a bit messier than using a drugstore kit - but it is really worth it. The results are amazing. I get tons of compliments on the color of my hair. I also love that henna adds volume and softness to my hair. I will never go back to commercial haircolor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a bit about me: I use the red color (with the fox on it). My hair is fine, no grey, and naturally a light (mousy) brown color. I mix the henna as instructed, allow it to sit and steep for 1 hour, then leave it on my hair for 1 hour after it&#x27;s all been applied. I rinse it with plain water, then add a natural conditioner to help get the rest out. I generally don&#x27;t wash my hair for a day or two after coloring.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a five star review. This is purely because ultimately the color is lovely, my hair got extra volume, the ingredients are natural and organic, and the price is great. I am not sure how long the color lasts because I did my dye job a few days ago but with all those other attributes the hair color is still cool with me even if it fades a bit. The color is the exact shade I expected from looking at the box and that rarely happens. It also worked with my highlights with the highlights being a lighter shade of red than the rest of my hair. I started with natural dark blonde hair. Another thing that I liked is that the amount of dye you are given is very generous. Someone with long and thick hair will not have to use 2 packages of dye like with the Garnier or Loreal. 2 people with thin hair 3 inches past the shoulder can use the dye mixture. 3 people with short thin hair can use the mixture, or 2 people with medium shoulder length hair. If you are one of those people with not a lot of hair who wants a few uses but it is worth a try and can break even to be between $2-3 a dye job. Can&#x27;t beat that for beautiful organic color that will not damage your hair or give you a headache with chemicals. You may even get more use out of it than I said because it was really thick and I can see how it can still make a nice color when cut with a bit more water than suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but since the other reviews were excellent and the price was right I decided to try this. The process was highly awkward, strange, and kind of gross. You have to boil water and mix it in a bowl with a wooden spoon so metal won&#x27;t taint the color, I used a regular metal spoon and it was fine. It turns from green powder to this brown mud that smells strange and looks exactly like dog crap. Seriously, if you have left over dye and want a good prank put this in front of your neighbor&#x27;s door or inside of his/ her mailbox, on our roommate&#x27;s pillow, or on a public toilet seat for a good laugh. It clogged up my sink really badly, the sink is having slight problems anyway but this stuff really put it over the edge and boy did I work that plunger. If you have a slip-proof mat in your shower you better take that our before you rinse your hair because cleaning the mud chunks out of those little holes is a pain in the ass. This is not fun to rinse out of your hair. I suggest that you rinse out as much as you can, scrub your hair really well with a lot of extra shampoo, and use a good conditioner so any remaining chunks slide off. I thought I got everything but had to get back in the shower. I brushed my hair, there were mud chunks on my brush, and I had to rinse my hair again and get in the shower with the brush. Just expect to take an incredibly long shower compared to the regular home DIY dye jobs and make sure to check your hair for chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, I will try a few other natural brands of dye before settling with this because the process was kind of annoying. However, I tried Herbatint, which was easy to use, and the color was not that great. Overall I would say to be patient with this stuff because the end result is high performance and you are not using chemicals.good laugh. It clogged up my sink really badly, the sink is having slight problems anyway but this stuff really put it over the edge and boy did I work that plunger.

    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have used it twice since I purchased it a few months ago. The first time, the color wasn&#x27;t as noticeable because I made a few mistakes and left it in for too little time (also, I used ginger instead of paprika). The second time (a month after the first), I mixed it with yogurt, paprika, and lemon juice, and left it in my hair with an intermittent heat source for about 6 hours. The result was incredibly shiny, conditioned, gorgeous auburn hair (my natural color was a medium brown). So far, the color has remained in my hair for 7 weeks, which is incredible. It looks really natural, which is exactly what I wanted. For the first few days before it oxidizes, it is very red, but don&#x27;t let that frighten you. In addition, my hair did smell like wheatgrass for about a week, but it&#x27;s entirely worth it. If you&#x27;re debating between products, I don&#x27;t know how others compare, but this one is entirely amazing!</li>
    <li> I used to pay 6 times more for henna until I found this one.  It works really well for those of us who are naturally red but starting to go gray.  :)  I always get compliments on my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tricks I&#x27;ve learned over the years:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Mix the henna with boiling water as the package says and add a 1/2 tsp of extra virgin olive oil to make it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;2) Let the mixture &#x27;cure&#x27; for 2 to 3 hours before applying.&lt;br /&gt;2) Once it is in your hair, leave it in for one hour.&lt;br /&gt;3) When you rinse it out, use 1 part apple cider vinegar to 1 part water and use a wide plastic comb to help get it all out.  then use your usual conditioner to wash the vinegar smell out.  This really helps set the color - I only have to do my roots now!&lt;br /&gt;4) I always line the floor and bathroom counter with cut open garbage bags so I can just throw away the mess when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;5) Keep an old wet washcloth on hand for wiping up any drops that get on your face or arms&lt;br /&gt;6) DO NOT use shampoo for the first 24 hours.</li>
    <li> it made my hair super soft and manageable. i also have a lot of shine in my hair now and they feel healthier.i dont have much trouble untangling them as i had before. it gave me a nice reddish tint on my light black/dark brown hair, its more visible outside than at home and it looks pretty but i was wishing it would give  me more reddish/orange color. i know henna dosent lighten hair color so i guess i&#x27;ll have to use hair dye for that as i have really dark hair. people who have lighter hair would definitely get more red from it i am sure. i am attaching a photo with this review just so you all can have a better idea. overall i am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Metal free. Quick Shipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in the Red color for the last year and always receive compliments on my hair...not only for the gorgeous red color, but also for the shininess and healthy quality of my hair.  I will never go back to using harsh chemical products on my hair again.  I also recommend using Alba coconut shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s gentle, has no sulphates or phalates, and leaves the hair shiny, soft, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does an awesome job of covering the grey, and it lasts for about 2 weeks before need of re-application.  The price is low enough that even with doing it every 2 weeks, is still costs less than going to a hair dresser or paying for an over the counter hair coloring product which usually needs to be touched up every 2 weeks anyway and is so harsh on the hair and scalp.  Go natural...try this out.  I&#x27;m betting you&#x27;ll be happy you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  It is a mud, so it&#x27;s gloppy and messy to apply.  For best results, use a small short trim painbrush or get a coloring applicator brush and part off hair in sections, applying the mud clear to the roots and using the paint brush to tap it in clear down.  Wear an old t-shirt or styling cape to protect your clothing, and do not apply in a room where you have carpeting as it will stain clothing and carpet..</li>
    <li> I started using Light Mountain henna in 2000 and have no intentions of switching to anything else. My hair is short with a lot of gray. I mix it, put it on my hair, sit under a hair dryer for 13 minutes, then wash it out. The whole process from start to finish takes less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Love the look. Because the gray colors differently than brown hair, my henna dyed hair has all kinds of different colors and looks more natural. I really get a lot of comments about my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;After 14 years, I have this down to a fine science. Mix in a clear glass mixing cup and put liquid henna in an old shampoo bottle to apply. Easy to apply and easy to clean up. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This worked well, turned my light brown hair to a coppery red. I didn&#x27;t like the color much, so I mixed one package red with one package dark brown, and this turned my hair a lovely dark red brown color. I left it in for two hours both times.</li>
    <li> I am a former hair dresser and have personally used this product on my own hair for many years.I have used many different brands but this one is the best quality in my opinion.  I continue to receive compliments on the color and shine of my hair. I was very happy to find a better price here than I had been paying at the health food stores and I love that it is quickly delivered right to my door.</li>
    <li> I just used this henna for the first time three days ago and I will never go back to box dye. I was a bit nervous to make the change, but I am so glad I did. I have VERY thick, coarse, wavy-ish hair, just below my shoulders. My hair has been dyed, stripped, bleached, with no break for twelve years, and it was really taking its toll on the texture. I had last dyed it about two months ago with a high-end box dye in a bright red shade, and my roots were medium to dark brown with a handful of greys.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use 2-3 boxes of dye to cover my hair, but as I mixed the henna it turned out that two boxes was just more than enough. I mixed in cinnamon, ginger, paprika, lemon juice, and a cheap Shiraz.  Applying it was no more messy than regular dye, but it is basically a clay mask in your hair. I would suggest applying it in SMALL strands, especially if you have thick hair. Also, I should have applied it to my roots first, because it got so heavy that I wasn&#x27;t really able to reach the thick of my hair. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, and it definitely beats chemicals that make your eyes water. I thought it smelled like an earthy gingerbread. My boyfriend kept making horse noises and making Sarah Jessica Parker jokes...he thought it smelled like hay.&lt;br /&gt;As for the color, it wasn&#x27;t the bright red I was expecting, however, I have changed up my color so many times that my only hope was that it would be some shade of red/ginger/auburn. It turned out a really nice medium auburn, and my roots even blended in really well. I hope that if I continue using henna, maybe I will end up with an eclectic Ariel-red, but if I don&#x27;t, at least I&#x27;m not trashing my hair with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my hair feels AMAZING. Smooth and silky and much less tangly. My hair has NEVER been so tame. I was even able to straighten it without it turning into a giant poof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it is vegan :)</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this product, because a product I had previously used was no longer available. I have dark red-gold hair that has lost much of its brilliance due to aging. This product produced a very nice coppery red that was perfect for me. Like all henna applications, it is messy and takes time and patience, but it made my hair shiny, healthy, soft, and the smell is to me (and to my husband) actually pleasant (far better than chemical dyes!). This product was reasonably priced, and I only had to use half a packet for each application, which makes it even more cost-effective. Will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> have no ideah if it&#x27;s good very excited! got the wrong color shipped to me know I have to wait even longer. I hope I do it right though</li>
    <li> Love the color and my hair feels great. It does take a long time to wash it out, it&#x27;s like sand but the result is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Love it. I was a little nervous about it staining my skin or home after reading the instructions but it cleans up easy if you don&#x27;t let it sit on the surface for hours. The hair color was fantastic. It has been about  a month since I did it and though it has faded some, my hair is still retaining the red hue, especially in the lighter parts. The smell is not sweet and perfume-y but it is also very light and doesn&#x27;t last long after you wash the dye out. Much better than any permanent hair coloring I have ever tried. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, USDA organic, color your hair without chemicals (clear link to cancer risk)</li>
    <li> This is the perfect henna for me. It is not body art quality (BAQ) but I prefer it that way. BAQ henna stains my pale skin like no tomorrow. This is still 100% henna, and turns my hair the most adorable gingery red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, it literally saved my hair. I was told by the associates at Sally&#x27;s that I could bleach bright red out of my hair and then use ash blond dye and get my natural hair color. Long story short, I ended up with silvery pink hair that was so fried it felt like a beard. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, henna is actually very healthy for your hair and the proteins in it will adhere to your tresses permanently to reverse damage (similar to keratin treatments.) After I used this dye, I had natural looking gingery hair, no split ends, and insane gloss. It was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used this, I put it directly over faded blood red dye. My hair is now a deeper, rich natural red. Once more, henna restored my hair to being glossy, thick and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to those who haven&#x27;t used this dye before:&lt;br /&gt;If you want a more gingery color, mix the powder with warm water. If you want a richer red, mix it with warm lemon juice and citric acid- also add some coconut oil into it to prevent the lemon juice from drying your hair out. NEVER leave henna on your head without a plastic wrap or shower cap. The henna will dry on your hair, become crusty and very hard to get out.&lt;br /&gt;For the first 3-5 days you have henna in your hair, it may look &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; or too bright. But it goes through an oxidation process causing it to mute to a more natural color. Don&#x27;t throw a fit and say henna didn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;ve only had it on for a day and it looks too bright.</li>
    <li> This is a good, really effective henna that you can customize to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, it&#x27;s gonna be red, so you should be expecting that. But it&#x27;s plain henna so I can use all my little tips and tricks to play with the color/conditioning, and not worry about the price like I do when I use Lush hennas (also a great choice, but more expensive.) I have dark brown hair, so most of my experimentation revolves around trying to amp up the red color so I can get a nice auburn rather than just a cinnamon brown. My hair is also thick and oily, and likes to fry with normal hair dyes (which I have used TWICE in my life and I will never again). Henna is great for a natural coloring to your hair that will leave it healthier versus fried and sad. Plus, since it will wash out in 3-4 months, you don&#x27;t really need to worry about redoing your roots. Just redo the henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips I like to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it sit for 2+ hours (this will help reduce down the time you need it on your hair, helps unlock the red color)&lt;br /&gt;Use hibiscus-based tea (for red color)&lt;br /&gt;Lemon juice (Lightens, but also be careful as this will dry out your hair)&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil (Another conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth it over your head and wrap it in plastic wrap. I&#x27;ve slept in it a few times, wrapping a towel around my head and my pillow, but this can be uncomfortable. I prefer now to let it sit for the 2+ hours and then keep it in my hair for about 3 hours during the daytime. This does also have the benefit of you being able to blast it with the hair dryer now and then (thru the plastic wrap) to increase the heat. Heat will help with the red tones and lock them into your hair for a longer-lasting shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. For the price, you can definitely afford to experiment on your own for your own perfect henna cocktail. I haven&#x27;t decided if I like this one of the Bright Red version more, but I don&#x27;t think I see too much of a difference.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re unsure about this, let me reassure you. It is 100% natural henna leaf powder and it will never damage your hair! Its one of those hair dyes that never go wrong. The worst case for this hair dye is you mix it wrong or wash it out to early. I&#x27;ve been using it for years in a variety of colors and have never been disappointed!</li>
    <li> Loved the dye! It&#x27;s a great product if you&#x27;re looking to stay chemical free. My hair looks healthy and shiny and gorgeously red.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have what they call &#x27;baby fine&#x27; hair.  At its best its never going to look lush, but when it was thinning and breaking, partly from medication I don&#x27;t take now, and partly from trying to turn it dark brown with chemicals, it looked awful.  I&#x27;d tried red before, but chemical dyes produced something between orange and red and purple, depending on the brand. At least purple was different.  Worse it was causing severe damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this and let it grow out a few inches over the cold season, and while it grew thicker minus chemicals it wasn&#x27;t thick.  I take biotin and it helps, but it didn&#x27;t make the hair stronger.  The first applicaton of henna was all over, good, grey/tan, damaged or whatever, and I was astonished at the results.  Its color is a real red.  And over time it doesn&#x27;t fade to some other odd tones like the chemical dyes do.  But most of all not only is my hair growing in thicker, its stronger.  Even the chemically dyed ends are not breaking off.  I considered trying the clear for an inbetween assist but have seen warnings it may make the red take less evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now below my shoulders for the first time in a long time and its not breaking off like it was.  I actually noticed the thickness it early on.  I have invisible brows so carefully dye them too.  But it&#x27;s nice to have something visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for application, I found it easy.  I mixed the powder and let it set for two hours this last time and it worked in one application, where it took two the first.  It is messy but then so was every chemical sort and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make the scalp sting or smell awful.  I rinced it out with the handheld showerhead and didn&#x27;t get all of it out, but it came out when I washed it a couple of days later.  The color initially was rather brassy, but within three days had gotten the full color so don&#x27;t assume it isn&#x27;t right immediately.  Mix less and wait a few days.  It didn&#x27;t run down my face and I just bought a bag of the bonnets from Walmart (with the ethnic hair stuff).  I also used my hair dryer to warm it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this since it does give highlights without having to engineer them and about fifteen minutes before rincing put it on the rest of the hair to strength it without over dying.  My hair will always be thin and wispy, but its soft and strong and close to my great grandmothers red (have a swath of her hair) and NO more unintended purple experiments...  (I picked up my son after and he kept looking around and couldn&#x27;t find me, then had this utterly mortified &#x27;Mom???  Do you know your hair is purple?&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one whole package first, then split it in half.  I may do thirds on the third box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d found this all those years ago instead of destroying my hair before I did.  Very very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add, my hair was breaking off so fast it seemed to get shorter as I tried to grow it longer.  The commercial chemicals had made it so brittal that I ended up cutting it off fairly short and starting over.  But I am SO delighted now.  It&#x27;s not thicker but with baby fine hair you are never going to get that wish, but my hair is inches longer, and noticably past my shoulders now, and holding.  The only thing I&#x27;ve done is use the henna on it which strengthens the hair.  I&#x27;m even more delighted about this than just the color.h the ethnic hair stuff).

    <li> The manufacturer should reconsider the texture it is too rough not grinded enough....It should be like powder...Other thn that it good and I appreciate the gloves included and the results are really good! I will still recommend it and continue buying it.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product ! Very straight forward instructions .  They take the guess work out of using henna for the first time. Also they give you options to eliminate the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; odor so many first time users complain about.  Brilliant ! Unlike other companies, Light Mountain is true to their word ! No hidden weird chemicals to be found ! Thank you for being one of the few companies in the world to give people a healthy choice for coloring their hair.</li>
    <li> I decided to quit using haircolor because of the damage it was doing to my hair and the chemicals. I tried this product and I am never going back!</li>
    <li> Great product, will be buying again. Comes with a cap, gloves, and instructions.</li>
