      <li>It is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Effective?</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s effective.</li>
      <li>I honestly wish that this product would become more popular.  </li>
      <li>Think it is of a good value, the wax removes easily, and it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>It melted very easily in the microwave.</li>
      <li>It is effective, but smelly and easily burned.</li>
      <li>You would LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>You get more wax (I believe, or</li>
      <li>how many times I tried to melt it in the microwave</li>
      <li>Also wish it would have came with more wood spatulas.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus for scissors and mirror.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I actually use this for my under arms and it works great!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The scissors does nothing, even scissors made for kids would have trimmed better.</li>
      <li>more cause</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many waxes before-</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions explicitly and it still burned me and then after I applied it, it broke off in chunks and took more skin than hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>If I had known it would take more than 2 days</li>
      <li>Going to try and look for something else :)</li>
      <li>I assume if I had more experience it would have been better.</li>
      <li>I used it in my underarms and it was ok.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m saving more time because I don&#x27;t have to tweeze or shave my underarms</li>
      <li>oh my god I love this stuff works for your eyebrows</li>
      <li>It works great, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love it and find it easy to use</li>
      <li>It smelled good and the wax was able to rip the hair off very well.</li>
      <li>And it takes more than a week before fine hairs start showing.</li>
      <li>Mess-free, quick, and easy to use!</li>
      <li>Easy?</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine because the professionals seem to miss a couple too, nothing a pair of tweezers can&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>Great for facial hair!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>In the picture, the oil is about 9/10 filled inside the bottle.</li>
      <li>When I saw this strip free wax</li>
      <li>well if you peel off the wax when it&#x27;s still slightly warm  - don&#x27;t let it cool too much and get crumbly or else</li>
      <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking to my original strip kit.</li>
      <li>I have tried sooooo many other at home waxes and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>The wax is an unholy abomination to clean up.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a pain to clean because it&#x27;s not water</li>
      <li>And of course I was right!  </li>
      <li>Works amazing and no mess!</li>
      <li>I am extremely satisfied with this purchase, I tried an epilator but that hurted too much.  </li>
      <li>it gets the job done but your bathroom and skin will be full of wax</li>
      <li>I am almost done with the product, last me for a good two months.</li>
      <li>you let it cool and just want the end result</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend letting it cool for a while!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Good enough for about 3/4 of the area.</li>
      <li>but once I did it on my underarms  - it was not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>It is super sticky wax...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to this product for years.  </li>
      <li>Not for the first time at-home waxer!</li>
      <li>would recommend to anyone who wants to try it out!!  </li>
      <li>Better than other waxing sets I&#x27;ve used, this was still pretty stringy and didn&#x27;t grip as nicely as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>The little mirror it comes with is a great bonus.</li>
      <li>Amazing product, it works so well and its surprisingly simple to use.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of at-home waxing kits and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sally Hansen Extra Strength all over Body Wax kit effectively since 2008.</li>
      <li>After trying many products, I settled on Sally Hansen&#x27;s lavender sensitive skin waxing kit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this works really well and does not cause much pain, more like a pulling of bandaid kind of pain, which is totally tolerable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the wax is totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>The wax did have a pleasant smell and microwaved well - it didn&#x27;t take too much playing to figure out how long to nuke it before its consistency was right.    </li>
      <li>Sally Hanson wax is a light honey yellow with a mild honey/vanilla scent, while the bright red Nads wax has a pungent chemical</li>
      <li>There is a bit of skill in doing your own brazilian/bikini, especially with hot wax.</li>
      <li>It only hurts for that few seconds that you have to rip it off but works great!</li>
      <li>Its hard to find this at my local drugstores, so its great to be able to get it here.</li>
      <li>first of all, this is my first waxing experience ever.</li>
      <li>You might as well grab your hair and rip it out with your fingers, because that&#x27;s exactly what it felt like using this product.</li>
      <li>The wax thins too much and doesn&#x27;t pull up and off at all!</li>
      <li>I would not suggest using this as a first time waxer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The wax is an unholy abomination to clean up. It&#x27;s like permanent marker in liquid form. It takes a ton of oil and scrubbing to get the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it gets the thickest, densest hair off in the first application; got my jungle crotch baby-smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed in salons and at home for more than 10 years, with a multitude of different products. I tried using this wax on my legs and it was a total disaster. The wax thins too much and doesn&#x27;t pull up and off at all!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT for underarms. This is my first try at home waxing, I have been reluctant in trying the at home versions because I was afraid of getting something that will not work.  I didn&#x27;t want to purchase a heater, strips, wax, sticks, and oil as a whole kit because they tend to be a bit expensive and I wanted something easier to work with.  I have gone to get waxed professionally and know that waxing hurts.  It seemed to hurt a little tad more than getting it professionally done but that may be because I was slower at pulling the wax off.  I missed a couple hairs but that&#x27;s fine because the professionals seem to miss a couple too, nothing a pair of tweezers can&#x27;t fix. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase, I tried an epilator but that hurted too much.  I would purchase in the future when I finish this jar.</li>
    <li> Anyone who hates this product is most likely using it wrong.  I have tried sooooo many other at home waxes and this is by far the best.  I like using it on my armpit hair as well as down below; it really leaves it smooth and clean.    Ok yes it does get a little messy and stringy but with some practice you can overcome this.    Yes it hurts but what do you expect?  You are ripping live hairs which are attached to nerves so yeah it will hurt a bit.    They claim it lasts for up to 8 weeks.  For me it lasts a little over 2 weeks until regrowth is noticeable.  Everyone is different.    This wax speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> This is terrible. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wax for years.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it at my usual store I decided to try something else recommended by the salesperson and didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I&#x27;m glad that I can order this through amazon, I don&#x27;t know why there are bad reviews about it. I love it and find it easy to use, I can&#x27;t remember if I had any problems at the beginning...all I know is that is the only one that works for me. Depends on how hot it is, it might be a little drippy but if you let it dry it&#x27;ll come right off the floor, the mirror or wherever!</li>
    <li> Save your money and pay someone to give you a wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for almost 5 years now (for my upper lips and under arms hair). I have stubborn hair and this is the only wax that works 100% for me. I&#x27;ve tried other Sally Hansen products and other brands but none of them works except this particular one. I was devastated when I can no longer find them at any drug stores or ULTA. I&#x27;m so glad there are still some here!!!! I wish they were cheaper though... at the stores you chould get them for $11 each. Anyways thank you, could not live without this wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sally Hansen Extra Strength all over Body Wax kit effectively since 2008. When I saw this strip free wax I was intrigued and since I&#x27;ve mastered using the strip wax I figured how hard could it be? Easy? yes. Effective? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a long detailed review about pubic hair and the lengths we woman folk go to to get rid of it (or at least taper it down) I&#x27;ll present you with a list of simple pros and cons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not nearly as messy as strip wax&lt;br /&gt;You get a mirror and pair of scissors with the kit. (Whee!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax became very crumbly&lt;br /&gt;Did not clear all the hair it encounters (the entire point of waxing in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;Heated up strangely and then cooled very quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking to my original strip kit. Though I appreciated the novelty of not having to use strips I simply found this kit to be far less effective and more time consuming.</li>
    <li> first of all, this is my first waxing experience ever. I have been shaving for years, and let&#x27;s just say, I have a LOT of under arm hair. Not to disgust you but...I have like 2 hair growing in one follicle, some spots even have 3 I know I&#x27;m sorry. My hair is very dark and thick either, even tweezing hurts like ohmygawd. I didnt think waxing would work on me since I have so much underarm hair like a man. But it worked wonderfully. It hurt for me, but tolerable. It&#x27;s super easy to use, microwave it anytime before using and it will cool down afterwards. And it smells like vanilla and almond. I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> Wax is hard enough to remove male public hair.  This is a problem with some products.  Shaping is not a requirement for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is amazing.  If you have a problem with it, then you must be using it wrong.  When I was new to the product, I hated it myself.  If you leave it on too long, it is brittle, crumbly, and it hurts.  If you pull it off too fast, then it&#x27;s all gooey.  But it doesn&#x27;t take too long to learn how to use it.  Soon, you begin to learn how the wax should look like to give you the best results.  I usually wait a while before adding the wax to my face.  I constantly check the consistency before using the wax.  So, that I could just put it on and remove it off.  It&#x27;s not rocket science, it doesn&#x27;t take long to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the wax is totally worth it.  You would LOVE this product. No strips. No mess.  Great for course hair.  Just put it on and pull it off.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore :(  They discontinued selling this at one point. and I still can&#x27;t find it in stores.  I&#x27;ve been loyal to this product for years.  I think Sally Hansen is the only company that makes wax that you could rip off with your fingers :(  I honestly wish that this product would become more popular.  I don&#x27;t know what to do or how to live without this product.  I mean, men could get away with walking around looking all hairy. But for a woman, that is embarrassing.  So, I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say I don&#x27;t know what to do without this product.  It is wonderful, amazing, and excellent way to remove hair. and to be honest, I hate Sally&#x27;s other products.  Regular waxing is just way too messy.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product on the shelves, I was interested in how a \\&quot;strip-less\\&quot; wax would work. Answer? IT DOESN&#x27;T!     This system starts off like most at-home wax removal kits: you microwave the wax, apply it with a wooden spatula, and rip it off. The wax did have a pleasant smell and microwaved well - it didn&#x27;t take too much playing to figure out how long to nuke it before its consistency was right.    However, the removal is where this system goes wrong. Using your fingernail, you have to pick up the bottom edge of the wax, so enough of it peels off to a point where you can grab it. (it&#x27;s soft, sticky, and pliable at this point, but solid.) Then you rip it off.    The problem is that if you wait too long to pull off the wax, it becomes brittle and just chips off. This doesn&#x27;t remove any hair, is extremely painful, and leaves you with lots of little sticky wax chips stuck on and under your fingernails.    If you don&#x27;t wait long enough, you start pulling, and the wax goops and strings up - like honey.    Even when the wax piece came off all in one piece, I found that only about 40% of my hairs were actually removed.    Stick with the strips!</li>
    <li> At first I hated this product because it was chipping off in small pieces, but after reading other reviews I tried laying it on thicker, and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions explicitly and it still burned me and then after I applied it, it broke off in chunks and took more skin than hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased this before. I am almost done with the product, last me for a good two months. I wax every 2-3 weeks. I just bought a second jar. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. Think it is of a good value, the wax removes easily, and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of overheating the wax. Once the wax was applied to my underarms it hardened pretty quickly and was hard to remove. It is sitting in the corner of my bathroom drawer. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great but the amount given is not enough to get the job done. Good enough for about 3/4 of the area.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help get rid of hair &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. I normally stick to shaving but I wanted to try this and I am too embarrassed to go to a place to get a Brazilian waxing done. I tried to use it and it hurt really really bad! I would not suggest using this as a first time waxer. If you&#x27;ve never done this before and think that you can push through the pain, think again! I would go to a place and get it done for the first time because it is easier to have someone else rip it off of you when you are in pain then to rip it off yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product. It smelled good and the wax was able to rip the hair off very well. It melted very easily in the microwave. If you are used to this kind of stuff, this would be a great product for you.</li>
    <li> Better than other waxing sets I&#x27;ve used, this was still pretty stringy and didn&#x27;t grip as nicely as I had hoped. This product cools quickly and hot water dish doesn&#x27;t help, so I found myself taking multiple trips to the microwave. Also wish it would have came with more wood spatulas.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus for scissors and mirror.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of at-home waxing kits and this one is by far my favorite. It removes every single little hair, even very short ones. I&#x27;ve been looking at every drug store for this and am so happy to have found this on amazon! The little mirror it comes with is a great bonus. If I could offer one bit of advice, don&#x27;t let the wax get too hard before you rip it off!</li>
    <li> Awful stuff.  One kit had been repacked and didn&#x27;t have everything in it.</li>
    <li> this works really well and does not cause much pain, more like a pulling of bandaid kind of pain, which is totally tolerable. Price is reasonable too! Recommend!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t complain. I used it in my underarms and it was ok. Now I&#x27;m saving more time because I don&#x27;t have to tweeze or shave my underarms and it only takes less than 10 minutes to remove underarm hairs. And it takes more than a week before fine hairs start showing.</li>
    <li> This product is great.</li>
    <li> I use this for more than just my bikini line and its the only product like this. It works great, I highly recommend it. The only down side is that I wish they would include more sticks.</li>
    <li> The wax does work but I feel that there&#x27;s too little wax. It&#x27;s kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> Overall this works really well. I saw a demo/recommendation of this from someone on YouTube and decided to give it a go. I mainly use it for my armpit and it works really well. I tried it in my bikini area once too and it was great as well. It grips the hair firmly and cleans up the area nicely. There&#x27;s usually some finer, little random hair left in areas where you missed to spread the wax or where the wax couldn&#x27;t hold on to, but you can easily tweeze all that out afterwards. The results are really good and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and will definitely buy again. The only issue is when you &amp;#34;tap off&amp;#34; the spatula around the edge of the jar, it would harden and stay there later and never seem to melt off again so in the end I got a lot of product left on the inside wall and edge of the jar that I have no idea how to get off because when you microwave it, it really only just heats up the bottom part where the majority of the product is. Nonetheless I&#x27;d still recommend this product and it&#x27;s basically a soft wax. Just follow the instructions that come with the kit. Pulling the wax after it hardens definitely hurts a bit just like any waxing experience, depending on how much you tolerate pain but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I saw someone on YouTube using this stuff to wax her armpits!! I decided to try it out and IT WORKED AWESOME!!!  It only hurts for that few seconds that you have to rip it off but works great! I know it says it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;Bikini Waxing&amp;#34; but it works great for armpits too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who wants to try it out!!  Instead of having to shave armpits every 1-2 days now I won&#x27;t have to for quite a while!!! :) yay!!</li>
    <li> it was............ bla</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years - it&#x27;s much cheaper to do it yourself than go to have a professional wax you every 4-6 weeks (though for me it would need to be every 2 or so weeks).  This kit works well if you peel off the wax when it&#x27;s still slightly warm  - don&#x27;t let it cool too much and get crumbly or else the wax/hair will be more difficult (and painful!) to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax doesn&#x27;t remove 100% of the hair - I usually have to go back and tweeze a remaining few stubborn ones when I&#x27;m done - but it will get all but a handful.  The wax is most effective when used to remove hairs which are least about 1/4&amp;#34; in length (the shorter ones which have barely surfaced are those usually left behind by the wax, although going over the same place a couple times will most often remove more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nads has a similar product, which I have also used, though I MUCH prefer the Sally Hanson.  You get more wax (I believe, or at least it seems to go farther), several wide &amp;#34;tongue depressors&amp;#34; which are angled at one end and very helpful (unlike the couple small and brittle/basically useless ones included with Nads), a small jar of soothing oil (versus a single, thin moistened disposable towelette in a wrapper), and the wax smells much pleasanter.  Sally Hanson wax is a light honey yellow with a mild honey/vanilla scent, while the bright red Nads wax has a pungent chemical aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> oh my god I love this stuff works for your eyebrows your bikini area and under arms and legs even  facial hair</li>
    <li> Its a good waxx but didnt remove my smaller hairs and doesnt last 8 weeks like it promotes</li>
    <li> It is effective, but smelly and easily burned. Far less product than in Poetic Wax, which also smells and works better.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great product. Takes off all the hair. I used it for my under arms. It was the worst pain of my life. (Worse than a Brazilian) Maybe I felt the pain more cause I was doing it myself. Hopefully the second time is not as painful.</li>
    <li> I thought this wax was TERRIBLE! And yes I followed the instructions. I am wondering if mine was like faulty? Because it certainly would not get \\&quot;crackly\\&quot; as some other reviewers said...I had totally the opposite problem. It is super sticky wax...I wouldn&#x27;t even call it \\&quot;wax\\&quot; cause it&#x27;s basically like putting honey on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry like other waxes...it always stays sticky so I had to scrub my skin with oil to get it off. I mean of course some of it came off with the strip along with a lot of the hair but it left a ton of wax behind. I would highly recommend against getting this. My skin is raw from trying to scrub all the stickiness off.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Best I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Not for the first time at-home waxer! I have  used those awful strips before, but this was my first time using real wax, at home. It was not easy to use...I assume if I had more experience it would have been better. I do not recommend this if you are new to home waxing. Going to try and look for something else :)</li>
    <li> You might as well grab your hair and rip it out with your fingers, because that&#x27;s exactly what it felt like using this product. It just gives you &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; grip. The trick is to leave a thick edge for you to grab, and pull while it&#x27;s still pliable and not hard and brittle, don&#x27;t spread it too thinly.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I tried to gently press the top down to stir as per the instructions, but a pocket of superheated wax exploded all over my hand, burning three fingers and part of my palm, spilled on the counter and floor, and got on my shirt and burned my stomach. I&#x27;d recommend letting it cool for a while!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s a pain to clean because it&#x27;s not water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;If you let it cool and just want the end result, it&#x27;s effective. I prefer Nair in the tub, or Nads strips to this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for almost 4 years and wouldn&#x27;t change for anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many waxes before- this is by far the worst.. it left me bruises in my bikini area.. ouch!</li>
    <li> sally hansens waxing kit works great. grabs every little hair and leaves the skin feeling smoith for weeks. i find that this method hurts less than regular wax and strips.</li>
    <li> Best home wax I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Mess-free, quick, and easy to use! I have used wax in the past but not in a while so I was afraid of the pain but once I did it on my underarms  - it was not bad at all. I&#x27;ve dealt with worse pain from epilating my underarms. I will purchase again once mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining about how this product works and found (with a little experimentation) it to work better than any other paper/cloth-wax combination I&#x27;ve ever used. The key (for me anyway) was to apply it moderately thick, allow it to settle just a bit, then apply a small second coat to the area you&#x27;ll be grasping to remove. Yes, it&#x27;ll sometimes crack a leave little bits of wax behind, but overall it&#x27;s the best product for times when extra-strength is the only option that works. :)</li>
    <li> First off, I bought this product on July 9th. I have prime and used prime shipping. It got here July 14th. If I had known it would take more than 2 days I would have went into a store, but this was not even the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came in as if someone used it, thrown the box around a couple times, and put it back inside. The box had wrinkles on it and the plastic bag that held the scissors, oil, and mirror was teared open. In the picture, the oil is about 9/10 filled inside the bottle. Mine? 6/10. The scissors does nothing, even scissors made for kids would have trimmed better. When I went to open the mirror, the mirror lens came off as in it was not even stuck to the plastic. In the picture it also showed that the wax has a holder, but mine was just a tub. I am really sad that something like this even left the warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 1 star because it worked.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, it works so well and its surprisingly simple to use. Will be purchasing another as soon as I run out. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> NEVER melted....wasn&#x27;t worth the money. It would not melt no matter how many times I tried to melt it in the microwave</li>
    <li> It definitely works, but not as well as I had hoped.. It&#x27;s messy, but it does pull the hair. But with how thick and as much hair as I have, I&#x27;d be waxing all day before all my hair was gone... but none the less, it does work, it&#x27;s cheap in price... can&#x27;t complain about that. Also, shipping is fast.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find this at my local drugstores, so its great to be able to get it here. Its the best wax for removing unwanted hair. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I used this after previously purchasing another no strip wax that just didn&#x27;t do the job for me, but I have to say that I was actually really pleasantly surprised with this one. The wax doesn&#x27;t get extremely tacky as quickly as my other one did, and this comes as a full kit as well-- scissors, after-wax oil, and even a little mirror. I used this for my underarms, and it worked really well.</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it for my armpits and also my upper lips. I&#x27;m so scared to use it on the bikini area though, it is quite painful...</li>
    <li> To much hassle to use.</li>
    <li> Not bad but it is too messy.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been waxing for years,and i&#x27;ve never used a wax so sticky and stringy. it gets the job done but your bathroom and skin will be full of wax</li>
    <li> Works amazing and no mess!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m an experienced waxer.  After having paid for this service for years, I finally deciding to save the money and do it myself.  After trying many products, I settled on Sally Hansen&#x27;s lavender sensitive skin waxing kit.&lt;br /&gt;It was silly of me to not read the label when I ran in and grabbed this stripless kit at my local drug store.  I thought it was the one I usually use, but I didn&#x27;t even realize until I got home.  When I saw it was stripless, I knew I was going to be unhappy, add I&#x27;ve tried many strip less products before.  And of course I was right!  This stuff absolutely sucks!!!!!  It&#x27;s painful, crumbles if you don&#x27;t put the correct amount of thickness, and you can feel... EVERY..... SINGLE..... HAIR..... being ripped out!!!!  Never again will I buy this product, and I&#x27;ve actually just written to sadly Hansen in hopes of getting a refund and discontinuing this as to prevent other woman from suffering this pain.  My legs are actually still stinging now, 3 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a desire to write a review before, but because this was so bad, I had to do it.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> This is the best wax ever! It does get a bit stringy but you&#x27;ll get use to it but it pulled out all my hairs.</li>
    <li> Love this hard wax, use it on my armpit. Quick and super easy, but will say that they can get a little messy sometimes.</li>
    <li> There is a bit of skill in doing your own brazilian/bikini, especially with hot wax. I used to do this for a living, and even the professional wax is a disaster if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Most of the bad reviews on here are because of this. Make sure it&#x27;s hot enough, test a small amount on your wrist to ensure it&#x27;s not too hot (this is largely common sense, if it&#x27;s super runny it&#x27;s obviously way too hot. It should be the consistency of thick honey). Apply firmly with the hair growth, wait several seconds, push done with your fingers to increase grip, this will always let you know when it&#x27;s ready to come off - no longer sticky and still pliable. Stretch your skin the opposite way hard, and rip off, try to keep that action close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely needs longer in the microwave to melt fully, the trick is to let it stand for at least 2minutes after it&#x27;s done. Be really careful of taking it out and stirring it as it has the potential to &#x27;pop&#x27; if the top isn&#x27;t melted properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works if you do it well. It&#x27;s the best wax I&#x27;ve found over the counter. I just wish they would make it in a bigger size, perhaps offer a refill in a larger pot without the scissors and mirror, I have a pile of those in my cupboard!</li>
    <li> Works really well but I suggest using waxing strips to use with the wax even though the product says you dont need them makes it alot eaiser process</li>
    <li> Not just for stubborn bikini hair. Great for facial hair! I really do love this product very easy to use but a little messy.</li>
    <li> I actually use this for my under arms and it works great!</li>
