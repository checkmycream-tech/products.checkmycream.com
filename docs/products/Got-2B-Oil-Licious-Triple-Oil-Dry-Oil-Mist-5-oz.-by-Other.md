      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>so I actually no longer use the Garnier because the Got2b product makes my hair smell awesome throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>The Schwartzkopf hair spray is supposed to be the best in the business, but the Got2be freeze spray is probably the same thing</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a healthy shine which, after hairspray and blow drying, can be removed.</li>
      <li>One of the best products I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  </li>
      <li>It has a Nice shine and smell but not crazy about it.</li>
      <li>Easy ordering i buy in bulk</li>
      <li>This spray shine is the best hands down.</li>
      <li>cant buy this locally anymore and it works great</li>
      <li>This is light and not sticky in any way.  </li>
      <li>Makes your hair look fantastic while smelling like you just washed it.  </li>
      <li>looks great even if you flat iron after using the product.  </li>
      <li>First, I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>with the seller, my package arrived safely and fast.</li>
      <li>It is true that you should not have an open flame near your head ,and if you can avoid this (which should be easy to do in most cases )you will love, love this product that will keep your frizzy hair under  control.</li>
      <li>I have ordered a few more, I love this product!</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s best for someone with very thick hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised this product is so hard to find since it&#x27;s one of the best products out there.</li>
      <li>Really smooths the hair and gives shine!  </li>
      <li>I love this especially on the ends of my hair to help stop breakage.</li>
      <li>I love the Got2be products and I use several.  </li>
      <li>Definitely getting more.</li>
      <li>and I needed a product to make my hair smell good after heavy working out and sweating, not to remove too much oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried the Got2be dry conditioner first, but it&#x27;s more like a texturizing spray than a conditioner</li>
      <li>After you spray it on your hair, rub it in so it doesnt run onto your skin.m Or spray it into your hands first, rub your hands together then apply to your hair, that way you have control of how much goes on and where its applied.</li>
      <li>But, I love this dry oil mist!</li>
      <li>There are numerous Got2be products that aren&#x27;t readily available.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair from getting burnt up with straight iron.</li>
      <li>it lasts me about a year (and I am VERY generous with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I do not have to get very often.</li>
      <li>At first I wasnt sure if this would work for my hair or not, or if it would weigh it down and make it too oily.</li>
      <li>My hair never feels oily and has good volume (I use very small quantities of the product)</li>
      <li>I live in Florida, where frizz is a real problem and this serum works like a charm.  </li>
      <li>This is a light non-greasy formula that I use on dry hair.  </li>
      <li>Works quickly and nicely as last touch up on hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.ly penetrate the hair.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Garnier has a really great dry shampoo but the scent just didn&#x27;t last long enough for me.  </li>
      <li>(why make entirely new formulas?).  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s one of the best products out there, at least for thick or damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or add too much shine like other shine sprays but does make your hair look healthy and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>it has a lite soft clean smell and it does not weigh down your hair and it gives your hair move ability.</li>
      <li>This dry oil mist seems much more conditioning, yet it does contain silicone, so I&#x27;m not sure if the conditioning ingredients really penetrate the hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very long and I use hot rollers, which dries it out somewhat</li>
      <li>The fragrance is slightly strong, and the mist didn&#x27;t really provide any flyaway control for my coarse thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this a high rating because it actually did what it promised.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this a high rating because it actually did what it promised.  </li>

      <li>It tames my dry frizzy hair really well.</li>
      <li>I use this dry oil spray to make my hair more slick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of oil, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp and lifeless but allows me to style my hair with shine and volume.</li>
      <li>prevent the damaging effects of all the things I do to my hair, and my stylist (from a high end salon) has commented on how surprised she is that we can do so much to my hair without negative impact.</li>
      <li>I think people are having problems with it because they are spraying too much and too close to their hair, so it gets to the root and weighs their hair down.</li>
      <li>even those it is fine and thin.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair, but it gets frizzy, too.</li>

<li> I got this because I blow dry my hair often and between that and the shampoos I use and now the new no poo I&#x27;ve been using it sucks either the life out of my thin fine hair or dried it completely out.</li>

<li> And, as for the ingredients....I don&#x27;t find them to be any worse than other products (even high end ones), and who puts their head near n open flame anyway??</li>
<li> I have tried all different brands (even the super expensive ones).</li>
<li> The dry oil has the added benefit of providing moisture, which my long hair needs.  </li>
<li> and I use this as a finishing spray to keep it from looking dry.  </li>
<li> then found Got2b Oil-licious Dry Oil Hair Taming Mist which is like a dry conditioner.  </li>
<li> Schwarzkopf Got2B oil-licious triple oil dry oil hair taming mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It also creates shine, as does this dry oil mist.  </li>
<li> So, enter the dry oil mist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product, but its discontinued now  :-(  It makes my hair look and feel so sleek. And it only takes a little bit. I&#x27;ll be bummed when I finish it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t catch on.  I dye my hair because it&#x27;s white now, stubborn and style resistant.  This oil mist brings life back to my hair.  It&#x27;s just the right amount of oil, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp and lifeless but allows me to style my hair with shine and volume.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff. Tames frizz without leaving your hair to greasy! Now&lt;br /&gt;my daughter is hooked on this. Almost time to order more.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Keeps my hair from getting burnt up with straight iron. Gives it a shiny/healthy look.</li>
    <li> Schwarzkopf Got2B oil-licious triple oil dry oil hair taming mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Butane, Trisiloxane, dimethicone, Isobutane, Propane, and fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to breathe any of these.</li>
    <li> I have tried all different brands (even the super expensive ones). This spray shine is the best hands down. It decreases all of the frizz without weighing your hair down. With my type of hair I do not need to wash my hair on a daily basis, I can use this product every day without build up! As an added bonus it smells very good, my coworkers comment me on how good I smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years and when I saw it was discontinued at stores in my area I immediately checked Amazon and hallelujah here it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it smells divine&lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s lightweight&lt;br /&gt;3. it comes in an aerosol can rather than some sticky pump (or, the worst, a pump your finger keeps sliding off bc, you know, oil.)&lt;br /&gt;4. it lasts me about a year (and I am VERY generous with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I have long (just above bra strap) moderately thick hair. I imagine if you have finer hair, it&#x27;d last you even longer.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how great this product is.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s cut my prep time in half, I swear.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing too. Genius, I tell you. I will keep a life&#x27;s supply of this stuff.</li>
    <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. Maybe it&#x27;s best for someone with very thick hair. (I prefer the got2b luxury mousse to tame frizz.)</li>
    <li> I picked this up at my local Dollar Tree a few months ago, and it&#x27;s been sitting on my shelf. Today I was looking for something to tame my frizz and I started reading the back of the label on this to see if it had any oils like keratin or Moroccan, and I noticed one of the ingredients was propane!! WHAT?! Needless to say, I will not be using this product.</li>
    <li> I dont know how good it is for health of the hair, but the look, smell and feel is great. Works quickly and nicely as last touch up on hair. Non sticky and non greasy.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING IT IS NOT OILY BUT CONDITIONS AND LOOKS LIKE OIL.&lt;br /&gt;ORDER THIS AND YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  I was actually searching for a dry shampoo when I found this product.  Garnier has a really great dry shampoo but the scent just didn&#x27;t last long enough for me.  I have dark thick hair and I needed a product to make my hair smell good after heavy working out and sweating, not to remove too much oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then found Got2b Oil-licious Dry Oil Hair Taming Mist which is like a dry conditioner.  This product is the best ever so I actually no longer use the Garnier because the Got2b product makes my hair smell awesome throughout the day.  Perfect product to use in between washes.  I think it&#x27;s one of the best products out there, at least for thick or damaged hair. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or add too much shine like other shine sprays but does make your hair look healthy and moisturized.  Makes your hair look fantastic while smelling like you just washed it.  It does eliminate the burn smell if you flat iron your hair and your hair looks great even if you flat iron after using the product.  I&#x27;m surprised this product is so hard to find since it&#x27;s one of the best products out there.</li>
    <li> First, I love this product and have been using it for years. It gives my hair a healthy shine which, after hairspray and blow drying, can be removed. Dry Oil doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or collect a build up. This hair product has been one of my top 5 picks, as a beauty blogger, for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the seller, my package arrived safely and fast. I would highly recommend this seller. Everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> item arrived on time and as described would buy again</li>
    <li> It is true that you should not have an open flame near your head ,and if you can avoid this (which should be easy to do in most cases )you will love, love this product that will keep your frizzy hair under  control. I have never found a product that can prevent the frizzies like this. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a light non-greasy formula that I use on dry hair.  My hair is very long and I use hot rollers, which dries it out somewhat (although it&#x27;s in great condition thanks to Kanechom conditioner, which is the BEST).  Anyway, I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day but the day after I&#x27;ve used the rollers, my hair is sticky from hairspray.  Although I brush it out, I use a high hold spray (CHI Helmet Head) and it can make my hair crunchy the second day.  I use this dry oil spray to make my hair more slick so I can roll it again.  It does the job well without greasiness.  I tried using John Frieda&#x27;s Secret Weapon creme, but it didn&#x27;t do anything, just weighed my hair down.  I love the Got2be products and I use several.  My favorite is the shine serum, which I use to prevent frizz.  I live in Florida, where frizz is a real problem and this serum works like a charm.  I use it on wet hair before I apply mousse.  It also creates shine, as does this dry oil mist.  The dry oil has the added benefit of providing moisture, which my long hair needs.  Heat styling causes hair to lose lipids (oils), as does coloring, and this mist helps to replenish them.  I bought this bottle for a song, as part of the add-on program on Amazon.  It&#x27;s not available at the local drugstores.  There are numerous Got2be products that aren&#x27;t readily available.  Schwartkopf also has a very expensive hair product line, which I&#x27;m sure have the same ingredients as Got2be (why make entirely new formulas?).  The Schwartzkopf hair spray is supposed to be the best in the business, but the Got2be freeze spray is probably the same thing (it&#x27;s really good and strong, btw).  I tried the Got2be dry conditioner first, but it&#x27;s more like a texturizing spray than a conditioner and there&#x27;s not much product in the can.  It would be good for an updo, for example, when hair needs more grip.  This dry oil mist seems much more conditioning, yet it does contain silicone, so I&#x27;m not sure if the conditioning ingredients really penetrate the hair.  Still, it makes my second day hair less sticky and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  I would order it again.  I&#x27;m giving this a high rating because it actually did what it promised.  I highly recommend it.ly penetrate the hair.  Still, it makes my second day hair less sticky and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  I would order it again.  I&#x27;m giving this a high rating because it actually did what it promised.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Really smooths the hair and gives shine!  Easy ordering i buy in bulk so I do not have to get very often.</li>
    <li> Love the softness of my hair when using this spray oil and the scent is an awesome bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this again!!</li>
    <li> It has a Nice shine and smell but not crazy about it. It doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down. Nice texture to it.</li>
    <li> gREAT PRICE WORKS FINE EASY TO USE ALL WOULD SHOP FOR MORE WHEN AND IF I NEED SOMETHING ELSE THANK YOU</li>
    <li> The fragrance is slightly strong, and the mist didn&#x27;t really provide any flyaway control for my coarse thick hair.  Went back to my pricey argan oil.</li>
    <li> cant buy this locally anymore and it works great</li>
    <li> At first I wasnt sure if this would work for my hair or not, or if it would weigh it down and make it too oily. But this is the perfect middle. It keeps my hair moisturized but doesnt make it oily. I think people are having problems with it because they are spraying too much and too close to their hair, so it gets to the root and weighs their hair down. I love this especially on the ends of my hair to help stop breakage. I never spray it close to my hairline because it will drip down on your skin and cause acne. After you spray it on your hair, rub it in so it doesnt run onto your skin.m Or spray it into your hands first, rub your hands together then apply to your hair, that way you have control of how much goes on and where its applied. I have ordered a few more, I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought mine in store. But, I love this dry oil mist! It tames my dry frizzy hair really well. I got this because I blow dry my hair often and between that and the shampoos I use and now the new no poo I&#x27;ve been using it sucks either the life out of my thin fine hair or dried it completely out. So, enter the dry oil mist. I spritz it on, then brush out, and wa la! Tamed hair. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. Definitely getting more.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I can spray dry styled hair and it add tons of shine without making my hair flat or oily.  The smell is nice.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Cannot locate in stores.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome it has a lite soft clean smell and it does not weigh down your hair and it gives your hair move ability.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair, but it gets frizzy, too. Because it is somewhere between curly and straight, it is the worst combination in the world to have. I have a short layered pixie, so I rely heavily on flat irons and products to produce the look I want. I am in my late 30s, so I get y hair colored and/or highlighted every 4 - 5 weeks. All I can say is this product does wonders to reverse/prevent the damaging effects of all the things I do to my hair, and my stylist (from a high end salon) has commented on how surprised she is that we can do so much to my hair without negative impact. She says my hair is really healthy in spite of the torture it ensures. My hair never feels oily and has good volume (I use very small quantities of the product) even those it is fine and thin. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a smoothing/shine product. And, as for the ingredients....I don&#x27;t find them to be any worse than other products (even high end ones), and who puts their head near n open flame anyway??</li>
    <li> Leaves hair a bit greasy looking. The Oil that comes in the plastic bottle by the same company, however, is terrific . I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and I use this as a finishing spray to keep it from looking dry.  I am going to by from this seller again.</li>
    <li> If you like spray shine products you will love this..This is light and not sticky in any way.  I switched from bedhead shine to this product.</li>
