    <li> the quality of the product exceeded my expectation. The powder is really fine and when i tested it on my hand, the texture feels very smooth and u can&#x27;t tell that there&#x27;s powder on it. For the price i am paying, it&#x27;s definately a product worth buying.</li>
    <li> Very nice, covers up a lot and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> It was great as always!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Shipping and deal was great. Thanks! I will definitely re-order. This is the best face powder I&#x27;ve found. Light and airy - doesn&#x27;t look cake-y.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have been using it for years. For some reason, it is no longer available at my local pharmacy.  I was thrilled to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last 2 years, I have purchased greater than 8 different brands of loose powder that state it will not irritate allergies with pricing ranging from $10 to $38.  All of them were either returned or thrown out.  This is the only completely odorless loose face powder that doesn&#x27;t cause my nose to run due to the smell.</li>
    <li> Good color. Feels good on skin.</li>

The solution is to pry off the plastic cover over the powder and scrape off any accumulated powder.  Then use a safety pin or similar object to clean the holes out.  It works but it&#x27;s annoying that I have to do this several times before the powder is used up.</li>

    <li> It is hard to find this powder at most places now.  I have used it for years and it provides the coverage and finish I need.</li>

    <li> Freat powder.  I must have light, and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> This powder make-up goes on with ease and doesn&#x27;t look like make-up, reasonably priced compared to others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this face powder.  I used it for years, and found that it was no longer sold in stores.  Thankfully, I found it on Amazon, for about the same price I used to pay in stores.  I have eczema &amp; psoriasis, and this face  powder doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. In fact, I believe it helps my skin to remain eczema &amp; psoriasis free.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and I can&#x27;t see myself buying any other brand. They are very gentle with your skin and last a lot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before, and love it.  I have eye allergies, and other powders make my eyes water all day long.  This one is truly hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> With difficult skin conditions, I prefer Almay products, and this powder works well for me, better than the compact powder.</li>
