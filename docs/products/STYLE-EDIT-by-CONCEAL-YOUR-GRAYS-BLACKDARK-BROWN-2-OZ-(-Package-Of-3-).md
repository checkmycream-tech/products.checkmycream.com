<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> What a great concept! I use this between my coloring and I can extend the next appointment by a couple of weeks sometimes. I use this mainly for my side part and after spraying, it looks like a fresh coloring! Doesn&#x27;t streak or smear. Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Awesome.  And delivery time is good.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for a couple of years now and there&#x27;s nothing better to help you stretch the time in between colorings.</li>
    <li> I have used this before. Its a good product</li>
    <li> Phenomenal! Covers gray beautifully. Spray it like you would aerosol hairspray, away from head and sweeping motions. Do not attempt to spray slowly or close to head. It comes out in a concentrated fashion which is not good. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy or sticky but may rub off on things, like a hat. Will stick in your nails if you scratch your head but does not drip when sweating from exercise. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this to cover my bald spot on top of my head from a bad scar. It is the only product that works for me. I love it. And it matches my black hair completely. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple years now. And it has total coverage. It rubs off some if I itch my head. But otherwise it stays in place. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. It is amazing. It covers my spot to where I have confidence. Love love love I&#x27;m  31, so I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of gray to cover but what I do have, it covers it very well. I use it to fill in on my actual scalp from missing hair from my scar.</li>
    <li> Hides gray hair very well.  The color is dark, but it blends well with my medium brown hair.  I like purchasing the 3 bottle set since I use the spray for frequent touch ups during the week.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown almost black hair with hard to hold color roots. This spray works well and definitely covers the gray. I have tried a few drugstore products but none work as well as this. It stays on and doesn&#x27;t come off on your hands like some do. My salon sells this for like 19 bucks a can so this is a steal. Get it!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product frequently.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The colors are dull, and it stained my hair. I asked my stylist about it and she said that it is a paint based product that will damage my hair. She recommended another brand that was a powder base which I absolutely love.  Colors are beautiful!!</li>
    <li> perfect for in between color appts. nozzle is designed to direct the color directly where you want it. I use it for a few days each month.</li>
    <li> This product works! It&#x27;s fast, covers gray and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I have terrible gray roots, this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Prompt service and great product!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this spray and likes it very much.  Helps prolong her hair dye job.  This was our 3rd order of this product.  To me it was kind of expensive, but as we all know you can&#x27;t put a price on your wife&#x27;s happiness.  Rated 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gadget</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have only a few strands of gray hair, and I can pin point exactly the ones I want. Blends great.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great to hold me over until my next coloring.</li>
    <li> Easy purchase,  this spray works well, although the color match isnt the best.</li>
    <li> It is a good product!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  fast shipping</li>
    <li> Far superior to Gray Away.  This will be my new daily-use scalp make-up...covers areas of alopecia beautifully and believably.  Tough to wash out (use a little olive or coconut oil with your shampoo for best results), but that&#x27;s better than it rubbing off during the day.</li>
    <li> Look no more!! Best by far. I color my hair every 2 1/2 weeks because I&#x27;m 100% gray. I&#x27;ve tried it all. I am a hair stylist as well so  I&#x27;ve tried every product out there. This is so natural looking. Isn&#x27;t sticky. Just spray and go. I have white gray hair and dye it dark brown. So when it grows out... I look like I&#x27;m thinning bc it is the same color as my scalp. Well no more!! Just spray in part and temples and good to go!!! Awesome product. Don&#x27;t hesitaye. You will love it. One tip: don&#x27;t be afraid to spray. It does not get real wet or sticky. Just shake bottle and get close and stay.</li>
    <li> Best root concealer ever. Stays put without reapplying even though I go three days between shampoos. Great coverage and blends in to my dark brown hair really well. I will never be without this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 year now and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and diferent techniques to cover my gray hair between touch ups, this one is by far the best! I&#x27;ve recommended to several people and I even made my salon buy to sell to their customers. Just be realistic in your expectations....you&#x27;re spraying on hair color so of course it&#x27;s going to rub off a little. The pros are that your hair stays shiny after you apply and you don&#x27;t have to do it again until you wash. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I wish the nozzle was larger but otherwise - this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this spray! It covers my growth and grays between color perfectly! Life changing.</li>
    <li> I buy this product regularly as it runs out quickly. You have to apply after every wash and it rubs off on your hand, pillows, sheets etc.&lt;br /&gt;You better have black towels, pillow covers and sheets. It&#x27;s a good temporary solution and works for what it is. But, there is a tar like smell. Not ideal if you are going on a date. The smell is my biggest gripe about this product. I wish they make it odorless or with a light scent.</li>
    <li> This product is actually used by my wife to cover her greys in between salon visits.  The stuff works great.  Is very natural looking.  Highly recommend.</li>
