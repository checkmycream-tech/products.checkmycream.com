### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>There’s one product in each category, and as the founder says, “is the best at what it does.”</li>
      <li>/&gt;Speaking of the nozzle, the video on this review says it dispenses the perfect amount.</li>
      <li>The best all in one lotion for  me.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great for the person who spends time in the sun.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Sometimes in life, you have to ask yourself, “How did the best just get better?”</li>
      <li>My skin has never been so good.</li>
      <li>but on one side I could see into it and tell there was a good inch of space.  </li>
      <li>If they changed the sunscreen and added something for anti-shine, it would be a good product.  </li>
      <li>you need a great lotion that is quick to use and let&#x27;s you still feel like a man.....</li>
      <li>lotion has an SPF 25 but goes on very easily.</li>
      <li>This product is nothing more than a greasy lotion.  </li>
      <li>Much better than the tubes.  </li>
      <li>Maybe okay if you are outdoors, but not something you want sitting at your desk.  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that its not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>Bought it to get away from the shine and grease of most moisturizers.</li>
      <li>There are many men who won&#x27;t use scented products and if I can find another combination moisturizer/sunscreen that is unscented, I will switch to it.</li>
      <li>The biggest advantage for me is that it has sunscreen built in, and now that the SPF factor has been raised to 30, it&#x27;s even better.  </li>
      <li>works much better but no longer available at amazon.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I have issues with my scalp and forehead being too shiny, and so many of the reviews were favorable and recommended this lotion for dealing with that precise problem.  </li>
      <li>It is non-reactive, and easily absorbs.</li>
      <li>Then when I tried the cream, it had a strong rancid spoiled smell with a hint of citrus...</li>
      <li>After showering and shaving my head, I apply the lotion, which seems to spread even more quickly now, covering my face, ears, and neck.</li>
      <li>The lotion, smartly packaged in pump size for your home bath and in a tube for those of us who travel for business, is the best facial care product I’ve ever used.</li>
      <li>My bottle arrived not even totally filled up, although you almost wouldn&#x27;t tell because the cream clinging to the inside of the bottle...</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Keeps the face matte and oil free.  </li>
      <li>Whether the original, which I loved or the new formula (which has somehow exceeded the original).</li>
      <li>Finding them, among the many brands of men’s and unisex skincare, was like finding just the right fit.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy - dries quickly and leaves no shine.</li>
      <li>The new formula is amazing as it has helped even my skin tone.</li>
      <li>The day I shaved my thinning hair to a clean scalp was my epiphany.</li>
      <li>20 mins after, it turns quite a bright yellow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just for the baldies, my guy has a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>This may be true of</li>
      <li>When it’s the right fit, you know it.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic with just the right amount of sunscreen built in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to finally find a lotion that is really for men.</li>
      <li>The lotion smells nice and goes on smoothly, but the justification for spending this amount of money was to get a product that specialized in reducing the shine on my skin, and it simply doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>They send you emails, but they&#x27;re actually real discounts and coupons, and they genuinely thank you for your business.</li>
      <li>Simple, no fuss, and effective.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen ingredients produce a distinct chemical odor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Worse yet is the fact that if you have any kind of facial hair, do not get this product.</li>
      <li>Nothing exemplifies this more than their Complete Face and Head Care Lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that the new formula blends into the skin and completely disappears--even when I have not shaved and have &#x27;stubble&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>This is the right</li>
      <li>Helps reduce shine, protect from the sun and provide just the right amount of moisturization.</li>
      <li>Unlike the simplicity that Matte for Men promotes, which quickly leads to that “just right feel” and cuts through the mania of choices for me, especially when many skin care lines over-complicate their offerings.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my husband, and it knocks down the shine while providing good skin protection.  </li>
      <li>I can tell he loves it, because when he&#x27;s running low he always asks me to get him more.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Matte for Men for a comprehensive and streamlined product group!</li>
      <li>Oh, be sure to try the Shave Gel, as well as the entire line-up!</li>
      <li>Hopefully, everyone knows the dangers of sun exposure, and if nothing else turns to the Lotion for its even higher SPF of 30.</li>
      <li>Firstly, it reduces shine and that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
      <li>The first day that I used Matte I was blown</li>
      <li>This is my first review ever.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I can corroborate is that it does wash off easily.  </li>
      <li>So this is way too much for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I paid way too much money for this and would not recommend this product.</li>
      <li>if you have very oily skin this works for about 2 hours,the your right back</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is just a high priced moisturizing sunscreen to wear at the beach.</li>
      <li>However, I do not see much mattifying effect; in fact, for me the mattifying effect of the new formula is less effective than the prior formula.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to end up looking like some old dude with sun spots all over his head</li>
      <li>This lotion is well worth the price and will last longer than you&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>Like finding that one car in your life that can be everything you want – or something as simple as finding the right razor blade.</li>
      <li>We weren&#x27;t aware that we could purchase Matte for Men in a larger size with a pump.  </li>
      <li>Everything about the new Complete Head and Face Lotion is better…  </li>
      <li>Perhaps, that’s because most are extensions of women’s lines pared down a bit and repackaged in blue or gray tubes to interest men.</li>
      <li>So many products cost the same price and give you less than an</li>
      <li>As long as they make their terrific Matte for Men products, especially the Complete Face and Head Lotion, I’ll have many shine-free miles ahead of me.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a completely bald guy like in the video.</li>
      <li>, when it dries, which is extremely fast, you cannot touch your face again or you will smear white.</li>
      <li>The “Anti-Shine” choice, which prevents any oily face breakthrough (and that so-unprofessional oily scalp) for me during a 12-hour business day, also moisturizes, conditions, calms, fights breakouts, and now goes so far as to help even skin tone and reduces the appearance of age spots.</li>
      <li>B004UKENPO Matte for Men Complete Face Care Lotion Pump, 6.5-Ounce]]</li>
      <li>I fell into the trap of thinking more expensive and more complicated was better.</li>
      <li>And especially the Complete Face and Head Lotion!</li>
      <li>It dispenses enough to cover your head, complete face, and neck.</li>
      <li>I gave this product 2 stars because although it does make my face feel pretty soft, smooth, and elastic, it is nearly impossible for me to actually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason is that this lotion does not feel as though it rubs into the skin.</li>
      <li>As it dries, you may notice a subtle, all-natural smell of citrus, also new to this version – and a nice pick-me-up in the morning, though hardly over-bearing.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, Matte for Men doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype -- it works fine as a moisturizer (and as a sunscreen, I suppose), but the mattifying effect just wasn&#x27;t there for me.  </li>
      <li>The oily shine on my face is completely gone and the dry flaky skin is now gone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasey like store bought products and the sun protection isn&#x27;t heavy or white.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2GW2GR6UDG23R]][[ASIN:B004UKENPO Matte for Men Complete Face Care Lotion Pump, 6.5-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Bought it to get away from the shine and grease of most moisturizers. It is fantastic with just the right amount of sunscreen built in. My skin has never been so good. Great for the person who spends time in the sun.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing more than a greasy lotion.  It has no Matte properties at all. leaves your face shiny after application and does nothing to prevent oily skin.  Just one or two hours after applying my oily skin is back.  I would suggest if you want a Mattifier try Murad oil-control  works much better but no longer available at amazon.</li>
    <li> if you have very oily skin this works for about 2 hours,the your right back wherer you started.&lt;br /&gt;some people think if its expensive it&#x27;&#x27;ll work,,,,no dice....its a scam.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps the face matte and oil free.  The only thing is that it glows under blacklight, so don&#x27;t put it on if you&#x27;re going to nightclubs or high-end bars.  Found out the hard way :/.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Matte for Men for quite some time now, but recently ran out and tried a different matte product. Needless to say, I instantly came right back to what works. This lotion is well worth the price and will last longer than you&#x27;d expect. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve buzzed my head since the military, and use this product on a daily basis for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it reduces shine and that&#x27;s why I bought it. Secondly (which I hadn&#x27;t initially thought of) for protection. I really don&#x27;t want to end up looking like some old dude with sun spots all over his head and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies like any other lotion, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing sun screen or some heavy caked on goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added plus, the company itself isn&#x27;t annoying like most nowadays. They send you emails, but they&#x27;re actually real discounts and coupons, and they genuinely thank you for your business.</li>
    <li> The best all in one lotion for  me. Helps reduce shine, protect from the sun and provide just the right amount of moisturization. I also love the fact that its not sticky at all. The new formula is amazing as it has helped even my skin tone.</li>
    <li> We weren&#x27;t aware that we could purchase Matte for Men in a larger size with a pump.  Much better than the tubes.  My husband loves it and uses it every day on his face and balding head.  I can tell he loves it, because when he&#x27;s running low he always asks me to get him more.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars because although it does make my face feel pretty soft, smooth, and elastic, it is nearly impossible for me to actually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason is that this lotion does not feel as though it rubs into the skin. You can rub and rub and there&#x27;s still a layer of white lotion to spread around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when it dries, which is extremely fast, you cannot touch your face again or you will smear white. It is obvious that this lotion forms a barrier that when touched, comes off quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet is the fact that if you have any kind of facial hair, do not get this product. I have short stubble on my face everywhere except my cheekbones and underside of chin/neck. If I rub it into my short stubble, it collects at the base I each hair and will not rub into the skin. 5 minutes later it looks like I have peeling skin under my stubble. 20 mins after, it turns quite a bright yellow. You can also see this at the tip of the nozzle when the lotion dries there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the nozzle, the video on this review says it dispenses the perfect amount. This may be true of you&#x27;re a completely bald guy like in the video. It dispenses enough to cover your head, complete face, and neck. So this is way too much for me. It&#x27;s about a half pump or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now hate to put on this face lotion. It&#x27;s difficult to specifically apply to just the bare areas of my face (cheekbones,forehead, nose, temples). I paid way too much money for this and would not recommend this product. One of the first products I have bought off Amazon that I am unhappy with.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  The biggest advantage for me is that it has sunscreen built in, and now that the SPF factor has been raised to 30, it&#x27;s even better.  However, I do not see much mattifying effect; in fact, for me the mattifying effect of the new formula is less effective than the prior formula.  Additionally, I like unscented products and don&#x27;t understand why the maker added the citrus scent.  There are many men who won&#x27;t use scented products and if I can find another combination moisturizer/sunscreen that is unscented, I will switch to it.</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever.  This stuff is the real deal. It&#x27;s great to finally find a lotion that is really for men. I have wasted a lot of money on other products and this is the first one that does everything it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 and started using Retin A prescribed by my dermatologist.  The side effects of the Retin A for me has been extremely oily skin on my forehead (embarrassing oily) and dry flaky skin around my chin and mouth. The first day that I used Matte I was blown away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has an SPF 25 but goes on very easily. The oily shine on my face is completely gone and the dry flaky skin is now gone.  The lotion has no scent either feminine or manly. The bottle is over 6 ounces and goes a very long way. So many products cost the same price and give you less than an ounce!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a great lotion that is quick to use and let&#x27;s you still feel like a man..... This is the right stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I really don&#x27;t plan on buying any more crap lotion products, I&#x27;m gonna have to take that money and try some of Matte&#x27;s other products!</li>
    <li> Sometimes in life, you have to ask yourself, “How did the best just get better?” Everything about the new Complete Head and Face Lotion is better…  Matte for Men has me as a client for life! Finding them, among the many brands of men’s and unisex skincare, was like finding just the right fit. Like finding that one car in your life that can be everything you want – or something as simple as finding the right razor blade. After all, every man is different. Unlike the simplicity that Matte for Men promotes, which quickly leads to that “just right feel” and cuts through the mania of choices for me, especially when many skin care lines over-complicate their offerings. Perhaps, that’s because most are extensions of women’s lines pared down a bit and repackaged in blue or gray tubes to interest men. They are the wrong products at the wrong prices.  Matte for Men should be where the buzz is! There’s one product in each category, and as the founder says, “is the best at what it does.” Nothing exemplifies this more than their Complete Face and Head Care Lotion. The lotion, smartly packaged in pump size for your home bath and in a tube for those of us who travel for business, is the best facial care product I’ve ever used. I began to seriously care for my face at 18, not out of vanity, but in the hope that something would help my terrible acne. After that had cleared, I explored other products and – I’ll admit that – the claims that the costly ones made were seductive. I fell into the trap of thinking more expensive and more complicated was better. The day I shaved my thinning hair to a clean scalp was my epiphany. I ran to my PC because after two hours my head was shiny and slick. I searched the web for products to help.  That’s how I discovered Matte for Men. And especially the Complete Face and Head Lotion! To this day, I can’t believe the results! Whether the original, which I loved or the new formula (which has somehow exceeded the original). After showering and shaving my head, I apply the lotion, which seems to spread even more quickly now, covering my face, ears, and neck. Hopefully, everyone knows the dangers of sun exposure, and if nothing else turns to the Lotion for its even higher SPF of 30. As it dries, you may notice a subtle, all-natural smell of citrus, also new to this version – and a nice pick-me-up in the morning, though hardly over-bearing.  The “Anti-Shine” choice, which prevents any oily face breakthrough (and that so-unprofessional oily scalp) for me during a 12-hour business day, also moisturizes, conditions, calms, fights breakouts, and now goes so far as to help even skin tone and reduces the appearance of age spots. Another edge for head-shavers! When it’s the right fit, you know it. As long as they make their terrific Matte for Men products, especially the Complete Face and Head Lotion, I’ll have many shine-free miles ahead of me. Thanks, Matte for Men for a comprehensive and streamlined product group! Oh, be sure to try the Shave Gel, as well as the entire line-up!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. It is non-reactive, and easily absorbs. It also includes SPF, so I do not need to layer on another product. This is a must have for every man. Simple, no fuss, and effective.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I bought it for my husband, and it knocks down the shine while providing good skin protection.  It&#x27;s not just for the baldies, my guy has a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that the new formula blends into the skin and completely disappears--even when I have not shaved and have &#x27;stubble&#x27;.  This is a major advance over the previous formulation.  And I like that the formula has an SPF 30 and maintains sunscreen ingredients that are safer according to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s recommendations for safer sunscreen (no oxybenzone or retinyl palmitate).</li>
    <li> Goes on easy - dries quickly and leaves no shine.</li>
    <li> My husband is not one for using a lot of products but he loves this lotion. He has remarked that it keeps his face moisturized but never greasy.</li>
    <li> Definitely not something you want to use if you have oily skin.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent shine.  The sunscreen ingredients produce a distinct chemical odor.  Maybe okay if you are outdoors, but not something you want sitting at your desk.  It seems to moisturize well.  If they changed the sunscreen and added something for anti-shine, it would be a good product.  Otherwise, it is just a high priced moisturizing sunscreen to wear at the beach.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have issues with my scalp and forehead being too shiny, and so many of the reviews were favorable and recommended this lotion for dealing with that precise problem.  Unfortunately, Matte for Men doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype -- it works fine as a moisturizer (and as a sunscreen, I suppose), but the mattifying effect just wasn&#x27;t there for me.  The lotion smells nice and goes on smoothly, but the justification for spending this amount of money was to get a product that specialized in reducing the shine on my skin, and it simply doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> My bottle arrived not even totally filled up, although you almost wouldn&#x27;t tell because the cream clinging to the inside of the bottle... but on one side I could see into it and tell there was a good inch of space.  Then when I tried the cream, it had a strong rancid spoiled smell with a hint of citrus... I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was supposed to smell like that or not, but I had to rush to the shower and get it off me.  The only thing I can corroborate is that it does wash off easily.  There was also no way to return the pump down to a locked closed position... I don&#x27;t know if mine was just broken or they all come like that, but needless to say, for the amount of money this costs, I should not have had this experience. Once again Amazon came to the rescue for me, which is why I will only buy online here.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
