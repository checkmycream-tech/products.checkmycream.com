<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good, but so painstaking to do. Not the product, just the day and age of irons and wands.</li>
    <li> Works well. Perfect amount of curlers.</li>
    <li> Very good product just as I remember from years back. They haven&#x27;t changed a bit, which, IMO is great. They still get very, very hot. Will still burn your fingertips just a bit. But this was fine by me. It wasn&#x27;t anything seriously painful or anything that caused me extreme discomfort. In fact, it was almost nostalgic for me as I remember them also doing this when I was in high school and used them 17 years ago. They work well, create a very nice curl, are easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store. They heat up within about 10 minutes and hold the heat quite nicely even once in your hair. Am very happy with the purchase and with the price.</li>
    <li> Great compact size, works perfectly, love what it does to my hair.  So glad I bought this;  I think I may get one or two more as back up at different locations.</li>
    <li> Does not heat hot enough and curls last 1-2 hours. Used curlers today and curl is gone even though hair had hairspray  in it.</li>
    <li> Small size, but they do the job well! My youngest has hair to her waist and the curlers worked perfectly and gave her a head of curls! So happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Hardly warmed up.  No metal core so it doesn&#x27;t hold the heat.</li>
    <li> These are cheap (but affordable!) and they heat up fast. My only complaint is even the larger rollers are smaller than usual. I would say the largest ones are like a standard medium sized rollers, so it was more like tight curls than the volume I am used to. I was ale to brush the curls out some but my roots didn&#x27;t get the volume I love from hot rollers. Also, if your hair is longer than your shoulders, these won&#x27;t work. I am going to try and switch out some of the smallest ones with rollers from my previous set. I like the compact design.</li>
    <li> Heat.  You need heat to make hot rollers work.  These just didn&#x27;t heat up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I live in two states, I wanted to get a set for my second home.  I couldn&#x27;t find one like my old set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair.  What these tepid rollers did to my hair, lasted less than an hour.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I had had the rollers in my hair.</li>
    <li> only used once and the curls didn&#x27;t hold.  Expected more</li>
    <li> It takes longer than I like to warm up, since I&#x27;m always running late in the morning, but it does a good job once it is thoroughly heated.</li>
    <li> Terrible design - rollers &amp; pins to hold get WAY too hot - I am going to toss this as I bought another brand to replace - these were unusable for me.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as shown. It heats up well and works perfectly. I am very happy with this product. It was shipped within a reasonable time frame as well which is a positive for me.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the lid has no clasp.  If I were to travel with this I&#x27;d have to wrap the cord around it to keep the rollers from falling out.  Not a big deal.  Overall very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in these.  Most of the rollers are far too small to use, unless you are looking for a tight tiny perm-like curl.  Also the clips are ridiculous.  They are shaped in such a way that when you go to remove them, they literally shoot off the back of your head into parts unknown.  So make sure you remove the curlers in a small bathroom, otherwise you may never find the clips. Definitely returning these.</li>
    <li> Got these for a grand daughter but have to really watch as they get really hot..I used them and had to put a piece of paper between my skin and the roller as it was hot..not for little ones..</li>
    <li> Works great just what I was looking for in a product!!</li>
    <li> Nice and compact delivers a big curl!</li>
    <li> I was shopping for some jumbo hot rollers and ran across this set that I purchased a several months ago.  I was curious about the review rating so I read them and am puzzled.  I cannot share the same opinion as the negative reviewers.  I find that the rollers heat extremely well and retain the heat.  In fact, I begin using them when the indicator dot just begins to turn.  Once I place the primary four large rollers in my hair I unplug the set to prevent overheating the curlers and causing damage to my hair since hot rollers should not be used everyday and can cause split ends.  I have medium thick hair and a lot of it, it&#x27;s shoulder length, no bangs and this set curls my hair beautifully!  In fact, I have curly hair day one, and beautiful fluffy and nicely shaped hair the second day.  I love the metal clips, but there is a trick to using them.  You must put them in to keep tension on the curler - for instance, you put the clip in from the opposite direction that you rolled your hair and press the open end of the clip down to sit on your head.  The clips do not mark or crease your hair as some other brands clips can.  If you cannot use these rollers effectively, I would look at the products you are using in your hair.  I notice if I use a silicone conditioner or hair serum ([[ASIN:B000VTRJMM CHI Silk Infusion - 6 oz.]], [[ASIN:B000P9DS4Q Frizz-Ease Extra Strength Serum, 1.69-Ounce]] or other similar products the curl falls out instantly.  These products are great, but should only be used if you want to smooth and straighten your hair, they do not promote curling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] that are suggested with this hot roller set, and while I do like them I prefer the metal clips that come with the set because they hold the curler tighter to your head.  I do find the Super Clips effective for sectioning my hair for different styles, as well as sectioning my little sisters hair when I cut it, but not for the hot rollers, if you are rolling the curlers all the way to your head.  If you have longer hair and just want to influence the ends they would be great.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they work, but they allow the curler to flop around on your head, and I like them tight to my head until they cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE April 15, 2015 - My hair is long now, down to my elbows.  I purchased the Conair Jumbo Flocked Rollers http://amzn.com/B007S69QAY and guess what?  I like these better!!  The smaller rollers in this review curl better even though I am way overloading the roller with my super long hair.  I have re-tried the Hot Roller Super Clips and they still do not work for me, even with way more hair.  The pins that come with the set are far superior in their holding power.for the hot rollers, if you are rolling the curlers all the way to your head.

    <li> Love it.  Replaced one just like it.</li>
    <li> At first it was tricky for me, the curls would fall, or it would be way to curly. So while my hair is still wet I use moose and blow dry my hair,with the help of a brush or my hair gets really frizzy. Them I do the curlers, I let them sit for a hour. Gives me plenty of time too put on make-up, get a load of laundry done to. The curls come out amazingly, and look great with a bandana.</li>
    <li> I love the compact design of these curlers which makes them much easier to store. I have very long hair and they give me just the right amount of curl/wave. I like having the indicator to let me know they are hot and they do warm up quickly.</li>
    <li> Great, work the same as higher priced items from conair</li>
    <li> I had to rate these at a 1 star because I was unable to leave no stars.  These rollers were a total waste of good money.  They stay hot just about long enough to take them off of the rods and get them up to your hair.  The plastic rollers lose heat extremely quickly!</li>
    <li> The curlers do not stay hot long enough to hold a curl.</li>
    <li> Works great and produces nice curls.  I have very fine hair and this hairsetter gives me the body I need.</li>
    <li> Nice and compact, the rollers get nice and hot but not too hot. I use this everyday!</li>
    <li> I just got these yesterday. Use them this morning, I am disappointed they are made so cheap, now. Curls were ok to walk out the house with, will have to try try try. But I have to say I&#x27;ll keep them only because I used them, but feel these days buy a good curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the money I paid for, just made so cheap. I used these years ago and not made as good.&lt;br /&gt;Forget these buy a curler iron</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was lightweight and very easy to use! Great way to quickly put some curls in your hair!</li>
    <li> Conair seems to do curling irons right, but was not impressed with their rollers.  Found the rollers themselves became too hot to handle even when only holding on to  the ends.  Could not get the right type of curls to style my hair.  Although the compact size was nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying electric curlers for years, trying to find some like the ones from years ago-without success until now. This set even curls my baby fine, limp hair. I like the metal clips; they don&#x27;t crimp my hair like the plastic clamp-style clips. The set does take longer to get hot enough to use, but that is not a problem for me. I suspect this is because the inside of the curler appears to be plastic, instead of the metal inside like the version from years ago. I like that you can order extra curlers in different sizes directly from Conair; the specifics and cost are include on the instruction sheet. I like these so well, I&#x27;ve ordered several sets,  for our mountain cabin and to have an extra set in the event the product is discontinued. Plus the price is reasonable compared to some sets I&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t work with my hair.These are the best electric rollers I&#x27;ve had in many years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of hairsetter for years. It&#x27;s great for thick hair giving soft wavey curls</li>
    <li> I love this hair setter.  I have medium short hair and the size of the rollers are perfect.  I did have to toss the metal clips as my hair is too fine and it would fall out of the rollers.  I purchased those clamps that everyone uses to keep long hair off their necks.  Since they come in all sizes and are inexpensive, they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> these really curl your hair I like them very fast</li>
    <li> I like it a lot haven&#x27;t used electric in years ,but it keeps the curl longer than most</li>
    <li> Perfect for a teenager</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had one since I was a young girl and decided to do my own hair and it does just what I won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Needs extra clips and a different way to store them.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t hold on to them.  They would burn my fingers.  Had to return them.😠</li>
    <li> Easy and curls stay on throughout the day till night. Just use with lightly wet hair for best results.</li>
    <li> I am not really happy with it, and I am thinking of sending it back, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the set doesn&#x27;t hold.  My 10 piece travel kit from conair does a better job even though I have to use it twice because of the length of my hair.</li>
    <li> This set seemed to be just right.  It had several of the smaller rollers which I needed.  The problem was they just wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  Couldn&#x27;t get the second one in before the first would fall out.  A friend said I should order the clips which would be more of a expense so, I just went and had my hair cut off.  I&#x27;m to busy to spend so much time and money on my hair.  I went back to short hair which is neat and quick.  I will consider returning since I only used one curler.</li>
    <li> The product came fast actually it was great worth your money! Ofcourse first thing I did was test it and heats up just fine. The siza is good too would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected . I would of paid more for a better one if I knew the outcome.</li>
    <li> The roller burned my fingers and the clip burned my scalp.  Unsafe and a little heavy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and compact and works great</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase.  Its my first set of hot rollers.  They work as well as I had hoped.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> One, great purchase! I used these for styling my hair when I needed to attend a friend&#x27;s wedding. My hairdo was really fabulous. My friends were asking about my hairstylist, and they were impressed to know that I did the styling myself using these curlers.</li>
    <li> I have had a set of these for MANY years and I have lost some and even cracked the lid. I bought other curlers to replace, but none were the same. These are the best and I was so happy to find them on here and at such an affordable price!!</li>
    <li> Great product... I have been using this particular set for years!  Love them, my only disappointment is that the JUMBO rollers are NOW only 1 inch in size.  My old set the JUMBO rollers are 1.5 inches.  So I have put my old rollers in the new set and they work perfectly... and now they get hot very quickly.  Also delivery was VERY FAST....</li>
    <li> I used to have hot roller way back in the 1960&#x27;s...LOVE IT .... with short or long hair. Now it&#x27;s 2013, and having lived in Calfornia for 2 years, every fall, my hair loses its natural curl, and looks straight and yucky. So I went on line &amp; found this version that looks the most like my original one, the important characteristic being the little pegs that holds the hair when you curl it around the curler. HOWEVER, for some reason, those clips won&#x27;t secure the curlers...either I can&#x27;t put them on, or they pop out, or they don&#x27;t really hold a tight curl. Very frustrating....anyone have any ideas??</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to help style my hair... you have to be careful though, these rollers do get HOT and can burn your fingers. Curls are fabulous though.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Very compact in comparison to other models.</li>
    <li> Nice, compact sized set, rollers take a long time to heat and are then too hot to handle. Also, the jumbo size are not that much bigger than the medium and not really useful for longer hair.  The smallest ones are of no use at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 20 year old set (red bottom with white rollers) and it&#x27;s not nearly as good.  Probably because everything today is made in China.</li>
    <li> I like this curler set!  I could even order additional curlers of varying sizes. I had one I purchased elsewhere. These units last a long time.</li>
    <li> I get the Shirley Temple curls i need to do some teasing, but the heating of the curlers can be inconsistent.</li>
    <li> Good price on a good product. Work well and curl stays in my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Had to return. Too few rollers in desired size.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this for my wife. She had worn out her first Conair Compact Hairsetter. Yes, she liked them that much, that I had to go on line to find her another set of the exact same Conair Hairsetter. She was way happy to receive them and uses it everyday. Thank you for a nice useable product.....Mike</li>
    <li> Fast and effective! Careful with hot rollers, they can burn fingers. Not for youthful users alone!</li>
    <li> Sent back...never really got that hot. Could have been defective.</li>
    <li> The middle rollers melted.  I turned on the rollers while I took a shower.  When I started to use the rollers, I realized that the rollers in the middle were puddles of plastice.  I have NEVER seen anything like it.  I&#x27;d give it a no star if I could  I just went ahead and threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Quick, easy and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> a little smaller rollers than i had hoped but work great</li>
    <li> Compact size but lots of rollers and a good assortment of sizes.  The rollers do take a while to heat up but that is not a problem for me.  They do a good job of curling my hair.</li>
    <li> I got the package and it was broken, with a crack in the screen, and the box was damaged too. I return them ASAP.</li>
    <li> I am one of the few that like these. Yes the curls will not stay with these as well if you don&#x27;t do a cool shot of air on them before taking the curlers out. Doing a cold shot of air with your hair dryer while these are still in your hair will then set the curls in place and make them not become loose. Some days I like the looser curl look which sometimes looks like a wave, I find it really pretty in my long hair. But just remember you can make these curlers work very well if you just use your blow dryer on them before you are about to take them out and use the cool shot function or put on cool air and blow on your curlers with it till the curlers are no longer warm at all. That should do it! And this allows the curls to last all day!</li>
    <li> The best, all around hot roller set. I&#x27;ve used others but this one beats them all. Wish there were more large roller and no tiny ones, but other than that, I highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m puzzled about the negative reviews.  It heats in about 10 minuets and gets so hot that I have to unplug it as I use it.  It&#x27;s no substitute for good old rollers on wet hair but nothing is that good.  I went to a beauty supply store that&#x27;s open to the public and got cheap hair clips for the rollers as the metal ones that come with the rollers are a total waste (18 for @ $4).  Got mine through the Walmart website w free shipping to my local store for under $20; better price on Amazon!  I love it.  It&#x27;s so much easier than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for a sibling with stick-straight hair, think she will love it. Unit appears to be well-made with a completely enclosed base, three different-sized rollers and accompanying pins.</li>
    <li> If your hair is fine and thin these aren&#x27;t for you.  They fall right out of my hair, even when I use the clamps.  Thankfully they were cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought these hot rollers at Walmart, I wish I had kept my receipt. They get hot but do not stay hot long enough for actual hair curling. At first I thought there was some electrical problem with the outlet I was using, however, I see someone else has reported the same problem. Dont bother.</li>
    <li> After 11 years of daily use, my Vidal Sassoon hot rollers finally gave out on me so I had to find a new set. I decided to try this set after reading several good reviews on it and that my local store did not have a huge selection. I tried it three times and am now ready to return. Although it is compact (perk) and heats up in a relatively short period of time, my hair does not stayed curled for very long (30 mins MAX). This is after heating the rollers up for 10 mins, rolling them into my dry hair that has hairspray, and keeping them in for 30 mins so they can cool thoroughly. This was the EXACT process I went with my old set of rollers. Well, 3 out 3, the curls never held. The 1st time I thought I may have used too much hair for each roller so the 2nd time, I decreased it a little. No change. The third time I used even less and still no hold. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed in this product and have returned it. On to the next!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for the price!  Just enough to do short to medium length hair.  If you have hair below your middle back you may need two sets.  They take a while to heat up completely but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a dud.  Rollers do not heat up enough to curl my hair. Ok, I take that back, not ALL the rollers heat up enough to curl my hair.  I replaced a 15 year old set (or older) with these thinking time was right to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old set had metal heating rods, these have metal heating rods.  Difference is my old set, the rods touched inside the roller actually heating them up. These &#x27;hover&#x27; over the heating rod and I guess but shear &#x27;closeness&#x27; to the heat, heat up.&lt;br /&gt;My old set took 1/2 hour to really heat up, these take 1/2 hour to heat up enough.  15 years of technological advances and still takes 1/2 hour.&lt;br /&gt;My old set used metal pins, this one uses metal pins (there is one star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do not do the job for me.  I am actually going to have to buy another set.</li>
    <li> Love uit!! it got here in like a day!</li>
    <li> Okay. They don&#x27;t get very hot though.</li>
    <li> I have had this set before and I was soooo pleased to find it was still available.  The rollers get hot quickly and there are 3 sizes...just perfect for a quick hair styling!</li>
    <li> This unit gets so hot that it burns my fingers trying to wrap my hair around the curler. I have tried to reduce the heating up time, but still it heats up to a high number then re starts the system. It want to regenerate from humman to many who do not use the bra&amp;#34; This is my latest photos.</li>
    <li> THIS IS REALLY A GOOD UNIT - PLENTY OF CURLERS OF THE RIGHT SIZE, CAN DO THE ENTIRE HEAD.  IT HEATS FAST AND GIVES YOU GREAT CURLS IN MINUTES.  I HAVE LONG HAIR.  IT IS NOT IN THE WAY ON MY VANITY.</li>
    <li> Not easy to manage, heavy and snarly.  I would only use in an emergency.</li>
    <li> rollers were easy to use.  No assembly required.  Heated quickly.  Sleek and compact.  Compact.  I like it - that is why I purchased two sets.</li>
    <li> I have mid upper arm length,  wavy, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box I was very excited to try all of the rollers and it looked like there was more than enough to use however as I started putting the rollers in my hair I noticed that only six big curlers will not be enough for all of my hair so I had to use the small and medium sizes which of course makes different sized curls. It was hard to get the ends of the hair in the rulers without the whole thing just slipping apart. After about 30 minutes,  I took the rulers out and OMG I LOOK LIKE I GOT An 80s perm! I brushed it out and OMG again! I looked like a poodle at the American kennel club!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I made do and my hair settled after putting a bit of anti humectant in it. 7 hours later and my hair looks exactly as it would if I had just air dried it after my shower, with nothing in it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this for thick hair, I&#x27;m going to give it to my sister who has very thin hair and likes the permed look.&lt;br /&gt;I will update to see how it works for her</li>
    <li> First time with hot curlers. They curled my daughters hair great. I just have to learn to use them better</li>
    <li> The clips get caught in the rollers with traveling, but the rollers do the trick! My hair stays set all day.</li>
    <li> These rollers were a big disappointment. They simply do not hold the curl, despite trying every possible styling product and also when using no product. The lack of hold is more likely related to the warm temperature of the rollers; they just don&#x27;t get very hot, even when I let them heat up for 40 minutes. I&#x27;m back to shopping for a better set.</li>
    <li> The unit is the right travel size... does not get as hot as my old unit... takes awhile. I needed fewer large rollers.</li>
    <li> they get really hot.  but do the job.</li>
    <li> These rollers are pretty small- even the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; ones were not big at all. Keep that in mind if you are looking to purchase larger rollers. I just wasted my money on this since I wouldn&#x27;t pay to return it. I wish the description wouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; rollers, medium and small rollers when there are no &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; rollers included.</li>
    <li> Would have gotten a higher rating  if they would produce this say with choices of all one size.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair. The rollers are too small for hair longer than shoulder length but perfect for short hair!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast. Rollers are nice sizes and you can order different sized ones cheaply be calling the number listed in the directions if you need more of a particular size.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t take long to heat up.  They stay hot for a really long time.  I have really long hair and they still worked and gave me ringlet curls that lasted all day with minimal product/hairspray.  The clips don&#x27;t fall off and keep the curlers tight against your head.  The compact size of the case makes it very easy to store however there is no clip or snap to keep the lid down.  I just use the piece of tape that they manufacturer put on it to keep the lid down too.</li>
    <li> Plenty of rollers.  I like that they all fit into any of the rods.  I do not like the picks, they don&#x27;t hold the rollers very well.  I use clips instead.  All in all, a good value</li>
    <li> These are really not even worth $12. Only half the curler gets hot so only one side of your hair is curled. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair setter for the price!!  Just as good as one I paid a lot more for.  Recommend this for short hair styles.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a steam set I jsf one when I is 18 I am now 57and I want to set my hair go figure so far OK it is like a hot curler left in my hair to set the curl it takes a good time to set and the light stays red does not turn White and I just love the look but wet to dry works for me. So I will try again in the day and let you know IG it canhhold a set or body in my hair.</li>
    <li> Meh... they don&#x27;t hold my long hair all that well. I miss the velour-covered curlers I used to have. These also don&#x27;t curl my hair all that well or make it shiny for that matter. My hair typically takes curl VERY well, but these don&#x27;t do much besides actually straighten out my hair a bit. They are a compact size though. Perhaps someone with very curly hair may want these to straighten their hair?</li>
    <li> Nice compact unit. The curlers are made to last with none of that velveteen that burns off after a few months.  It does take about ten minutes to heat up, but curlers retain heat for a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but the roller that&#x27;s supposed to have a dot on the end that turns white when it&#x27;s hot, doesn&#x27;t!  And, the rollers are so darned hot you are going to burn yourself each time you pick one up.  It does curl my hair but I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Remington plastic hot rollers I got in high school in the 1970s (way to go Remington).  Over the years I have purchased numerous sets of hot rollers in hopes of finally replacing my old scuzzy set but nothing worked near as well.  FINALLY I found them.  These blue Conair curlers are not only as good as my old set, they are better.  They are hard nylon/plastic and get adequately hot, not like those spongy jobs.  They have three sizes, clips that hold, and were not expensive.  I have finally retired my old Remingtons.</li>
    <li> They are great! work just fine, didn&#x27;t get any problem. Excellent choice.</li>
    <li> The product itself was very good as far as the quality and workmanship. If I didn&#x27;t have short, thin, fine hair I would give this 5-stars. The curlers heated up just enough....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only  problem with this product was:  I have short, thin, fine hair.  My hair was long enough to wrap around the curlers, but because my hair was so thin and fine, it kept slipping out and I kept having to re-curl it.  At 4am I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to keep doing that so I am returning these.  That&#x27;s the only reason I gave this product 3-stars.  I ended up returning this product.</li>
    <li> With shorter hair I like having more of the smaller rollers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of hot rollers for years.  These work really well and my set gets really hot!  My curls last all day and can be very tight if needed.  Unlike the flocked or velvet covered rollers these do not leave my hair a frizzy mess.  The clips hold pretty well, I had an old set with clips that attached to the inside of the roller, which I prefer, but alas, they no longer exist.  I highly recommend this product. It also has a really affordable price.  I would like to see more replacement rollers offered.  The jumbo size is best for longer hair.</li>
    <li> Wife was looking for a travel set of hairsetter that would not take up 1/3 of her suit case and once again went on to Amazon.com and sure enough they had them in stocked and shipped and they arrived as planned and made there first trip the week of August 11 and took up very little room and my wife reported that they worked great.</li>
    <li> I really like this hairsetter; it is compact, and I like the sizes of curlers and the fact that I can order more from the company if I would like to.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that before I am finished setting my hair with them the curlers get too hot to handle. I will probably just leave the lid up on the hairsetter when I am about halfway through and see if they are still hot enough to use without burning my fingers. Compared to some other sets I have tried, the curlers stay in my hair better.</li>
    <li> This is just what I expected, good quality except the lid hinge seems a little iffy.&lt;br /&gt;For the hair style I am going for, I may order replacement large rollers (available through Amazon) and switch those out for the smallest ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not built like the old ones but I am still getting used to them. They heat up fine and I may need more time to play with them.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these rollers to replace my 30 year OLD Clairol hot rollers which were cracking and starting to leak wax.  I was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews, but for $14.77, I figured it wasn&#x27;t a big investment.  I really love them.  The rollers heat up fast, (keep the cover on them while heating) and work really well.  I use individual folded toilet tissue for \\&quot;end papers\\&quot; to help my hair go over the rollers and also use those plastic Goody hair claw clips over the rollers instead of the provided metal clips.  It only takes a few minutes to roll my hair and it looks great!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of hot rollers so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to but I love them! they do exactly what I expect! They get hot enough and leave a super cute curl! :) My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled up in them and they are easy to put in and take out.</li>
    <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> I bought these at Rite Aid Pharmacy and returned them after finding them on Amazon for 1/2 the price.  This is a nice basic set of hot rollers (and works well) Make sure you purchase a thermal  glove because the rollers get very hot and can burn your hand.  The set comes with 1 color coded clip for each roller.  It&#x27;s important to match the clip to the correct roller size (you can distort the clips with stretching).  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase but I do wish it came with a few extra roller replacement clips (due to loss and distortion).</li>
    <li> A little had to handle. Very hot rods.</li>
    <li> Gave this away as a gift, the girls say it works for what curls they want.</li>
    <li> great buy for you curls</li>
    <li> I really like the roller set up,  but I only have one negative about it.  The rollers are fine,  but the little clips,  when inserted on the roller has caused hair breakage.</li>
    <li> I purchased these rollers for a family member who was visiting my home for an extended period.  The (fabric) covered type ones that already owned didn&#x27;t curl  very much at all, so I ordered these as a hopeful upgrade.  Good value, price, and seller, too.  These Conair rollers are good, but not over the top exceptional such as the hot curlers I grew up with in the 1970s.  The Conair set takes several minutes to fully heat (but not too long at all)  &amp; the clips included aren&#x27;t useful at all (the kind that comes every electric roller set).  I purchased other (butterfly) hair clips to use instead as they hold the roller/hair more securely.  Good rollers, again, just not alot of tight/lasting curls. They are much better than okay &amp; worlds better than a curling iron or fabric/velvety covered hot rollers.  Further, they are tons faster than curing your hair with a curling iron or brush.  I recommend these hot rollers for overall value &amp; also recommend this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these Conair rollers are good but not exactly 5 stars.  I received the item exactly as described, quickly &amp; extremely well packaged.  They are worth the cost paid. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the them. based quality &amp; price.  Seller was superb, too.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers.  They are just like the ones I used back in the day (giving away my age).  Sometimes things change and they should just keep them the same.  Use them every morning. Good price.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair perfectly and makes my hair gorgeous!</li>
    <li> The curlers got so hot I could not hold them in my hands; when I managed to find a spot on them that didn&#x27;t burn my fingers, and I got hair wound around them, the clips either were too big to hold them tightly or fell off completely. They were useless and I will return them ASAP!</li>
    <li> These are great rollers.  Purchased them for my daughter who has very thick hair.  They work well with her hair and she didn&#x27;t even use the whole set.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and this set works awesome. I would recommend this to anyone. It heats quickly and I am pleased. I have no negative issues at all.</li>
    <li> i order it because the price was good for me, and i heard a lot about this item.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for the money. These curlers get really hot and hold a curl really good.</li>
    <li> I feel meh about these, I like them but not much curl as I wanted and falls easily. I have another set by conair that cost more and seemed to keep a tighter cool.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with using rollers after using my mom&#x27;s set from probably the 80&#x27;s, I have no idea how old they were, but they got hot as h*ll, and would burn the crap outta your fingers, and the side of your face if you rested them on your skin.  Ah, those were the days..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using an old set of Conair velvet rollers for years.  Unfortunately, while I liked the rollers themselves, the clips to keep them in place were like claw clips, and would create bends in my hair.  I should have just bought the U wire clips (the kind that come with this particular set), but instead I bought this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like my mothers old set, as it has the nubs around to capture the hair, but these do not get as hot.  The style doesn&#x27;t last long without using a lot of product.  I have fine, thick hair, that is about mid-back in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these with various products: Manic Panic Volume cream, Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious styling creme, Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion, Herbal Essences curl mouse, hairspray, moulding cream, and a generic hairspray.  I used a Tresseme heat styling spray.  Nothing really kept the curl to hold all night.  I say all night, but thats typically just 2-3 hours, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bit the bullet and bought a ceramic styling wand when I saw it on sale on Hautelook for $50.  Best investment ever.  I will still use these hot rollers for the back under pieces of my hair, as they are hard for me to reach with the styling wand and are not very visible anyway.</li>
    <li> Delivered just fine, and quickly. The rollers got too hot for me to handle, so I had to leave the lid open and let them cool down a bit. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be an automatic shut-off when they reach temperature (whatever that is).  Tip ... take the &amp;#34;pins/clips&amp;#34; OUT of the case before heating the rollers or they get too hot,a also!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my new Conair rollers!  I have been using electric rollers for over forty years and could not locate a brand with the right roller grasp of late.  I read all the reviews previous to my purchase and most were positive.  One consumer commented on the hair pins and I find them much more user friendly than the clips and a smoother finish for my long hair. I could not be happier and if you are an older roller gal like myself, order these puppies ASAP, you will be &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for. I have fine, wavy hair between medium and long. It gives very good curls. Curls holds for long time (about 4-5 hrs) without applying any hairspray. Not harmful to hair as much as the iron or metal curler. you may think of buying Super clips for hot/cold rollers as per your convenience because stainless steel clips are bit difficult to use, it does not hold hair properly. It takes about 10-15 mins to heat. But once its done it gave me wonderful curls, just the way i wanted.</li>
    <li> She loves them,and they &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> These curlers are perfect!  The get very hot and my hair holds the curl all day.  I was worried that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough curlers for my hair which is shoulder length but it has plenty.</li>
    <li> The rollers heat up fast and the rollers are easy to use. The variety of sizes is what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these curlers.  I like the fact that the curlers have eight small curlers, which work better with my hair than the larger rollers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s old fashioned maybe but EVERYONE asks me how I get my hair to do what it does.  Set lasts forever!!!</li>
    <li> Clips are annoying, also the colors/sizes are such a subtle diffence making it difficult to tell</li>
    <li> i did not received the large pins for the large rollers and the large rollers are the only ones i use. and when i ordered a second conair set of rollarsthe same thing happened.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and Easy to use.  Purchased one for me and a couple as gifts.  Just enough rollers to do a variety of body building in my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I feel like there is a safety issue. When the curlers get hot enough to use, the bottom is twice as hot. I believe if anything was under it, it would cause a fire. If you grabbed the bottom it would burn you. I think this needs to be pulled off the market. With shipping being so high, I just pitched it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to curl fine hair</li>
    <li> Did not work at all The electrical cord did not stay and would not stay in the  Wall electrical plug!!! Very disappointed and will be returned as soon as UPS comes and picks up the packet it&#x27;s already been called in for pick up</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> it adds body and lasting curls  that can last  an entire  work day.  It is also kind to hair and  causes no drying or damage.</li>
    <li> These rollers are as close to the old style Conair rollers from the 1980s that I have found.  The do even better when I spritz my hair with a heat spray as I roll each curl.  It seems to make the curls hold better.  So far I am happy and the case is much smaller so it saves my counter space.</li>
    <li> Compact and light, it initially seemed to fit the bill. The smallest rollers are TINY and don&#x27;t heat up at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other rollers do heat up pretty quickly, but don&#x27;t seem to retain heat. Like all rollers, they give off this burnt plastic/chemical scent for first few times you turn it on. I tried using them more than once to see if I just had to get used to it, but since the smallest rollers seemed defective I eventually ended up returning this and getting a Revlon brand set which I like better.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s gift. She liked it.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I literally went through four sets of rollers before I found these. None of them created the big, smooth curls that these did. I&#x27;ll let you guys know if the curl stays but my guess is that&#x27;s a function of the products you&#x27;re using and the texture of your hair.</li>
    <li> I love these! I have been using hot rollers for years and I like these the best because they aren&#x27;t as bulky as the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. I read a couple of viewers state that they like the plastic clips better. The metal ones are so much better if you know how to use them. A little practice and you&#x27;ll master them. I have very fine hair so after I put them in I give them a squirt of hair spray (while hot in the hair) and it really holds the curl much better. I highly recommend these and you can&#x27;t beat the price! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/24/2016 The curlers are still perfect. I left the original set up North for when I visit and just bought the exact ones again for home. I also the fact that they get really hot fast, not like the old ones that you had to wait 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have a Remington brand of all small rollers that i have had for years. I like the old set better. I wish this new set had more small rollers. It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl as well either.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this seller and this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these old-time rollers, but I like the way it curls.  I only wish there were a few more rollers.</li>
    <li> Great product!I having been using it for years and just needed more sets, for home, travel etc. I will continue using this brand.</li>
    <li> Again something I had years ago and hopefully these hot curlers will be as good as the ones I had before. The size is perfect both hair rollers and container they are in. I can&#x27;t wait to use them and will give another review after the first use.</li>
    <li> not work at all&lt;br /&gt;clips not work at all. I am looking for another ones, but I can not find.</li>
    <li> My hair is short and I was able to switch to all small rollers with no problem at all.  I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. Rollers get very hot and there are plenty of them in 3 different sizes. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Great working item, never overheats and not to hot even when kids are around&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with my choice</li>
    <li> I love this hairsetter!  I have another one like it and I wanted to get a second one to use all dark blue curlers in one hairsetter.  So, now that I have two of the same thing, I have substituted all other colors with dark blue ones to have similar curlers for my entire head.  No other hairsetter can compete with Conair.  That&#x27;s because their tubes on which the curlers sit go well up into the shaft of the curler to insure good heating.  Conair smart.  That&#x27;s what I say.&lt;br /&gt;  And, if I ever need a new hairsetter, I will always have the other Conair in reserve.</li>
    <li> Love these.  They are my go to rollers.  I have another set that don&#x27;t stay in as well.  The clips keep these in great, you get a nice curl.  I have medium length hair.  If yours is down to your shoulders you will need a bigger size.  These are smaller but give great curl and it seems to last in my hair.  To be fair though most curl does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the pins out before you heat the rollers.  They get pretty hot.</li>
    <li> These work well but you have to give them plenty of time to heat up.  It had been years since I used hot rollers and I was living in flat iron land (in my head) where things heat quickly.  When I adjusted my expectations and started giving them about 10-15 minutes to heat, I got a lot happier with the product.  These do what they are supposed to do and I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl quite as tight as my old set with longer &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; on the curlers, but far better than the other types of electric curlers. Have been using these things since they came out over 40 years ago.  The clips or pins for holding the curlers in are the best I&#x27;ve ever had; not too long, and matched with color to the rollers. Heats quickly and efficiently. Do plan to leave the rollers in a bit longer than the older types.</li>
    <li> love this hot roller set!</li>
    <li> Nice price, works great.</li>
    <li> It heats up VERY quick , much quicker than the other Conair Model I have , in addition , it is so compact that is about the size of my palm . Just love it !</li>
    <li> Makes hair nice, this is a great value for the price,the rollers heats up quicky and they are not too hot to the touch.</li>
    <li> I have used these rollers several times and what a great way to style your hair when you are in a hurry to get out the door!! The curls held all day and I definately don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now. I would reccommend these to everyone with a busy day and not much time to work on your hair!!!</li>
    <li> The largest roller in this set is 1&amp;#34;, not 1 1/4&amp;#34; as another buyer stated. I wish that the size of the rollers were listed in all descriptions.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these hot rollers. I have tried many others, but the curls always fall after about 10 minutes. With these my curls last all day!!!! AWESOME</li>
    <li> These rollers are AMAZING! They leave my hair soft and with huge voluminous curls...looks salon made.</li>
    <li> Heats up very hot in about 5-10 minutes and they curl fantastic.  I read some negative comments about these and I completely disagree.  My hair is very curly in the back and stick strait in the front.  I have to straiten or curl my hair every day one way or the other.  I also have thick hair so I need a higher temp product. These were hot... which is a good thing for hair curlers... and they held the curl perfectly well for a few days. Also... the pins are very simple and easy to use.  Same old mechanism for the past 30 years I&#x27;ve been doing hair. I saw some comments that they were difficult to put in.... absolutely not hard at all.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed in the size of the curlers.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me.  Heats quickly, gives me the curl I need for my short hair.  Sliding the pins over the roller takes a little practice, but once you do it a few times works well.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t want this product if I had long hair and used them every day, but for my short hair does the job....</li>
    <li> I wanted curly hair for my wedding and I have short, fine, straight hair. Most other products did not work, but these (sort of) did. I was able to get some curl in my hair and it looked nice!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This product heats very fast.  I bought 2 sets because i have long hair.  I took the medium and big rollers out of one and combined them the other set.  It worked great.</li>
    <li> It works like I expected it would. Thank You</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  The colors match my bathroom decor; the rollers get nice and hot, but the red indicator lite hasn&#x27;t come on, and I don&#x27;t have time to wait longer than 10-15 minutes before I&#x27;m ready to curl.  I don&#x27;t know if the lite doesn&#x27;t work, or if I&#x27;m not waiting long enough.  The rollers curl good, but they don&#x27;t hold as long as I would like-it just leaves it w/more body than curl.  I believe it would curl better the hotter it gets and the longer you leave them in, the smaller the rollers are and allowing it to cool before you comb it-I don&#x27;t want to take that much time in the mornings.  It&#x27;s a good replacement update to my old Remington hot rollers.</li>
    <li> After reading a bunch of reviews saying how &#x27;bad&#x27; these hot rollers were, I need to speak up. They work great for any hairstyle, you just have to chose the right size roller and how long you want to leave them in. They are good to go in less than 5 minutes. If you let them heat up longer, they&#x27;ll be too hot to handle. This is true for any set or brand. They ask that your hair be dry or almost dry, but I have used them slightly damp with no problem. Like every new thing, you need to find your own personal comfort zone in its use. These are very good hot rollers and I had my last set from Clairol for over 30 years. It was time to try a new set before I set the bathroom on fire with the old.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This is a very cheap set.  Does not get hot enough and does not hold heat.</li>
    <li> These take longer to heat up than I thought and the little &amp;#34;indicator light&amp;#34; is pretty much impossible to see (am I blind?  Stupid?  Does mine not work properly?), BUT I still really, really like these curlers.  They remind me of the ones my mom used to use when I was a little girl.  I&#x27;ve tried the curling irons, the wands, everything I can think of, and these are the only things that actually work (or that I&amp;#34;m able to use without looking a hot mess).  They take a little getting used to, a little practice on the weekend when you&#x27;re not going to be seen in public, but once you get the hang of it, you can put these in right when you get up, do your makeup, get dressed, and you&#x27;re set to go.</li>
    <li> No switch! You must plug them in every time you want to use them. I&#x27;m not a fan of how my hair sets in these as well. I Wouldn&#x27;t recommend or purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this, perfect size. Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t blue, it was hot pink</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on these rollers, I purchased them during a price drop.  Unfortunately, they do not meet my expectations.    I used to own an earlier Conair predecessor of these rollers in the 1980&#x27;s, which contained liquid wax inside the core.  Those rollers got very hot, and retained their heat.  Unfortunately, this edition does not appear to have any heat conductor within the rollers; each roller is plastic through and through.  So despite the fact that each roller sits on a metal heating rod, the rollers do not heat well or retain their heat.  Why?  Because plastic is not a good heat conductor.  I had to heat these rollers for a full 25 minutes for them to get hot enough to perform, and even then, they produced only a mediocre curl.      Too many small rollers were included with this set, so I would only recommend these rollers if you have short to medium-length hair.  I would not recommend the rollers for long, thick, or course hair, as they don&#x27;t get hot enough to manage those hair types.  I am returning them for a refund, and will try a different variety.</li>
    <li> Trust the reviewers who called this product terrible. It is. I just returned it. I bought it because I forgot to pack my electric rollers on vacation and thought I could use an extra set for travel. Forget it. These electric rollers are so bad, so insulting, that I went way out of my way to return them.&lt;br /&gt; 1. They don&#x27;t provide body or curl the hair, as electric rollers normally do. Some reviewers said it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t stay hot long enough. I don&#x27;t know the reason. But I know they don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt; 2.  The metal clips have no give to them. When you force them onto a roller, they either spring off or slide off. Then you have to start the process over, heating the roller up again and hoping it stays on this time.&lt;br /&gt; 3. Because the metal clips have no give, you must match up the right size clip to the right size roller--which you don&#x27;t have to do with the rollers I normally use, by Clairol. With the Clairol set you can use the clips interchangeably for almost all the rollers.&lt;br /&gt; 4. There&#x27;s a ridiculous \\&quot;color coding\\&quot; of the clips in which the bottoms of the clips match one of the three shades of blue of the rollers. But people grab rollers from the round end, not the tips, so you can&#x27;t see the color at the tip. (If anyone at Conair is reading this, I&#x27;ll bet that whoever created this product doesn&#x27;t use this product.)&lt;br /&gt; 5. If you thought a \\&quot;compact\\&quot; set, which this calls itself, would be good for travel, that&#x27;s just what i thought. Wrong. The way the case is designed, the clips aren&#x27;t anchored in any way so if you pack the case, the clips fly all over the unit and the case doesn&#x27;t click shut, either, so if you pack this thing, you will have a suitcase full of rollers and clips.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone. My terrific Clairol electric rollers are ones I&#x27;ve had for a long time and I can&#x27;t vouch for what they&#x27;re making or selling now.&lt;br /&gt; But if you&#x27;re even thinking about buying this substandard Conair product, read the 16 \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; reviewsthat were written before mine and then read some of the \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; reviews and see which ones you believe are authentic.</li>
    <li> i have bought two of these one for home and one for florida, tried many hairsetters this is my favorite</li>
    <li> Love these curlers  There are a variety of sizes and they really heat us quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this set......great to travel with . Not too big and bulky. Highly recommended if your looking for great hot rollers</li>
    <li> Compact,easy and gets the job done, and the right price. curlers stay in and has great long lasting curls.  Great</li>
    <li> I like my Conair compact hairsetter. Its small size fits my shelf perfectly. Gets hot. Good variety in curler sizes.</li>
    <li> The only real issue I have with this product is that it takes awhile to heat up. The curls keep as long as if I was using a curling iron. Other than that, I think it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Taking these on my cruise</li>
    <li> Gets pretty hot, so watch out!  All in all it does the job like the ones I owned in the 70&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This is easier than using a curling iron...rollers heat up fairly quick and my arms don&#x27;t get tired like when I stand in front of the mirror with the curling iron..............</li>
    <li> I have been using ones that were 20+ years old because each newer set I purchased didn&#x27;t get as hot or didn&#x27;t grip to my super shiny hair the way my &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; ones do. Purchased these for my mum at Christmas and she loved them so much she convinced me to try them... They are OUTSTANDING I am so impressed with how well they curl my super long shiny pin straight hair. My mum has short thick course hair and they work wonders for her too. Will not disappoint!!! Thank you conair!</li>
    <li> I used to use these years ago, but after my small children lost the rollers, pins, or both to several sets, I just gave up.  They are past that stage now, though, and these were exactly the type of rollers and pins that I wanted.  Just a tip to anyone who hasn&#x27;t used these before ... push the pins over the rollers with the bent side toward your scalp, and the rollers will stay in place.  They absolutely will not stay put if you use the flat part at your scalp.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it has different size rollers and my hair is short, so I only use the small  rollers and then I need more 12 more smalls instead of the md &amp; large rollers .</li>
    <li> dont waist your money :( I usually love conair products but these are cheep plastic rollers that DO NOT retain heat. by the time you get them in your hair they are already cooling off. One comment said to use cool air from a blow drier - doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I had some that were actually filled with wax and were amazing, these look similar but don&#x27;t be fooled (like me) they are NOT the same and they don&#x27;t work. I ended up buying the remington wax-filled hot rollers after these didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Did not heat up well.</li>
    <li> Very handy and does work.  I do need more heat but these will work for trips.  I have two (2) of their large sets.</li>
    <li> Just right for my hair length.  I love the clips and the compactness of the hair setter.  This was a great purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use these - but I find it really hard to curl all the hair on these curlers. Plus takes a while to heat.</li>
    <li> They heat up really well!</li>
    <li> Love the product fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product is OK. Just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers have very poor &amp;#34;gripers&amp;#34; and fine hair does not hold; they fall out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have to use some kind of a curling cream/gel. (Yuck--more stuff to wash out.) It&#x27;s a struggle to curl hair and get the clips on curlers, as the pins pop off very easily and fly across the room. When you go retrieve them (the wayward pins), the other rollers are already falling out! I had to use a curling iron to finish AFTER it took out the rollers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many small rollers. They are only good for very short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get better results, with less frustration, from my 45-year-old Clairol Kindness set!  It has better rollers, and heats up in the same amount of time. (Unfortunately it&#x27;s too big to tote around for travel.)</li>
    <li> Sent it back. Could&lt;br /&gt;Not even wrap my hair around the rollers. They don&#x27;t &amp;#34; catch&amp;#34; fine hair well at all.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it regularly. It&#x27;s much smaller and more compact than her old one, heats up fast and does a great job. Would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  I do wish it had bigger rollers but then it would not be as portable.  Take it with me when I travel too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for curlers of this type for awhile and was happy to find these. I used similar ones in college, back in the &#x27;70s when there was nothing else but curlers you boiled and curling irons, which I don&#x27;t believe many of us even thought of using. This set seemed to take a little longer to heat up than I expected, but not so long that it&#x27;s a problem. They work very well, and in my opinion are much better than the flocked type. It&#x27;s been a long hard row to hoe just to find these but I&#x27;m glad I did. I would buy them again, definitely.</li>
    <li> I ended up with a big rollers that had damage to them, I bought these for a special occasion I guess Ill have to add time to my schedule to get my hair ready due to the damaged rollers</li>
    <li> The hair setter does not heat up properly and the clips do  not remain in place.  I took it out  and used it for the first time during the week and this weekend.  Thus the reason for my not responding before now.  It did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I had a set of electric rollers for nearly 40 years, and I never thought I&#x27;d find another set that I would like as well, but I have.  These rollers get hot within 10 minutes and are very easy to use, since they have mini spikes on them to hold the hair while being rolled.  The roller set is also one of the least expensive on the market, which makes it an even better deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a set I love from 14 years ago. It heats up fast and does a decent job.  I only wish it got hotter.</li>
    <li> These curlers provide lots of bounce and volume for thick, short hair.  The big and medium rollers aren&#x27;t as big as I&#x27;d like but the color is right!  Still prefer my old set of rollers to straighten my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> It did not get very hot, therefore it did not put much curl into my hair.  I was disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I wish it were a steam unit because that curls my hair better.  This performs as expected, again, with fine hair, nothing works great.</li>
    <li> Ok. I did not like that they weren&#x27;t flocked.  I found it was hard to grasp the ends of my hair neatly around the curler.  They curled my hair OK but all the curl was at the bottom and not enough at the root.  I don&#x27;t know if they weren&#x27;t hot enough or the curlers were too small for my shoulder length hair (not particularly fine or thick). But I did love that the U-pins were nice and tight.  Once you learn how to put them properly, they&#x27;re 100x better than the awkward clips that leave bends in your hair and don&#x27;t hold the curler tightly enough.  I&#x27;m debating on returning or keeping them just for the U-pins which are hard to find.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up. Such a waste of my time and hopes for curls</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used electric rollers in many years but decided to try them again. They are just as I remembered. Work great. It takes a time or two to get used to rolling your hair up and using the clips again but it&#x27;s worth it. Great body and curl but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few hours. Serves the purpose and we&#x27;ll worth the money</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these rollers. I bought my first set five years ago and lately the old ones were not heating up as well, so I decided to replace them. In spite of giving up the ghost after five years, I like this set of hot rollers. The new set are definitely doing the job. The curl lasts for 4-6 hours, even in my fine thick shoulder length hair. The rollers do heat up pretty hot, and you have to be careful putting them in, but I prefer that they are hot to the touch, as I find curlers that don&#x27;t heat up don&#x27;t do a great job on my hair.</li>
    <li> Not anything against the company or the curlers but they just weren&#x27;t long enough.  They look longer in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love the hairsetter. Gets very hot and curls hair very well.</li>
    <li> I have no problems with this set of rollers. I plug it in and wait maybe 5 minutes before I roll my hair. I get great curls that last. I like the size of the set also; easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I have medium length thick hair. These did noting for me.  I even used them a few times to make sure. The bottom gets hot (real hot) but the rollers don&#x27;t really. I am really disappointed with it. Going to sell in my next garage sale.</li>
    <li> Dont come out like curls it stright my sister has this too and with hers my hair comes out curl and dont have problems with hers only mines</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a hairsetter with more than 6 small rollers for a while.  I was so happy to find this one and I love it.  The roller stay in my hair and do not get stuck either.  My hair is naturally wavy and this harisetter makes my hair curly and full and stays curly all day.  High recommend it</li>
    <li> This hairsetter does exactly what it promises to do: create soft, shiny and stylish results. Purchasers will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This Conair Compact Hairsetter, is the Boom, I was in Napa Valley last month,  and I took it with me, and I must say, I am so glad I did.  It works great for me, and it didn&#x27;t take that long to heat-up. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like these curlers.  I can &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; or go looser depending on how long I leave them in.</li>
    <li> These are the first curlers I have ever purchased so I can&#x27;t compare but I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> They take a little longer than I would like to heat up, so if I am in a hurry these are not my go to thing.  But, when I have the time, and they are ready, I am happy with the resulting curl to my hair.  I have short hair, so the graduated sizes are all useful.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell size of rollers online. These are too small for my hair.</li>
    <li> works well, considering if you know how to use curlers so practice practice practice &#x3D;) be careful and take the pins out before you plug it in so you don&#x27;t burn yourself trying to secure the curlers!  It gets the curlers themselves at a good temperature and keeps them that way.  Just enough for my hair style as well and I have medium thick hair.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because it didn&#x27;t stay put when I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has fine hair).  I did like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get that hot, but doesn&#x27;t make the curls supper tight (very loose looking curls).</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t handle them. They are too hot!!</li>
    <li> they are the perfet for my hair</li>
    <li> Works great and such a wonderful deal! I had a set of hot rollers like these about 20 years ago with the grooved rollers, since then, I have been unable to find them in the stores. I could only find smooth rollers. The grooved rollers make all the difference for lasting curls. The smooth ones just make the curls fall night down. I feel so lucky to have found these! I LOVE THEM! GREAT PRODUCT AND UNBELIEVABLE PRICE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product.  There are not enough small curlers.  I could have used more of the small ones.</li>
    <li> I shopped Walmart,Kmart,Shopko and could not find this conair hot set..Love it, love it, love it..Its easy ot use and heats up fast..</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Personally, I am that girl that can never seem to do her hair right.  This is easy to use and gives me hair looking like the models on the box. I never have a bad hairday using this.</li>
    <li> My wife loves her new curlers but says the clips are small and hard to handle. Could be that her fingers don&#x27;t work well. I know I like her hair curly. She has recommended this product to her friends.  I liked the price of this product too.</li>
    <li> Curled my hair for the first time with these hot rollers and my hair turned out fantastic! I do some pinup contests and modeling and this hairsetter will help with my hair a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers for decades.  During this time I have bought many sets by differing manufacturers.  It is often difficult to find rollers with &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; to help hold hair in place.  These are perfect.  The container is truly compact.  I could not be more pleased.  There is even a convenient slot for pin storage.  Very very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to find this product on line as it is difficult to find in the stores.  Love the compact hairsetter and plan on buying another one as a gift in the near future.  Service and delivery were great.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of the Conair Compact Hairsetter.  I bought it so I could get another set of the small rollers since Remington no longer makes electric rollers for short hair.</li>
    <li> it is easy to use very compact and heats up quickly, useful to take on trips as it is very light</li>
    <li> I purchased the Conair Compact Hairsetter, Blue a few years ago. It quit working. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores. Found it through your web site. Ordered 2 of them and am very satisfied with them. Thank you for having this on your site.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted .Hard to find this.</li>
    <li> My wife was so sad when her ancient set of rollers broke.. she is very happy with these.</li>
    <li> I have long hair  and these curlers did not hold a curl for more than a couple of minutes. They might be ok for someone with short hair.</li>
    <li> Heats fast.  Long lasting curls!  This is the second set that I have purchased.  Great set of hot rolls for the price!</li>
    <li> I have owned these curlers for many years. They work decently except for the smallest ones. For some reason, those just won&#x27;t retain any heat. The large and medium sized curlers do the job well enough, but for the smaller sections of hair where I need the small ones, I can&#x27;t even get a bit of heat on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lasted for a really long time, but now I have to replace.</li>
    <li> I am with those who do not like this set. I have shoulder-length coarse hair, and these rollers are very light and don&#x27;t get hot enough to set a good curl. Oddly enough, the outer &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; rings of these curlers seem hotter than the curler surface! So, for me, my fingers get burnt but my hair doesn&#x27;t get curled. If it didn&#x27;t cost so much to return them, I would send them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this set might work perfectly for someone with thin or fine hair, as each curler is very light. I very much prefer heavier, denser rollers that hold the heat and set a firmer curl.</li>
    <li> Hot, hot rollers make it easy to put some curl in my hair in record time.  Glad I bought it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought them as a gift for my mother and she seems to enjoy them. She searched everywhere for the rollers with &amp;#34;the bumbs&amp;#34; they hold her hair better.</li>
    <li> These do a good job. I like using hot rollers sometimes and these fit the bill. 4 more words required.</li>
    <li> these are ok but I did not find that they get very hot and they clasp are hard to keep together.</li>
    <li> Curls my hair just right.  If I had to change anything it would be to add extra clips.</li>
    <li> Love these!  I&#x27;m going to buy a 2nd set b/c my daughter loves them, too.  I originally saw them @ Target, but they $5 cheaper on here.</li>
    <li> This is my first hot roller set, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that would ever curl my straight hair! It has such a beautiful design, and it was actually very easy to use! :)</li>
    <li> The curlers heat and cool as expected, leave my hair silky.  Am very happy with this product especially because it had 8 small roller.</li>
    <li> Nice, does the job intended and looks good.  Heats up fast and holds the heat after.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers do not get too hot - this prevents my naturally oily hair from getting too oily.&lt;br /&gt;It does not take up much room even though it holds quite a bit of rollers.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this product much (maybe a handful of times) but it has held up well and&lt;br /&gt;I especially like how the lid protects the rollers from getting dusty&lt;br /&gt;(stored on the high shelf of my bathroom closet due to infrequent use).</li>
    <li> Love these hot rollers from conair.I have use them before they lasted along time. I was happy I found them at amazon ,because I could find them at the stores any more.I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I chose this hair setter because the review said all rollers fit all of the rods.  I use only the small size, so this works for me.  I was able to order enough of the small size direct from Conair to fill the two I bought.  Conair called me personally to confirm my order and that is one thing I really appreciate---having the one on one contact.  Good Job Conair!!!</li>
    <li> This hot roller kit does not heat the roller sufficiently and the rollers do not stay hot.  The sizing is also very small</li>
    <li> They are a little slow heating up but adequate if I plug the unit in before my shower, they are ready when I&#x27;m finished. My hair is short so having the multiple sizes helps and they curl very well. Curls pretty much last all day.</li>
    <li> Slow to get hot!  Takes 30 minutes in hair for curls</li>
    <li> This is the third set of electric rollers that I bought in 4 months.  I hated the clips on the first set that I bought because they left a crease in my hair.  I did not like the second set I bought because they were so hot that I was yanking them out of my hair after putting in the second roller because it was burning my hair.  After looking at the reviews for this set, I decided that with the pins instead of clips and the lack of heat reported, perhaps these were what I was looking for.  They have performed extremely well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have to use styling products in my hair to hold the curl for the day.  Where I live it is extremely warm and humid and curls will not stay in my hair without a styling product.  But with the right product, my hair is full of bouncy curls.  Some reviewers noted the difficulty in traveling with these rollers.  While I do wish there was something that would \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the curlers closed and I wish that there was also a more separated compartment for the pins, I recently took mine on a two-week road trip.  The curlers never fell out of the base even when they were turned sideways.  It&#x27;s all in the packing.  Yes, the pins went everywhere inside the base, but that could have been resolved if I had taken the time to just put them in a small zippered bag.  I put all my other beauty products in zippered bags, so why not the pins for the curlers?  As for having difficulty choosing the right pin, I just turned the pins upside-down in their compartment.  It&#x27;s just as easy to lay them out alongside the curlers, too.  I thought these were minor difficulties.  I bought the curlers to curl my hair without causing burns to my fingers or my scalp and they deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to another reviewer&#x27;s bit of advice on securing the pins, I agree that the pins need to go in opposite the direction in which you are curling your hair.  For most people, the ends of the pins will point either up or to your face, depending on where the curler is.  I also found that if I \\&quot;aim\\&quot; for my head, instead of just trying to slide it in, then turn the pin upwards or toward my face when they touch my scalp and I know that they grabbed a bit of hair, that the curlers remain quite secure.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Conair clips that are recommended and they are secure as well.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added note 7-2-14: Some reviewers said that the red dot heat indicator never turned white as it was supposed to.  I always started rolling my hair about 5 minutes after I plugged in the set so the dot never got a chance to turn white.  So I decided to test them.  After 15 minutes, the dot was completely white and the rollers were actually so hot that I unplugged the set before I used them.  Some of these sets just seem to have problems that I have not encountered with mine.</li>
    <li> love this set. easy to use, and to keep clean and store. i am very happy with this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It was very pretty, but the curlers didn&#x27;t get hot! I let them hear up for a long time and they didn&#x27;t curl my hair good! I read the reviews and took a chance... I wasted my money! Buy a different kind!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the Conair Compact Hairsetter. It does the job and doesn&#x27;t take up very much space!</li>
    <li> Did just what it says it will do. Cut my hair short and had gotten rid of all my curlers. Went&lt;br /&gt;to buy some and they were all over $30. Checked Amazon, saw these and ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;Work well nice curl that holds up. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is I wish two of&lt;br /&gt;the small curlers were medium.</li>
    <li> The points on the rollers were too sharp.  The rods did not hold the rollers on.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the item it replaced, Clairol 20 instant head setter, that I had had for years and recently stopped working.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have wavy hair. So when I curl my hair it takes good. would recommed.</li>
    <li> Works well. Plenty of curlers for my hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice set with just enough curlers of every size. The reason I gave 4 stars is they take quite a while to warm up.</li>
    <li> This Conair product receives 4 stars because it produces magic curls when you don&#x27;t want to sleep with a headful of curlers, or make a trip to the hair salon. The only thing I dislike is the length of time it takes for the curlers to heat up, which is approximately half an hour. I recommend this product to those who aren&#x27;t in a hurry to get out the door, or want to brush their teeth, microwave a cup of coffee, and apply makeup while the set is heating.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers work wonderful! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well; the only way I can get my hair to curl is with hot rollers. I tried the &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; kind and they didn&#x27;t work very well at all. I put these in my hair and by the time I&#x27;m done doing my make-up, they&#x27;re ready to come out. The curls were defined and held up well throughout a night of dancing. I would highly recommend these! Just a quick tip to avoid creasing, take the roller clips out before you plug these in; if they are hot when you put them in to hold the roller, it can create a crease in your curl.</li>
    <li> Great set of hot rollers---surprised how light they are and still does a great job of creating beautiful big curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and makes with no luck. I finally found these at my local big box store for $13. I thought what the hay....it&#x27;s $13 unlike the $40 paid on some cermamic rollers that only straightened my hair. I tried each set I bought at least a week, changing times heated to different style products,etc. None of them gave me one curl let alone a headful that would stay. So I thought for sure these would have the same issue. No on/off switch which is not a big deal to me as back in the ol&#x27; days most of them didn&#x27;t. Rollers may look smaller than those from different sets but they do not give you Shirley Temple hair, despite some claims. I have YET to find hot roller sets that gives you the look of pin curls unless you are using hot rods. They come with pins and not clips. I prefer pins. There is a trick to using them. You want to curl to the root and use pin by placing it in the opposite side you curled. So if you are curling back, you push the pin down onto the curler and then forward or opposite direction the curler took. You are curling down, you push pin up. Make sure to have straight side of pin on the bottom of placement; it should the next to the scalp. While the teal colors are similar between the large and medium rollers this is not an issue. You have 2 locations where the pins are stored in the setter and you can easily separate the 2 to avoid confusion. Or separate them before you begin. There is no time suggestion on how long to preheat this setter. On average, these take 10-15 minutes for heat up. 15 minutes for optimum heating. 10 minutes works fine for me. These are plastic, yes. But they still retain heat. Just because you may not feel the scorching heat 10 minutes after placing them like some setters, doesn&#x27;t mean they are not working. I leave them in for at least 20 minutes for most of the time 30 if I want a super bouncy curl. Curls release a bit after an hour to a nice full healthy curl. If you are not getting a curl, change products youare using or try using nothing. Anything silicone based will pull a curl out. Try using stuff that is volumizing or curl enhancing as products. Leave in oils like argon or coconut can also cause curls not to take. Think back in the day, most of the time our mothers only used a setting lotion on our hair for curls or just dampen our hair to pin curl or roll in sponge curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not like the pins, you can always opt to buy clips to hold the rollers. I have found some at Sallys that work like Conair&#x27;s but only a fraction of the price. By that I mean they are large enough to hold the curler but they do not have the long claws on the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually went back to buy another set. Now I have 40 curlers and I have a wide range of options on how I would like to curl my hair now. I have as many as the large babyliss setter you can buy but for a quarter of what they cost. Give this setter a try. Have patience. They are worth it.</li>
    <li> The rollers seem to put curl into my hair but for a very short time.  The curl falls out immediately so I believe the rollers just don&#x27;t get hot enough..</li>
    <li> Good product good service.</li>
    <li> A bit complicated to use. But thats probably more on my part than the maker. Curls seem to hold and the price was great. Only used a couple times but looking forward to trying to learn it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled. I use them every day. The set fits perfectly on my tiny bathroom counter</li>
    <li> Works great and small little pack</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase! My hair is super curly and I am looking forward to seeing all I can do with the curlers.</li>
    <li> I could not use this item because the curlers got extremely hot. I could not even hold them long enough to get them in my hair. This item is a hazard and should be taken off the market.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up that well</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  It was new!  Great experience.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of a hot roller set in my search for a roller set that gets hot enough and stays hot long enough to make a long lasting curl. I&#x27;m in search of a hot roller set like those made 20 years ago that have flocked coating and heat really hot and stay hot long!  PLEASE ....would some American manufacturer step up to the plate and make a decent hot roller set like those made 20 years ago?  If you have to charge more then charge more for crying out loud. I will pay it.  And while your at it please study the vintage Clairol sets that came with the metal clips and observe that the metal is stronger and rougher than todays stainless steel clips.  Slippery clips made of stainless do not hold a roller in your hair. What is needed is the kind of metal that Clairol used in their hot rollers 20 years ago. Those clips have a tension, thickness, and roughness of metal that do the job.  I promise you, if a hot roller set were ever made that was flocked, heated very hot, stayed hot for at least 1 hour in your hair, and came with rough metal clips of the vintage Clairol kind, you&#x27;d outsell every other hot roller set on the market and you could charge triple for it.</li>
    <li> Very nice rollers for the money.  I ordered these on a Saturday and received them them very next Monday (GREAT SERVICE).  The rollers work as expected and I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Cannot yet write a review of this item since I&#x27;m yet to use it. It does look great and I love that it is compact. Will update after use.</li>
    <li> Rollers were very small.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers they are great!!!! And lightweight too!!! Thank you so much! Will be ordering from here again! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Good for thin, fine hair. The clips stay in unlike some sets I&#x27;ve tried. I bought 2 and leave one packed for travel.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product - I use it every day - this is a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; purchase!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mother and she loves them.  She couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores so I ordered them for her.  She said it&#x27;s just like the ones she had years ago.  They stay put and her hair doesn&#x27;t come out of them.</li>
    <li> My hair is too shot, but no problem with heating up. Gave to my daughter &amp; she loves it</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and theses didn&#x27;t work well for me. Only the very ends of my hair would curl and then the curl didn&#x27;t hold. If you are at all unsure, I would recommend buying from a local store. I didn&#x27;t realize I couldn&#x27;t return these because they weren&#x27;t sold by Amazon. I would have to pay for return shipping and a 15% restocking fee. I was extremely disappointed to find this out. I decided not to return as it wasn&#x27;t worth the money to send back.</li>
    <li> Had to send it back because it was defective, I followed the instructions but when I turned it on to heat, the rollers melted...</li>
    <li> Takes 20 minutes to heat up. Rollers are too hot to handle, curl does not last, and curl does not even look good.  I would keep looking and skip this. Design flaw:  the base gets hot too, so don&#x27;t drop anything on it and don&#x27;t stick your hand down there to retrieve it.</li>
    <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t hold for more than an hour or so. I even tried the cold air trick. Just use a curling iron</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to my order.  Some people said that the plastic rollers get hot but they don&#x27;t remain hot enough to work properly. They were correct.  The old school rollers always had a metal core.  The metal core kept the rollers hot and working.  These cheap rollers are 100% plastic.  Plastic will not hold heat like metal.  Of all the rotten ways to save a buck.  I am sending them back.</li>
    <li> get up to my mother for her birthday. she loves it! she uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> These curlers just don&#x27;t get very hot.  If you have medium or thick hair, you have to leave them in for an hour.  Then the curl falls out in about twenty minutes.</li>
    <li> This product is a time savor plus quick do when u dont have time for salon. Plus it heats fast and curls quickly plus the curls holds a while.I&#x27;m glad I bought it cause it&#x27;s not in stores.</li>
    <li> These hard plastic rollers just would not stay in my hair - they just slid out.  It was difficult to get them in my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Love this hairsetter.  Has enough smaller curlers for shorter hair.  Curlers grip well.  I would recommend this for anyone with medium length hair.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as described and it arrived in good condition and in the time frame quoted.  It also worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Curled my hair perfectly.  I have very fine hair so it slips out of curling irons.  These rollers worked great!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick hair and have used rollers forever. Was looking for something compact to travel with so took a chance on these. I set my hair as normal, curlers seemed hot- but after I took them out my hair was completely straight with a half an hour ! I was shocked !  They do not get hot enough for long hair..</li>
    <li> I have think hair and thought these would work well but when I take them out of my hair, it seems to create more static.  I will have to keep playing with them to see if I can find a happy way to use them.</li>
    <li> So the 2 stars is because the product worked and arrived on time but did not work for my type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have short, thick, blond, naturally curly hair.  I&#x27;ve used hot rollers before with great results but they were the larger velvet type and I figured since my hair was short, I needed smaller rollers...WRONG.  Starting with clean dry hair and no product, I let the rollers heat up for ~20 min, everything went in Ok and held well (I always prefer these metal clips to the large plastic jaw type) but when I took them out they worked too well.  I had VERY curly/fluffy &amp;#34;that 70&#x27;s show&amp;#34; mom hair, even 1940&#x27;s ish when brushed out.  I&#x27;m thinking that for someone with finer hair where the curl will fall these may be better.  But having thick hair, these were just WAY too small of a roller and gave more of a perm look than the soft body and wave that I was used to.  These will be going back and I&#x27;ll be picking up the Conair jumbo velvet rollers instead.</li>
    <li> These work great for me.  My hair is fine and I dry my hair after I apply Nioxin thickening gel.  This helps my  very fine hair hold the curl.  I have purchase two identical sets - one for travel.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great size, heats up hot enough to curl my hair and it holds the curl - I have long, fine hair that is hard to curl.  I like that the lid is attached and that there is plenty of room to store the clips.  I love the metal clips - they hold the rollers in place and do not fall out.  I have used hot rollers for over 20 years and it is hard to find a set that works to me -  these work really well.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Recipient very happy with it.  Priced right too!</li>
    <li> Great set of rollers. Received them quickly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set after my Revlon set with the velvet rollers started dying.  Reviews said it was like the one mom used to use on my hair.  It takes a long time to heat up and the curlers, even after 1/2 hour, still don&#x27;t seem to be hot enough to keep the curl in my hair.  Disappointed in the product, not the vendor, just the product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I used this product this morning for the first time. The larger barrels on the top for body and volume and the smaller on the bottom. The rollers heated up fast, they are easy to use...not to hot on the fingers. I didn&#x27;t get any tight curls, just loose manageable and stylable perfect for great volume.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and not a lot of it, so this worked perfectly for me! Easy to use and the clips worked just fine. This is the first time i&#x27;ve ever tried something like this and it works great. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have had this product in the past and have worn out several sets.  It is a must have as part of my hair styling regimen.</li>
    <li> I thought this was an amazing price for a hair setter.  The rollers are lightweight and made of plastic.  They don&#x27;t hold the heat that well and cool off quickly.  If you&#x27;re looking for a tight curl, don&#x27;t get this.  In the long run, I wished I would have spent $5 or $10 more for the rollers w/ceramic in them.  For a looser curl that lasts, they work great.</li>
    <li> Really nice and convenient ........</li>
    <li> HAVEN;&#x27;T USED IT YET, BUT CONAIR IS A  QUALITY PRODUCT. DID CHECK TO MAKE SURE IT HEATED UP, AS EXPECTED.  IT DID!!  AMAZONE, AGAIN, DID GOOD!! NEVER EVER USED THE AMAZON OR EBAY.  JUST TAKING A CHANCE, SO FAR AMAZON IS ON TARGET.  THINGS FROM E-BAY HAVE BEEN OK!!, TOO.  I JUST SEEM TO FIND WHAT I WANT, AND IT IS TRUE TO PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION ON AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> This set works great. I finally had to replace my 30 year old set. This one came with a cracked lid, but it was replaced immediately with no issues. Good purchase, good results, excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Received very quickly and price was right.  They work great</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wife and she loves them!!!  She had a larger roller set and actually prefers this one more!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use and it works well! I bought an extra for my mother. I love this product, never using a curling iron ever again after having this product.</li>
    <li> Nice product, small easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl African American hair.</li>
    <li> Great option for a simple curler set!</li>
    <li> Does a good job curling, if you can get past the burnt fingers!  HOT!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These curlers get pretty hot but once they are taken off the heat and put in hair the cool down way too fast. The only curlers that actually do much to my hair are the smallest ones and even those curls loosen and about an hour after curling my hair I only have very slight waves.</li>
    <li> These curlers work ok.  Since they are new they are hard to put the wire holders over the curlers.  You can do it and it does work just not smoothly.  They do smell like a chemical however as times goes on it has been less and less.  They do curl my hair I just wish they worked smoother.</li>
    <li> Great rollers for the price.</li>
    <li> The right number of rollers and the perfect size for travel just wish the pins were a little easier to use. The price is more than right. Just go for these you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> it doesnt stay on. had to return it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; Conair curlers from the &#x27;80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.  They would get extremely hot, but they worked very well.  If I left the curlers in my hair until they completely cooled, I would have literal ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These &amp;#34;new school&amp;#34; curlers may look very similar to the vintage ones I remember, but they definitely do not get as hot as the old ones.  As another reviewer has stated, the old curlers had some sort of liquid, perhaps oil inside.  I don&#x27;t hear anything in these, so perhaps that is the reason these aren&#x27;t as hot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, I still think this set is better than most others I&#x27;ve tried lately.  Even if they can only give me a wave instead of a tight curl, they are my best bet for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows of a better hot roller set that actually gets hot, please let me know.  Until then, these will do.</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl and the little teeth on the rollers leave marks in my hair.  I&#x27;m going to keep using my vintage Clairol hairsetter from the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a quick and easy alternative to using a curling iron.  I hadn&#x27;t seen or used electric rollers in years, and was pleased by the very affordable selection offered on Amazon. They arrived quickly and work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Works great might order more smaller rollers. I needed small rollers and could not find in stores. I had an older set that I used far years</li>
    <li> These curlers definitely curl your hair nicely.  The only downside is that they are dry curlers (not steam curlers) and they do get really, really hot.  This is great for curling, but definitely hurts your fingers after a while.  I suppose this is the downside to any set of curlers, though. Overall I&#x27;m happy with them and have  no complaints about how the function. They do make very pretty curls.</li>
    <li> According to my 10 year old, I am now the best mom in the world for getting her these rollers.  Her hair is straight as a stick and baby fine, and the heat is just right and curls last most of the day.  Wish all birthday gifts could be this inexpensive and loved.</li>
    <li> these rollers heat up fast an they curl quickly, there is one roller that lets you know when its time to use the rollers and they are very easy to use.  My only small complaint is that there isn&#x27;t an on off switch, you have to plug them in every time.</li>
    <li> These rollers have worked very well for me, however, I think these work best on a certain type of hair. Mine is fairly thin and long (5 inches past my shoulders). There are just enough rollers for all of my hair, but if my was thicker they may not work quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heat up quickly and are easy to put in your hair. I recommend buying the plastic Conair Clips to use with these rollers (instead of the metal clips that come with it). I get a better curl when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewer that recommended a cool shot of air with a hairdryer before taking the rollers out is absolutely correct! My curls held a bit longer after using that trick. I also recommend LIGHTLY spritzing your hair with a flexible hold hairspray before rolling your hair. It creates great hold while keeping your hair \\&quot;touchable.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rollers and the case is also very compact. If you wanted to travel with these, they would not take up much room in a suitcase or on a hotel bathroom counter. These are very good rollers for the price!</li>
    <li> Need to buy different size rollers.s the</li>
    <li> I bought two different hair setters at the local store. I returned them both, because they would not heat up enough to curl my hair. This hair setter is great . The curlers are light weight. Each curler sits on its own metal rod that heats from the base of the unit. This rod heats the entire lenght of the curler ...enough to make great curls. I am so happy I bought this set. One thing I wish it had is ....an auto shut off. It does NOT have AUTO shut off. I would of gave a five star if it had.</li>
    <li> This is the best hot curler I&#x27;ve used so far. The only problem is the process, the machine itself is not at fault.  Yes My hair has days where it comes out flawless from these rollers but then there are days I look like a poodle, but its okay. practice makes perfect, but the hairsetter has no blame for that. it heats up well enough, turns on, and is easy to stash away. Great product!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and they lady loved it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Has just the right sizes to do really curly, wavy, or just extra volume. Heats up quickly too. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> was not bad for the price cause it came with pins .but losses heat by the time the culer is put in hair thats way i give it 4 stars</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t raise my arms for long time so curling iron is hard to use.  I can put the hair rollers in and rest in between and they work wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T DO A VERY GOOD JOB IF YOU WANT A CURL TO HOLD THROUGHOUT THE DAY</li>
    <li> This hairsetter is very compact. Fits easily on the back of the bathroom sink. Heats up fast and does a good job.</li>
    <li> Because had small, medium,large rollers and they get gei hot.What my wife was looking for.She said that she would recomend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews both pro and con for this product as well as other heated rollers.  My Caruso Curls died just after one year and I wasn&#x27;t about to spend that kind of money again.  I went down to Ulta to check this out.  These have the smaller size that I have been looking for.  I ordered these from Amazon as they had a better price and were offering free shipping.  I have to say, these do the job for me.  They take about 10 minutes max to warm up and are hot when they go into my hair.  I am very pleased with the results and will buy a spare set.  So glad I decided to give these a try as there are so few hotr roller sets made for short hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by the reviews for this, since I have had a really good experience with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually air dry my below-shoulder length hair, which is naturally just a bit wavy and fine but a lot of it. But for my wedding rehearsal dinner, I had my heart set on using rollers to look a bit more special and I&#x27;ve been using them since. I tried the Remington travel set off Amazon, and didn&#x27;t like them since a) three prongs didn&#x27;t work, b) 10 was too few and too small and c) they never got hot. (http://www.amazon.com/Remington-H-1015-Ceramic-Compact-Medium/dp/B000EPJNMW) I also tried the Conair Instant Heat Compact set, and no dice. Too small, too few, not hot enough. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002G21GI/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00). Neither set did much for my hair to make or hold a curl, even with hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these! They worked like a charm and were perfect. They&#x27;re like the old school ones my mother used to use on me and I love them for that. (No ionic crap, which I suspect is more marketing gimmick than science). I didn&#x27;t do anything different, just shampooed my hair with my usual organic shampoo, no hair spray or product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The middle curler has a little indicator that goes from red to white when they&#x27;re ready, and I found that would take about ~10 minutes. Not instant, I know, but not too long and it&#x27;s worth it to wait it out. Also, make sure you heat them with the lid closed--this is what the instructions say--otherwise, yes, they won&#x27;t get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the combination of sizes, though they&#x27;re a bit smaller than the old school ones I remember (maybe my head is bigger now?) I rarely used all 20, but I definitely mix up the sizes depending on how much curl I want. Very nice that they have 8 of the smaller ones and 6 of the other two sizes as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the pins and not the clamps. The clamps I find make ridges that look funny. These pins have a good tension so when I put them on the curler in the opposite direction of the roll, they stay nice and steady. Also, the case has a little slot for the pins, which the other curler sets didn&#x27;t have. Nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this, plus the size is hardly bigger than the compact sets. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend.put them on the curler in the opposite direction of the roll, they stay nice and steady.

    <li> Awful turns into a friz</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed and wanted at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I can NOT believe how GREAT these rollers are!! Let me first say that this is about the fifth set of Hot Rollers that I have tried, ALL the other sets were more expensive than these, and some of them WAY more expensive than THESE!!!  My hair is VERY fine and VERY thin and down to the bottom of my shoulder blades. To say that it is HARD to curl is an understatement!!!  I heated these up for about 15 minutes, rolled my hair, left them in for about 15 minutes and unrolled. I could NOT believe it!!! My has is actually CURLY!!!! The ONLY product that I put in my hair was some Nexus Mousse, the SAME product that I used with ALL the other sets as well! These rollers do get HOT! I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can hold on to the ends of the rollers to roll your hair, so that is no biggie. The big this IS that THESE rollers WORK!!!! And they are UNDER $20!!! So, if you want to curl your hair with hot rollers and it actually work, get THESE rollers and a can of the Nexus Mousse that is also available here on Amazon. I would say a TOTAL of 35 minutes from plugging in to DONE you WILL have curled hair!</li>
    <li> The rollers lose heat quite quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I really like these, they heat up quickly and make really nice curls.</li>
    <li> I like everything about these except that I wish the ends didn&#x27;t get as hot as they do. I can still handle the rollers but they get hot as it&#x27;s just a single piece of plastic on each roller. My hair is very thick and straight, and these do keep a curl all day long. I spray with hairspray as they are cooling, then I spray again when I take them out. I then brush my hair out a little and then tight poodle curls fall to a perfect curly wave in about an hour.</li>
    <li> This works fine for what i need. it is exactly like it looks. it is hot rollers and that is all that i wanted. i have very straight hair so i usually let them warm for about 3 to 5 minutes, i like my rollers really hot to help set the curl. i leave the rollers in about 10 minutes and i have the body and curl i want. my curl last all day, but of course i am a hair spray believer! not sure how long the curl would hold without hair spray! i would have given them a 5 but i hate the roller holders! you really have to work them just right to get them on the rollers! otherwise they are great set of hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot, but easy to work with if you have a bag of clips to hold the rollers.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The rollers get really hot and make a nice curl. If my hair has a perm, the curls will hold for days.&lt;br /&gt;The case is small enough to easily pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my rollers for years and they are still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The rollers take a little while to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;For me there are too many tiny rollers and not enough of the large and medium rollers. I wish Conair would make two different sets. I had to buy two sets, just to get enough large rollers to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I found out the hard way not to leave the pins in the case while it is heating up, as the little rubber ends are starting to come off, I guess due to the heat. Now they stab my head when using them. I suppose this little tip was in the instructions that I didn&#x27;t read. :(&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Conair does not sell replacement pins. So don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
    <li> Love the curlers.  Can finish my makeup and get dressed while hair is setting.  Nice curls and body for the day.</li>
    <li> These rollers are very light plastic.  They work fine as long as you are quick.  They do not stay very hot very long.  Nice compact size.  Not bad for the price.  Just using as a back up set for now.</li>
    <li> The hair setter is a great size and heats up in about 5 or 6 minutes.  It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and am very impressed with the quality.  Very well made product and great price. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very easy to use.I like it</li>
    <li> The rollers are much smaller than they appear.  I hate this product.</li>
    <li> This item is not up to past experiences with brand name items. Rollers are small made for fine or thin hair. Need to use the product 2x&#x27;s before satisfactory.  Not recommended for thick natural blonde resistant to curl hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an older Conair model. This one does not curl, no matter how long I leave in my (short) hair. I tried it twice going by the instructions and still had to get out the curling iron to get some curl in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The old one still works so no sense replacing it with one that doesn&#x27;t work.  Just thought I would update to a curler set I thought was gonna curl faster and better than old one.  I am missing a couple clips from old one but can get by.  Returning this one.</li>
    <li> The rollers took forever to heat up. Even after waiting 30 minutes they were only warm and did not work to curl my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old really likes these.  It gives you the feel of being in a salon. I do wish there were more pins that came with it, but overall it&#x27;s a good product. She has thin hair so it works very easily for her. I haven&#x27;t tried it on thick hair yet.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic electric rollers. I have wavy hair that is cut in layers. I find that I can leave them in for only 5 minutes and my hair comes out gorgeous. The clips fit beautifully and I don&#x27;t find the curlers hot to touch with the fingers. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much as described, with jumbo, large and medium rollers except they aren&#x27;t as large as another brand&#x27;s Jumbo and Large rollers.  i was a little disappointed, but they still work.  i will go ahead and order the other brand&#x27;s jumbo &amp; large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;the clips slide on easily and are color coded to go with the specific size roller.</li>
    <li> The heat as so hot I could not pick the rollers out</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this hairsetter and the price. This was a replacement for my previous hairsetter this was half the price of the old one..</li>
    <li> Awhile back I had bought these rollers at Walmart. After several years of use it was time for another set. I wanted to try something different and bought the velcro rollers -- these did not hold a curl and got cool right away.  I went on a hunt to find the Conair curlers and did not find them at any store nearby. I went on Amazon and found them. These stay hot and curl my hair. These curlers are the BEST!</li>
    <li> I ordered these to give my thinning fine hair some volume.  I do like them but wish there were more of the larger rollers with this set then just 6 of them.  They are not too hot when putting them in my hair and don&#x27;t burn my scalp like some have in the past.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Stop working after only a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but a ton of it. These rollers were very hard to hold as they got very hot and are pokey. So when I tried to put them in my hair it took awhile. Then, they didn&#x27;t actually curl my hair at all. It would hold for maybe 20 minutes then the curl would fall out. I returned these and got these rollers instead.

    <li> Gets hot enough to roll my hair.  Really wish I knew how to use them though...</li>
    <li> This product works as specified. Really makes good curls and they hold. Liked hot rollers enough to buy another set to make sure I had enough for whole head.</li>
    <li> I like the quicker heat-up time.  I don&#x27;t like that the curlers get so hot they are sometimes hard to handle.  I like the case with a storage space for the clips; I don&#x27;t like that there are only six medium rollers when my hair set pattern needs seven. I really liked being able to review the various choices then purchasing on-line.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> In the box there was a booklet that showed me how to order more rollers. So I was able to get more of the size I use. Any size fits on the heating pegs. The clips are also available, but you get 4 of each size. I had to order multiple bags of clips so I could get enough for the extra rollers. The cost of the rollers and clips and shipping were very reasonable. The order arrived very quickly. The rollers work great. They heat up in about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Tried this product and returned it.  Did not like the pins to hold curlers and they were uncomfortable and not impressed with results of using curlers.  Returned product</li>
    <li> It is not as good&lt;br /&gt;as my old one was</li>
    <li> I read the review&#x27;s and ordered them anyway, they are GREAT! Heat up nice and hot,give a nice curl to my hair~ I would recommend to my friends.[[ASIN:B001BLRYMO Conair HS34R Compact Hairsetter, Blue]]</li>
    <li> I needed a new set of rollers when my set started to crack and chip.  I love those old rollers!  Well, this set is nice but they don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair for all day.  The best that they worked was after a half an hour heating and leaving them in while I drove a half an hour to work.  Great hair that day and everyone commented.  I don&#x27;t have that long to let them heat and that long to leave them in daily.  They need to get hotter!  But I will keep them an use them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order...these don&#x27;t get hot enough to even put a curl in your hair...I returned them and found some on Ebay!</li>
    <li> These rollers work great- they heat up fast and hold the curl in my hair. They are also perfectly compact in their case with the wire holders. Great for travel or home. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> got it for my girls they loved it better price than walmart fast shipper exact item I want  one for myself now</li>
    <li> I was looking for the Remington Hot Rollers but they did not seem to have the type of roller I was looking for.  Then I came across the Conair HS34R!  They work great and I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see how small this set is, but it packs a punch. The rollers are smooth and I&#x27;ve had great luck with how it works with my hair.  The curls stick around longer than when I use my other rollers that have a more velveteen fabric on the rollers.  My only slight complaint is that these take a while to heat up all the way.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair.  Did not work well at all. The little bit of curl it did leave fell within an hour.  And did not un roll very easily. I have much better luck with the velvet covered rollers.</li>
    <li> Just the right sizes of rollers, easy access and storage of the holding pins, pretty colors.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great set and super price! Heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t burn fingers. Nice size. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> Very hard to put in hair and keep secure and curls are way too tight.  Don&#x27;t ever use and wish I could return.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for- compact, efficient, easy to use... totally does the trick.</li>
    <li> not hot enough to set hair</li>
    <li> I researched this carefully, and bought this for my wife, who is spectacularly picky about her hairsetters.  It&#x27;s not the technology that&#x27;s important, it&#x27;s the execution.  She is thrilled.  A different, more expensive Conair model was a dud.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers! This set is similar to the original Clairol electric rollers. These heat well! The best part is the metal roller holders are the same size so you can order 2 sets and put the smaller rollers on the medium or larger roller base rods and have a set of all small (which I like) all medium or all large rollers depending on your need. No more looking on eBay for old electric roller sets at prices ranging to $100. This set will work for all hair lenghts and styles and the price is great! I am back for 3 more sets! :) LOVE these rollers!~Sharon</li>
    <li> I love these curlers! I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers before and being a new mom I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do my hair. These curlers heat evenly and are easy to put in and such a time saver. The best part the curls stay all day something my hair never did before!!!!</li>
    <li> It was actually a gift for my mom and she loved them. I might get me some for me soon.</li>
    <li> Quick to heat! Just the right size. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the old ones I purchased years and years ago.  They don&#x27;t seem to get quite as hot but still do a  nice job.</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers for many years and find the Conair Compact hairsetter to be everything I need in hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;It does everthing it is intended to do. It heats beautifully. It doesn&#x27;t take any longer to heat than any other hairsetter I have owned throughout the years. It creates good curls and body. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room and is a very good price. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others. The only negative I have with it, is that I would like a little bit larger roller. Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair. So fine, that even a new hairdresser I went to was a little shocked at how &amp;#34;baby fine&amp;#34; my hair is. My dream has always been to have voluminous hair that doesn&#x27;t fall flat...DREAM being the key word. Every other hairdresser (all 3) has told me that in order to get some volume, I will definitely need extensions. I think that&#x27;s a bit counterintuitive, considering that upon removal of those extensions, chunks of my hair will also come out. BAD IDEA. Anyway, on to this product (the entire point of the review)...my new hairdresser advised against extensions (refreshing to hear) and said that I should first try some rollers. I bought the conair compact hair setter 1. because they were cheaper than others, which I figured would be a better idea for a first timer like me and 2. the reviews were positive.  I am not a person who has time to do my hair in the morning and even if I had time, I&#x27;m not very good at actually &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; my hair. Here is what I loved about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;2. It heats up fairly quickly. I plug in the hair setter before hopping in the shower so the rollers are hot and ready to put in my hair&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s a no fuss way of doing your hair! Like I stated, I don&#x27;t have time to do my hair in the morning but it takes about five minutes to place the rollers all around my head (sometimes I even just put 4 along the top of my head) and leave the rollers there while I do my makeup, make coffee, come back upstairs, and BAM! The rollers are ready to come out and my hair is ready to go. I run my fingers through my hair and I have decent volume. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls, but I love the waves the rollers make!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone who is on the run or does not know how to style their hair with a curler.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would def buy again! I bought this for myself and to use on my 8 year old daughter. She thought it was great....I could roll up her hair an she could go pla while they cooled. Before she would have to stand around while I used the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to heat up, the curlers slide right off my hair but once you get past all that it makes a curl. I do not recommend this set. 2 stars for being small which is good.</li>
    <li> I have been rolling my hair for 17 years. This set reminds me of the sets I could get a long time ago. They get hot! I really like how compact the set is. They do not take up a lot of counter space. I would agree with other reviewers that the rollers are not very big. The biggest roller is more like a medium-sized roller. I use these when I want a beachy wave look and they work very well for that.</li>
    <li> I have used hot rollers daily for at least fifteen years and wouldn&#x27;t have replaced my other set which was Conair also, but it just suddenly stopped heating after 15 years. Not a bad run, though. This model was the closest I could get to the other.  I have found that you need to leave the cover down while heating. You MUST wait for the roller with the red dot to turn completely white before using them. Also, once you roll your hair, don&#x27;t remove them too soon from your hair, like after only 15 minutes, because you want have a good curl - just sort of loose - but that might work for a causal affair, but won&#x27;t hold up after an hour even with spray.  The best for me has been to let the rollers heat for an least a hour before using them, then keep them in my hair for a least 30 minutes to have a curl that will last for hours. I have bone straight and semi thick hair, however, because everyone&#x27;s hair will most likely respond differently you need to figure out what will work for you. Blessings!</li>
    <li> Good product, but my hair is too long for it to be effective :(. It heats up well and stores nicely.</li>
    <li> JUST RIGHT FOR ME. I have thick hair and like a little curl to tame it.  This has 3 sizes. I use the medium and the large only. Heats very fast, very hot. I am happy with it. The curls to not stay for days, but I don&#x27;t want that. They might with a little styling gel or spray. If I leave the rollers in until totally cooled and lightly spray will hair is warm, curls maintain for a long day/night. NOTE: THE PINS GET EXTREMELY HOT WHILE THIS IS HEATING. I always take the pens out first.</li>
    <li> Conair&#x27;s Compact Hairsetter is my favorite go-to hair styler. It&#x27;s much more efficient at making curls than a curling iron and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting burnt while I curl either. It heats up fast. It&#x27;s compact, but not too small. This little set of curlers is a time saver. I stick them in my hair, get dressed for the day, throw on some make-up, and then take the curlers out. A quick brush through and I&#x27;m ready. I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on my hair, so I&#x27;m pleased with these curler&#x27;s performance. I&#x27;ve used other electric curler sets, but this one is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are not quite hot enough but will do as long as you put some product in your hair first such as a curling mousse or hair spray. Then set your hair. Make sure you leave them in long enough to get to room temp before removing.</li>
    <li> I love this curler set. It holds my hair well and curls very quickly.</li>
    <li> Works fast ..not burning hot and very compact.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed that the rollers were smaller than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;The clips secured the rollers very well.My hair came out beautiful and shiny but it didn&#x27;t hold the style very long. I will try a setting lotion next time.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for these rollers. I used this exact same brand and style back in 1989 yes 1989, I loved these rollers heats well and holds the heat. Being African American I didn&#x27;t think these rollers would work for my hair, I was wrong! Excellent product, purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> Gift --- she liked the fact that there were 8 small rollers</li>
    <li> This is a great hairsetter if you like your rollers hot and not flocked.  I&#x27;ve tried other setters and they just never curled my hair good enough, this one does.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace and old one I had. It is wonderful. Much faster than my old one! I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> There weren&#x27;t any usable sizes in this set for me that would have worked. I would look like I had a old fashioned roller-do if I set my hair in rollers this small. I haven&#x27;t used it even once and regret this purchase.. because I had to pay return shipping I just kept it and I hate it. I&#x27;ll probably gift it to someone in the future but wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have short hair and want lots of curl and body. I&#x27;ll stick with my ceramic hot iron.</li>
    <li> these rollers dont even start to get hot and the little bit of WARMNESS  they do get isnt enough to even waste the electricity it takes to let them get WARM</li>
    <li> I have daughters with straight hair who love curls as much as I do. The best curls I ever had were the ones made with my old plastic hot rollers (not velvet) that had teeth and pins (not clamps) to secure them. After searching high and low I finally found these and they work as great as they did back in &#x27;85! They&#x27;re such a great price I was able to purchase a set for each one too!</li>
    <li> Like a blast from my past, this is very like what I used in my youth. Gets really hot! I had to unplug it to finish.</li>
    <li> They did not get hot enough.  Curl did not hold for more than 2 hours.  Returned them</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Stays hot, big rollers. But the clips fall out every time.</li>
    <li> I like this hairsetter (I&#x27;ve owned a lot of different ones since the Clairol Kindness set came out in the 60&#x27;s). I like the color.  The variety of rollers is good for my needs, and I like the slots in front to hold the pins.  A couple of improvement suggestions, though--the rollers take a long time to heat up (10-15 minutes).  This is longer than I&#x27;ve experienced with other types of hairsetters.  And then, when heated, there seems to be no regulator to keep them at a stable temp, and they get very hot!  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine so it&#x27;s susceptible to heat damage.  So if I have plugged the set in, and forgotten about it, (because it takes a long time to heat up) I need to unplug it and wait again, as the rollers are much too hot to place in my hair.  An on/off switch would be really great, and a dial for desired heat would also help.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great unit!</li>
    <li> Works great, couldn&#x27;t believe the price!</li>
    <li> Love it!! easy to handle</li>
    <li> The clips work easily, the rollers stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is it is easy to lose the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this set had bigger sizes as well.</li>
    <li> Update. Now that I&#x27;ve got the clips, I&#x27;ve found that none of the roller sizes work for me. I have medium length hair and I wanted rollers for body, not curl. I look like my mother with tight little curls. Also, I have soft hair and they don&#x27;t stay well. After a bit I feel them sliding down my hair. I would have returned them, but by the time you get through with the cost...not worth it. Donating to a shelter. Wish someone would make large, not huge, rollers in a small set. If anyone knows of one, pls let me know. My layers aren&#x27;t long enough for the really big rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review. Not helpful. Opened the box today ready to try them out and there are NO CLIPS IN THE BOX. I must admit, I have never had this problem with amazon and I order a lot. But their solution was for me to return the whole thing and wait for another delivery - rather than just sending the missing items. For this kind of trouble, I can do brick and mortar thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for the granddaughter with long hair and wanted special curls for an event. Very well pleased.</li>
    <li> I have fine, but thick hair, and I needed a hairsetter that would give my hair curls that I could brush out and style.  I hadn&#x27;t used a hairsetter in years, using instead a curling iron which took a lot of time.  This hairsetter heats up quickly, makes great curls, and I am very, very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this and decided why not, I will try it out.  This was garbage.  For one, not enough curlers, two, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  This will be given to a preteen for play.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far, but perhaps because I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before I found it difficult rolling my dry hair onto the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps with more use and practise it will become easier???</li>
    <li> The first curler was hot when I took it out to use it, by the end they were warm. They didn&#x27;t curl my hair, and make it look horrible. I have been getting good results with a curling iron, but wanted a quicker way to curl my hair. This was not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning them and looking for other curlers</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a good price! Have used many of their products and am always completely satisfied with the results!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. 3 different sizes for a variety in tightness for my curls. Always leaves my hair full of body!</li>
    <li> These blue rollers heated enough to give my fine, thin hair a good set using heat-tamer spray lotion. This Conair model did NOT overheat and burn my scalp and fingers as the pink flocked roller set did. Extra rollers and clips are available from Conair by mail, not online at their website yet. That information is included in their little booklet that comes in the roller set.</li>
    <li> I love this hairsetter by Conair.  I just wish they would make one with only the large rollers for travel.  I have two, one I just dropped while on vacation, and broke the top off so I&#x27;m ordering another.  It still works and I will have it on hand, like I do blow dryers, incase one goes out.  This works better than any hairsetter I&#x27;ve tried.  It takes a little while for it to warm up but the curl is the best ever and it lasts all day and even into the next.  If anyone at Conair is listening to my review.....PLEASE WOULD YOU MAKE A TRAVEL HAIRSETTER JUST LIKE THIS WITH ONLY THE LARGE ROLLERS?  The one you have does not work as well as this does.  I&#x27;ve tried almost every travel set on the market and either they leave an indentation (the clips), or with the clips they are just as cumbersome for travel as this or in the end take up just as much space with the clips, or they frizz my hair, and do not get hot enough.  I am convinced this is the best on the market at least it is for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived right away. The metal clips work great. Fast heat up. Perfect</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical...but I have received so many compliments on my curls since using this product.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I can now wash and style my hair effortlessly thanks to this product. The secret is to allow the rollers to heat up completely - a minimum of 15 minutes and then leave the rollers in to cool completely - another 15-20 minutes or so and just slip them out as you are heading out the door. Thanks, Conair, for this product.</li>
    <li> nice, i juz dunno how to use, and how to rollers my hair properly,</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 different sets of rollers and these by far are my favorite and would buy again. Perfect size and compact uses less space but actually has more rollers than my old bigger set.</li>
    <li> This set doesn&#x27;t get very hot, so any curl doesn&#x27;t last.  Can&#x27;t seem to find a set that has everything - heat, hair protection, and kind od clamps that don&#x27;t leave creases. :-(</li>
    <li> It takes too long to heat. I donated it to a thrift shop</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Rollers get extremely hot, which is great for setting hair but tough on fingers.  I typically remove metal clips from their storage space while hair setter is on so that they do not heat up as well.</li>
    <li> The rollers were too hot to handle and they were smaller that I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased them to do my hair for Halloween.  They did arrive on time, but they do not heat up very well at all.  The curlers just did not get hot! Needless to say, because they did not get hot, no matter how long I left them in, they just did not curl, my plain Jane curling Iron does better than these.  I am very disappointed and will be returning my product.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great and don&#x27;t take up a ton of space on your counter top.</li>
    <li> A co-worker&#x27;s hair looked pretty one day so I complimented her and she told me she had used hot rollers. I had not even thought about these since I was young (using my mother&#x27;s) so I ordered this set and have not been disappointed! Quick and easy with good results!</li>
    <li> Got stuck in my hair!</li>
    <li> Very good!  Small enough to slip into a drawer or leave on the dresser.  Complete with all the sizes needed.&lt;br /&gt;Heats quickly. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, curls stay in all day. My ONLY complaint is that the lid doesn&#x27;t have a latching mechanism which makes it easy to accidentally dump the pins and rollers out.</li>
    <li> Just received item.  Absolutely no paperwork included!  None!  No directions - do I leave the lid open or closed while heating?  No registration or warranty.  If I knew how they worked I may have a different opinion.  Sloppy packaging and marketing when there is nothing to reference.  How do I clean rollers?  Seriously can&#x27;t believe that I received a new set although that is what I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this curler set...it&#x27;s just what I wanted.  I plug it in and in about 15 minutes it&#x27;s ready.  By the time I put in 4-5 curlers, it&#x27;s time to take them out, with curls galore....so, in less than 30 minutes, my hair goes from straight and limp, to curly and bouncy!  I recommend this set to anybody wanting a quick way to set your hair, with a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these for so cheap but they aren&#x27;t worth it at all!! They don&#x27;t curl your hair well and the few curls I did have fell out within less than an hour with hairspray.</li>
    <li> I like this set more than the last, more expensive,  one I had.  I actually bought two of these because I wanted more medium sized rollers.  I don&#x27;t need the big ones.  All the rollers can fit on the same rods so it works out OK.  It&#x27;s pretty good.  Wish it had an auto shut off.</li>
    <li> This little hair setter was great! Much better than some more expensive sets I have used.</li>
    <li> So... I have a Vidal Sassoon set of hot rollers that I&#x27;ve had since the late 90&#x27;s. Pretty much identical to this model (metal prongs that heat up the core of a plastic roller with teeth kept in place by a metal pin). I packed them and moved and now have NO idea where they are :-( Recently, I was reminded of the effortlessness and ease of making my hair voluminous and wavy with hot rollers. Did some research online and wanted to get the jumbo rollers for body. Went to Ulta cuz I had a coupon and got Conair More Big Curls. It was a dud. They&#x27;re cheap for a reason. I tried twice: once with day-old hair and then again with freshly washed/blow-dried/prepped hair. Fail. I had waves for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to Wal-Mart and got the Conair Jumbo Ion Shine Instant Heat set and was SO excited! Then I got home, opened the package to find the pins missing. I wanted to cry. But I got online and scoured reviews and decided just to stick with what I know and find a set similar to my old tried and true rollers. Found these and really appreciated the suggestion by another reviewer to get TWO SETS and just use the bigger ones. Duh. So I did. I&#x27;m writing the review with rollers in my hair. I&#x27;ll update this review when these come out :-)</li>
    <li> I wanted it for travel and I like the size. I have straight hair and I just plug it in when I go to shower and it&#x27;s ready.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these hot rollers.  I keep one in a box ready to go when we travel.  They work well for me and I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about them.  The price is right also.</li>
    <li> This roller set is compact and does the job very well. The rollers heat up very quickly and the rollers and metal clips (as opposed to the plastic clip that goes all the way around the roller) don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;dents&amp;#34; in my fine hair. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> This is a nice unit when I do use it. My only two complaints are that it doesn&#x27;t come with enough pins and it is hot as heck if your finger somehow touches one of the heating units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to heat up in minutes and renders nice curls. I just wish it had more pins or clips included.</li>
    <li> I had purchased another roller set that did not work well at all.  These stayed in my hair without issue, made perfect curls and were very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these hot curlers, they heat up nicely and create a nice soft curl without burning my hair. I would recommend this product.  The price is good as well.</li>
    <li> Curlers do not get hot enough.  The old, worn-out set I had attained a higher temp and therefore was more useful.</li>
    <li> The Hairsetter works okay but the clips are most annoying.  They are difficult to use and don&#x27;t stay in place very well.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps Conair has improved this situation, in which case I would be happy to purchase clips if they are available.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter requested hot rollers for Xmas. She just loves this set. Very easy to use with beautiful out come.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I was hopeing it would be, I had a set of hot curlers years ago and used them all the time, but this product didnt work very well. My dauhter has long hair and it was a waste of time to even try it didnt curl her hair at all.</li>
    <li> This set is ok...I don&#x27;t believe it gets hot enough and just produces limp curls. I kept it but have most definitely had better.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m growing my hair I was finding it difficult to find smaller roller. Take extra time to allow them to heat up.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw this set at Wal-Mart for 22 dollars I paid 17 dollars here. I have never seen this set anywhere elae but walmart.. Awesome...</li>
    <li> The Conair curlers are a great product.  They heat up nicely and the curls look great.  This was a good bargain &amp; I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> Compact design and weight for travel, but I wish they were flocked with wide clips instead of having little nubbies with thin clips which fall out easily.</li>
    <li> Do not get hot enough and takes a long time to heat up.</li>
    <li> I have had these for two years &amp; they still work great even after I dropped them really hard a couple of times....when these wear out &amp; I going to get the same ones again...I have gone from really short hair to long hair since I have had them &amp; they have worked great for both lengths..I used to be a hairdresser so I have had a few of these hairsetters &amp; some of them just left my hair which has a lot of body really limp &amp; unaffected..</li>
    <li> We used this for the first time the other day.  The directions don&#x27;t give any actual &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; information relating to how long it takes curlers to heat up or how long you should leave in your hair once set.  They say to watch the indicator light on one of the curlers to turn from red to transparent white.  I think it took about 20 mins for curlers to heat up to that level.  We left them in for about 20 mins &amp; I have to say the results were terrific!  My daughters hair is completely straight normally but after we took the curlers out she had the curls she wanted &amp; the best part is they stayed in all day without having to spray them with any product.</li>
    <li> I assumed when Conair said that some of these curlers would be \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; sized, that&#x27;s what they meant- compared with the jumbo size of their other unit (the pink Conair HS10W Instant Heat Compact Hot Rollers for around $12.00). I returned this unit right away. I will be ordering another HS10W unit-it heats up very quickly, even if I have to reuse some of the curlers in one session, and there is no curve in the curler... Just a large, evenly shaped curler. I have frizzy hair and this set gives me a smooth curl- Love it and will be ordering another one so I have more of the larger curlers. WHY, CONAIR, do you not offer replacement curlers?  [[ASIN:B001ELJO0Q Conair HS10W  Instant Heat Compact Hot Rollers]]</li>
    <li> They curled well but the clips do not help hold the curler in. If you have long hair and expect regular softer curls like kim k I would not recommend this. These curl well, but they come out as small curls. Normally my hair goes to my butt but these curls shrunk it to my shoulders! I recommend the XL and Jumbo curlers!</li>
    <li> I love how the product has different size rollers. I prefer these clips to the clamps that leave creases. Plus the timer on the roller that lets you know when the roller are hot enough are great. I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I like these rollers but the only problem was the box wasn&#x27;t accurate. They tell you that you&#x27;re going to get 6 jumbo rollers, 6 large rollers and 8 medium rollers. U actually get 4 jumbo rollers, 5 large rollers and 11 medium rollers. I would rather had what was on the box but I still like them.</li>
    <li> This product creates tight curls compared to the loose sexy ones I was looking for. The curlers are smaller so they work for medium length to short hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them before and I love them !!</li>
    <li> quick heating, curls great</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and these don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl MY hair. I would hate to see the result on someone with straight or fine hair. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is hard to get the rollers to stay in your hair with the cheap clips that are provided.</li>
    <li> awesome! aririved quickly and works great! just what I was looking for!  Beats  driving around looking for ones that will stay put in your hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased these a few months ago and these are by far the worst electric hair rollers I ever had. These rollers take more than 45 minutes to heat up. The curlers do not stay hot if you leave the lid up. At best, I got some waves in my straight hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a set like the Clairol 20, these are definitely not it.</li>
    <li> These are a little heavy and I&#x27;m not crazy about the clips. They do the job that I bought them for and it does not take long to get a curl.</li>
    <li> The rollers won&#x27;t stay in my hair but maybe my hair is too short at this time.  I put it away to try again at a later date.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this like some other reviewers. It heats up and curls just fine and holds the curl too.</li>
    <li> did not work well, never heated enough; and did not hold the hair no matter what types of clips were used</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that does not curl well. I usually have to curl my hair first with the curling iron then i roll my hair with the curlers and let it sit for a few hours. IF your hair curls easily this should be fine for you.</li>
    <li> i HAVE IMPOSSIBLE TO CURL HAIR BUT IF I LET THESE GET GOOD &amp; HOT, i CAN GET SOME CURL. I have shoulder length hair but use 2 sets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of hot rollers, but nothing curls my thick, heavy hair like these classic Conair curlers! Thank you, Conair, for keeping these classics around!!</li>
    <li> These curlers heat up super fast and come in three different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had lots of hot rollers over the years and these are my new favorite !</li>
    <li> I love these, I use them 3 or 4 times a week</li>
    <li> It simply takes too long to heat up. Much longer than my last set of electric rollers. Very disappointing since I am quite rushed in the mornings. If time means anything to you, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> easy to use small compact case but in end curls did not hold. medium shoulder lengther hair fell flarnot curl after an hour in cool weather no humidity</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase and was very happy at how quickly I received my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J McCoy</li>
    <li> I really like these rollers, but they take forever to heat up. Normally when I get out of the shower, I plug them in, dry my hair, and then they might be ready. Maybe.</li>
    <li> Great curlers.  Heat up fast and stay in place.</li>
    <li> Love these hot rollers. For some reason, the plastic rollers hold my curls, unlike the velvety rollers. I let the hairsetter heat up for approx. 20 min (while I am in the shower). I have to admit, I have hard to curl hair, especially when it comes to hot rollers. If I don&#x27;t prepare my hair, my curls won&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few tips: while my hair is still wet, use a volumizing mousse and a &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; heat-protectant spray (adds hold to your hair/won&#x27;t weigh it down). I also learned a little trick - add salt to your hair; for some reason, it helps hold the curl. Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray does the trick, and smells great! It sounds dumb, but it works, and won&#x27;t make your dry/matte! Anyways, I let my rollers set for 20 min., then spray my hair w/a flexible hairspray after the rollers are out. Sounds like a lot, but it&#x27;s fast and my curls last until I go to bed. :)</li>
    <li> great product for price</li>
    <li> Needed some hot rollers and these have been great.  The clips don&#x27;t hold as well as I would like.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that there are so many sizes to choose from.  The only thing I wish is that there were more but this is great.  It heats fast, they curl hair great and they are easy to roll and stay in with the clips.  Overall great quality.</li>
    <li> I saved $30 &amp; free shipping.  The rollers are a little smaller than my last set, but seem to heat up quickly.</li>
    <li> There are only 6 mid-sized rollers and I would prefer to have more.  There are too many small and large sized rollers which I rarely use.  But the unit works great is compact enough to sit on the counter.  It is hard to find a unit which is comprised largely of medium rollers unless you buy the travel size.  So, my review is based on selection of rollers and not the quality.</li>
    <li> It did not do the job that my 30 year old set did before it gave up the ghost.</li>
    <li> Nice compact set.  I have to get used to the timing and not get it too hot.  It kind of got too hot the first try.  One issue is that the heat indicator roller did not turn red so I heated it too long.  The amount of curl was good but the curl didn&#x27;t last long.  I don&#x27;t give up easily so I will give it a few more tries.</li>
    <li> These work very well. However, I wish they heated more quickly (10 min,) I wish the set had an on/off switch, rather than requiring plug-in / unplug or a power strip, and I wish there were 3 storage sections for the three sizes of clips, rather than 2 sections.</li>
    <li> Returning them.  Curl gone in 1/2 hr. Going to give the flocked type a try.</li>
    <li> Better than flocked rollers- love them.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I use curlers daily. these give my hair the lift I need. My hair is very thick and baby fine, some curlers just leave my hair limp and so flat. These are different.</li>
    <li> Do NOT be in a hurry, this is the slowest heating Conair product I have used.</li>
    <li> Received as described.  Good quality and function.</li>
    <li> I liked these so much that I ordered a back up for when the first one konks.  It only unplugs since it does not have an on/off switch so I have to watch out for that.  I like the lid since other sets I have owned have lids that come off easily.  This one stays put.  The heat is just right, not too hot but hot enough.</li>
    <li> i have used my rollers a few times.very happy with the results</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get the hang of using these. Once I found the right combination of product to use for my hair and the correct time to let the curlers set, these have worked very well. (At first, I was way off with product and time and the curls only lasted about an hour.) I do wish there were larger sizes. The small curlers in this set will give you small spiral curls, which is not what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought another hot roller set from walmart and had to return because they did not get hot. This HS34R is much better and does a good job. Nice and compact too.</li>
    <li> The set is a nice size and of good quality, but my hair is just too curly for these rollers.  I would need to straighten it first and then curl it, which takes more time than I have in the mornings.  I will use these for special occasions only.  I&#x27;m sure they would work fine on someone with less curly hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine from Amazon...but I hate to see people waste their money. I have curly hair that I sometimes want to smooth out &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for 45 years with no problem. These are ridiculous. Mine took a long time to heat, I burned my fingers trying to get the clips to hold the rollers (I&#x27;ve had these kind of clips before) to no avail, the clips are close in color so you need to be careful to use the correct size...I fooled around with these for an hour that I&#x27;ll never get back. The curlers kept slipping down and my hair looked insane.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our tween daughter, and have been satisfied.  It works exactly as advertised, and she has had no trouble with it.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well. I use my old pins.</li>
    <li> Took forever to heat up.</li>
    <li> Does not heat all rollers.  Takes about an hour to heat up</li>
    <li> I love that there are several sizes to choose from to really work with hairstyles.  They stay in really well and heat up well.  They heat up pretty fast.  This was my first set of hot rollers, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to, but I love using them/they&#x27;re easy.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers! Heat up quickly and curls are pretty and hold very well. Good price for everything that came with it and how well they work.</li>
    <li> Companies just do not make things like they used to. I had a set of rollers that were so hot you almost burned your fingertips! These just don&#x27;t come close to getting as hot. I usually go for the cheapest or mediocre items and they work the best but I was not satisfied this time. I am Mexican and Puerto Rican with Medium course 3b/3c hair. I have never had a problem with any of the sets I have had when it came to the heat. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  They do not get hot enough.  When I received the product, it didn&#x27;t come with enough of the right sized clips for the larger rollers.</li>
    <li> like that it had mostly smaller rollers, works well and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room just and a good price.</li>
    <li> heats up fast and clips are good quality</li>
    <li> It travels well, fits in small suitcase and I was very happy with it while traveling. Someone had asked if you can get extra rollers and the answer is yea - contact Conair Corporation in East Windsor, NJ or in Glendale, Az.  There is a charge, but this should answer your question - sorry it took awhile to answer.</li>
    <li> Just like the set I owned back in the 70&#x60;s. I wonder if these will last 30 years also?  I kinda doubt it. These seem to work fairly well.  I have to realize. My hair texture has changed since I was 17 &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold the curl as easily</li>
    <li> The rollers got crazy hot. I can&#x27;t use these. The only good news is that they apparently responded to all the complaints about the rollers not getting hot enough. I couldn&#x27;t hold a curler long enough to get it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Might be okay if you have very thin or short hair. Good starter set for litle girl or older lady--curlers do not get hot enough to burn, but this means they didn&#x27;t get hot enough to set my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I would try it after returning a Remington set which got really hot, but also little curl-- have had really good results with Conair before. Had them for about a month.Tried several different ways just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t doing something wrong, even tried leaving them in for an hour-- very sad curls. Okay if you just want to add a little lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My case also broke right away, just cracked out of nowhere. So I am returning the set. Retrospectively, I would buy one of the $40 sets by Conair instead, just didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money if this set had worked.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the Remington All That Travel pagent curlers--so will look for a larger set similar to them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these rollers!They get hot fast and leave my hair with lots of body and volume.</li>
    <li> Love it ,love it ,love it,love it,love it</li>
    <li> My daughter is in show choir and needed a set of curlers that could travel with her to competitions.  This set heats up nicely and is easy to pack.</li>
    <li> The curlers preformed just fine, but be aware that the assortment of rollers is not suited for medium to short hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is quite long and incredibly difficult to curl - when I use a curling iron, they fall out of my hair before I have even finished my whole head. Adding hairspray just speeds up the drooping process by adding extra weight. It would be comical if it weren&#x27;t so frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these on a whim because they were cheap, and I wanted to see if hot rollers might work better than an iron. I was honestly, genuinely shocked at how well they worked. My hair came out in nice, tight curls that I loosened up into something less cork-screw-y without destroying it. And then they stayed that way! For hours!! Even the next day when I woke up, my hair had more curl in it than I usually have 20 minutes after using a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all hair products, I&#x27;m sure these don&#x27;t work the same on everyone, but for people who struggle with getting curls from curling irons I would highly recommend giving them a try. Perhaps it is just using hot rollers over an iron, but for the price, I&#x27;m glad I tried these first.</li>
    <li> The price was right. The compact size is great. The rollers heat up quickly, and the clips are easy to use. The only challenge I have is the ends get hot enough to be uncomfortable to handle. Everything else is great.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure if i wanted these but im glad i did. They are really good, they get hot really quick and they do what they say they do.Well worth the money,which wasnt alot either.I would definatley buy these again or for a gift for someone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s compact. But it will not get hot enough to curl your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for YEARS for a new hairsetter.  I have short hair and they all come with medium or large rollers....I need 10 small rollers to do my hair.  I bought this set because the price was great and would be no major loss if I didn&#x27;t like it.  Surprize...I love it.  I ordered 3 more rollers....all rollers fit on all the posts....There is an order form in the box.  I use this every morning, and I get curls that last all day...Only have 1 complaint....the pins are short and sometimes go flying, however I find I can use the longer pins from my old set.  I think I just have to learn how to put them in better.  I&#x27;m so glad I found these!!!</li>
    <li> Gave these a chance and regret it. They work somewhat at least... But they are just plastic, and they do kind of suck. :((</li>
    <li> The price was great and the product it terrific.  My hair kept the curl all day long!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and was a GREAT BUY!!</li>
    <li> This is working very well.  Heating to just the right temp for my hair which is hard to hold curls.</li>
    <li> all of the rollers were very small, even the largest size. I would like to return this item. It is not going to work for me.</li>
    <li> Hunting for these for ages.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these so much she convinced her sister to get a set!!</li>
    <li> The curlers heat up well but the way it&#x27;s designed leaves room for improvement.  The base heats up along with the rods where the plastic curlers sit.  So if anything plastic drops into it while you&#x27;re getting ready, it will melt.  You need to remember to close the cover.  Hair gets stuck in it all the time and you&#x27;ll need to wait for it to cool to get it all out.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd set because I have a lot of hair. These are nice and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Good design &amp; a good product</li>
    <li> I love these curlers.  They work perfectly and leave my hair with the big curls that I have always wanted.</li>
    <li> I am so NOT a hairdresser! Once I learned how to use the little metal clips I was able to curl my longer (winter scraggily) hair&lt;br /&gt;into a sort of &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; early in the morning. The curlers are fast and so much better for my neck than overnight twisty foam curlers.&lt;br /&gt;but I wish I had more large sizes - I do no use the smalls at all. I am satisfied with the product otherwise.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Old fashioned curls...</li>
    <li> I bought this set because the reviews were good. It&#x27;s a cute set, I like the roller sizes and the pins. However, the rollers are plastic. and they don&#x27;t hold heat well. The base barely gets hot, and as a result the rollers don&#x27;t get too hot either. Did little for my hair. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. It heats up quickly and does the job. My hair is layered and a little longer than shoulder length and it is great. So great, I purchased two in case.</li>
    <li> This was so easy to use.  Let the rollers heat us and then put the rollers in your hair.  I usually leave the rollers in for about 5-10 minutes and it gives my hair the curl I need.  Have used the velcro rollers before but they broke your hair  and this does not.</li>
    <li> After months of trying multiple different sets of rollers I went ahead and ordered these. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect given the price wasn&#x27;t very high.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers work very well! They get nice and hot but are still easy to touch. The clips stay on and aren&#x27;t the silly clips that clip over the roller but rather slide over the roller.&lt;br /&gt;They work quickly. Very happy with product. My only issue is the shape of the container. It isn&#x27;t square so it is an awkward fit into my cabinet.</li>
    <li> More than 50% of the curlers have melted into the rack. They are a serious fire hazard and should be pulled IMMEDIETLY!!!!</li>
    <li> I only had it on for a few minutes and the rollers MELTED ON THE POSTS!  Evidently, there is no thermostatic control.  Also, there is no core element within the rollers to retain the heat.  The rollers are just pieces of plastic set onto hot metal posts.  Sure, there is a \\&quot;ready\\&quot; light but it only indicates that the unit is \\&quot;on\\&quot;.  The hairsetter never turns OFF!</li>
    <li> These rollers take over 5 minutes to heat up which I found very disappointing. I do like how compact the case is. The rollers are nicely made and do not get tangled and pull hair like others I have had.</li>
    <li> Rollers small, clips are crappy, order plastic clips.</li>
    <li> This hot roller set did not heat.  I tried leaving it plugged in as long as 45 minutes and I could wrap my hand around the rollers, they were just warm.  I was able to return it with no problems so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> The curlers work quickly and well.  The pins are a little annoying, but other than that, easy to use. Great.</li>
    <li> These electric rollers work really well. Take hardly any time to heat up and are nice and compact.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the old type hair rollers with the grippy barrel but can not find them.  These are ok but still may return them, because they do not stay in my hair.</li>
    <li> gets the job done and the size is right</li>
    <li> I ordered this Conair hot roller set in March of this year because it contained a total of 20 rollers with 3 different sizes.  Conair has always been a name I trusted in the past.  Approximately the 4th time of using this hot roller set, I plugged it in and in about 10 minutes later found that 8 out of the 20 rollers had melted down on the heating rods.  The rollers melted to the base whereby they were stuck and could not be removed.  I like the style and multiple sizes of the rollers and the clips; however, I do not trust the overheating.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a warranty, but I will be contacting Conair regarding this potentially hazardous product.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair really short and don&#x27;t use it, but it worked well with longer hair</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot enough. I tried them one time and before donating them.</li>
    <li> I am very much a novice with hair products such as this, but it was very user-friendly so it worked out great for me.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like the set.  The only thing is that they take a long time to fully heat up.  Also, clips (sold separately) are a lot easier to use than the metal fasteners, but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not used to them yet.</li>
    <li> This set is fabulous.  I have fairly long (past my shoulders) curly hair that I have to blow dry but that just leaves  looking like nothing.  This set is perfect for giving long hair  those great waves that make your hair look styled.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and she liked it!</li>
    <li> These are great! I like the bigger ones better though, so I wish there were a few more of them. They heat up quickly though, and do a good job!</li>
    <li> Great set for the money.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Heats up quick, has pins instead of clips.</li>
    <li> I looooovvveeeee this set! Gets very hot and the clips are great. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I love them - in fact I bought two more for gifts</li>
    <li> Have not used this Hairsetter yet but I think I am going to love it.  Just the right amount &amp; size of the rollers.</li>
    <li> I already owned this hairsetter, and just love it. They stay hot and the longer you leave them in your hair the tighter the set. I originally bought this at WalMart for $19.99 and liked it so much that I tried to find another set in the stores without much luck. I like to keep an extra set on hand in the event the set breaks down or for guests to use in the spare bathroom. Amazon had such a good price I bought two. I have thin hair, but a lot of it and usually, with other hairsetters, I&#x27;ve had to use hairspray on each section of hair before rolling just so I have somewhat of a curl, but I haven&#x27;t had to do that at all with this set. I set my hair and leave them in while applying my makeup and by then the curl is great. The clips hold the rollers much tighter to your head than my old Vidal Sassoon set, I was constantly re-tightening those clips before attaching them to the roller, just so they held tight to my head. The Conair clips hold tight every time, with no flopping of the rollers. I would highly recommend this hairsetter.</li>
    <li> These are just OK. There aren&#x27;t enough for my hair. I can only do about 1/2 my head and my hair is a few inches past my shoulders. Curls don&#x27;t hold well. I usually use these and them spend like 30 min with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to put body and curl into my shoulder length air. I was very disappointed that these curlers did not do the trick. After reading all the reviews on a number of different products I felt certain this would to the trick. The result, STRAIGHT HAIR! I used them 3 times and even left them heat for 20 minutes and they never even got warm. I got better results from my curling iron and small set of 5 hot rollers that I have been using. This item was returned. My advice, do not waste your time this set.</li>
    <li> I returned this item, the curlers were all too small, and I wanted more volume, not tight curls. It is also small, I have medium length hair and these didn&#x27;t fit my whole head.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and is very small so it fits in the bathroom perfect! I would definitely buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow that arrrived in great time...within a few days of placing the order.  Works as described.  I am very pleased</li>
    <li> You have to let them warm up for awhile with the lid closed. Makes my hair look great without burning with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> My second set of the same.  Love it.  I had the old one for almost 10 years</li>
    <li> For the most part these work great. I would be nice if the rollers were bigger. Pins tend to not hold as well as I would like them. Still better alternative to curling iron.</li>
    <li> I grew up using my mother&#x27;s 1960s-era Conair steam curlers. They worked amazingly well 30 years later.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that these curlers will have the same longevity. At first, I was a little concerned that the curlers are entirely plastic (unlike the variety I&#x27;d used before that had a metal lined core). However, the curlers really hold the heat! My hair resists curl, yet I have guaranteed curls that will last all day (with just flexible hairspray) after less than 5 minutes in the curlers!&lt;br /&gt;They can be a little warm on your fingertips when rolling, but no more than I expected. My favorite feature is the same as my mom&#x27;s old set---the clips really hold the curler tight to your head, no risk of it falling off, yet easy to slide on and off.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase these based on the large number of negative reviews. The positive reviews convinced me to try them and I am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;I actually got these as a Warehouse deal, so I only paid $12.32 in all, with prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other types of hot rollers (hot sticks and steam rollers) in the past and these are the best I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers heat quickly and hold their heat very well. I found the curls lasted all day and the next day I still had lots of body and waves in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers do get hot on the ends, so be careful when using them. The pins hold securely and were much better than clips.&lt;br /&gt;I heated them for about 30 minutes before use and left them in for about 30 minutes. My hair is not very thick, has slight curl and wave and is shoulder length. I only used the medium and large rollers. I thought the small would make curls that were much too tight. The box contained an order form for additional rollers and I might buy more medium and large size rollers. The price was pretty reasonable. Extra pins are available, too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers since I was a teenager. I didn&#x27;t want anything fancy, I just wanted what worked and worked well....this did the trick and actually exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Rollers heat up very fast and work well.  Don&#x27;t even have to leave them in for very long.  Only draw back is someone with long or very thick hair may need additional rollers in a set.</li>
    <li> I have really straight hair thin shoulder length hair, and I usually need every roller.  I put the curlers in my hair the way the instructions tell you to, but the outcome did not look very good. So I have tried many different ways to get the curls to look right, but so far I&#x27;ve had no luck. It&#x27;s going to take a lot of patience with this product. The hot curlers do work, but they do not make really nice tight curls with my hair.</li>
    <li> Did not give good curls.&lt;br /&gt;Only heated to &amp;#34;Warm&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Clips do not secure enough on rollers, would not recommend to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and even with mousse and/or hair spray these don&#x27;t work for me. I get the tinniest bit of curl but it falls flat within 20 minutes of use. I also tried the Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact, Large and Medium Roller. It worked a little better but still didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
