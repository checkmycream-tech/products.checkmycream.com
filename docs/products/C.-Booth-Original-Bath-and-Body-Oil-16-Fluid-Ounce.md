      <li>Not greasy feeling and fragrance free</li>
      <li>It feels light and not greasy after rubbed in.  </li>

      <li>The oil&#x27;s consistency is very nice and it provides enough moisture for the entire day!</li>
      <li>Mineral oil only moisturizes the top layer of skin; the oils in this penetrate to moisturize the deeper layers.  </li>
      <li>That being said, if you can get beyond the odor, this product is pretty quality.</li>
      <li>It is cheaper than Alpha Keri or similar products and, in my opinion, leaves a more acceptable amount of oil on my skin.</li>

      <li>Very gender-neutral scent.</li>
      <li>This stuff is very moisturizing and absorbs well, however, it has a very cloying scent.</li>
      <li>However this is way overpriced and can be doing at some drugstores for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Very emollient.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I use this after getting out of the shower, and it moisturizes better than any body cream, lotion or other body oils.  </li>

      <li>Keeps my skin soft and moisturized through out the day.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft all day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read about this product in a Yahoo article about beauty products.  I really didn&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love this so much better than just oil. Great smell!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very moisturizing and absorbs well, however, it has a very cloying scent. I read other reviews calling it almondy and soft, but I would say it compares to White Shoulders by Elizabeth Arden. The smell is so strong that I have a hard time using it because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a little old church lady. That being said, if you can get beyond the odor, this product is pretty quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil after I shower (while still wet) for about 2 years now and my skin almost never needs extra lotion. I will use lotion on my hands (I wash them a lot) and my elbows in the winter. This oil is light, doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy, no lingering smell, and faster to use than lotion every day. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was not fond of the scent.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, just not my taste.  If it did an excellent job i would live with it, but I will try something else.</li>
    <li> This body oil is so smooth and silky!  It leaves my skin feeling soft all day.  I especially like putting it on after a shower while my body&#x27;s still wet (before drying off with a towel.)  It also feels great on my feet.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day and have no intention of stopping.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a good product but the company is great too! Excellent customer service, they even notified me when my package was out for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I am instantly in love with it. I hate moisturizing in the morning with lotion because it&#x27;s just awkward to put on skinny jeans with greasy legs. This shower oil is thick enough to actually stay on your skin through the shower (Unlike Aveeno, Eucerin, Neutragena, and Nivea! Oh, I&#x27;ve tried them all). But is still easy wiped off with a towel when you sadly must end your shower time.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but I won&#x27;t dock it stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;It gets rid of the &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; leg thing and it softens my leg hair so my boyfriend&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t graded off by my relaxed approached to regular leg shaving.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I have used (at this price point) so happy Amazon sells it even lower!!! Great feel especially if you have dry skin and the smell is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you have oily skin I would not use this as it is thicker in consistency, but not nasty thick, like goop</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have used it right after a shower and in the bath and it makes my skin feel soft and I love the light scent.</li>
    <li> The scent is soothing, seductive, but not at all overwhelming. Can definitely be used with scented lotion or perfume. Feels amazing. I use it after a shower before I towel off and my skin stays soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil. Very emollient. Good for eczema and dry patches. Look forward to using it in the bath too!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff. The smell is strong, but it does not bother me for some reason. I usually get headaches from strong smells, but this does not bother me at all! I use it in the shower, after the shower, just as a lotion...etc. I also mix with coconut oil, coffee, and brown sugar and make an in shower scrub that is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product....i hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this all over and couldn&#x27;t find it. I thought they had stopped making it. This is a great price for a wonderful product. I don&#x27;t like lotions....I love body oils after a shower...they soak into your skin and make you feel so luxurious...this one doesn&#x27;t fail you either like some can. I never use baby oil and nothing with mineral oil in it...that will just sap the moisture right out. This has no mineral oil and keeps you hydrated all day...and your skin looks amazing..just put it on right after your shower, while your skin is still wet. And then towel off...you won&#x27;t be slippery or greasy...just wonderful, beautiful skin...oh and you smell a little like chocolate. I love it....it is very lightly scented...a little scent of vanilla and a little a cocoa butter, makes for a lovely natural smell...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Gives me super soft skin all day long and smells divine!</li>
    <li> Ii didn&#x27;t notice anything outstanding either way.&lt;br /&gt;I could probably find something cheaper and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;At least I tried.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Light enough to rub on and towel off, heavy enough to use for shaving.  I like the scent, but I could see that others may not.</li>
    <li> This bath oil is great. I use it once a week in the shower to prevent winter dryness, and I love it. A small amount on problem areas makes all the difference. It doesn&#x27;t drip and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to slip and die after using it. Also, it smells WONDERFUL. Very gender-neutral scent. Nobody would be upset about the way this product smells.</li>
    <li> This is the best body oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  Put it one while your wet for best results.  The price is best when you buy 4 or more at a time.</li>
    <li> Best after shower oil on the market... Not greasy feeling and fragrance free so it does not clash with any other lotions or perfumes.</li>
    <li> Favorite body oil hands down. We&#x27;ve been purchasing this for over 2 years now. First saw it at my local Rickys and they stopped selling it so we&#x27;ve been buying it online. The smell is great and it gets the job done. We also use it for lubricant... we&#x27;re a married couple so we don&#x27;t use condoms so oil is not a problem. Does not irritate. Haha sorry if that&#x27;s TMI. But just saying! Might be useful to someone.</li>
    <li> ,Best body oil EVER. I have just about tried them all and always come back to this one...and always will! The smell,  texture, and overall moisture and feel it gives your skin is unbeatable. I am absolutely addicted!</li>
    <li> I love love love hot baths in the winter. Obviously,  this dries out the skin. My doctor recommended slathering on large amounts of moisturizing cream immediately after a bath. Not only does that get expensive, but it&#x27;s a real pain. This Booth bath oil is an excellent substitute. I use about two capfuls in every bath. I t leaves my skin with a very light coating of moisturizing oil...and gets into every little nook and cranny. The fragrance is light and fresh, as well. There will still be some people that just don&#x27;t like the feeling of oil left on their skin. This product leaves a very light film...nothing that would noticeably come off on clothing. This is so much better than using an after bath or shower oil. It does leave a little bit of oil on the surface if the bath tub...so use caution. The best thing about this product is the price. It is cheaper than Alpha Keri or similar products and, in my opinion, leaves a more acceptable amount of oil on my skin. Great value.</li>
    <li> This is the best body oil ever smells great too, I add it to other lotions, my husbands dry feet look great, he is diabetic his doctor is pleased</li>
    <li> I was seeking an body oil similar to Neutrogena sesame oil but this isn&#x27;t it- doesn&#x27;t really smell good just plain like vanilla or some sugary smell. and its thick - not for me</li>
    <li> Love it, will continue to buy and use it and it is like nothing I have ever tried before...</li>
    <li> She loves it and pleasant smell</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Use it everyday. However this is way overpriced and can be doing at some drugstores for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Pleasant light scent, moisturizers well, and gives my legs a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> My shower routine includes this oil immediately after and I can&#x27;t rave enough of how it has changed my skin. Love love love.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well and is made of all natural ingredients, no mineral oil like other body oils.  Mineral oil only moisturizes the top layer of skin; the oils in this penetrate to moisturize the deeper layers.  It feels light and not greasy after rubbed in.  For moderately dry skin, not severely dry skin (for which I would recommend shea butter oil).</li>
    <li> My main reason for purchasing this product was to replace the Neutrogena Sesame Oil with a product not tested on animals.This product is thicker than the sesame oil but I love the product &amp; it has a wonderful scent. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for great price. I use this when I get out of the shower while I am still wet. Keeps my skin soft and moisturized through out the day. I feel very good about the fact that the ingredients are natural and chemical free.Arrived on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Helps with skin roughnesss and better than some other leading brands of baby oil. Good product and would recommend to parents for their kids.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m converted.  This oil is extremely light and has a very pleasant scent.  I don&#x27;t put it in my bath as some have mentioned in previous reviews, I apply it lightly after bathing and find it much more effective in maintaining my skins moisture than any other lotions I have tried.  Love it.  Worth every penny and as long as the formula doesn&#x27;t change, it will be the only one I use!</li>
    <li> I really care about paraben, sulfate, phthalates and some, and I thought this body oil is only natural and ordered it, but I searched online and found a webpage saying it has paraben. But when I received this, the label said it&#x27;s free from paraben, and sulfate and mineral oil. I don&#x27;t know which is correct. Anyway, it still has some artificial colors.</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil smells.  I use it directly after exposing my skin to water.  It goes on smooth and silky. I understand it can be used on dry skin as well.</li>
    <li> This is best body oil I&#x27;ve found. It feels thicker, richer, less watery, and much more moisturizing than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this body oil,but I found it less expensive at marshalls.</li>
    <li> My favorite body oil!  I use this after getting out of the shower, and it moisturizes better than any body cream, lotion or other body oils.  The fragrance is soft, light, clean and pleasant--won&#x27;t clash with perfumes. I will not let my household be without this body oil :-0</li>
    <li> Works in the most amazing way for baby eczema (atopic dermatitis).</li>
    <li> Seriously, I use this oil ALL THE TIME! I use it for shaving, to moisturize after the shower, even as a perfume. I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
    <li> The absolute best bath oil ever; however, it does not smell feminine at all (hence four stars). The oil&#x27;s consistency is very nice and it provides enough moisture for the entire day!</li>
    <li> USE THIS ALL THE TIME, MOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Super great bath oil by Booth after you use the Rosemary Shower and Bath Gel, which I HIGHLY recommend as a combo.  GREAT SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also buy at least one of the Booth original bath and shower gel.  You will be set!  Wonderful natural products, my son and I stocked up and we are loving our soft smooth skin, hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!</li>
