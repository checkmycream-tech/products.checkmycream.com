      <li>This product is okay now that I know how to make my own foundation as a waterbase on YouTube</li>
      <li>This explains why I felt like I had to use more of it in the airbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I was expecting better.</li>
      <li>and I love them I do recommend</li>
      <li>Love this brand.</li>
      <li>I love how lightweight the formula is, and the coverage is pretty good, but I just feel that the quality is lacking.</li>
      <li>Very light and smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants a quick perfectly applies makeup.</li>

<li> I am a professional makeup artist and I purchased glamair for a recent wedding I did.</li>
<li> I finally poured it out to get rid of the ball, I felt like there was less pigment and more water in the Glam Air than some other brands, so it is not necessarily a better deal.  </li>
<li> The colors are grey and muddy and did not match one person out of 11 girls.</li>
<li> Nearly every time I try to squeeze a few drops and nothing comes out.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
<li> this is on the expensive side specially for 2 ounce bottle</li>
<li> There is a little ball in the bottle to help mix the color, the only problem is when you turn the bottle up to deliver the drops there are times when the ball blocks the drops from coming out.  </li>
<li> This set gives you the opportunity to experience a wide variety of shades.  </li>
<li> There is absolutely no use for this airbrush foundation at all.</li>
<li> I read complaints about the little metal ball (that serves as an agitator to mix up the pigment/water when you shake the bottle) blocking the tip and preventing the makeup from coming out...  </li>
<li> I wish they had lighter shades, this includes olive tones, which is a waste.</li>
<li> I bought these for my Luminess airbrush machine and apparently I got the wrong foundation color</li>
<li> trying to get used to airbrushing, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my technique or the product.</li>
<li> My skin takes on a weird texture after application, and some of the shades are a little too pink.</li>
<li> It covers well, however it is really thick and sticky.</li>
<li> Yes, it is really it infuriating and frustrating, and makes me want to throw the bottles in the trash.  </li>
<li> Not a good product at all.... very disappointed with it!</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t hate the product, but I am not buying it again.</li>

    <li> This set gives you the opportunity to experience a wide variety of shades.  The product provides great coverage.  The price may seem a little expensive at first until you realize that it only takes a couple of drops to provide a great look.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I purchased glamair for a recent wedding I did. The colors are grey and muddy and did not match one person out of 11 girls. They are also beyond watery. There is absolutely no use for this airbrush foundation at all. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Luminess airbrush machine and apparently I got the wrong foundation color I did email the sender and they were nice enough to correspond and tell me that it was on its way thank you so much they were kind and courteous they re send the new ones and they were the right colors and I love them I do recommend</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t find a color to match so i had to make my own which is ok but tends to waste more makeup..</li>
    <li> Looks great on skin. The 3 and 4 match almost everyone. They have lasted me forever!</li>
    <li> I bought this as an intro to airbrush. I love how lightweight the formula is, and the coverage is pretty good, but I just feel that the quality is lacking. My skin takes on a weird texture after application, and some of the shades are a little too pink. For someone with redness issues, this is a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to get used to airbrushing, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my technique or the product.</li>
    <li> I wish they had lighter shades, this includes olive tones, which is a waste.</li>
    <li> Not a good product at all.... very disappointed with it!</li>
    <li> It works, I guess. It covers well, however it is really thick and sticky. It makes my face look oily the instant I put it on and it also feels and looks like it is &amp;#34;caked on&amp;#34;. I am use to using Belletto which is amazing but expensive. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
