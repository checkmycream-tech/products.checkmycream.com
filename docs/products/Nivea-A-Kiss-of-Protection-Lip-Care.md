      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>and I was looking for a healthy, effective lip balm for the winter that contained an effective SPF for outdoors sports.</li>
      <li>He thought it looked like lipstick and wouldn&#x27;t wear it any more.</li>
      <li>Love this product, cannot survive in the sun without it.</li>
      <li>It may be a very good quality, but it makes your lips shiny WHITE.</li>

      <li>and it actually looks great.</li>
      <li>Once I used up the tube, I started searching for the product and fortunately found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The formulation has several skin beneficial ingredients along with a true broad-spectrum SPF and moisturizes beautifully.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;A Kiss of Protection\\&quot; is the best, inexpensive lip balm I have found with a high enough SPF to truly offer sun</li>
      <li>I originally received a &#x27;sample&#x27; of this lip protection at a marathon event.  </li>
      <li>Good to keep some spf on those lips, Know someone who go cancer on there lips, and some extra UV protection never hurts.</li>
      <li>This is easily resolved-- just don&#x27;t use too much product!</li>
      <li>It is excellent in terms of keeping my lips from becoming dry while also slightly lightening their color tone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the previous version of Nivea SPF 30 for quite a while &amp; loved how it felt as well as the protection it provided.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is moisturizing very much.  </li>
      <li>Nivea brand is not one I personally sell, which is why I gave away samples of it because it was better than the product I do sell -- for lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I truly enjoy the smooth application (it leaves your lips protected but not moist and shiny) and lasts a LONG time.  </li>
      <li>This cannot be worn in public because it turns yours lips bright white.  </li>
      <li>It really works and stays on longer than most similar products.</li>
      <li>I have large lips that crack</li>
      <li>They are creamy and smooth but I think because of the high SPF factor they leave your lips white.  </li>
      <li>The sun is so much stronger there than in New England.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this new formulation at all and won&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It truly does have broad spectrum protection and functions exactly as intended.  </li>
      <li>With a normal use, there is no residue at all.</li>
      <li>and they feel almost normal.</li>
      <li>It leaves a pale white shade on your lips, making you look like you&#x27;ve been hospitalized with for many months!</li>
      <li>-- it can leave your lips looking a bit chalky, however, that is one downside that I can definitely live with vs. having chapped/cracked lips.</li>
      <li>Its fantastic and priced low enough that I can keep extras and not worry about losing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>smooth with a slight vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised to find it on Amazon as I have never seen it anyplace else.</li>
      <li>I really like this specific Nivea product, Kiss of Protection.</li>
      <li>I purchased several different types of Nivea lip balm because \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; website gave them a very positive review</li>
      <li>It does go on with an ever so slight bit of whiteness to it, but that wears off quickly</li>
      <li>It is smooth, has a very faint fragrance/taste, and stays effective for a very long time.</li>
      <li>Most chap sticks go on clear, but this one leaves a thick white layer over your bare lips or lip stick.  </li>
      <li>The previous sticks I received didn&#x27;t have the little silver ring around the tube, and didn&#x27;t leave any white residue, which I really liked.</li>
      <li>I bought three six-packs with my first purchase to introduce friends who used other horrible tasting lip protectors to the best.  </li>
      <li>other reviewers have noted, if you really slather it on, it will leave a white residue on your lips.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating is that, as with other similarly formulated Avobenzone products, you can actually taste the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It left a very noticeable white residue on my lips as other reviewers already have mentioned.</li>

<li> If you prefer broad spectrum SPF in a formula that doesn&#x27;t taste like sunscreen, then I would go with the ALBA Botanicals version, which has an in-part physical sunscreen base.</li>
<li> After wearing this, I get a terrible taste in my mouth which lingers for a long time.  </li>
<li> I am very unhappy with this product.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this in the past and would have given it a 5-star rating, however, this batch looks white when it is applied.  It looks a bit odd, but serves it&#x27;s purpose.  The previous sticks I received didn&#x27;t have the little silver ring around the tube, and didn&#x27;t leave any white residue, which I really liked.</li>
    <li> I really like this specific Nivea product, Kiss of Protection. Not only does it have SPF 30 but it&#x27;s feel great on and makes my lips soft. When my lips are chapped, it only takes a day using this and they feel almost normal. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product, cannot survive in the sun without it. Not sure why the SPF is so hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> This cannot be worn in public because it turns yours lips bright white.  I am very unhappy with this product. I had a tube I purchased at Kaiser which had the same label and it went on clear with a little shine.  that&#x27;s what I expected from this order.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip protection I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought three six-packs with my first purchase to introduce friends who used other horrible tasting lip protectors to the best.  It lasts, and no one would ever guess you had an SPF product on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea brand is not one I personally sell, which is why I gave away samples of it because it was better than the product I do sell -- for lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t regret any kissable moment.</li>
    <li> It may be a very good quality, but it makes your lips shiny WHITE. I could use it when skiing or going for a run, but would not wear it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip balm for my boyfriend over in Afghanistan and he loves it.  He is not a lip balm user and he loves the stuff.  He carries it around with him at all times.  I have large lips that crack and this stuff works great at preventing it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great lip balm this is it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the previous version of Nivea SPF 30 for quite a while &amp; loved how it felt as well as the protection it provided. However, the product has been reformulated and it turns my lips white when applied and dries them to the point of burning and cracking. I see no mention of zinc oxide in the ingredient list, but that is how it makes my lips look. I really don&#x27;t like this new formulation at all and won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I originally received a &#x27;sample&#x27; of this lip protection at a marathon event.  Once I used up the tube, I started searching for the product and fortunately found it on Amazon.  This is very similar to a Clarin&#x27;s SPF lip product that I used to use several years ago, but at a fraction of the price.  I truly enjoy the smooth application (it leaves your lips protected but not moist and shiny) and lasts a LONG time.  The only downside -- it can leave your lips looking a bit chalky, however, that is one downside that I can definitely live with vs. having chapped/cracked lips. The other upside is NO flavor.  If you are a fan of flavored lip protection, this may not be the product for you, however, this is a very effective 30 SPF lip protection for both men and women(my hubby uses it since it is not &#x27;greasy kid&#x27;s stuff&#x27;!)</li>
    <li> I purchased several different types of Nivea lip balm because \\&quot;the Cosmetics Cop\\&quot; website gave them a very positive review and I was looking for a healthy, effective lip balm for the winter that contained an effective SPF for outdoors sports. \\&quot;A Kiss of Protection\\&quot; is the best, inexpensive lip balm I have found with a high enough SPF to truly offer sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm the best SPF lip product I have tried. It is smooth, has a very faint fragrance/taste, and stays effective for a very long time. I&#x27;ve tried $28 lip balms (Dr. Weil Origins) that are no where as good as this one. Its fantastic and priced low enough that I can keep extras and not worry about losing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, if you really slather it on, it will leave a white residue on your lips. This is easily resolved-- just don&#x27;t use too much product! With a normal use, there is no residue at all.</li>
    <li> this lip balm stays put for hours.  I use it when I go for motorcycle rides, jogging and hunting, it keeps my lips moisturized and protected.  Stops them from cracking with the heat and dry air.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because of the spf but after he put it on his lips were white.  He thought it looked like lipstick and wouldn&#x27;t wear it any more.</li>
    <li> I bought a number of these to use over the summer months. My husband and I are very active outdoors (i.e., swimming, bicycling, kayaking, hiking, etc.), so we each carry one around with us at all times. Fits easily into your pocket (mine even shares space with my iPhone slot in my handbag), works beautifully and protects my lips from sunburn. I occasionally use it under my tinted lip balm for extra protection. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favourite lip balm of all times.  No camphor or mint to make your lips tingle.  smooth with a slight vanilla scent.  Sunscreen is an added bonus</li>
    <li> I was vacationing in Greece and my lips started to get so sunburned. The sun is so much stronger there than in New England. I want into a little grocery store and this was the only lip balm they carried. It was wonderful and just what I needed. I was so surprised to find it on Amazon as I have never seen it anyplace else.</li>
    <li> This product may work well but it will never get the chance to show me.  After wearing this, I get a terrible taste in my mouth which lingers for a long time.  I wish I had not bought a multi pack because I&#x27;ll now be giving them all away</li>
    <li> This is my preferred lip balm. It is excellent in terms of keeping my lips from becoming dry while also slightly lightening their color tone.</li>
    <li> Good to keep some spf on those lips, Know someone who go cancer on there lips, and some extra UV protection never hurts.</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase a lip moisturizer with SPF protection. Nivea is a great company and I&#x27;m sure the product works as advertised but there is no way I&#x27;m using this in public. It left a very noticeable white residue on my lips as other reviewers already have mentioned. I plan to send send back and look for an alternative.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is moisturizing very much.  Then there is the white film it leaves on your lips.  Protection... probably.  But do you want to walk around with white lips?  Up to you.</li>
    <li> This chap stick is super nourishing, but it sadly turns your lips white when you use it.  Most chap sticks go on clear, but this one leaves a thick white layer over your bare lips or lip stick.  I thought it might be good over darker lipstick that I&#x27;d like to lighten a bit, but it left a very obvious and uneven white film over the lipstick.. not attractive!</li>
    <li> This is the best brand of lip balm I have ever used, and this product has the added benefit of sun protection. It still feels like lip balm, not like sunscreen. It does go on with an ever so slight bit of whiteness to it, but that wears off quickly and it actually looks great. I wear it daily to the office. My daughter plays tennis and all her friends are constantly borrowing it, so I bought enough to go around.</li>
    <li> The formula of this SPF lip care product is excellent.  It truly does have broad spectrum protection and functions exactly as intended.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating is that, as with other similarly formulated Avobenzone products, you can actually taste the sunscreen.  That is a big detractor for me.  If you don&#x27;t mind that this tastes like a sunscreen, then this one is for you.  The formulation has several skin beneficial ingredients along with a true broad-spectrum SPF and moisturizes beautifully.  If you prefer broad spectrum SPF in a formula that doesn&#x27;t taste like sunscreen, then I would go with the ALBA Botanicals version, which has an in-part physical sunscreen base.</li>
    <li> It leaves a pale white shade on your lips, making you look like you&#x27;ve been hospitalized with for many months! I only used it at the beach a few times and couldn&#x27;t use the pictures in which i was wearing this product.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a Lip protector with SPF 30. It really works and stays on longer than most similar products.</li>
    <li> Use it every day  under lipstick and like how it feels on my lips. Good product, i recommend it .</li>
    <li> They are creamy and smooth but I think because of the high SPF factor they leave your lips white.  In defense of the maker, they do what is advertised but maybe they should tell you about the white lips when applied.</li>
