<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This turned out to be a very good purchase. Only one has broken so far and the rest work fine, are durable and do not damage the hair :-).</li>
    <li> I like these but i just wish they were a bit thicker. Not recommended if you have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and good value pack</li>
    <li> These will snap fairly easily. I had to double up every time I used them. I switched to thicker elastics.</li>
    <li> Skinnier than I thought they would be. :(</li>
    <li> These elastics pretty much exploded when I tried to use them to put my hair up in a ponytail.  They have no give.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These worked out great. Two years later and I still have several I haven&#x27;t used though granted, I don&#x27;t put my hair up everyday at all. I&#x27;m really happy I got the larger value pack and thrilled I picked the neutral colors. I wouldn&#x27;t call these cheap either as others have. Is there such as thing as an expensive high-quality elastic band? I mean, these aren&#x27;t meant to be decorative hair bands or anything. They are what I expected them to be and they do what I expected them to do, can&#x27;t really ask for more than that. They&#x27;ve lasted a long time. They haven&#x27;t snapped and the colors are so much better than what I&#x27;ve typically seen that make half of the bands unusable because I&#x27;m not running around with neon green, orange, or pink bands in my hair like I&#x27;m not a grown woman. A good buy for sure and a great value.</li>
    <li> If you have thicker natural hair like me maybe find some thicker ones because mine snap a lot. However, I just tie them together and keep it moving lol</li>
    <li> I have long hair and like to put it in a pony tail  so 30 of these will last me a while and a good price  bought through the add-on item</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be so thin but for the price, they are OK.  They work better when I wear my hair curly, but when it&#x27;s straightened, they slide, leaving me with a very loose ponytail and I have to put my hair back up over and over!  The thicker ones are definitely better for straight hair.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast but when I ordered them I thought the hair bands were thicker they are really thin and get stuck in your hair so if you have thick hair I would not recommend during these.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for my thick hair</li>
    <li> These look larger in the picture than they actually are, so they&#x27;re pretty thin bands.  I would have bought thicker ones had that been clearer; I kept them, but don&#x27;t use these.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars because even though I have thick hair these are a little large for me. Also I prefer the elastics that are a little thicker and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;Scunci makes the best hair elastics! But I stay away from Goody, they stretch out fast. Try Scunci.</li>
    <li> These are great hair ties. I use them every day. They never pull my hair. Minimal stretching. I have very thin hair and these hold perfectly.</li>
    <li> These elastics are a great size. They are not the big bulky ones, nor are they the tiny ones. They really are an in between size and can be used for both adults and children..</li>
    <li> This product was cheap to buy and cheap to make. They do not stretch, so using it on a ponytail (especially if you like to double it), isn&#x27;t going happen. You get what you pay for, so how much can I really complain about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On a more positive note, for those with fine hair, you could probably double it on a half-up/half-down hair day. And only on that day. I would not buy again - I am currently using them while I pack; they work well to bind thick VGA cables (no doubling), bind the cord for the iron (doubled), and keep utensils together (doubled).</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t hold up tight like Goody but I love the neutral colors. Also, they loosen way too soon. I feel like a piece is only good for a day&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> I needed another $1 for an add-on-item and these weren&#x27;t even worth the $2 I spent. They are extremely thin elastic, they do not last at all. I have some Elastics of the same brand I bought at Walmart and these don&#x27;t even come close to that. I hate them!</li>
    <li> I expected much better quality from this brand.  I am very surprised that they are much thinner than they appear and break very easily.  My daughter required 2 to hold her ponytail and it did not make it through one school day.  I wish I could return them.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, these came and were the little thin ones. I was expecting them to be thicker so I was a bit dissapointed.</li>
    <li> These are really weak. They snap easily. Very poor quality even for my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love these bands always have and I will continue to buy them and use them as long as I have long hair.</li>
    <li> same old same old that I&#x27;ve bought since I was a kid.  I&#x27;m all about securing the ponytail and/or French braid.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and she was delighted with them.  She&#x27;s a nurse who has to wear her long hair up at work, and she&#x27;s always looking for an elastic band, so this was a no-brainer as a gift.  I&#x27;m sure every one of them will be used.</li>
    <li> Got some long hair I needed tied back. These tied it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a fair amount of variation in the size. Some take 3 twists and some take 4 to be snug. Either way, the job gets done without snagging hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None have broken so far and I&#x27;ve had them about a month or so.</li>
    <li> I absolutely swear by these Hairbands! I cannot go back to any other, They are slim sleek and just perfect</li>
    <li> Whats there to say, they were a decen priced add on and I didn&#x27;t have to go shopping for more stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice stocking stuff, good quality.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price. Amazon has all goods and this one was something that I use to purchase local. Prime membership rocks</li>
    <li> These do what they&#x27;re suppose to, and with 30 of them even if a couple break (they haven&#x27;t) you still have plenty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 out of 10 break on me so far. Other than that, they are fine. I&#x27;ll go with thicker ones next time (I have thick hair).</li>
    <li> These work great for my toddler. They are easy on her curly hair, don&#x27;t pull or tug, and don&#x27;t get tangled.  My hair is much thicker and longer and these are a little too weak to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> These hair bands work well and don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair. They are also have good endurance as I&#x27;ve had them for a while and they&#x27;re still in good shape.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Thin but look like they can hold down my short hair!</li>
    <li> Decent. A little thin but served their purpose.</li>
    <li> Not good for my need. the bands keep breaking whenever i try to use it for my hair. I have natural hair</li>
    <li> Have had 4 break while putting in my hair. I don&#x27;t have exceptionally thick hair so I&#x27;m not over-stretching these hair bands. This is unacceptable. Well not buy again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get a good grip without them breaking but what is one to expect for an add on item.</li>
    <li> They were a bit thinner than I expected but other than that, they worked well and for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great colors, just wish they were more durable! Still will recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about these. I have super thick long hair and I cant use it at all. It isnt stretchy enough for me, nor those it keep my ponytail up.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what you want in a hair tie. They&#x27;re thin but really strong. I&#x27;ve been using one specific hair tie for nearly a month and it&#x27;s only slightly stretched out. There&#x27;s no sign of it becoming worn or about to snap. The best part is that I can leave my very fine, long, hair tied up all day and it won&#x27;t crease where it&#x27;s been gathered.</li>
    <li> I should have checked with my wife before ordering these. These thin ties would damage my daughter&#x27;s hair. I guess I can use them for wire ties.</li>
    <li> Easily broken. Will not buy it again, the first time I use it, it was broken and hurt my ear. T T If you want to use it, be very careful and gentle and never use it in a hurry.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and so far they work really good! The range of colors is great for different hair colors. So far none of them have broke on me like others tend to do with thick hair. I really have no complaints! The hair ties are simple and cute.</li>
    <li> I love these elastics. Mainly because there is no metal on them. The metal always gets trapped in my hair and i hate pulling my hair out over and elastic band great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I bought these, in part, because of the many good reviews (the other consideration being the price).  However, several of them snapped the very first time I used them.  A little sting to the hand is far less annoying than the idea that about half were only good for a couple uses and about 1/4 - 1/5 snapped the first time.  I won&#x27;t buy these again and would recommend that others purchase something else.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Break easy. If you have long hair they definitely will not work for a ponytail. Maybe the end of a braid or something. They would probably work good for a child.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when they arrived because they are skinny and I expected them to be thicker (even though the picture is accurate - silly me) I have used them for a simple pony tail to a smooshed up bun and when I take my hair down, there is no line of demarcation. The attachment (for the two ends of the elastic) is not metal, so when you pull one out of your hair the lazy way,&lt;br /&gt;it slides out easily without catching your hair in it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;roughly 8¢ per band&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a bad deal&lt;br /&gt;hasnt snapped yet and holds my hair pretty well .</li>
    <li> My thick hair really isn&#x27;t held up well by these hair ties. They stretch really easily but would probably work well for thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I put my hair up this morning, and haven&#x27;t needed to fix it for hours.  The Conair hair ties never stay in place this long.  So I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> stretched way too easily, and had too much give. great colors but not strong enough to keep hair in place</li>
    <li> I thought these were thicker from the picture, but they are still great. No metal, minimal crimping after wearing for a little while and nice neutral colors &#x3D; win! :)</li>
    <li> I got these as an add on product. They are much too think for my long but soft hair. They did not stay in my hair but I gave it to a niece whi has thinner shorter hair and she wears them. I did not pick the right product for my hair when I bought these.</li>
    <li> I use these just about every day. Others are always breaking...but not these. They also have a great stretch. I can easily put these on when I make a bun on my daughter and it holds all day long. Will order these again for sure.</li>
    <li> These are too big for my hair and they are lose.  I would not purchase them again.  You really have to have a lot of hair and super thick hair to use them.  Other than that, they are not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love these hair ties they don&#x27;t snag often and no nasty metal clips that pull your hair. I add these to my cart all the time for adds on when I need extra couple dollars spent for free shipping. These hair ties tend to last a long time before they get stretched out or break( I usually loose them first)</li>
    <li> Very thin don&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
    <li> These are good. They&#x27;re strong, soft, and come with nice earth tones that don&#x27;t distract. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a good set of reliable pony tail holders.</li>
    <li> This is a better deal that what you&#x27;ll find in the stores. I like the skinny elastic hair bands, and prefer this neutral colors. They are good quality, too. No stretching out or pulling apart at the seam yet.</li>
    <li> These are almost invisible when wrapped around my hair, if you wrap them too tight they may break and cause your hair to break as well (if it is not properly moisturized).</li>
    <li> I love these bands.  They are ideal for day-to-day usage.  For me single band last for 4-6 weeks.  I am happy with my purchase/</li>
    <li> I keep ordering them for my wife and she keeps leaving them all over the house... So they must be doings something right!!!</li>
    <li> I really like these. The range of colors is nice to match lots of outfits. No metal on them so that is nice too. Once in while they will break though.</li>
    <li> I must not have read the description because these are quite thin.  Not preferable for my thick full hair, as it just doesn&#x27;t hold tight enough.</li>
    <li> This one is pretty simple, I like the addon items, nice feature. These are what they say they are. No surprises</li>
    <li> they were a thin then expected.</li>
    <li> These are great hair ties. No pulls, snags, or tears on my hair. They&#x27;re thinner than I expected, but I didn&#x27;t read the medium part as thickness. I haven&#x27;t ripped one yet, which is the reason I needed to buy more. I&#x27;m very happy w these.</li>
    <li> These are alright. Cheap but they snap after a little while.</li>
    <li> These break very easily. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My 8-year-old keeps a couple of these on her wrist along with her rainbow loom bracelets so she&#x27;s always ready to put her hair up at a moment&#x27;s notice.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re hair bands - what can I say?  They arrived and they hold my hair back.  Nothing more to say</li>
    <li> These are thin but works out fine for our thin hair. We lose them before we wear them out so I can&#x27;t say how long they work for.</li>
    <li> it is better than other products that i have used in the past...i will keep on using it..love its lot</li>
    <li> The first one I took out of the package broke as I was pulling my hair through the elastic.... enough said.</li>
    <li> Kinda small but strong&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave much of a kink in your hair&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m happy with this product I would buy them again</li>
    <li> They are thinner than the ones that I usually buy from walmart, so if you have thick hair don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I thought that these would be more durable. I do have thick, long hair, so I probably should have ordered the heavy-duty ones. Vidal sassoon is usually a pretty good hair product brand..was a little disappointed, but the price was decent for the product.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this again. The bands unraveled after about ten uses in my hair.  The rubber band showed and then pulled my hair.</li>
    <li> These are a good size. They hold my semi-thick, long hair really well. I use them daily and have had a couple of them break, but not too bad considering the price and the amount I use them. I keep 1 on my wrist and it does tend to stretch out after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would buy again!</li>
    <li> As others have stated, these bands are very thin. And I have had 2 of them break while just putting them on my hand to apply to my hair! I would not purchase again for this reason. However, they really do not hurt/get to tight/crimp. In fact, I would not attempt to make them &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; as I am sure than they would break.</li>
    <li> CHEAP...  Very thin.  I bought them as cat toys because my cat likes it when I shoot them up in the air and he catches them.  He didn&#x27;t like these because they were to thin.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the thicker ones, not these tiny ones.</li>
    <li> Product last a long time and it works as described.</li>
    <li> Not a size medium, very very thin and break easy....won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what I said. I have REALLY thick hair and this didn&#x27;t do it bit. It only went on once and ended up falling out. Then I thru them all out! Buy at a local store to be sure.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are no metal, nice colors, and stretch easily without getting out of shape. The brown matches nicely with dark hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 3 of these snap within the first week of use. Even had one snap right in my hand as I was attempting to put it in my 5 year old niece&#x27;s very fine/thin hair! As someone who is always using hair ties this product is disappointing in terms of life spand. They do their job (when they&#x27;re not snapping in half), but I would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> My dad and I have fought against dry-rot for decades. Every time we&#x27;d get the old sectioned poles out, the rubber bands we had held them together with were dust. These are great for that exact purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter for back to school. They do the job.&lt;br /&gt;Cute colors to coordinate with clothing.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, wish they had the size one size smaller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say except these are what I ordered.  I normally just pick these up at the store but was feeling lazy. No complaints! :)</li>
    <li> My thick hair easily destroys the will and constitution of most elastic hairbands, leaving broken bands of cloth and rubber in its wake; hairbands that once were circular in shape, are left limp and disconnected, appearing like no more than mere loop-less strands.  Among the lives of normal hairbands, my hair causes sadness and fear; my hair is the monster that hairband moms and dads tell their children about if they don&#x27;t behave.  Legends are told through out the region, many don&#x27;t even speak my hair&#x27;s name; calling it &amp;#34;The Follicled One&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;The One Who Cannot be Tamed&amp;#34;.  But from the far reaches of the land of Vidal Sassoon, came a hairband unlike no other.  With the strength of steel in its rubber interior and vice like grip in its woven thread armor, it laid its claim over my hair in an epic battle of wrapping and roping that won the hearts of all the hairbands across the land.  Peace has once again thrived atop my head and the beastly mane has been tamed.  There is no need of grand stories of this legendary hairband as its humble memory is spoken in the quiet peace that other hairbands know they will not have to face the wild hair beast no more...</li>
    <li> I thought these were going to be thicker, but I also didn&#x27;t notice that they were noted as &#x27;Medium&#x27;.  I didn&#x27;t know what that meant, but now I do.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work fine, but I&#x27;ll have to use for awhile to see if they hold up to my thick hair as well as the thicker elastics I normally use!</li>
    <li> these are good. a little thinner than I thought they&#x27;d be, but they have lasted a pretty long time anyway.</li>
    <li> The ones I was using were thicker and harder for me to put in and take out. These are so much easier to use. Glad I got them!</li>
    <li> I like them they are just little cheap hair ties nothing special  at all , good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;baby fine&amp;#34; hair and these do not cause my hair to break. I may be a little old (69) for &amp;#34;pony tails,&amp;#34; but I use these a lot because fine hair is so hard to &amp;#34;put up.&amp;#34; I am very pleased with them and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good quality and cheap, easy to use, and it is cheap than walmart! I will reorder it next time after I run out of them!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t miss this if you&#x27;re looking for hair ties with decent quality and reasonable price. It is skinny so I recommend using two together if you have a lot of hair. A single band lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter.  They advertised &amp;#34;•Medium thickness elastics hold hair in place without being too thick&amp;#34;.  Good concept but does not work at all with hair of any thickness.  After you put it in, within a very short time, the pony tail has drooped.  It does not hold.  Maybe good for people with extremely thin hair.  Waist of money for us.</li>
    <li> These elastics would only work for people with very thin hair. They are marked as medium thickness and they should be marked as thin. Half of them have snapped at the seam and had to be trashed and most of those snapped the very first time I tried to use them.</li>
    <li> My niece is always out of these. So, I bought her this big pack. She likes them. They are hair bands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> These are thinner than what they appear but are rather durable considering the thinness.  I have very thick hair and they hold it very nicely.</li>
    <li> they all break to easily my wife has thick hair these lasted no more than about 2 weeks. waste if you have coarse thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> A waste of money they all popped on the first use, I&#x27;ll never  get this product again. Never me again.</li>
    <li> When I took these out of the box I laughed. I didn&#x27;t think it would be able to hold my hair in place tightly. I was wrong, they hold well and don&#x27;t pull.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re hair ties...Not much else to be said. They do what hair ties do. Average quality, but one did break already. Be careful with em!</li>
    <li> These elastics came quickly but were much thinner than i expected.  Not the great deal i hoped for.  We have very thick hair and they slide out easily.</li>
    <li> These are very tiny ponytails.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Elastic is no good.</li>
    <li> The first three I tried to use broke instantly. The nest two seemed to work, let&#x27;s see about the other 25. They are very thin and not very strong. Gets the job done, but next time I spend a little more to get some wider and stronger hair ties.</li>
    <li> I just buy this one for free delivery in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;this is too thin, so it does not suitable my hair. However, I think this is good for kids aged from 3 to 10.&lt;br /&gt;therefore, my girl can use it well.</li>
    <li> Cheap hairbands but are good quality. I will purchase them again after I lose/snap these. Nice neutral colors and no metal pieces.</li>
    <li> Just what I need for some simple pony tails.</li>
    <li> these hair clips look like normal size hair clips from their picture. I never even knew they sold such thin junk! what a waste of money paid $3.79 for this garbage. I should have went to a dollar store but i was buying something else so I figured I&#x27;d just add them to my order. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Bought these to round out to $25 for free shipping, but they are great. I&#x27;ve had them for months have yet to have one break.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the colors are great with my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not understand that these were a thin elastic. Wanted the thicker bands for thick, long, hair. Don&#x27;t hold</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the little ones. Good for thin hair, little girls and for partially putting your hair up. Not for ponytails or buns in thick hair.</li>
    <li> Overall I am happy with these. I would&#x27;ve gave five stars but I think they could be a little more stronger. Just don&#x27;t pull on them too much.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for. Thin, durable, and flexible hair ties. Basic and painless. very please with the purchase</li>
    <li> Got these ponytail holders at a great price since they were add on items. They are the thin ones rather than the thicker ponytail holders, however still a great price.</li>
    <li> Comes in a variety of colors, thinner elastic so you have to wrap the hair several times to make it stay.</li>
    <li> These bands are thin and don&#x27;t break easily. Around my wrist I can barely feel that it is there. The color assortment isn&#x27;t bad; neutral.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;m always trying to do new things with my hair and I love these because they don&#x27;t leave a crimp In my hair. They do not get tangled in my hair. They dont do any damage to my hair. I&#x27;ve used these forever. I recommend these over the kind that have the metal piece any day! these are my all time favorite pony tail holders ever!! The colors I got were the neutral ones. I think the colored ones look odd on an adult so get the neutral colored ones! lol they stretch pretty good. I don&#x27;t have thin or thick hair I&#x27;m in the middle so I guess medium thickness?? and they work well for me!&lt;br /&gt;I must mention that I got these in the mail before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and she loved it so much</li>
    <li> These are pretty much standard for hair ties. The different colors are nice and they do stretch. As others previously stated, they are a bit thin and could be better if they stretched a bit more. My hair is pretty thick so I need extra strength in order to hold it up. Not the best hair ties I have seen, but they definitely get the job done.</li>
    <li> These do not pull my hair - hooray!  I should have bought the large, though, because the elastics tend to end up around my wrist and these are a bit tight.</li>
    <li> Wow, these little bands are great for pinching off circulation!  And they&#x27;re cheap, just the way i like it.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair. When trying to put the bands in my hair, the bands literally snapped and flew across the room. The worst part? After I finally got them in my hair, I started noticing some &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; in the middle of my hair. Ends up these have no metal parts, but there is a &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; where the elastic seams come together and exposes the rubber underneath. Well, this was creating friction on my hair and every time I pulled out the elastic, it was breaking my hair in a million places. Terrible product.  Now my long hair needs to be cut at the shoulder line to get rid of the weird frizz!!! Baaaad elastic! Bad!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Very good color and quality.  I used some of them a few times already and none of them were broken.  Very good purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> These do not hold my hair at all. They break really easy. I would save my money and not buy these as an add on.</li>
    <li> When they were delivered they were small thins hair ties.. Not the medium I was expecting.  I still used them, but would have preferred thicker.</li>
    <li> Thin and fine but very strong.  A few neutral colors but a lot of bands. Do not get stuck in my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and these break easily- sometimes out of nowhere while in a ponytail. Does the job though for a short time.</li>
    <li> They are Ok but they are not elastic as much as i expected. I have already broken 3 of them.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the brand of elastic I used to buy at walgreen anymore. They lasted me years for a small pack.&lt;br /&gt;This one is alot thinner. Not as strong and not last as long.</li>
    <li> Too thin for my kind of hair</li>
    <li> They work ... just didn&#x27;t realize from the picture how thin and skinny these were.  Might work better for thin hair.  The are about 1/16&amp;#34; thick if you were wanting a tangible band, this is not it</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly hair, and these break SO easily.  Not great...</li>
    <li> Good colors for my hair and last well.</li>
    <li> These hair crimpers are so thin that if you have thick or even normal hair they do not hold it together well.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. These work well. No metal bit connecting the two sides, just a bit of glue, which is great because then my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in that bit. Don&#x27;t break too easily. Stretchy enough to be comfortable to use but keeps elasticity for a decent amount of time too. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Just perfect! Was delivered promptly and it is just as it is shown. Always good to have around. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> AWFUL, Cheap, not worth the add on price, this product is very thin and would pretty much only work on a little girls pony tail</li>
    <li> I like these because the colors are neutral and go with most things.  They are thin though, so I don&#x27;t recommend them for people with very thick hair.  But I haven&#x27;t had one break yet!</li>
    <li> I can only wear thin elastic bands with or without metal..didn&#x27;t really matter. But these are amazing. The colors are very classy and will fit all occasions and dress color.</li>
    <li> for the price, you cannot ask for anything better. And what&#x27;s more, the quality is really good. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I got it because it was the highest rated. Sits at my wrest (note I&#x27;m small built). Perfect with hair. I love its neutral colors.</li>
    <li> I just bought these for the hell of it since I have long hair. I&#x27;m a guy and I have thick hair and these get the job done. There so cheap too. Definitely get these if your running low.</li>
    <li> These are on the thin-ish side, but I ordered a pack in June 2013 &amp; just now have to re-order!... they lasted me that long!  I have medium thick-ish hair and wear a pony every day. I absolutely recommend them.  I did give a few away, &amp; there are 2 dolls using the last 4 now.  (It was after I just read all the not-great reviews that I felt I had to post how satisfied I&#x27;ve been with this item).</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible, I might as well be tying my hair with rubber bands. Save your money and get something else.</li>
    <li> These are good for a pony tail. They came promptly. I like them a lot as they do not tear or break my hair.</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sassoon Medium No Crimper Elastics works great. I have medium to long hair and it&#x27;s not too thick so they stay on pretty good. They don&#x27;t stretch out as much as my other hair ties. I might try the thicker ones next time.</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair and usually don&#x27;t trust thin hair ties but these hold up fairy well. Good amount for the price</li>
    <li> Product was wonderful. It was a lil smaller then I thought. But still wonderful product. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> These hair bands are the color I wanted, but are not very good quality unfortunately.  I can only use them once before they start pulling apart and stretching out to far.</li>
    <li> I like these.  They do not break my hair.  They do however strech our fairly quick but for as many as you get for the price they are worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Man, all y&#x27;all one-star givin stingy fools get outta here. With these the man bun is in full effect, as glorious as ever. Put em in ya life.</li>
    <li> I love that these are in colors to match dark hair. I also love that they don&#x27;t have the metal on them.</li>
    <li> I love these but didn&#x27;t realize they were the skinny kind of rubber bands. They still do a good job for the smaller size.</li>
    <li> These elastic s are okay, not super sturdy or tight. They don&#x27;t seem like the last a long time, but they&#x27;re fairly cheap, and they&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
    <li> I chose these due to the neutral colors, but they were breaking so quickly, it was astonishing. I usually lose my hair ties before they can break, but these just outdid me!</li>
    <li> Not very strong, and not very stretchy - I don&#x27;t expect these to last long. They also smell fairly awful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought these hair ties were thicker than they actually are. They&#x27;re very thin and break really easily. They also barely wrap around my hair (and I have layers and my hair is pretty thin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and just got to the drugstore for your hair tie needs.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter and they didn&#x27;t even last me 3 weeks they rip when your stretching it to tie on hair</li>
    <li> Not too much to say here.  I have light hair so nice too have hair bands that are not dark.  I also like these are regular width unlike some really thik ponytail holders I have seen recently which are much more than my hair needs.  I would buy these again..</li>
    <li> In about three years, my hair will be long enough for a pony tail.  This 30 pack is going to make sure I am prepared for that.  Please come to my pony tail party and be my friend.</li>
    <li> Good value. I don&#x27;t know how I lose them so quickly!!</li>
    <li> Worked well, but was thinner than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> arrived as expected.  not a fan of the little glue on each band</li>
    <li> The rubber band is a lack of elasticity.</li>
    <li> 3 broke at first use! Don&#x27;t get this if you have thick and long hair. It would not work for you since the elastics are very thin and not very strong.</li>
    <li> very effective for fine to medium thick hair, holds well, and goes with many, many outfits.. and I like ordering them here because when I am out shopping I usually forget these type of things and just end up getting the essentials..</li>
    <li> What I expected, nice buy.</li>
    <li> cheap hair ties, good quality, great for an add on item since theyre something i go through quick and need anyway. they&#x27;re the thin ones, which is perfect.</li>
    <li> These ponytail holders are very thin, but I like them.  These were an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; for free super saver shipping from Amazon, and since I like having lots of &amp;#34;hair hickys&amp;#34; around, I was glad to have such a large pack of them.</li>
    <li> These bands do what the packaging states they do, keep the hair in place without damaging your hair or braking it off.</li>
    <li> These are good, grippy elastics and at 1.99 on sale, you certainly can&#x27;t go wrong. So far no breakages or other complaints. My hair is shoulder length.</li>
    <li> ok, but not for thick hair as advertised. probably wouldn&#x27;t break on someone who didn&#x27;t have incredibly thick hair as mine, but I&#x27;ve been going through them rather quickly.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair up. they are small so if you have thick hair, probably go with thicker</li>
    <li> These are not thick bands and don&#x27;t hold up well for what I wanted them for.  My daughter has very thick hair and these bands aren&#x27;t strong enough for her hair.  They break constantly.  However, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick so I can use them...so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add-on item since you can&#x27;t have too many hair ties.  There is not much else to say.</li>
    <li> If you like thin and durable, these are awesome but weren&#x27;t what I was expecting.  They are a little thin for my tastes.</li>
    <li> These rubber band work but are thin. Happy with them - just thought they would be thicker. Good price. Good Colors.</li>
    <li> Like mo3pal said, these are a bit small especially if you wear them around your wrists. I have very thin wrists but they still start to cut off my circulation if I have more than one around my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Nice colors (marroon, dark brown, light brown, black, army green, cream/white)--I gave the white ones to a blonde friend because I have very dark hair and they don&#x27;t work well with my hair, but all the other colors are great with by black brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to comment on their durability, although in all honesty they look like what you&#x27;re paying for. not really high quality, but they&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> They are what they are, and they do what they do.  Nice thick &amp;#34;snagless&amp;#34; elastics, without the little metal bit.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> These things are Cheap &amp; Break Apart after less than10 uses.....I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> Fuctionable and shipped fast&lt;br /&gt;Overall good purchase if it&#x27;s an add on item.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair. These did not work well for me. I think this would work with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> They are in my opinion useless they tear for some odd reason and they wind up you hair in the tie once you take it off. Poor quality product for an expensive price.</li>
    <li> wonderful elastics they don&#x27;t pull your hair &amp; they hold very well</li>
    <li> These ponytail elastics are great, they don&#x27;t tangle your hair or break it.  I would definitely recommend them, they colors are neutral and they are kind to your hair.</li>
    <li> After a few uses they stretch out and where the seam is comes apart</li>
    <li> These hair bands work great. Very thin, but works for my hair. I usually like the thicker bands, but those seem to break easily, so I am very happy that these don&#x27;t break easily like the others. Great value!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a band to hold your hair together. It does its job.</li>
    <li> these are your basic run of the mill hair tie. They will hold your hair up that&#x27;s for sure. These are the ones I keep in my purse for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; since they&#x27;re cheap and small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these very simple, basic hair elastics for a long time.  I grew up with the same kind, except they had a little metal ball where the closure was hidden inside.  These are all elastic.  They have the perfect amount of stretch in them.</li>
    <li> These are very thin so they tend to lose their shape and snap quite easily. I&#x27;ll go back and repurchase the brand i used before.</li>
    <li> Very thin elastics.  Would be perfect for braids or ponytails for people with thinner hair or for those who do not want a really thick hair tie-size is like that of a normal hair tie but the elastic is thinner.  Colors are fairly neutral-no bright or bold colors, which was as described.</li>
    <li> These are very cheaply made, broke several on my first gentle pull. They are thin, break easily, not stretchy at all, not what I consider &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; sized; a bit on the smallish side.  Strangely some people gave it 5 stars even though they disliked it but felt since they didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money it was OK....those 5 stars are confusing the issue.  These hair elastics are useless.  They are not elastic at all.  Possibly the only way they wont tangle is if they are used in very fine thin hair -carefully.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my gf and she loved them.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hair ties. I prefer the thinner elastic, although they do stretch out faster than thicker elastic ties. The colors are also nice and neutral.</li>
    <li> got these to break the $25 free shipping bariier.  Now the wife has more than enough and has stopped stealing mine.  Not the best quality, but i have large hands so putting them on is where they break (seam comes apart).  This has only happened twice, so it is no big loss.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no need for a review for something like this other than to say the packaging is super easy to deal with and there&#x27;s no metal to snag your hair. Stretches out after a day or two and doesn&#x27;t hold as well. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> loved these as an add on!</li>
    <li> These elastics do hold your hair back but I broke one the first day. I usually use rubber-bands which I assume is damaging so I brought two packs.</li>
    <li> These thinner, no crimper elastics work perfectly for the bottom of my daughter&#x27;s braids. I am very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> These elastics are great colors, fairly sturdy, and a great price! Shipping didn&#x27;t take long at all either. I love the add-on program!</li>
    <li> These elastics are thinner (but not too thin) than the ones I usually use and hold just as well.  I was looking for some that would be less bulky and these came through.  The neutral colors are great and hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged since there are no crimpers.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for. These were very cheap, cheaply made, and quick to break. Very, very thin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. But I don&#x27;t feel as if I was ripped off. I only paid $2!</li>
    <li> used to get the standard bluky black ones that hold. ( for working out especially) .. find that these are just as strong and more discreet. great price.</li>
    <li> These were sturdy but I would not recommend them for women with very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I always buy these because they work great</li>
    <li> About 1 out of every 3 of these has NOT broken the first time I tried. Cheap thin elastic that breaks apart at the seam with the slightest stretch. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> These are quite a bit thinner than I had expected; probably about half the thickness of standard hair ties. This makes me concerned about their durability, but I guess only time will tell how they hold up. In any case, with 30 of them at this price I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter all that much if they break more easily.</li>
    <li> thin and tiny, not high quality.</li>
    <li> Great brand and surely couldn&#x27;t beat the price! Will order again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> They seem a little thinner than the ones I normally get.  I do not know about the quality as I have not used them yet.</li>
    <li> Standard elastics for hair. I like not having the metal piece as it does not pull. Be careful when removing as hair may still get tangled around band.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an add-on item (on sale). Plus, I think they are really useful. And I&#x27;m glad that I bought them.</li>
    <li> These are the only hair product our family can&#x27;t live without! They do not pull your hair out when taking them out.</li>
    <li> These literally broke when I took them off the cardboard. They were no were near strong enough to hold my hair. Horrible product!</li>
    <li> I had purchased these to get me over $25 for free super saving shipping and they actually work pretty good. I have pretty thick hair and so far they haven&#x27;t broken on me but they were a little thinner than I thought they would be but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
