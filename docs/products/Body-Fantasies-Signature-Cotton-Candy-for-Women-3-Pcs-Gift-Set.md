    <li> Smells just like spun sugar at the fair! A couple of sprays on my shirt,  hair, neck and wrists and I&#x27;m good to go. I would say the scent lasts a couple of hours. I could smell it on my wrist if I put my nose to it but the general scent had dissipated by then. Lotion is creamy but light and absorbs quickly.  The bodywash is delightfully sweet and lathers well. Thank you vyer much!</li>
