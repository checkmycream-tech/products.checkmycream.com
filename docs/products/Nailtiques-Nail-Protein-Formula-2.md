<li> My nails are so long &amp; hard thanks to this.  </li>
<li> used this nail formula for a long time</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say that it would work independently of the oil therapy because it seems that the two products are designed to augment each other.</li>
<li> I have to constantly files them down</li>
<li> It was the only thing that stopped my nails from cracking in half all the time.</li>
<li> I have used it every day for over two weeks now and have seen no real difference.</li>
<li> Never tried other nail proteins, never had the need to look elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
<li> My nails are extremely damaged due to acrylics and gel nails.</li>
<li> The formula is very much what you expect, a little thick, clear, with a semi unpleasant smell.</li>
<li> #2, 0.25 - a lot less of product.  </li>
<li> ALMOST HALF THE COST</li>
<li> About a month ago, I took off the sculptured nails and got these formulas (first used the kit for after removing artificial nails).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a recovering nail biter who had a biting relapse a few months ago.</li>
<li> I put this on everyday when I started with nubs. ...</li>
<li> It is not easy to find, so</li>
<li> Wear until it wears away at the tips, about 5 days usually.  </li>
<li> My nails still chip but nowhere near as bad as they used to.</li>
<li> My nails were VERY short and impossible to work with.</li>
<li> My nails were always so think and weak that I bit them off.  </li>
<li> I almost want to say they have gotten worse.</li>
<li> My nails are VERY weak and thin.</li>
<li> I was very frustrated and tried one of those nail growth polishes from my local drugstore.</li>
<li> I have horrible nails; ridged, split and weak.</li>
<li> I still apply this formula under my base coat whenever I change my color.</li>
<li> Had stupidly put acrylics on to mask the damage, then when they came off my nails were in a terrible state.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this polish</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> ahhhh this stuff is a miracle.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item - it showed 2 1/4 oz of product, which I had purchased before.  Now I see it is written #2, 0.25 - a lot less of product.  (comma makes the difference)  Just, let the buyer beware.  Nailtiques is a great product that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recovering nail biter who had a biting relapse a few months ago. My nails were VERY short and impossible to work with. I was very frustrated and tried one of those nail growth polishes from my local drugstore. To keep things short, it wasn&#x27;t working fast enough. One of my coworkers is a nail tech and she recommended this product to me, and I&#x27;m so ever glad she did. I started applying the formula the day I received it. The formula is very much what you expect, a little thick, clear, with a semi unpleasant smell. The first week I didn&#x27;t notice TOO much of a difference, but I felt the very little nails I had getting stronger. I kept applying, and by Week 2 I started seeing an amazing difference in growth. To keep a long story short- it took me about 3.5 weeks to get my nails back to a normal &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; length. Although that may seem like a long time to some, my nails grew STRONGER and at a decent rate too. I still apply this formula under my base coat whenever I change my color. I would recommend this to anyone out there that is getting impatient with growth and also wants BEAUTIFUL and STRONG nails once they grow back in.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. It was the only thing that stopped my nails from cracking in half all the time.</li>
    <li> I use it every day. It works when it is on. When I put too many layers it starts peeling off. The nails are still brittle without Nailtique.</li>
    <li> Keeps my nails from splitting and peeling.</li>
    <li> MUCH CHEAPER THAN CVS OR WALGREENS ALMOST HALF THE COST AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.</li>
    <li> This is the best product you can ever use on your natural nails.  Period.  Strengthens like nothing else out there.  My nails were always so think and weak that I bit them off.  Then I got sculptured nails and it got me out of the habit of biting them.  About a month ago, I took off the sculptured nails and got these formulas (first used the kit for after removing artificial nails).  The change in my nails is stunning.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this polish I had such high hopes! My nails are extremely damaged due to acrylics and gel nails. My nails are VERY weak and thin. They are always peeling and breaking. I have used it every day for over two weeks now and have seen no real difference. I almost want to say they have gotten worse. I am glad I did not pay full price for this in stores and only hope I can find something that will work.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My nails are so long &amp; hard thanks to this.  I have to constantly files them down or I&#x27;d have claws lol.</li>
    <li> Bought this as I had nails that were constantly splitting, peeling and chipping. Had stupidly put acrylics on to mask the damage, then when they came off my nails were in a terrible state. Have been using this for about 3 weeks on and off (youre supposed to do 4 days on, 1 day off I think). My nails still chip but nowhere near as bad as they used to. I think with dedicated use, this product is very, very good - but you need to be more dedicated to it than I am!</li>
    <li> I have horrible nails; ridged, split and weak. This is really helping!!</li>
    <li> I started using nail polish several months ago and had to stop when my nails began to split and break. I used this product to help repair my nails after using Nailtiques Oil Therapy. The protein formula works very well. I can&#x27;t say that it would work independently of the oil therapy because it seems that the two products are designed to augment each other. Read and follow instructions for both products; don&#x27;t improvise. I also rated the Nailtiques Oil Therapy with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> recommmended by a friend, so far no improvement but i am hopeful that this will help my brittle nails grow</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that really works on making your nails stronger!  This is the one!  I really like this product.  It is not easy to find, so Thank you Amazon for helping me get this!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this excellent nail formula especially since it really works and was a great buy.  I will buy more!!&lt;br /&gt;Have used this nail formula for a long time and I have great nails!</li>
    <li> It arrived right away and I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it really keeps my natural nails healthy and strong.  I would highly recommend this product and this seller because of the quick turn around once I placed my order.</li>
    <li> Miracle product.  turned my soft peeling nails into strong, growing, beautiful nails.  Now i have to file or cut them every week!  Will never stop using.  Worth every penny.  Never tried other nail proteins, never had the need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;The way i use:  apply one coat on day 1 and a second on day two.  Wear until it wears away at the tips, about 5 days usually.  REmove with regular polish and repeat cycle.  I don&#x27;t add more than two coats at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure to use the right formula for your nails (go by description).  formula 2 is my miracle.  I tried 2 plus because it seemed even &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; but it wasn&#x27;t right for my nails.</li>
    <li> Liquid nail crack in a bottle.  I love this stuff. I put this on everyday when I started with nubs. ...nubs.  I couldn&#x27;t get my nails to grow.  Now I&#x27;m scratching myself and others by accident,  and digging under my nails. Yay!!</li>
    <li> ive used this for over a year and can&#x27;t love with out it! makes them grow and harden so much</li>
    <li> This was grow out nail that are very damaged or brittle. You just need to keep it up and it will help your nails to protect them while in water with gloves. I have bought this twice and I have now been using this for a month and half and will buy the Nailtiques Nail Protein Formula, # 1 and #3 to keep them (nails ) beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other products such as Sally Hansen in an effort to strengthen my weak nails, but this product is the only one that works.</li>
