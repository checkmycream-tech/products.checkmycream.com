### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best stuff ever!</li>
      <li>It goes on rather waxy/greasy, but work it in for a minute or two and you are good to go.</li>
      <li>Super moisturizing and perfect for the winter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been loving it for years, and probably always will.</li>
      <li>Guess it works OK</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I recommend shopping around and finding a seller with a better price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen changes, my cuticles are getting better, i just need to be more</li>
      <li>Cuticles have never been softer or better looking.  </li>
      <li>Very rich and creamy.  </li>
      <li>I have used this cream for several years and am delighted to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It smells clean and nice but not heavily.</li>
      <li>Would loved to find in larger jars?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds and this is the best, put it on at bedtime</li>
      <li>However, it absorbs quickly so you won&#x27;t stay greasy.</li>
      <li>Product probably does what it&#x27;s supposed to but is super sticky and the consistency of Vaseline.</li>
      <li>but I think its well worth the money...</li>
      <li>Regular hand lotion did not really help, but this works great!</li>
      <li>So I know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say that Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair and Christian Dior&#x27;s Cr&amp;egrave;me Apricot - nail cream, are hands down the VERY BEST ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Qtica, but I thought I was getting the larger container (like the one shown), not the 0.25oz.  </li>
      <li>it really works.</li>
      <li>Should have read more carefully!</li>
      <li>and it helped repair my dry cracked cuticles very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thick enuff to stay put and absorbs nicely</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t&#x27; use it unless I am in old clothes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to buy a few of the other products made by Qtica&#x27;s since this one is so amazing.</li>
      <li>QTICA Intense Cuticle Repair Cream works well to sooth my dry cracked cuticles</li>
      <li>The jar is tiny but the product last forever cause you don&#x27;t need much for each hand.</li>
      <li>My cuticles have always been very dry, but regular use of the Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair Cream, has made my cuticles soft and manageable!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would describe the product as more of a balm than a cream; it&#x27;s very thick and greasy.</li>
      <li>and when I wake in the morning my cuticles are soft and easier to push back.  </li>
      <li>Really greasy so you have to be careful about it getting on your clothes and furniture.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item to individuals with dry cuticles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the jar to really smell it; so you won&#x27;t walk around smelling like perfume or an almond cookie like some of the other brands.</li>
      <li>My hands are in water a lot we live on a ranch where I work outside with our animals and my cuticles are always dry and cracked.  </li>

<li> My hands are in water a lot we live on a ranch where I work outside with our animals and my cuticles are always dry and cracked.  </li>
<li> The only flaw I see in it, it is a bit oily, I cant seem to get it rubbed in, so I use it before bed time, it only takes a dab on each finger, I recommend this to anyone who has sore or dry cuticles.</li>
<li> I usually pay this much for an ounce.</li>
<li> i have used this cream for a long time.</li>
<li> I work at a medical center and have to wash my hands frequently with harsh soap which caused my cuticles to dry and crack.</li>
<li> The cream helps protect and heal rough and split areas around fingers.  </li>
<li> If you have very dry cuticles, then this is the cream for you!</li>
<li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
<li> I am not consistent user but every time I start using this product, my nails improve.</li>
<li> It is a little pricey</li>
<li> Dried cuticles were repaired just over night.</li>
<li> Hard to use during the day without making a mess of everything you touch.</li>
<li> I use it at least 5 times a day, and a jar typically lasts me about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> No more cracking or splitting.</li>
<li> Cold weather takes a toll on my hands and the cuticle cream definitely helps!  </li>
<li> Nothing works as well on my thick, determined cuticles as Qtica.</li>
<li> , it is subtle and fades after awhile anyway if you prefer scentless.</li>
<li> My cuticles and fingers get so bad they actually crack, bleed and get infected.</li>

    <li> Product probably does what it&#x27;s supposed to but is super sticky and the consistency of Vaseline. Hard to use during the day without making a mess of everything you touch. Does not &#x27;absorb&#x27;. Would not but again.</li>
    <li> I am not consistent user but every time I start using this product, my nails improve.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! Thick enuff to stay put and absorbs nicely</li>
    <li> I love Qtica, but I thought I was getting the larger container (like the one shown), not the 0.25oz.  For the same price you can get the 0.5 oz size.  I recommend shopping around and finding a seller with a better price.</li>
    <li> Nothing works as well on my thick, determined cuticles as Qtica. I&#x27;ve been loving it for years, and probably always will.</li>
    <li> The only one that words on my ragged cuticles.</li>
    <li> QTICA Intense Cuticle Repair Cream works well to sooth my dry cracked cuticles, I put it on before bed and when I wake in the morning my cuticles are soft and easier to push back.  My hands are in water a lot we live on a ranch where I work outside with our animals and my cuticles are always dry and cracked.  Qtica Cuticle Cream has helped a lot, I am giving it a 4 star.  The only flaw I see in it, it is a bit oily, I cant seem to get it rubbed in, so I use it before bed time, it only takes a dab on each finger, I recommend this to anyone who has sore or dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> Item was smaller than I anticipated but cream does it job!!! I would highly recommend this item to individuals with dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> i have used this cream for a long time. it really works. i use it before i go to bed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m and artist and work with chemicals on a daily basis. My cuticles and fingers get so bad they actually crack, bleed and get infected. I&#x27;ve bought tens-of-thousands of different cuticle and hand products over the years, and I have literally tried every one on Amazon. So I know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say that Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair and Christian Dior&#x27;s Cr&amp;egrave;me Apricot - nail cream, are hands down the VERY BEST ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the product as more of a balm than a cream; it&#x27;s very thick and greasy. However, it absorbs quickly so you won&#x27;t stay greasy. It smells clean and nice but not heavily. You have to stick your nose I&#x27;m the jar to really smell it; so you won&#x27;t walk around smelling like perfume or an almond cookie like some of the other brands. The jar is tiny but the product last forever cause you don&#x27;t need much for each hand. I use it at least 5 times a day, and a jar typically lasts me about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to buy a few of the other products made by Qtica&#x27;s since this one is so amazing.</li>
    <li> Really greasy so you have to be careful about it getting on your clothes and furniture.  Guess it works OK but I don&#x27;t&#x27; use it unless I am in old clothes.</li>
    <li> If you have very dry cuticles, then this is the cream for you! My cuticles have always been very dry, but regular use of the Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair Cream, has made my cuticles soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> Should have read more carefully! This is so tiny (1/4 oz.)  I usually pay this much for an ounce.</li>
    <li> The same as the hand cream from QTICSA. The cuticle and the all around the fingertips now softer and no cracks during the every day work. Thank you for this stuff</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for several years and am delighted to find it available on Amazon.  The cream helps protect and heal rough and split areas around fingers.  Cold weather takes a toll on my hands and the cuticle cream definitely helps!  Would loved to find in larger jars?</li>
    <li> I work at a medical center and have to wash my hands frequently with harsh soap which caused my cuticles to dry and crack. Regular hand lotion did not really help, but this works great! I like the scent, it is subtle and fades after awhile anyway if you prefer scentless. It goes on rather waxy/greasy, but work it in for a minute or two and you are good to go. A little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds and this is the best, put it on at bedtime and I use sleeping gloves and it moisturizes all night and it helped repair my dry cracked cuticles very quickly.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Dried cuticles were repaired just over night. Very rich and creamy.  Wish I had gone ahead and bought the larger one.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Rub it in cuticles every evening.  Cuticles have never been softer or better looking.  No more cracking or splitting.</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing and perfect for the winter.  It is a little pricey but I think its well worth the money...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen changes, my cuticles are getting better, i just need to be more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;But I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
