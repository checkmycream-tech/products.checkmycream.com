      <li>I was nervous because of the price, but am very happy with the quality of the polish.</li>
      <li>Great concept but don&#x27;t waiste your money!</li>
      <li>MY POLISH STAYED ON AND LOOKED GOOD ALL WEEK!!!</li>
      <li>An excellent top coat!</li>
      <li>and it was a pain figuring everything out, though as always, Amazon was great about everything.</li>
      <li>Love this polish!!  </li>
      <li>: I am a Scotch Naturals convert and enthusiastic supporter!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I put 2 coats on this morning and it has mostly chipped off in mid-afternoon.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite water based top coat.</li>
      <li>Love love this polish.</li>
      <li>Think of it more like acrylic paint, after acrylic paint drys</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions on the website and you will be pleased with your manicure.</li>
      <li>have become Scotch Naturals&#x27; number one fan, and I want other health-conscious consumers to know that it&#x27;s an excellent product, BUT IT MUST BE APPLIED CORRECTLY.</li>
      <li>I ended up getting my money back, thanks to amazons GREAT customer service!</li>
      <li>I started to read something about using an oil on your nail first, then their colored paint and then this top coat.</li>
      <li>Brushes on smoothly, dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Great top coat for natural and other nail polish.</li>
      <li>I applied this top coat to another scotch nail polish and it completely peeled off once I washed my hands.</li>
      <li>I did not use the product right away.</li>
      <li>It looks good and lasts for about a week or two with me being very active and barefoot in the summer.</li>
      <li>I attempted  to apply both nail polishes 3 more times, but got the same results.</li>
      <li>This top coat mixes with the nail color and takes it back into the bottle.</li>
      <li>If the polish did not work for them it is most likely because the directions for using this polish was not followed correctly.</li>
      <li>I wanted to put something more healthy on my nails, but I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money and do not have a trio of products that work for more than a few hours.</li>
      <li>Love this low odor product and it really seals in the color.</li>
      <li>I just wanted a natural clear top coat</li>
      <li>And my lungs are much happier also.</li>
      <li>It really makes nail colors pop.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s too much work for me.</li>
      <li>But with a simple clear coat it&#x27;s so quick and easy that the pros far outweigh this con for me.</li>
      <li>I finally made the jump to a healthier nail polish when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and is the essential 3rd step to having a positive Scotch Naturals nail polish experience.</li>
      <li>It dries super fast, stays on a long time and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*No more tingling because it has the SAFEST ingredients of all natural brands; in addition to the \\&quot;3-free\\&quot;, it also does NOT contain harmful acetates or alcohols which other 3-free polishes</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t last a day - scratches right off.  </li>
      <li>I had to learn new techniques</li>
      <li>There are 2 other prime eligible sellers, which they recommended I go with to make sure I will get the right color this time, so go with either of those other two for a safer bet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very watery for whatever reason and it peels off the next day.</li>
      <li>A complete (expensive--for nail polish) mistake.</li>
      <li>At first I did my own thing, used another brand&#x27;s base coat (safe but not water-based), didn&#x27;t follow directions, and got nail polish that peeled right off, as other SN reviewers have complained.</li>
      <li>After getting strange tingling sensations when applying my old clear-coat</li>
      <li>Looks like regular polish but so much healthier for you, less toxic than even the 3-free nail polishes.  </li>
      <li>You must use their base coat, 2 coats of color and the top coat which is super shiny.</li>
      <li>Good idea, but bad product.  </li>

<li> If you want a clear look be sure to use the base coat first and it will last for a long time.</li>
<li> but it actually takes me LESS TIME now to do my nails because the water evaporates so fast and the polish is dry!</li>
<li> absence of overpowering stinky fumes&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;AT NIGHT, BEFORE BED, I buffed my nails to make the surface as smooth as I could; I applied base coat, 2 coats color, and top coat, waiting only a few minutes in between coats as directed.</li>
<li> I tried searching all over the weppage to see where to leave seller feedback but couldn&#x27;t find the appropriate link, so thought it would be helpful to other buyers to know to avoid eTailz as the seller, just cause they sent me the wrong color</li>
<li> Scotch Naturals set a new record for me, and I have always expected polish to start chipping and peeling after a few days.</li>
<li> Regularly I desire the simplicity of clear-coating my nails so that they don&#x27;t look dull...</li>
<li> You do need the Scotch sticky base coat and top coat.  </li>
<li> The only very slight difference I found was that I needed 3 coats of color, not the usual 2.  </li>
<li> But it is hard as rocks ONLY after a few hours and should not be exposed to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Chemical smell, not original scoth label</li>
<li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> But that is a small price to pay for a non-toxic pedicure.  </li>
<li> UNFORTUNATELY, people are posting a lot of negative reviews of SN products because they&#x27;re trying to use them just like they use solvent-based polishes; the only problem is, this is water-based:</li>
<li> /&gt;NO ODOR, NO TOXINS, DRIES IN MINUTES, HARD FINISH</li>
<li> But this stuff was hard as rocks after it cured overnight.</li>
<li> at least* once per week.</li>
<li> it is very hard.</li>
<li> Water thin and lots of bubbles...</li>
<li> I should have paid attention to this (returns are allowed at Scotch.com), as this polish is very expensive to end up with something I&#x27;m not satisfied</li>
<li> Too complicated for me.</li>
<li> Since I was past 30 days I can&#x27;t even get a replacement on the base coat to see if that would help the polish stick.</li>
<li> I had the impression that I could use it as a base coat.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed!</li>
<li> The worst nail polish ever</li>
<li> Maybe the consistency was lost in shipping, but this is the worst nail polish I have ever purchased.</li>

    <li> I did not use the product right away. It was a month before I opened it. When I did it was a blob of white. It did not work properly so it did not help the polish stick. The polish then chipped off in big chips within hours of applying it. I wanted to put something more healthy on my nails, but I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money and do not have a trio of products that work for more than a few hours. I&#x27;m quite disappointed! Since I was past 30 days I can&#x27;t even get a replacement on the base coat to see if that would help the polish stick.</li>
    <li> An excellent top coat! Brushes on smoothly, dries quickly. And no toxic chemicals! It&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
    <li> The worst nail polish ever</li>
    <li> Love this low odor product and it really seals in the color.</li>
    <li> This top coat mixes with the nail color and takes it back into the bottle. After that is not usable anymore:/</li>
    <li> Great concept but don&#x27;t waiste your money! I applied this top coat to another scotch nail polish and it completely peeled off once I washed my hands. I attempted  to apply both nail polishes 3 more times, but got the same results. I ended up getting my money back, thanks to amazons GREAT customer service!</li>
    <li> Non toxic. Great top coat for natural and other nail polish. I love it!</li>
    <li> Do not listen to the negatve reviews! If the polish did not work for them it is most likely because the directions for using this polish was not followed correctly.This is not a solvent based polish. Think of it more like acrylic paint, after acrylic paint drys it is very hard. You must use their base coat, 2 coats of color and the top coat which is super shiny. DO NOT EXPOPOSE YOUR NAILS TO WATER FOR SEVERAL HOURS. Your manicure will last all week</li>
    <li> Love love this polish. It dries super fast, stays on a long time and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> UNFORTUNATELY, people are posting a lot of negative reviews of SN products because they&#x27;re trying to use them just like they use solvent-based polishes; the only problem is, this is water-based: it&#x27;s TOTALLY DIFFERENT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have become Scotch Naturals&#x27; number one fan, and I want other health-conscious consumers to know that it&#x27;s an excellent product, BUT IT MUST BE APPLIED CORRECTLY. At first I did my own thing, used another brand&#x27;s base coat (safe but not water-based), didn&#x27;t follow directions, and got nail polish that peeled right off, as other SN reviewers have complained. Then I went to Scotch Naturals website and followed their directions to the letter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;AT NIGHT, BEFORE BED, I buffed my nails to make the surface as smooth as I could; I applied base coat, 2 coats color, and top coat, waiting only a few minutes in between coats as directed. MY POLISH STAYED ON AND LOOKED GOOD ALL WEEK!!! Scotch Naturals set a new record for me, and I have always expected polish to start chipping and peeling after a few days. But this stuff was hard as rocks after it cured overnight. I did exercise caution and used gloves when I did dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had to learn new techniques but it actually takes me LESS TIME now to do my nails because the water evaporates so fast and the polish is dry! But it is hard as rocks ONLY after a few hours and should not be exposed to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ODOR, NO TOXINS, DRIES IN MINUTES, HARD FINISH THAT LASTS (on properly prepared nails) AND STUNNINGLY-UNIQUE COLORS: I am a Scotch Naturals convert and enthusiastic supporter! And my lungs are much happier also.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite water based top coat. It really makes nail colors pop. If you want a clear look be sure to use the base coat first and it will last for a long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> IT WAS SO THINNED OUT , IT WENT ON LIKE MILK.</li>
    <li> Love this polish!!  I used this polish for a pedicure, following the very simple directions from Scotch Naturals site, and still no chips almost 2 weeks later.  You do need the Scotch sticky base coat and top coat.  Looks like regular polish but so much healthier for you, less toxic than even the 3-free nail polishes.  The only very slight difference I found was that I needed 3 coats of color, not the usual 2.  But that is a small price to pay for a non-toxic pedicure.  I am a Scotch Naturals fan for life!</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and is the essential 3rd step to having a positive Scotch Naturals nail polish experience. Do not skip this step! Follow the instructions on the website and you will be pleased with your manicure.</li>
    <li> Maybe the consistency was lost in shipping, but this is the worst nail polish I have ever purchased. Water thin and lots of bubbles...</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived within the specified time frame.</li>
    <li> Chemical smell, not original scoth label</li>
    <li> I put 2 coats on this morning and it has mostly chipped off in mid-afternoon.  I had the impression that I could use it as a base coat.  A complete (expensive--for nail polish) mistake.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last a day - scratches right off.  Good idea, but bad product.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I wish I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I tried searching all over the weppage to see where to leave seller feedback but couldn&#x27;t find the appropriate link, so thought it would be helpful to other buyers to know to avoid eTailz as the seller, just cause they sent me the wrong color and it was a pain figuring everything out, though as always, Amazon was great about everything. There are 2 other prime eligible sellers, which they recommended I go with to make sure I will get the right color this time, so go with either of those other two for a safer bet.</li>
    <li> Regularly I desire the simplicity of clear-coating my nails so that they don&#x27;t look dull... it&#x27;s also the solution when you&#x27;re in between manicures and need to replace the flaking nail polish remnants. After getting strange tingling sensations when applying my old clear-coat I figured it was time to investigate \\&quot;au naturale\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE:&lt;br /&gt;*The absence of overpowering stinky fumes&lt;br /&gt;*No more tingling because it has the SAFEST ingredients of all natural brands; in addition to the \\&quot;3-free\\&quot;, it also does NOT contain harmful acetates or alcohols which other 3-free polishes DO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE:&lt;br /&gt;*No returns via Amazon purchase. I should have paid attention to this (returns are allowed at Scotch.com), as this polish is very expensive to end up with something I&#x27;m not satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;*This is not as durable as traditional kinds. It will need to be redone *at least* once per week. But with a simple clear coat it&#x27;s so quick and easy that the pros far outweigh this con for me.</li>
    <li> I finally made the jump to a healthier nail polish when I found out I was pregnant. I was nervous because of the price, but am very happy with the quality of the polish. It looks good and lasts for about a week or two with me being very active and barefoot in the summer. I followed the instructions on the website and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> I know you&#x27;re supposed to follow some instructions per the website for it to work as it&#x27;s supposed to but that&#x27;s too much work for me. I started to read something about using an oil on your nail first, then their colored paint and then this top coat. I just wanted a natural clear top coat and this didn&#x27;t do the job. It&#x27;s very watery for whatever reason and it peels off the next day. I didn&#x27;t put any oil on my nails as the directions instructed though. Going to return this polish. Too complicated for me.</li>
