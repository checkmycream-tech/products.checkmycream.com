    <li> I have bought this product at Nordstrom and loved it. I am not sure if what I received is not real, or has somehow gone bad!! Instead of the cleanser being white (which it always is, and still is at Nordstrom), the product I received is a seafoam  green!?!?!?! Yuck. I plan to return</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning since I was about 30 and I&#x27;m 41 with little to no change in my skin.  I would say that is a VERY GOOD thing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! This is my second time ordering it from Amazon. It is amazing for my skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face sparkling clean! I use this w/ the Olay exfoliating cleanser.</li>
    <li> love this cleanser. super gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> My skin feels clean and tingling when I&#x27;m done using this. I like it but I thought it was a bit over priced.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a creamy one (which is good for dry skin). My t-zone tends to get oily during the warm weather so this cleanser doesn&#x27;t really work for my kind of skin, but it may be good for others who have dry skin, as I said earlier. It&#x27;s of good quality but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite facial cleanser.  I have tried a few different products before making this my go to facial cleaner.  The light scent is pleasant smelling and this product both cleanses and moisturizes the face.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very gentle, yet effective. I will be purchasing this product along with more Dennis Gross products. I also buy the acne pads</li>

    <li> My daughter moved from California to Indiana to attend college. She never had problems with acne until moving to the Midwest. We tried every prescription cream and medication but the acne got worse. After reading articles about how minerals in hard water in some parts of the country can cause acne we decided to try Dr. Gross&#x27; products. Within a week my daughter&#x27;s acne cleared up! She&lt;br /&gt;will use this product religiously going forward. Thank you Dr. Gross!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite! I keep coming back to this product, and it has never ceased to impress me!</li>
    <li> love this product! shipped fast, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not used to the toner and cleanser &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;!  But I am continuing to use it and will see the results!</li>
    <li> love this product and this brand. my skin is definitely less oily and feels clean without drying out.</li>
