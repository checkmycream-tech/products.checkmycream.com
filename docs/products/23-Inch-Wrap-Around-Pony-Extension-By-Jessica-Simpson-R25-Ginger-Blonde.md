      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how well the color matches my hair.</li>
      <li>My own hair is way too think, therefore didn&#x27;t wrap around or stay on my head.  </li>
      <li>but if you match it close, you can get your own hair color changed to match it at the hair salon.</li>
      <li>Great for a quick hair do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it matched my hair almost perfect and nice that it has different color blondes</li>
      <li>course, since Amazon is so good about returns, I returned it and received a full refund.</li>
      <li>good price, really pretty!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely \\&quot;love all of them!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>you will want more pieces!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I absolutely  love it.  </li>
      <li>so make sure to order the correct shade</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love the length.</li>
      <li>If the prices were lower, I would definitely order many more!!!  </li>
      <li>looks like real hair and the color came out to be very nice.</li>
      <li>The color is great and looks natural.</li>
      <li>but if you put your ponytail higher up on your head, it works much better!</li>
      <li>Easy to put on, easy to care for and easy to style.</li>
      <li>Because it is synthetic, it tangles easily and sheds.</li>
      <li>&amp; they are sooooo easy to use.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t tell there is any matrix that way, and it also holds it on strongly.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine).</li>
      <li>Love the Jessica Simpson wrap around hair pieces, stay put once on, easy to use, look very much like my own hair, thanks :-)</li>
      <li>It seems as if it is being discontinued and that is a HUGE BUMMER...  </li>
      <li>If you find it too shiny for you put a touch of powder in your hands, rub to together and then lightly run though synthetic</li>
      <li>it was so light in weight</li>
      <li>The real one actually looks better than the photo!!!  </li>
      <li>This adds a quick style to it, and is easy to put on.</li>
      <li>and it is super easy to put in...</li>
      <li>A fun choice!</li>
      <li>It still blends fairly well because it has several highlights/lowlights, so it&#x27;s still wearable.  </li>
      <li>overall it was a good experience.</li>
      <li>I love this so much</li>
      <li>The wig is soft which is nice, also you will feel the weight on your head.</li>
      <li>I would recommend curing your own hair if its long since you will be able to tell your hair from the wig that way.</li>
      <li>I already own several pieces from this line that I ordered from the original site</li>
      <li>but I was able to change the color to golden blonde which came out perfect and still holding it color which synthetic hair is not easy to change the color.</li>
      <li>This hairpiece is nice and long and has just the right color strawberry blonde, and the wrap around is also much better than the clamp ponytail and looks more natural.</li>
      <li>This was MUCH cheaper than the other brands I looked at, and the quality is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>it would be more of a reddish blonde, instead it was brassy/yellowish.  </li>
      <li>The match is scary how perfect it is!</li>
      <li>i will be buying more from this brand and trying different ones out!!!</li>
      <li>I want another one, in the straight style, too!</li>
      <li>It arrived within a few days of ordering &amp; it is an absolutely beautiful piece, but what I ordered was not exactly the right color for me.  </li>
      <li>I am very please with the turn out.</li>
      <li>Everyone always thinks its my real hair.</li>
      <li>This piece looks so real.</li>
      <li>The only issue I have is it is pulling free of MY ponytail, I am hoping I can work on that.</li>
      <li>Look real.</li>
      <li>I felt like it was pulling on my real hair causing damage.</li>
      <li>The waves really help it blend well with your hair.</li>
      <li>price is great compared to other brands and actually Other websites.give it</li>
      <li>Just have realistic</li>
      <li>I even put it up in a high bun for my sons wedding and everyone complimented my hairdo.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Except for it did not come in the color I was looking for which was golden blonde</li>
      <li>The only problem I see for anyone buying this would be getting the right color</li>
      <li>The hair could be a little more refined, smooth and shiny and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>looks very natural</li>
      <li>Bought 6 of these so far!</li>
      <li>This was super easy to put in, I did cut about 4 inches off the end since it was thin anyway</li>
      <li>Also the comb to secure it is heavy and weighs on my ponytail.</li>
      <li>and it looks completely natural.  </li>
      <li>I even used it this past Saturday as a &amp;#34;piece&#x27; layed it flat in the back under my own hair and pulled my hair up on sides .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really the only comparable and affordable thing out there for a white chick.  </li>
      <li>My own mother did not realize I was wearing a fake ponytail.</li>
      <li>i love that it looks so natural too and doesnt have that fake shine to it.</li>

<li> and you will never  go back to expensive other brands and real hair.</li>
<li> My hair is shoulder length and layered, so my ponytail is not very exciting.</li>
<li> I did cut a few inches off because it is unbelievably long.  </li>
<li> I have really long, thick hair actually as long as this wrap around.</li>

    <li> Love the Jessica Simpson wrap around hair pieces, stay put once on, easy to use, look very much like my own hair, thanks :-)</li>
    <li> This is even nicer than I had expected-very long-I actually cut it. Can be flat ironed or curled-either way looks great!</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length and layered, so my ponytail is not very exciting. This adds a quick style to it, and is easy to put on. I did cut a few inches off because it is unbelievably long.  Because it is synthetic, it tangles easily and sheds. There is plenty of hair in it, so just brush it before Nsd after using it. A fun choice!</li>
    <li> Love it! looks very natural</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I ordered it last week and received it in the mail today. I got the &amp;#34;ginger blonde&amp;#34; ponytail and it matched perfectly! (My hair was an auburn red before I dyed it honey blonde so make sure to order the correct shade and you&#x27;ll be fine). I will be using this on my Vegas trip in 2 weeks, but I tried it on today and it looks FABULOUS!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This was super easy to put in, I did cut about 4 inches off the end since it was thin anyway but the color matches perfectly. I use a champagne hair color on the rest of my hair. I like that there are several colors woven into the wig. The wig is soft which is nice, also you will feel the weight on your head. I would recommend curing your own hair if its long since you will be able to tell your hair from the wig that way. I put just a little curl to the ends of my hair and you could not tell the difference.</li>
    <li> good price, really pretty! The waves really help it blend well with your hair. Love the length. I recommend this hair piece, and will be using this seller again.</li>
    <li> Jackpot. This was MUCH cheaper than the other brands I looked at, and the quality is AMAZING! It has a bonus tendril of hair so that after you clip it into your pony tail and enclose it with the small velcro piece, you wrap the tendril of hair around the base of the pony tail and bobby pin it. You can&#x27;t tell there is any matrix that way, and it also holds it on strongly. I can braid this and wind it up into a bun and bobby pin it to make a chignon. I want another one, in the straight style, too! LOVE this.</li>
    <li> This hairpiece is nice and long and has just the right color strawberry blonde, and the wrap around is also much better than the clamp ponytail and looks more natural. The hair could be a little more refined, smooth and shiny and less frizzy. But no matter it&#x27;s still a beautiful piece.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. I used this for cosplay. My only complaint was that it was a little heavy but if you put your ponytail higher up on your head, it works much better!</li>
    <li> looks like real hair and the color came out to be very nice. it matched my hair almost perfect and nice that it has different color blondes so it blends well. At first i thought it was going to look really thin cause it was so light in weight but then i put it in and it looks great!! i love that it looks so natural too and doesnt have that fake shine to it. and it is super easy to put in... i would recommend extra bobby pins though jus tfor piece of mind. i will be buying more from this brand and trying different ones out!!!</li>
    <li> Bought 6 of these so far! Color is perfect. .texture...real easy to use and everyone thinks it is real.great for growing out hair.the 18 inch pony is great  and the beach pony is awesome.nice to have a selection . price is great compared to other brands and actually Other websites.give it a shoot and you will never  go back to expensive other brands and real hair.</li>
    <li> Awful. Tacky, fake and so artificial looking!!!</li>
    <li> The match is scary how perfect it is! Love this.</li>
    <li> I should say I have had human hair extensions which you can&#x27;t come close to comparing with this pony but I was disappointed hoping to use it in between extension applications and it is so fake looking and heavy I felt like it was pulling on my real hair causing damage. The color ended up matching well but that&#x27;s about it, up to this point I have never used it, I guess I will keep it around for Halloween.</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love it.  I have washed and straightened it and it looks completely natural.  My own mother did not realize I was wearing a fake ponytail. I even put it up in a high bun for my sons wedding and everyone complimented my hairdo.  The best!!!</li>
    <li> This piece looks so real. Everyone always thinks its my real hair. Its a perfect match. I love this so much</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and even though this is something I would not usually purchase on-line, I did. The color was not bad, but overall the texture and appearance seemed fake to me. Which...of course, it is. Just have realistic expectations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, since Amazon is so good about returns, I returned it and received a full refund.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick hair do.&lt;br /&gt;Except for it did not come in the color I was looking for which was golden blonde but I was able to change the color to golden blonde which came out perfect and still holding it color which synthetic hair is not easy to change the color. I am very please with the turn out.</li>
    <li> My own hair is way too think, therefore didn&#x27;t wrap around or stay on my head.  Its for thin hair, ugh!!  otherwise color was great so bummed</li>
    <li> That is the risk you take when ordering online.  I assumed since it said &#x27;ginger blonde&#x27; it would be more of a reddish blonde, instead it was brassy/yellowish.  It still blends fairly well because it has several highlights/lowlights, so it&#x27;s still wearable.  The product arrived here very quickly and I was really impressed by that...overall it was a good experience.</li>
    <li> It arrived within a few days of ordering &amp; it is an absolutely beautiful piece, but what I ordered was not exactly the right color for me.  It is too yellow &amp; I needed to have some darker highlights. The only problem I see for anyone buying this would be getting the right color but if you match it close, you can get your own hair color changed to match it at the hair salon. Just remember what color you ordered for the next time cause trust me...you will want more pieces!!!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t return it b/c I waited too long.  :(&lt;br /&gt; I already own several pieces from this line that I ordered from the original site and I absolutely \\&quot;love all of them!\\&quot;  I get compliments every time I wear them &amp; they are sooooo easy to use.  If the prices were lower, I would definitely order many more!!!  If u get the right color, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!  The real one actually looks better than the photo!!!  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how well the color matches my hair.The only issue I have is it is pulling free of MY ponytail, I am hoping I can work on that. I even used it this past Saturday as a &amp;#34;piece&#x27; layed it flat in the back under my own hair and pulled my hair up on sides . Looked great- Good piece for the price.</li>
    <li> Great match. Look real. Blends in well with my hair. Easy to put on, easy to care for and easy to style.</li>
    <li> I like Ken Paves bangs, but this pony tail doesn&#x27;t work too well for me. I have really long, thick hair actually as long as this wrap around. I wanted this to help with style and curl on lazy pony tail days. The color is great and looks natural. If you find it too shiny for you put a touch of powder in your hands, rub to together and then lightly run though synthetic hair.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had is with the size it is too small for thick hair. I could not get it to fully wrap around my hair and close with the Velcro. Also the comb to secure it is heavy and weighs on my ponytail. It eventually falls down and makes a mess. The worst thing about it is the piece the sticks out sideways that you have to wrap around and secure with bobby-pins, I just don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to return it. I will either give it to someone with my hair color that has thinner hair, or I will figure out a way to &amp;#34;re-fashion&amp;#34; it&#x27;s designs and make it work for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a shorter, thin ponytail then I think this would be good for you.</li>
    <li> very nice. good service</li>
    <li> I have this piece in lots of colors so I can dye my hair and use it whenever.  This doesn&#x27;t match me NOW but will someday and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.  It seems as if it is being discontinued and that is a HUGE BUMMER...  It&#x27;s really the only comparable and affordable thing out there for a white chick.  :)  I have it down to a science how to use them and now they&#x27;re going away....so sad.  Ken Paves if you&#x27;re reading this, bring &#x27;em back for pete&#x27;s sake!  If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
