<li> /&gt;-little bit goes a long way</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it every day for cleaning makeup brushes; washing face and body- tea tree &amp; citrus are both beneficial to fighting acne and this soap doesn&#x27;t strip skin; footbath (every winter I get an annoying cuticle infection from sweaty socks, gross;) laundry add-in (antimicrobial extra measures;)</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little does go a long way so this soap has lasted quite awhile.  </li>
<li> My hair looked dirty right after I washed it!</li>
<li> We haven&#x27;t used it for anything else, but there&#x27;s tons of other reviews that detail its merits for everything from tooth brushing to dish washing.</li>
<li> I use other scents for bathing.</li>
<li> Even diluting it, it&#x27;s just too expensive and not amazing enough to be worth the price.</li>
<li> Received extremely diluted product.</li>
<li> The bottle was taped down in 3 places to prevent any leakage.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s rated only  .1 point below this soap for not drying out your skin, for a lot less money!!!</li>
<li> but less as you dilute it, which is recommended for a lot of purposes.</li>
<li> Hard to explain but regular cleaners usually make my floors a little sticky</li>
<li> Otherwise it will fulfill all your dirty jobs and aid very well in skin</li>
<li> My hair was not filthy to begin with, but it felt filthy after using this as shampoo.</li>
<li> For a few months I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap to brush my teeth</li>
<li> I hate cleaners that you cant even pernicious most of the word you know they are killing you slowly with this</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the liquid but couldn&#x27;t find small bottles anywhere, so here I bought 8 oz bottles of Tea Tree and Citrus each.</li>
<li> Only a vague resemblance to the quality I know and associate with Dr. Bronner.  </li>
<li> It was horrible as a shampoo for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this to use as a shampoo since drugstore shampoos seem to be drying my hair out and conditioner ain&#x27;t fixin it. I diluted it as the website suggested but it left a film in my hair which turned it greasy and after using shampoo the next day my hair was even drier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it worked wonderfully as an emergency laundry detergent and getting the baked on grease off my oven door. I diluted it about 1/2 cup in two gallons of water, let it soak on the door and then scrubbed with baking soda. It took some elbow grease but it got it all off. I was quite impressed. I also used it to mop my linoleum floors. It left a nice smooth feel. Hard to explain but regular cleaners usually make my floors a little sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the scent, light citrus. But for the results I got I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Even diluting it, it&#x27;s just too expensive and not amazing enough to be worth the price.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is always great, I love the smell of the Citrus.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> If this soap smelled any better I&#x27;d try and eat it. Heavenly fragrance. Highly recommended. Gets your day off to a contented start.</li>
    <li> After reading so many reviews about how wonderful this product is, I decided to try it. I like the mild citrus scent. I don&#x27;t understand all raving over how it makes your whole bathroom smell great. I didn&#x27;t notice that at all. It has a very mild scent and it&#x27;s no longer noticable after I get out of the shower. The scent does not linger, and that&#x27;s fine with me.  It does leave my skin squeaky clean, and I did not notice it drying out my skin as others have stated. A little does go a long way so this soap has lasted quite awhile.  It was horrible as a shampoo for me. My hair felt sticky and full of residue. My hair looked dirty right after I washed it! My hair was not filthy to begin with, but it felt filthy after using this as shampoo. I washed my hair with this soap a few times to give it a good chance. I&#x27;m back to using Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoo.  I have not tried it in the laundry or on my floors yet. I think I&#x27;ll stick to Seventh Generation for that.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s  soaps are awesome. I like this scent for my face wash in the am. I use other scents for bathing.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, bought to make my own shower gel. Price isn&#x27;t great though saw  the bigger bottle at CVS for a little over a dollar more.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Lathers very well. A little goes a long way. Rinses clean.</li>
    <li> My first time trying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m impressed!!  Love this soap!!&lt;br /&gt;-little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-sooooo many ways to use it...laundry, dishes, toothpaste, face/body, household cleaning...etc.&lt;br /&gt;-great value&lt;br /&gt;-gentle on my skin&lt;br /&gt;-lovely scent&lt;br /&gt;-no harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use bottle/container&lt;br /&gt;-will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Received extremely diluted product. Did not lather up at all</li>
    <li> I love this smell, it makes me feel refreshed and clean and ready for the day...</li>
    <li> Great soap but you probably know that.  This is the same stuff only in a travel bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Citrus scent smells great, washes clean without the tingle of the peppermint.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome....I quit using the liquid hand soap. Mix this stuff with water in a foam dispenser &amp; you got great hand soap w/o added chemicals. I was very pleased with the packaging. The bottle was taped down in 3 places to prevent any leakage.</li>
    <li> Product arrived with a faulty seal.  Fragrance had dissipated.  Only a vague resemblance to the quality I know and associate with Dr. Bronner.  Nobody&#x27;s fault. Things happen.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, just trying new scents</li>
    <li> I hate cleaners that you cant even pernicious most of the word you know they are killing you slowly with this I use it for everything!</li>
    <li> No complaints.  The Citrus smell is not quite what I hoped for but it does the job of cleaning and eliminating odor!!</li>
    <li> I KNOW I WILL LOVE THIS, BUT HAVEN&#x27;T USED YET.  PLAN ON USING IN A CLEANER VERY SOON.  MAYBE TOMORROW.</li>
    <li> This soap is OK, but for the price I will buy Dove Moisturizing bar in the future.  It&#x27;s rated only  .1 point below this soap for not drying out your skin, for a lot less money!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap..all Dr. Bronners soaps.  They get you squeeeky clean in no time.  But the downside is that they strip your skin of oils..so you have to really lotion up.</li>
    <li> I use this mixed with water in a spray bottle, it&#x27;s a great cleaner and I love the citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Love any of the Good &amp;#34;DOCTOR&amp;#34;s&amp;#34; products.  My family has used their for ever!</li>
    <li> For a few months I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap to brush my teeth (people say flouride toothpaste is toxic) and it gets them clean and really doesn&#x27;t taste too soapy. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the liquid but couldn&#x27;t find small bottles anywhere, so here I bought 8 oz bottles of Tea Tree and Citrus each. I&#x27;m hooked! You can really use this castile soap for just about everything. It&#x27;s also natural, environmentally friendly and the company supports ethical causes. I&#x27;ll break it down-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree: Natural antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, nice medicinal smell. DO NOT try brushing your teeth with this variety, it burns and is all you can taste for hours. Otherwise it will fulfill all your dirty jobs and aid very well in skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Orange: Orange oil benefits include similar antibacterial properties as stated above, good for skin, uplifting scent in aromatherapy. This soap is mild and freshly fragranced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers nicely but less as you dilute it, which is recommended for a lot of purposes. I&#x27;ve used it every day for cleaning makeup brushes; washing face and body- tea tree &amp; citrus are both beneficial to fighting acne and this soap doesn&#x27;t strip skin; footbath (every winter I get an annoying cuticle infection from sweaty socks, gross;) laundry add-in (antimicrobial extra measures;) hair- clarifying agent to strip buildup, still trying to figure this one out- I shampoo regularly after; cleaning buildup on my bamboo hairbrush; mopping floors. Just about anything you can think of! Of course consult online forums and read proper usage, i.e. possibly not appropriate to wash pets, or all but baby mild are not recommended for sensitive skin and, well, babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I mix tea tree and citrus together for maximum performance, and to conserve more of each. I want to try more scents, but don&#x27;t want to waste plastic, so I&#x27;m debating sizes to buy. When I choose my favorites I&#x27;ll figure out which tokeep in bulk and refill, etc. I really like the stuff! I&#x27;ll update after I try more.</li>
    <li> I like citrus stuff. So I was struck with the issue of what smell Dr Bronners I wanted to get to use a body wash. Hence the I like citrus stuff so I got this one. I smelt great but be aware DON&#x27;T WASH SENSITIVE AREAS WITH THIS SOAP. or be prepared to feel the burn. I also read that a lot of people use this one for household cleaner</li>
    <li> This is classic for a reason. I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and the citrus is my favorite scent. I use it to clean any wood in my house, including doors and kitchen cabinets. This stuff takes care of anything that is scuffed up.</li>
    <li> We use this with all of our laundry. It smells fabulous and continues to smell great on the towels a week later. We haven&#x27;t used it for anything else, but there&#x27;s tons of other reviews that detail its merits for everything from tooth brushing to dish washing.</li>
