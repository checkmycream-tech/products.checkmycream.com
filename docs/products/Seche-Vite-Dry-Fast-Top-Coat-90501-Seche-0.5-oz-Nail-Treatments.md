      <li>This is absolutely THE best top coat you can buy.</li>
      <li>I love this top coat!</li>
      <li>and they make by far the best nail polishes on the market.</li>
      <li>NIce shiny top coat.</li>
      <li>I understand some people are worried about the ingredients in this product, and the smell is quite potent.</li>
      <li>I applied the top coat and waited approx.</li>
      <li>way better than the drugstore brand</li>
      <li>its on top of.</li>
      <li>Now when I found out that this top coat has the ingredient TOLUENE  </li>
      <li>I could paint my nails and apply this top coat, sit for 2 minute and put on my shoes without worrying about my nails being smeared.</li>
      <li>It dries my nails in about 5 minutes the most, and I do my nails before I go to bed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never buy another top coat again.</li>
      <li>What can I say about this top coat,</li>
      <li>well worth the price!!</li>
      <li>After hearing such great things about this top coat on youtube, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a worthy investment!</li>
      <li>My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many top coats from quick drying to normal.</li>
      <li>Nail polish lasts a week, even when I wash dishes or clean, without gloves.  </li>
      <li>I love how it really hardens tha polish</li>
      <li>not so much china glaze top coats), ZOYA, and ORLY all of these nail polish brands have said NO to these ingredients</li>
      <li>I love how fast and shiny this dries.</li>
      <li>I really like using it over my nail designs for a quick drying, shiny top coat.</li>
      <li>If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
      <li>quick dries.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest not using this top coat during pregancy or around kids.</li>
      <li>I will with much regret stop using this product until SECHE VITE becomes TOLUENE free.</li>
      <li>Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
      <li>There are other top coats out there that provide an excellent glossy finish without using any of these questionable ingredients; furthermore, I concluded that it is not by accident that the top nail-lacquer brands already stopped using Toluene, DBP, formaldehyde, etc.</li>
      <li>IT TRULEY GIVES YOU A CLEAR SHINY FAST DRYING TOP COAT.</li>
      <li>It stays on, dries fast, and has an amazing shine for the entire week.</li>
      <li>Seche Vite has a strong smell of paint solvent, paint thinner, completely different from the sweet, distinctive smell that nail lacquers have.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, it dries VERY fast and works well on all of my nail polishes.  </li>
      <li>One particular ingredient caught my attention right away:</li>
      <li>This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
      <li>5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
      <li>With this, my manicure is dry within minutes, and I&#x27;m able to get on with my life.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but it&#x27;s not enough to make me stop using this.</li>
      <li>Dries exttemely fast.</li>
      <li>How it dries my nails so fast</li>
      <li>Now I can really be creative with designing my nails because I know I wont be stuck blowing on wet nails for an hour.</li>
      <li>It dries the nails fast and keeps the polish on longer.</li>
      <li>Dries really fast and leaves nail shiny.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>without this top coat, it normally takes 5 minutes for all of the layers to dry.  </li>
      <li>ingredient that is in this is TOLUENE and many other polishes have this ingredient in their polishes.</li>
      <li>I am very rough on my hands, so no polish lasts for more than four days on me before needing touch up.</li>
      <li>Delivery was also super fast, will definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>I have used Orly and Sally Hansen fast dry top coats with similar results.</li>
      <li>Over all shines great, but not impressed.</li>
      <li>first noticed the different, unusual odor when I opened the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely come back for more purchases in the future!</li>
      <li>Many other things contain the same ingredient but just doesn&#x27;t have a warning label because it doesn&#x27;t manufacture in California.</li>
      <li>BE FAR</li>
      <li>Save your considerable amount of money on this and the Orly Bonder.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>It took a little longer to ship than i expected, but was worth the wait!!</li>
      <li>after i applied the seche vite dry fast top coat, my nails were hard and dry within 15 seconds!</li>
      <li>It dries extremely fast; faster than any other I used.</li>

<li> Wow.  </li>
<li> It took a little longer to ship than i expected, but was worth the wait!!</li>
<li> after i applied the seche vite dry fast top coat, my nails were hard and dry within 15 seconds!</li>
<li> It dries extremely fast; faster than any other I used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure you can use it to thin out your other polishes too.</li>
<li> It does have a strange smell to it, not quite like regular polish.</li>
<li> It makes your nail polish dry faster, last longer, and gives your nail a coating of strength to prevent breakage.</li>
<li> Some research identifies Toluene as a potential carcinogen and contributor to other health</li>
<li> It makes your polish shiny, prevents it from chipping as it ages and makes your polish dry faster.</li>
<li> As advertised, it dries rather fast, and I noticed a subtle thickening of product in the bottle as I was applying it.  </li>
<li> I never believed it when I heard that it was completely dry, but after trying it I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
<li> And with this it&#x27;s dry to the touch in about 10 minutes and completely dry in a half an hour.</li>
<li> Be careful applying this stuff.  </li>
<li> Previously I used Opi base and top coat in one, but my polish started peeling off the next day.</li>
<li> This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive</li>
<li> i really never painted my nails because i would ruin them in the few minutes after.  </li>
<li> I expect this bottle will turn to impenetrable goo before I&#x27;ve used even half of it.</li>
<li> For the past few years, I gave up on doing my nails since I was too impatient to dedicate the time needed for the polish to fully dry.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t stay on my nail long enough to matter.</li>
<li> If you reapply in the days after a mani, it extends the life of the mani by a few days.</li>
<li> The only reason why this one has a scary warning label is because it was manufactured in California and California has set standards and violations for using Toulene.</li>
<li> i tried it for the first time over semi-dry nail polish (base coat + 2 layers of nail polish).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve NEVER liked one until I used Seche Vite.</li>
<li> Also, some say that the polish will get extremely thick after awhile</li>
<li> No More!</li>
<li> I mean I know that nail polish must contain chemicals after all it must stay on, but you guys know what I mean.</li>
<li> But it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to deter me from using it.</li>

    <li> After hearing such great things about this top coat on youtube, I decided to give it a try.  I purchased mine at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for 7.99 so seeing it on amazon for under 5.00 was shocking!!! Great deal! Anyways, it dries VERY fast and works well on all of my nail polishes.  I really like using it over my nail designs for a quick drying, shiny top coat. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! BE FAR THE BEST TOP COAT I HAVE EVER USED AND I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT FOREVER IT TRULEY GIVES YOU A CLEAR SHINY FAST DRYING TOP COAT.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product.  i tried it for the first time over semi-dry nail polish (base coat + 2 layers of nail polish). after i applied the seche vite dry fast top coat, my nails were hard and dry within 15 seconds! without this top coat, it normally takes 5 minutes for all of the layers to dry.  well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Wow.  Be careful applying this stuff.  As advertised, it dries rather fast, and I noticed a subtle thickening of product in the bottle as I was applying it.  I expect this bottle will turn to impenetrable goo before I&#x27;ve used even half of it.</li>
    <li> i really never painted my nails because i would ruin them in the few minutes after.  when i tried this, it worked instantly.  i can paint my nails now and not have to worry about ruining them.  way better than the drugstore brand quick dries.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this top coat! Previously I used Opi base and top coat in one, but my polish started peeling off the next day. This one doesn&#x27;t peel. It stays on, dries fast, and has an amazing shine for the entire week. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely THE best top coat you can buy. The price is too low for the things it can do. It dries extremely fast; faster than any other I used. I could paint my nails and apply this top coat, sit for 2 minute and put on my shoes without worrying about my nails being smeared. The smell is strong but it&#x27;s not enough to make me stop using this. Also, some say that the polish will get extremely thick after awhile but I suggest purchasing the seche vite thinner [...] to thin out the polish. It cost only 8 dollars and that is inclusing shipping and handling. I&#x27;m sure you can use it to thin out your other polishes too. And finally about the ingredient..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient that is in this is TOLUENE and many other polishes have this ingredient in their polishes. The only reason why this one has a scary warning label is because it was manufactured in California and California has set standards and violations for using Toulene. Many other things contain the same ingredient but just doesn&#x27;t have a warning label because it doesn&#x27;t manufacture in California.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! What can I say about this top coat, I&#x27;ts awesome!!!!! It dries my nails in about 5 minutes the most, and I do my nails before I go to bed and I do not have any problems in the morning. Now when I found out that this top coat has the ingredient TOLUENE  I was soooooo disappointed. I say NOOOOOOO to TOLUENE, FORMALDEHYDE, AND DBP, HENCE THE REASON WHY MY NAIL POLISH COLLECTION CONSIST OF OPI, CHINA GLAZE (nail color, not so much china glaze top coats), ZOYA, and ORLY all of these nail polish brands have said NO to these ingredients and they make by far the best nail polishes on the market. I will with much regret stop using this product until SECHE VITE becomes TOLUENE free. If we don&#x27;t stand our ground companies will not remove these harmful chemicals from our nail polishes. I mean I know that nail polish must contain chemicals after all it must stay on, but you guys know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It is amazing.  How it dries my nails so fast, I don&#x27;t understand, but I don&#x27;t care.  Remember to give it 20 minutes or so and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> This is the best topcoat I have used.  Beautiful finish &amp; shine.  Nail polish lasts a week, even when I wash dishes or clean, without gloves.  Dries exttemely fast.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
    <li> It dries the nails fast and keeps the polish on longer. If you reapply in the days after a mani, it extends the life of the mani by a few days. Definitely a worthy investment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many top coats from quick drying to normal. I&#x27;ve NEVER liked one until I used Seche Vite. Before I&#x27;d have to wait almost 3 hours before going to sleep and I&#x27;d still wake up with those pesky sheet marks. And with this it&#x27;s dry to the touch in about 10 minutes and completely dry in a half an hour. I never believed it when I heard that it was completely dry, but after trying it I&#x27;m a believer! I&#x27;ll never buy another top coat again.</li>
    <li> This is the one.  Dries faster.  Shines brighter.  Lasts longer. I&#x27;ve tried others and keep going back to this one.</li>
    <li> just started using. toes last, but fingers don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll try with a ridge-filling base next time to see if that&#x27;ll help. Over all shines great, but not impressed.</li>
    <li> I love how fast and shiny this dries. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t stay on my nail long enough to matter. I used Orly Bonder base coat and I can&#x27;t seem to keep polish on my nails longer than 12 hours without it chipping away. Very disappointed. Save your considerable amount of money on this and the Orly Bonder.</li>
    <li> The best of the best, the glossiest top coat, period.  One review after another exalted the incredible mirror-like finish that Seche Vite gives to your nails.  I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed the different, unusual odor when I opened the bottle.  Seche Vite has a strong smell of paint solvent, paint thinner, completely different from the sweet, distinctive smell that nail lacquers have.  A caution flag went up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed on the side of the box raised yet another flag.  One particular ingredient caught my attention right away: TOLUENE.  The warning also found on the box did not alleviate my concerns, either: \\&quot;WARNING! This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy and will not use Seche Vite because of its questionable ingredients, specifically Toluene.  Some research identifies Toluene as a potential carcinogen and contributor to other health disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may argue that while Toluene can be bad for you, just about every other chemical may equally be bad if misused.  Perhaps so.  The bottom line for me is that I would not want to use something that has potential health risks.  There are other top coats out there that provide an excellent glossy finish without using any of these questionable ingredients; furthermore, I concluded that it is not by accident that the top nail-lacquer brands already stopped using Toluene, DBP, formaldehyde, etc. in their products.</li>
    <li> I cant stop gushing about seche vite! For the past few years, I gave up on doing my nails since I was too impatient to dedicate the time needed for the polish to fully dry. No More! With this, my manicure is dry within minutes, and I&#x27;m able to get on with my life. Now I can really be creative with designing my nails because I know I wont be stuck blowing on wet nails for an hour. It does have a strange smell to it, not quite like regular polish. But it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to deter me from using it. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> It took a little longer to ship than i expected, but was worth the wait!! I love how it really hardens tha polish its on top of. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Will definitely come back for more purchases in the future! The order processed within a day and was here in 3 days.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I am extremely pleased with it! Dries really fast and leaves nail shiny. Delivery was also super fast, will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Este producto es increible. Lo aplicas sin que se seque el esmalte y en pocos segundos las uñas estan completamente secas y con un brillo espectacular.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat ever! It makes your nail polish dry faster, last longer, and gives your nail a coating of strength to prevent breakage. I understand some people are worried about the ingredients in this product, and the smell is quite potent. I highly suggest not using this top coat during pregancy or around kids.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat ever made. It makes your polish shiny, prevents it from chipping as it ages and makes your polish dry faster. Stock up!</li>
    <li> Works well. Dries the multiple layers of nail polish that I apply LOTS faster than without it. NIce shiny top coat. I am very rough on my hands, so no polish lasts for more than four days on me before needing touch up. I have used Orly and Sally Hansen fast dry top coats with similar results. This one is very good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it out-performs the others.</li>
