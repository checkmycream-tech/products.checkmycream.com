      <li>they do ok at removing make up</li>
      <li>Do not find them any &amp;#34;quicker&amp;#34; than the original moisturizing pads, but do the trick!</li>
      <li>Yes, they are quite oily but they they remove stubborn waterproof eye makeup in the most thorough and fantastic way.</li>
      <li>They are a nice small pad, perfect size for eyes, so the jar doesn&#x27;t take up much room and are a good $ value.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

      <li>These are my new favorite eye makeup remover pads.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon, for making it available  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other (and more expensive) products, and I love these best - especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>I bought a pack of 3 at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products over the years and this is the ONLY one that works.</li>
      <li>The first 2 times I bought this project, it removed my waterproof mascara like a charm.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I was concerned at first because a reviewer mentioned their container arrived with mold....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others but keep coming back to these.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very oily, but wiping with tissue afterward solves this problem.</li>
      <li>Fast and thorough waterproof eyemakeup remover.  </li>
      <li>Works well but very oily</li>
      <li>No rubbing, gentle wiping.  </li>
      <li>the pads are also very oily.</li>
      <li>:  I have used other products that remove eye makeup better.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than the more expensive brands and have been using it for years, but it is becoming more difficult to find.  </li>
      <li>but if you get these, easy to use pads, it comes right off without rubbing too hard either.</li>
      <li>It is becoming hard to find</li>
      <li>I even went back to the old baby oil method!</li>
      <li>They are a little greasy but well worth it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove dark mascara as well as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>However when I opened the first jar the pads were a bit dried out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, mainly because this one does make my vision blurry after use, but nothing else compares.</li>

<li> Among all other make up removers I have tried, this one is so far the best.&lt;br</li>
<li> Not sure if they were older or not stored properly.</li>
<li> This brand had other versions of the same product including oil-free - which did not do the job and left my eyelids dry and burning and pulled out lashes in the process!</li>
<li> my skin is dry around my eyes these oily pads work for me.</li>
<li> Then, when I apply it to my eyes as instructed, the pad still feels dry</li>
<li> All 6 containers had the inner seal lifted half way.</li>
<li> (If all the pads in the jar are very dry, your product may have come unsealed at some point....</li>
<li> I used to always always use Almay, but these pads are roughly 1/2</li>
<li> If you have issues with them being &#x27;dry&#x27; just take all the pads out of the jar and flip them upside down -</li>
<li> Seems just like a slightly damp cotton pad, but damp in a way that reminds me of dry ice or something.</li>
<li> but a lot of other people seem to like it, so</li>
<li> They seem like they sat for a long time and are very dried out.</li>
<li> I take a pad out of the container and it seems kinda dry, like there is hardly any ointment on it.</li>
<li> my vision is blurred for a few minutes after i use them.</li>
<li> However this time is seems a little dry, perhaps because the seals are broken.</li>
<li> Typically this is my favoirte eye-makeup remover, but its getting hard to find.</li>
<li> I had a very hard time finding it this time, so when in doubt, check Amazon...  </li>
<li> pads are very thin and small.</li>
<li> maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Trying to get off waterproof makeup is just agonizing...but if you get these, easy to use pads, it comes right off without rubbing too hard either. I&#x27;ve tried so many others but keep coming back to these. They are a little greasy but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for water proof make up for years and it works so well. It is becoming hard to find so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 30+ years. I am a contact lense wearer and only use waterproof mascara. I have tried many products over the years and this is the ONLY one that works. I use to be able to buy Andrea&#x27;s blue Eye Qs at any drugstore, but noticed over the years that many places quit carrying it. I have even contacted the headquarters of some of the big chains (Walgreens, Target, Walmart...) begging and pleading for help. This brand had other versions of the same product including oil-free - which did not do the job and left my eyelids dry and burning and pulled out lashes in the process! I even went back to the old baby oil method! I still can&#x27;t believe this has been taken off the market, but am thankful I was able to find it on Amazon.com. I bought a pack of 3 at a very reasonable price. THANK YOU Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> It works quickly and easily.  Sometimes I just dip a cotton swap into the container for just a spot of remover.  Only thing is that you need to buy three bottles for the deal.  I was hoping to outlive my makeup products.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 packs of 3. All 6 containers had the inner seal lifted half way. Tampered with? Or unsealed properly by manufacture?  Typically this is my favoirte eye-makeup remover, but its getting hard to find. However this time is seems a little dry, perhaps because the seals are broken.</li>
    <li> Excellent they work every time. I like the fact that you get tthree In a pack its a great deal. I&#x27;ll order them again.</li>
    <li> I use these &amp; the moisturizing pads for removing waterproof mascara.  Do not find them any &amp;#34;quicker&amp;#34; than the original moisturizing pads, but do the trick!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite eye makeup remover. Bc my skin is dry around my eyes these oily pads work for me. And it removes all my waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> These are my very favorite makeup remover pads. However when I opened the first jar the pads were a bit dried out. Not sure if they were older or not stored properly. They still get the job done, but I have to use several pads instead of just two. If your local drugstore stocks these get them there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I&#x27;ve tried other products, mainly because this one does make my vision blurry after use, but nothing else compares. I did figure out that I needed to use the pad and then wipe the oil off with a basic make up remover pad Before blinking. This method prevents the oil form getting in the eye resulting in blurred vision. It&#x27;s also great for removing long-lasting lipstick!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years - it does wonders with waterproof mascara.  I had a very hard time finding it this time, so when in doubt, check Amazon...  Great product, and this time I bought a lot!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used - it does not burn eyes or skin, takes off any mascara, even waterproof easily.  No rubbing, gentle wiping.  I won&#x27;t use anything but this anymore &amp; I&#x27;ve tried it all!!</li>
    <li> Pros:  They are a nice small pad, perfect size for eyes, so the jar doesn&#x27;t take up much room and are a good $ value.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I have used other products that remove eye makeup better.  They don&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> The first 2 times I bought this project, it removed my waterproof mascara like a charm.  This batch (of 3 separate jars) isn&#x27;t doing the job at all--and I&#x27;ve tried all 3 jobs.  Back to hunting for a remover pad that will take off waterproof mascara...</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work too well for me. I take a pad out of the container and it seems kinda dry, like there is hardly any ointment on it. Seems just like a slightly damp cotton pad, but damp in a way that reminds me of dry ice or something. Then, when I apply it to my eyes as instructed, the pad still feels dry it doesn&#x27;t take much makeup off... and yet somehow the area around my eyes gets kind of greasy. I don&#x27;t recommend this but a lot of other people seem to like it, so maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted. I was concerned at first because a reviewer mentioned their container arrived with mold....but none of my items were defective in that way. The delivery time was good as well.</li>
    <li> pads are very thin and small. they do ok at removing make up but it takes more than one pad. the pads are also very oily. my vision is blurred for a few minutes after i use them. if i could give 0 starts i would because of the following.... I would like to leave an update that after opening these pads and using them the oil was on the top of the lid of the inside and molded it! i was using eye pads that had mold on them! never again will i use these! never, ever!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well but very oily</li>
    <li> I have used these eye remover pads before and was pleased. They seem like they sat for a long time and are very dried out. Did not remove my eye makeup at all.</li>
    <li> Love these! They remove waterproof mascara. Only need one pad for two eyes. Good deal.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the drugstores anymore.  Yes, they are quite oily but they they remove stubborn waterproof eye makeup in the most thorough and fantastic way.</li>
    <li> Fast and thorough waterproof eyemakeup remover.  I like it better than the more expensive brands and have been using it for years, but it is becoming more difficult to find.  Thanks, Amazon, for making it available  It also has great moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase these at my local drug store.  Then they stopped carrying the waterproof ones, and I found them at my local beauty supply.  Then THEY stopped carrying them and I panicked!  I quickly found them on Amazon (woo hoo).  These work GREAT, especially on waterproof mascara (that&#x27;s all I wear).  I&#x27;ve tried many other (and more expensive) products, and I love these best - especially for the price.  If you have issues with them being &#x27;dry&#x27; just take all the pads out of the jar and flip them upside down - the product sometimes just drains all to the bottom - and &#x27;poof&#x27; you have refreshed pads again.  (If all the pads in the jar are very dry, your product may have come unsealed at some point.... I don&#x27;t think there is a solution for that... but I checked all three jars received and mine were all fine.)  At one pad per day, these order will last me about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove dark mascara as well as I had hoped.  Have to use multiple pads to do the job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product would recommend it</li>
    <li> Among all other make up removers I have tried, this one is so far the best.&lt;br /&gt;It removes heavy-duty waterproof mascara real quick, with just 1 or 2 swipes.&lt;br /&gt;It is very oily, but wiping with tissue afterward solves this problem.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite eye makeup remover pads.  I used to always always use Almay, but these pads are roughly 1/2 the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck with that.  And I think this brand may actually work quicker and faster than Almay.</li>
