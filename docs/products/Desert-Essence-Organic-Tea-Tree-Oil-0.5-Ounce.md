<li> This is a very small bottle, but it lasts a long time because you use very little.  </li>
<li> Even keeping it in dark cupboard, the potency decreased.  </li>
<li> I skeptically bought this oil because someone recommended tea tree oil for infected body piercings.</li>

    <li> I got this about year ago and even though the bottle is small (about an inch and half tall maybe 2 at the most) it lasted me about a year for what I used it for. And it worked good. But the 2nd bottle I just ordered from the seller NutriCity on here, came opened and leaked. Half of the oil had leaked into the brown envelope it was sent in and the smell was crazy strong before I even opened the envelope up. No seal on the bottle like it should of been and the oil had erased all the ink on the stickered label. Someone had removed the seal and added something to it. Because it didnt smell anything like the first sealed and untampered bottle I got the first time I ordered it. Definitley not ordering from nutricity again. I&#x27;m about to try the seller Vitamshop instead. The oil gets 5 stars Nutricity gets 1.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a baby bottle of tea tree oil, there&#x27;s really nothing that can be wrong with it. The bottle is adorable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used tea tree oil for zits, it works great. Spots treatment only. You must diluted with vitamin E oil or some kind of oil it is too strong will dry out skin. Over all, purity you excellent. Shipping is fast and easy!  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lysa</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil is a great product to keep on hand. it has so many different uses, some that you figure out when you least expect it. This is a good version of tea tree oil. My only complaint was that this bottle was very very very tiny. Much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I skeptically bought this oil because someone recommended tea tree oil for infected body piercings. I applied it once a day to the infected site and within 5 days I was completely healed. You only need to use a very small dab at a time so I imagine this bottle lasting forever.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! now if I could find something for my acne scars</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for acne and other little skin issues. This small bottle is handy to take along on trips or to school, etc. Seems like a good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will order again and again.  Organic is important to me and sometimes that is hard to find.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I am very pleased with this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This dries out and flattens my acne like nothing else. They are totally gone in a day or two. I have tried everything over the years, and in terms of getting rid of a pimple fast, this is the best.</li>
    <li> To be a full potency tea tree oil should be in a brown bottle, worked on mold at first.  Even keeping it in dark cupboard, the potency decreased.  Later I read it should be in dark bottle</li>

I&#x27;m so happy they offer an organic option for those of us that won&#x27;t allow pesticides on or in our bodies. I&#x27;ve noticed the organic version seems to work much faster than the standard version on toe fungus. The nail on my husbands toe grew out in just two months with the organic. The standard version of desert essence tea tree oil took about 4 months to grow out. Could b coincidence, but I prefer to get anything organic that I can, so I&#x27;m thrilled that my favorite brand offers this in organic, as I have not seen this in stores where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small bottle will last a long time too!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face all of the time. An affordable organic tea tree oil, perfect</li>
    <li> Best option at the price by far. Handy size for handbag. My go-to remedy for almost anything that befalls one: insect bites, cuts, burns. Plus I like this company and use several other products of theirs, including yummy ginger-tea tree toothpaste. Perfectly happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Smells super strong and does the job! I mix it with other oils to cut down the intensity. Arrived quickly and is just as pictured.</li>

No medicine cabinet should be without this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing....warts, insect bites, scratches...heals them all.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is great for my skin.  This brand is very potent and not too oily, which I like.  I dilute it 50/50 with water, and it absorbs well.  Not too drying.  Five stars.</li>
