      <li>The plastic of the stripers feels really cheap.</li>
      <li>They were free stuff.</li>
      <li>but the price was cheap</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does the job. But you can get the same set at local dollar stores now</li>
    <li> The 3 liner brushes is why I ordered this. But they are horrible! The entire colored tip the liner brush is attached to comes off very easily. Which also traps water up inside the white handle &amp; can ruin a design if you&#x27;re not aware or if it&#x27;s not cleaned out properly. I learned that the hard way!  Also when you need to dry the brush between a paper towel, you have to be very careful so the entire brush tip doesn&#x27;t come off while pinching it. Or else you have to try to re-attach it while your doing your nails, over &amp; over again. Extremely annoying!! I might glue the tip to the handle &amp; hope it stays. But then again I&#x27;m not sure if any water would still get inside. So I&#x27;m really not sure yet. I only received the colored rhinestones sample, no different shapes. But not a big deal. The dotting/marbling tool seems ok so far. But if you&#x27;re ordering this for the liner brushes, like I did, I would not recommend at all. No matter what the price. Because you will still have to order another brush liner set that doesn&#x27;t fall apart while trying to do an intricate design and ruin it. Hopefully everyone doesn&#x27;t have these same issues with their brushes.</li>
    <li> I do not speak English, but I mean to this product and am very satisfied with it, I will recommend to my friends.   Rating 100%</li>
    <li> im guessing their made out of acrylic becuase when i clean them one of my tools broke becuace it like melted it. so try to not drown them in acetone. the brushes are good love them. shiping is fast but costly but worth it.</li>
    <li> these are so cool.  they were a gift for my daughter for christmas.  so easy to use and clean.  although i wish there was a pamphlet on how to do unique designs.  great item and excellent price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice nail artist, so I ordered this dotting set to make my life easier. As a bonus, it came with the Sable Nail Art Brushes Pen. I gave this product 3 stars because the dotting pens are great! I only had trouble with one of them coming apart on me. The dotting tip fell out of the pen. The others made very clean dots with no fuss, no muss. Another downside is the brushes. They are cheap and terribly made. The FIRST time I attempted to use one, the entire section of brush fell out. The other two seem to be okay, but since I&#x27;ve only used them twice, I am skeptical. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t purchase them on their own.&lt;br /&gt;So, buyer beware of the brushes, and be careful with the dotting tools. They seem awesome for now, but I worry if one fell apart (I glued it back together fairly easily) that the others might soon follow.</li>
    <li> I like the dotting tools, but no the brushes. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t know nail art until you get this product! I use it all the time! If you look for these dotting tools they are quit expensive but after you bought it, you will never regret it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought a set of these tools they are perfect for detailed nail art work. They&#x27;re made of metal so you can just stick them in acetone to clean them and they&#x27;re good as new. I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet. Very handy tools to have if you&#x27;re into nail art.</li>
    <li> I got these for my granddaughter. She loves them. :) The only thing she didn&#x27;t like was how long they took to arrive, but it is stated upfront that it will take weeks.</li>
    <li> The product is as described. Although it is missing the &#x27;bonus&#x27; gems or fruit or whatever. Quality product overall. Would recommend. Shipping took a few weeks</li>
    <li> I use these tools all of the time!</li>
    <li> This showed up quickly and was great quality for the money.  I love the dotting and detailing tools for nail art.  I&#x27;ve really enjoyed working with these tools.</li>
    <li> This order came fast and was packaged in bubble wrap and three separate packages for the dotting tools stripers and rhinestones. Good quality nothing damaged. The only thing that I would like is more variety in sizes of the dotting tool heads. Several are the same. Otherwise great product, will be buying from this seller again. :)</li>
    <li> the rhinestones and fimo do look like that in the picture but the seller doesnt give you that much. you should read the description. its about 20 pieces of rhinestone and 10 fimo which isnt alot. in the picture it looks alot more. some of the dotting tools look like it has the same size tips.</li>
    <li> They were great, just as they described. They just arrived later than I expected but otherwise I am very happy with the set!</li>
    <li> I love my tools to make dots on my nails. Easy to use and easy to clean. Very practicals. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this set.  Just wish it hadn&#x27;t taken so long to get here.  But it was definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set with a variety of sizes. I have not used these much yet and I hope they hold up well to wear and tear.</li>
    <li> I got my product 2days after I ordered it which I loved and I got exactly what I wanted.  The dotting tools are exactly what you see in the picture. The brushes are kind of hard but I have had no problem using them. The small crystals are perfect size for long and short nails. Overall I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> ilove doing my own nails because a custom look from a salon is sooo expensive but with these i make the cutest designs and get compliments all the time</li>
    <li> These were very reasonable.  Shipping was fine.  They are just as described.  Looking forward to using them to do my nails &amp; add cute designs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so annoyed with this. I have patiently waited for my package to come even though it is far past its estimated date. The only package that came was for the brushes, so, I will be reviewing them. First of all, I received them and they were all three bent and one was basically rendered useless. Besides the fact that they were bent, they were very poor quality. Would give it a zero if I could. I&#x27;ve made so many great purchases from Amazon, but this one was super lame. I&#x27;m never going to order anything internationally again.</li>
    <li> It was perfect they didn&#x27;t break and came exactly how it showed. The Bonus Rhinestones and Fimo Fruit and/or Flower Slices never arrived but I didn&#x27;t care for them I just wanted the dotting tools and stripers, I would buy from them again</li>
    <li> I just love these dotting &amp; striping tools! They&#x27;re inexpensive but get the job done for my nail art. They even threw in some cute little diamonds that my daughter loves!</li>
    <li> I got these for my granddaughter. She can&#x27;t wait to use them. I didn&#x27;t see anything I did not like about them.</li>
    <li> it has been very difficult finding fine brushes and stylus&#x27; to use with alcohol inks. these look like they&#x27;ll work beautifully.</li>
    <li> These did come as described, they do seem a little cheap but the price was cheap so I&#x27;m satisfied. I&#x27;ve used them a few times and I like them, I just hope they last!</li>
    <li> My 12 year old has been learning how to do nail art and asked for dotting pens.  I read the reviews on this product and I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the reviews.  But, my daughter insisted she \\&quot;needed\\&quot; them.  This product came fast and my daughter says she is very happy with them.  They of good quality and easy to clean. They are great tools to be used from learner to professional. I&#x27;m happy I made the purchase. Now, I get my nails done for free now and they look salon style. I get the same response from people \\&quot;I need an appointment with your daughter!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because I&#x27;m starting to do nail art and they work great, the dotting tools I use so much but the stripping brushes I haven&#x27;t use because they are too long, I had to buy shorter ones but they are in great condition and they are exactly what they are described as.</li>
    <li> Pleased with these items !!</li>
    <li> This product came in a very timely manner. The dotting tools are great, they are easy to clean and they come in various sizes and leave very clean dots. On the other hand, the stripers are okay. They fray really easily but luckily the nail polish keeps it in a thin brush. My blue striper shed a little on the second day I had them... Also I was cleaning off the brush (you can just dip it in acetone and whipe off the polish w/ a cotton ball)and the words that said Germany&#x27;s Finest Synthetic came off more easily than nail polish. The plastic of the stripers feels really cheap. All in all, save your money for a little bit better quality stripers but definitely get the dotting tools.</li>
    <li> I really love doing dots with these cute tools. Also the brushes are ok. I think the dot tools are worth it</li>
    <li> I got this for me and my little girl, we like the different size balls , as for the brushes we find it hard to controll them on how thick I line is or isn&#x27;t. (Sure we can get better at it)  the shipment was quick to quicker then what the seller said it would. Over all I think this is a great way to diy nail art</li>
    <li> going to try another review and if this place keeps telling me that my post is not good enough for them then i will just find another place to do online business with. I see no reason to attempt to force the buyer to write a certain amount of feedback in order for it to be posted and even then, they demand positive feedback, well what if the items are not that great? this is my issue. I SHOULD NOT BE ORDERED or FORCED TO POST A SPECIFIC TYPE OF FEEDBACK IF I DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT. Simple truth, if it is a good product that should be sufficient to post. If amazon keeps trying to order me to do specific things at their pleasure I will simply  go back to the previous online site that I was ordering from and ditch amazon completely. Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this in beginning December and it was here about a week early but I didn&#x27;t get my rhinestones and fimo fruit so I contacted to seller and they shipped me a new one. ONLY when it got here it was the wrong thing AGAIN! So hopefully this time they&#x27;ll get it right. Im giving this a three because the dotting tools and nail strippers are perfect! but if your looking for your bonus items good luck.</li>
    <li> The bristles of the brushes fall out easily and never completely clean of polish even when soaked over night in remover. Also create much thicker stripes than I desired.&lt;br /&gt;The dotting tools are great because of the 8 different sizes, very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This product is sooooooo fun and sooooo simple to use. I use it every week for a fun new design.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVED every piece!!! Amazing tools that get the job done would recommend to anyone looking to style up their nails</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are really cute, and they come in different sizes. Although the striping tools aren&#x27;t the most attractive, they work well, and I like them.</li>
    <li> I bought nail supply from this person and everything that I ordered came the day it said it was going to arrive. The only thing that I remembered on the page was that they were going to mail me also a pack of nail fruit designs and those didnt come with the order. They were free stuff. But other than that I did receive the stuff that I paid for. I would recommend them to other people.</li>
    <li> It was a month since i order this product and i still didnt get it. Not very happy.... happy new years!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping am just giving it 4 starts because the first time i used one of the dotting tools it broke but i will put some glue on it other than that good</li>
    <li> These were a great deal!  Super inexpensive and exactly what my daughter wanted.  I&#x27;ve used the dotters and stripers and they work like a charm.  One end of the dotter was broken when I opened the package, but no worries --- I just put a dab of glue on the end of the tip and stuck it back in.</li>
    <li> The marbling tips are made rather cheaply- one of the tips fell off right in the bottle. O m G. Z er&#x27;s. I had to super-glue it back on. UPDATE: Two of the tips have fallen off now! I actually pulled on all the rest of the tips, none of the others came off. I superglued this one on, too. If you get this set, be aware to pull on all the tips, and superglue them on. So minus a star for this set. Come on, they test or even glue the tips on? Bech, please. ; (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it took a few seconds and was easy enough. The marbling tips gave me the cutest marbled manicure on my toes ever; before, I wasn&#x27;t able to do something like that on my own. Also; they are perfect for making dots of different sizes. Be aware you may need to super-glue them back in place, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass of the marbling pens is really pretty &amp; nicer than that of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long brushes are great for applying glitter or dipping into bottles for designs. I&#x27;m not much of an artist; I may make a few stripes. I mostly use the to fish out glitter pieces. The brushes are perfect, long &amp; straight. The handles are cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A OK little set for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Also, I received no Fimo slices or rhinestones. If you&#x27;re gonna be so cheap about your product, you should really pony up on the free stuff, grasshopper. :((</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good over all if its your first set. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for a professional but Im no professional so they work for me, for now, I will get a better set of them soon though. My problems with this product was, first off, when I received it, before I even got to use it the medal ball from the green tool fell right out, I fixed it fairly easy with super glue though. Now, second problem, I never got either of the bonus items that I was supposed to get, now I contacted the seller and tey quickly sent me an email back saying that they were going to ship me a new order and I haven&#x27;t received it yet, its been about a week and half so theres still time for me to receive so after I receive it I will give this product another star.</li>
    <li> I use this for creating designs not only on my nails but on other surfaces too! I really enjoy using these beauty tools!</li>
    <li> i loved the dotting tools they were great. not cheap at all, good quality. i use them all the time. the brushes were not so great. they are extremely stiff and are hard to clean. i would recommend the dotting tools to anyone but not the brushes.</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly and is exactly what I wanted!  It&#x27;s great, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to do their own nail art!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cousin and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I loved the dotting tools and was very happy with them. However I was a little disappointed with the green nail striper because it was bent and the hairs will not stay together when pressed to the nail.</li>
    <li> dotting tools work great but the brushes are a bit cheap but for the price i paid works for me they took along time to get here cause they ship from japan i think that should of been listed when selling the item but over all very happy with them</li>
    <li> this is amazing for any age i love the different sizes for the dotting tool i love the thin striper,fimofruit AND RINESTONES.  I AM A NAIL ART PROFFESIONAL AND THIS IS THE BEST THING I EVER HAD. I USED  A TOOTH PICK FOR MY DOTTING TOOL AND A PIECE OF STRING BUT THESE TOOLS ARE AUESOME I AM EXITED TO OWN IT SOON ME AND MY FRIEND BOTH ORDERED ONE BUT I DIDNT GET MY SET BUT I USED IT A FEW TIMES  AND I HOPE MY SET ARIVES SOON WOW THATS A GREAT DEEL FOR YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> First of all, this came much faster than expected.  I was very pleased with that.  The dotting tools are cool-looking and are good quality.  Another thing I was pleased with was that it came with fimo fruit and rhinestones to decorate your nails with.  However, don&#x27;t order this expecting a huge pack of fimo fruit canes and tons of rhinestones.  It came with about ten slices of fimo fruit, about five types with two slices per type; and about ten rhinestones in different colors.  Basically enough to put all the slices on your fingernails in one sitting.  I don&#x27;t know if the types of fruit and colors of rhinestones are randomized.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use the brushes that came with the set yet; other reviews I have read for this product have mentioned that they are flimsy and come apart easily.  Although I haven&#x27;t used them, my advice would just be to be careful with them; pat them dry instead of pulling on the brush hairs.  But for the price of everything you get and the quality, I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Brushes are cheep they fell apart after first use.</li>
    <li> very awesome product.. the dotting tools are perfect and the brushes work well.. don&#x27;t get too excited about the bonus jewels and fimos though.. there are way less pieces than in the picture..</li>
    <li> Well the brushes arrived 4 days after ordering then with expedited shipping. They are in fine condition and seem durable so far. My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t receive the FIMO fruit or flower slices. So that&#x27;s disappointing but overall my order is pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> When i see bargains it&#x27;s a must buy,this duel was so affordable and so surprised it arrived in2 weeks. So fast i wasn&#x27;t expecting it.so i saw the good wrapping and open fast and started to do my tips,and i love doing designs and i can say these strippers do help make straight lines or whatever you want to go with them.looove them.</li>
    <li> The product itself is okay. Dotting tools have held up so far and I do agree with previous reviews that there really are not 10 different sizes. Some are very similar, so more like 6 sizes. Still, good for the price. I have yet to use the stripers. My biggest complaint is the shipping process. From the day the order shipped until it arrived was a grand total of 35 days. I thought this was absolutely insane, only plus side is the seller was very quick to respond after the initial email was sent asking why it is taking so long. Overall, good product, just took way too long to receive it.</li>
    <li> Love these ! They came before the shipping date  , my only complaint is that I did not receive the bonus items that came with these. Other than that I am a happy girl!</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, I do wish that there was more variation in the sizes of the dotting tools, but otherwise I am very pleased with what I got. Everything described was included. The dotting tools seem sturdy and strong, and nothing was damaged during shipping, as everything was very well packaged.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for dotting tools, these ones are not only cute, but they work pretty well. The stripers, however, are complete junk. The hairs split and they offer virtually no control. I&#x27;ve seen/used good stripers and these are just a waste of time. I gave this product three stars only for the price and the fact that the dotting tools were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: if you want dotting tools, look somewhere else because I think they sell them separately and cheaper at beauty supply stores, and they all pretty much do the job. ABSOLUTELY SKIP THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STRIPER SET. You will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a find!  I am using these a lot and the quality is so good!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these for everyone who needs art supplies...Try them!</li>
    <li> This set has just about every size ball end you could possibly want. Makes it very easy to create nail designs!</li>
    <li> Great tools!  Excellent price!  Shipped faster than anticipated.</li>
    <li> Dotting tools are great but the brushes are just okay. It took 2 months for me to get this product which it was supposed to take a month tops and then I wasn&#x27;t given the bonus items that it was supposed to come with. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> This was a nicer set than I expected, I bought it for a 9 yr old, but it would have been good for an adult.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to do all the cool new nail designs. Seem to be made well and easily cleaned up.</li>
    <li> Used it right away! Wish the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stain the brushes but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much! I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I do not believe these are sable brushes,  they are unbelivably stiff and hard to work with but I do like the marbalizers....</li>
    <li> Love them such a good deal for your money</li>
    <li> I love nail art and have been doing my own nails for 17 years.  The marbleizing pens are great for making polka dots. I&#x27;m hoping also for swirls too, I just haven&#x27;t gotten around to trying yet. **A note - in several reviews I read, people were complaining that there are not 10 different sizes as described. This is true, there are 5/6 (depending on how critical you are), but it honestly doesn&#x27;t matter. There is a big enough variety in what&#x27;s there, so don&#x27;t let that deter you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the detail brushes. Yes, they are made out of thin plastic, but I see no issue with sturdiness/durability and I have no issues cleaning them. Just put the nail polish remover on a cotton ball and wipe it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also true, there are not as many rhinestones and fimo fruit as what the pictures tell you, but there are plenty considering the price of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools in this set are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are just so-so quality (the bristles are actually fine, but the handles are really cheap and I dipped the brush tip in acetone to clean the brush off and part of the handle melted a little bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still couldn&#x27;t beat the deal though.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools are excellent, very high quality.  The brushes are just OK, they are difficult to clean and the bristles start to fray.  But they work for when you don&#x27;t have the striper built into the polish color that you need.</li>
    <li> I strarted doing designs when i do my nails. this helps a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;it works great, i truly enjoy doing the designs now ...</li>
    <li> The tips fell out the first time I used them. I will have to get some glue to fix them before I can use them.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED DOTTING TOOLS NOTHING MORE</li>
    <li> Dotting tools are cool and make great designs. The strippers are cheap and a pain to clean. So overall is an okay product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, my 9yr old can use it and create her own unique designs, she loves that she&#x27;s able to do her own nails and change them when she pleases</li>
    <li> The dotting tools worked great. I don&#x27;t do much brush work, but the few I have done the brushes work great. My daughter always gets complements on her cute nails. :)</li>
    <li> Was delivered sooner than expected. I think it&#x27;s a little pricey though. And the bonus rhinestones are just a very little packet of an assortment of stones that are not even worth mentioning since it&#x27;s so few.</li>
