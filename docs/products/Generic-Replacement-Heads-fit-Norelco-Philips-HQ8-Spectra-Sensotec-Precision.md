      <li>Not very sharp.</li>
      <li>Slight pull when you move the electric rasor across your fsce too fast.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery but blades were blunt from the start and not fit for purpose, pulling hairs more than cutting them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think they cut as well.  They do not have a full cutting circle</li>
    <li> these blades do no cut, Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not to good it is Generic but not even close to the real heads I have to get new original heads after a month</li>
    <li> Better than what I had ben using for many years. It&#x27;s all about the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery but blades were blunt from the start and not fit for purpose, pulling hairs more than cutting them. Advised that they needed to be run in!!! As a mechanical engineer I do not know of any cutting blades that get sharper with use?</li>
    <li> Work better than the last store bought replacement parts</li>
    <li> As others have commented, these blades are not sharp.  I actually get a closer shave from my old blades. Somewhat suspect these blades are used.</li>
    <li> they were bad. that&#x27;s why you refunded my cost</li>
    <li> Does not meet my requirements. And do not match the original product</li>
    <li> The heads were as promised and arrived in a timely manor.</li>
    <li> so far I can&#x27;t tell the difference from Norelco</li>

    <li> Had to return, I ordered the wrong item.</li>
    <li> No better than the ones I replaced. Junk!!!</li>
    <li> Replacing the old heads has cut my shaving time substantially as I&#x27;ve had the original heads on the shaver now for some time.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but they don&#x27;t cut worth a damn</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> While these blades fit into the unit well enough, they did not seem to be as sharp as I would have supposed. Consequently, they do not shave as well as the originals.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, great price--wonderful scervice---I was ready to buy a new one when I found the new blade replcement---work oy very good--saved the price of a new one</li>
    <li> absolutely worthless; they were no better than the used originals I had in the shaver. Poor mail packaging; may have contributed to the condition of the blades.</li>
    <li> They work, but not well. Not as close shave as the original ones, and the center &#x27;hub&#x27; came out of 2 of the three heads.</li>
    <li> Does not cut well. I had to buy a new shaver :-(</li>
    <li> Fit razor well very pleased</li>
    <li> Meets my needs for sure on my Wet/Dry Norelco shaver!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Fit is good, but the blades are rougher on skin than old ones.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest a laser cut on blades for better comfort.</li>
    <li> Easy replacement and shaves close</li>
    <li> These replacement heads do not seem to be as sharp as the ones furnished by Norelco,&lt;br /&gt;My next purchase of heads will definitely be those from Norelco.</li>
    <li> Great Value and shipped fast</li>
    <li> Difficult to install and pulled hair.</li>
    <li> no where as good as original but hey, these are the only ones available for my old razor</li>
    <li> VERY POOR QUALITY OLD ONES CUT BETER</li>
    <li> The purchase by mistake. Good for nothing. I dropped them</li>
    <li> They were worse than the  originals  needing replaced. Forced to buy new electric razor.</li>
    <li> After replacing the old heads with these I found the shave was not as I expected. I then reinstalled the old ones and the shave was closer.</li>
    <li> shaves worth than my 2 year old blades&lt;br /&gt;don&#x60;t guy it!</li>
    <li> Very dull and pulls hair bad...  Do not recommend these to anyone...  Would strongly suggest paying more and getting real blades...</li>
    <li> This was advertised as &amp;#34;fits all&amp;#34;.  That is not the case.  How do I process a refund?</li>
    <li> it pulls. replaced with old heads, no problem</li>
    <li> Just as good as the original Norelco heads.</li>
    <li> not as sharp as original blades. multiple passes and still need to shave again as not as close of shave as original.  do not fit well.</li>
    <li> I tried the replacements for a week and got better results going back to the old set.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I bought Norelco bu selected generic - bad move.</li>
    <li> They fir good and work well.</li>
    <li> These heads pull whiskers rather than cut them.  Not worth the savings.</li>
    <li> The blades (bottom row in the picture) worked fine but the outside ring didn&#x27;t work (top row in the picture).  He had to use the new blades and old parts that run over his face.  With all new parts, they just pulled the hair out.</li>
    <li> These blades pulled most of the hair out of my face.  What hair it didn&#x27;t pull out, it left.  After a couple of attempts, I threw the whole razor in the trash.</li>
    <li> Slight pull when you move the electric rasor across your fsce too fast.</li>
    <li> Seller is a prompt shipper. Product is junk. You could get a better shave by putting your face in a running weed eater. Shave was painful and I ended up reinstalling my old blades. Save your money!</li>
    <li> it just did not cut like the new ones</li>
    <li> love it when I get the item fast and exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Product did not meet expectations.  My husband said his old blades were better than new ones</li>
    <li> sure needed them thanks</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the price but they work and redeem my razor to shave well again.</li>
    <li> Instead of buying these, do yourself a real favor and get a different shaver with two rings of cutting blades on each head. Using a single for so long I just had no idea how much better those really are, quicker and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE GENERIC REPLACEMENT HEADS.  THEY ARE NOISY AND THEY PULL ON MY BEARD.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET A CLOSE SHAVE WITH THEM.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that they work properly. They don&#x27;t seem to turn as quickly.</li>
    <li> These arrived with no packaging or documentation whatsoever. Just three replacement heads in a small zip lock baggie. Just seemed fishy to me. I returned them so I can&#x27;t vouch for their quality on a shaver.</li>
    <li> Was not able to get a decent shave with replacement heads even after repeated circular motion method.&lt;br /&gt;I will not reorder or recommend the heads.</li>
    <li> Works well, but the first time I washed it out the middle part came off (ungluded)</li>

    <li> It arrived on time. Just what I needed</li>
    <li> Not the best.  I does not give me a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Fits into shaver but configuration doesn&#x27;t allow for best performance</li>
