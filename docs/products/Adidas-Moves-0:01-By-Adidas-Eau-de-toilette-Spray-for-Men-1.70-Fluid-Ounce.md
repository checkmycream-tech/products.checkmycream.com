      <li>The smells is great.</li>
      <li>Great smell.  </li>
      <li>Smells greats and the bottle is very nice quality.</li>
      <li>My fiance has loved this cologne for years and when he ran out I searched for it.  </li>
      <li>people lol :)</li>
      <li>I was so satisfied with my purchase!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just ok!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite smells for my man to wear, can&#x27;t find this size of bottle in stores, so I will be buying it every couple months for my fiancé to always have in his collection of cologne!</li>
      <li>This adidas smells so amazing on my hubbs.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>nice looking bottle also.</li>
      <li>This is a great smelling cologne, and is pretty inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>Lasts a reasonable amount of time and is quite attractive with a spicy, sporty scent</li>
      <li>No matter how many times you squirt this thing it won&#x27;t get any better.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s (and his girlfriend&#x27;s) favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ts a nice full size also.</li>
      <li>Anyways if you dont mind carrying it around in your car/office give it a go, its a good cologne; otherwise i recommend the Adidas Deep Energy which is really good</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of a mix between fresh &amp; spicy.</li>
      <li>so i can&#x27;t give it a 5 star, but it&#x27;s nice and definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s strong</li>
      <li>The Adidas moves has a great smell that you can wear not only for sports</li>
      <li>This is the only cologne our son wears, it smells very nice.</li>
      <li>small price awesome</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing smells great ladies love it as people said..and it does last long</li>
      <li>Not overpowering, light and fresh</li>
      <li>Not a bad smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong but does not last more than 4 hours if you are lucky to get that!</li>
      <li>Not too many places have this specific Adidas cologne 0:01 and the places that do cost much more.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s what you would expect from an Adidas scent - nothing too fancy, something fairly synthetic, but still nice overall, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>It has a good smell but maybe a little too strong.</li>
      <li>At this price its definitely worth a try though.</li>
      <li>It was bar none the best price I found for a bottle this big by a WIDE margin.</li>
      <li>its smooth yet lasts throughout the entire day and the ladies love it</li>
      <li>can notice the pear leaf right up front.</li>
      <li>You have the generic fresh summer scent that you get from many Adidas fragrances, but there is also a warmer, spicier collage to this as the fragrance wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping and exactly what my guy wanted.</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised that it was just fine.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it in a bigger size!!</li>
      <li>really like it ! .....</li>
      <li>if you put to much on and get into a car then you will have to lower the window or you and everyone else will get a headache from it!</li>
      <li>Great scent reminds me of a hard workout, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for date night but definetly great for post work out or after a game of basketball or football.</li>
      <li>but you can spray it everyday, the bottle is also pretty nice looking.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t readily find anymore.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing it really just depends on your body chemistry whether a sent lasts for you or not.</li>
      <li>better than 90% of the other stuff you&#x27;ll find for this price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s heavy glass with a plastic top.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cologne along with the Adidas Fresh Impact and the Adidas Deep Energy.  </li>
      <li>The violet is more noticeable and longer lasting than any of the other notes listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>AM001 is a fresh scent like virtually all other Adidas scents.</li>
      <li>Normally use Adidas Moves (blue) but tried this on a whim.  </li>

<li> Maybe I just get used to it, but I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts too long, especially when you&#x27;re outside for a long period of time.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long either.</li>
<li> The only problem as other reviewer mentioned is that it does not last long.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the size because I wish they offered the larger one at the same per ounce cost.  </li>
<li> i sprayed it once spent all day out</li>
<li> We&#x27;re thinking about trying some of the other scents as well.</li>
<li> If you really want to keep the smell you have to spray it at least twice a day which kinda sucks.  </li>
<li> Hard cologne to buy today</li>
<li> I thought that was gonna mean taking a risk that it had already started turning skunky the way colognes do after a couple of years of storage</li>

    <li> this stuff is amazing smells great ladies love it as people said..and it does last long i sprayed it once spent all day out side came home took my sweat shirt off the next day sweat shirt still smelt great like i just sprayed it again</li>
    <li> Bigger bottle small price awesome I know where to get my by husbands cologne now thanks. This is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> The smells is great. Maybe I just get used to it, but I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts too long, especially when you&#x27;re outside for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> Normally use Adidas Moves (blue) but tried this on a whim.  Received nothing but compliments.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t last an hour. No matter how many times you squirt this thing it won&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> What do you say? It was bar none the best price I found for a bottle this big by a WIDE margin. I thought that was gonna mean taking a risk that it had already started turning skunky the way colognes do after a couple of years of storage but I was pleasantly surprised that it was just fine. Showed up when it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining about this stuff lasting, I can wear it and still smell it hours after. I&#x27;m guessing it really just depends on your body chemistry whether a sent lasts for you or not. At this price its definitely worth a try though.</li>
    <li> This adidas smells so amazing on my hubbs. He likes it so much, uses it as his everyday wear. Not overpowering, light and fresh</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling cologne, and is pretty inexpensive.  Lasts a reasonable amount of time and is quite attractive with a spicy, sporty scent</li>
    <li> AM001 is a fresh scent like virtually all other Adidas scents. This one reminds me of their Adrenaline fragrance. It&#x27;s what you would expect from an Adidas scent - nothing too fancy, something fairly synthetic, but still nice overall, especially for the price. This one cost me about 20$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of a mix between fresh &amp; spicy. You have the generic fresh summer scent that you get from many Adidas fragrances, but there is also a warmer, spicier collage to this as the fragrance wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can notice the pear leaf right up front. Anything else it&#x27;s a bit too muddled. I can also smell the freesia and the violet. The violet is more noticeable and longer lasting than any of the other notes listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average sillage and longevity.</li>
    <li> This cologne is one of the best colognes i have ever bought. its smooth yet lasts throughout the entire day and the ladies love it</li>
    <li> This bottle lasted me for a while. It has a good smell but maybe a little too strong. It doesn&#x27;t last that long either. For the price, the quality is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne our son wears, it smells very nice. We&#x27;re thinking about trying some of the other scents as well.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and exactly what my guy wanted.</li>
    <li> My fiance has loved this cologne for years and when he ran out I searched for it.  Not too many places have this specific Adidas cologne 0:01 and the places that do cost much more.  My only complaint is the size because I wish they offered the larger one at the same per ounce cost.  Love it.  Also, Amazon once again messed up on my shipping so it took weeks to get!!  Not the products issue, only amazon.  Cant stand when people rate items based on Amazon flaws or amaziness.  PRODUCT review people lol :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne along with the Adidas Fresh Impact and the Adidas Deep Energy.  The Adidas moves has a great smell that you can wear not only for sports but you can spray it everyday, the bottle is also pretty nice looking. The only problem as other reviewer mentioned is that it does not last long. If you really want to keep the smell you have to spray it at least twice a day which kinda sucks.  Anyways if you dont mind carrying it around in your car/office give it a go, its a good cologne; otherwise i recommend the Adidas Deep Energy which is really good</li>
    <li> Thank you! I got this for my brother some years ago and he always went through the smaller bottles before the next Christmas came. So glad I found it in a bigger size!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne all the time.  BUT when I do, girls notice and  really like it ! .....and that&#x27;s all that matters. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite smells for my man to wear, can&#x27;t find this size of bottle in stores, so I will be buying it every couple months for my fiancé to always have in his collection of cologne!</li>
    <li> Smells greats and the bottle is very nice quality. It&#x27;s heavy glass with a plastic top. I&#x27;ts a nice full size also. Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> Hard cologne to buy today but it does not bother me since i wont be buying again once i am done with mine! if you put to much on and get into a car then you will have to lower the window or you and everyone else will get a headache from it! It&#x27;s strong but does not last more than 4 hours if you are lucky to get that! Not a bad smell but it&#x27;s strong and it&#x27;s just ok!</li>
    <li> Great scent reminds me of a hard workout, wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for date night but definetly great for post work out or after a game of basketball or football.</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t knock my socks off so i can&#x27;t give it a 5 star, but it&#x27;s nice and definitely worth the price. better than 90% of the other stuff you&#x27;ll find for this price. nice looking bottle also.</li>
    <li> I was so satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s (and his girlfriend&#x27;s) favorite scent. Can&#x27;t readily find anymore.</li>
