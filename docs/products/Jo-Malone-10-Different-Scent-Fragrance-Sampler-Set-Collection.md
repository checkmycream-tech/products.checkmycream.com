      <li>I love them..</li>
      <li>I love Orange blossom.</li>
      <li>I love being able to mix and match all the Jo Malone fragrances, so I order the samplers over and over.  </li>
      <li>Love the colognes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy there were several favorite samples which I have been looking for!</li>
      <li>And people always tells me that I always smell good, clean, fresh and viril.</li>
      <li>Beautiful scents, but they do not last on your skin.</li>
      <li>Love products and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>and they gave me e FREE</li>
      <li>and I enjoy trying all of them.  </li>
      <li>It was as if grabbed from cosmetic counter for free then sold.  </li>
      <li>Great assortment to try out the different scents.</li>
      <li>I could go to the mall and get this for free at the Jo Malone counter at Nordstrom.</li>
      <li>Received my order promptly, complete and in very cute packaging.</li>
      <li>Great combination of dark and light fragrances.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t decide which one to purchase and use daily, they are so good.  </li>
      <li>all sounded like they would be light and fresh and feminine, but they are not.  </li>
      <li>Thanks guys for creating something something special for people also special.</li>
      <li>I needed to know which fragrance to order and it was worth getting the samples .</li>
      <li>I love Jo Malone and the scents are incredible but too expensive for samples.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed getting to smell other scents, but many were what I could consider more masculine.  </li>
      <li>They all seem pretty one note.</li>
      <li>Will probably order more at a later date.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>you so much.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>My wife loves this and said these are the real deal</li>
      <li>Overall it is still a nice way to sample all these scents at a somewhat reasonable price, especially when there is no Jo Malone location near me.</li>
      <li>Not a bad thing just not very different from one another.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars only because I appreciate the idea of being able to try some of the various scents - I like grapefruit.  </li>
      <li>Only 4 stars, but only because I didn&#x27;t love all 10 fragrances....</li>
      <li>however, I&#x27;ve found that Jo Malone scents are incredibly strong and long lasting....</li>
      <li>I love having the small vials of Jo Malone scents to try out.  </li>
      <li>There are such a cool way to smell the different fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Have a rich scent, long lasting.</li>
      <li>Nice little set lets you preview several fragrances before purchasing a larger bottle or just carry 1-2 vials in your purse.</li>
      <li>My order arrived early, before estimated date of delivery.  </li>
      <li>Delivered really fast with 10 different fragrances~!  </li>
      <li>the scents in this particular sample set are very earthy and green as opposed to floral which is what I prefer.  </li>
      <li>Pictured packaging different so was surprised when arrived wrapped in tissue paper.  </li>

<li> I think the names of the scents were confusing.  </li>
<li> and it just happens that I am not a fan of the red roses scent :(</li>
<li> Two of the samples were broken and you couldn&#x27;t spray them.</li>
<li> Sorry, just not for me.</li>
<li> I was disappointed as I sent as a gift to someone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nice! Would have loved to receive a sample of Peony and Suede Blush though. Have received many compliments. This set is a great way to figure out which scents are right for you. Great combination of dark and light fragrances.</li>
    <li> Great assortment to try out the different scents. Loved this!</li>
    <li> I LOVE JO MALONE-----EXCELLENT ALWAYS,</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read it correctly, but I was eager to try the Orange Blossom and thought it would come in the packet of 10, so I could try others as well.  Instead I got duplicates of others.  Oh well.  I enjoyed getting to smell other scents, but many were what I could consider more masculine.  I don&#x27;t think I would recommend paying $25.  I went to Nordstrom and they gave me e FREE&lt;br /&gt;full viles of the Orange Blossom in the end.</li>
    <li> Good way to test a number of scents!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed all of the samples.  Will probably order more at a later date.</li>
    <li> I love Jo Malone and this was a nice way to sample many fragrances.</li>
    <li> Not very feminine scents.  More manly than I wish to smell.  I think the names of the scents were confusing.  Bluebells is probably the only one I will actually wear.  Orange, Nectarine, Lime, Pear, Freesia etc. all sounded like they would be light and fresh and feminine, but they are not.  They all have a very heavy, dark undertone that makes them smell like a man.  Sorry, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I received all 10 samples but got 2 of the Red Roses (from seller Beauty&amp;You) instead of 1 Lime Basil &amp; Mandarin, and it just happens that I am not a fan of the red roses scent :( Some samples might have been sitting there for a while as I can see a small portion being evaporated. Overall it is still a nice way to sample all these scents at a somewhat reasonable price, especially when there is no Jo Malone location near me.</li>
    <li> I love having the small vials of Jo Malone scents to try out.  Of of them are very nice and I enjoy trying all of them.  Also, they are a great size for my travel bag!</li>
    <li> Good set. They all seem pretty one note. Not a bad thing just not very different from one another. I did receive a rose scent that wasn&#x27;t listed in the description and as I loathe that smell it was definitely unwelcome.</li>
    <li> not all fragrances are my favorites but it&#x27;s a great way to choose a couple of them in order to buy a full bottle</li>
    <li> Great items shipped quickly and safely - perfect!</li>
    <li> Beautiful scents, but they do not last on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love them.. I ordered the  set for the grapefruit which I did not get , but after speaking with the company they informed me they would send me another set with the grapefruit. I would have given them 5 stars, but I&#x27;m waiting on the set with the grapefruit.  I will order again. Over all great customer service.</li>
    <li> Came in time and well packed. Great! thanks.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the variety</li>
    <li> Love products and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> A great way to try a variety of distinctive scents at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> nice fragrances, but I find it a bit pricey for a set of samples...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected in scents perspective but you do recieve enough to make a decision on which one is for your style</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and said these are the real deal</li>
    <li> Love the sample kit !</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars only because I appreciate the idea of being able to try some of the various scents - I like grapefruit.  Unfortunately, the scents did not stay on me very long.</li>
    <li> They truly are samples. I love Jo Malone and the scents are incredible but too expensive for samples. I could go to the mall and get this for free at the Jo Malone counter at Nordstrom.</li>
    <li> These are individual test pump sprays. These are great.</li>
    <li> I love this sampler.  All of the fragrances are amazing.  I can&#x27;t decide which one to purchase and use daily, they are so good.  Reeeeeally a great value.  thank you!!</li>
