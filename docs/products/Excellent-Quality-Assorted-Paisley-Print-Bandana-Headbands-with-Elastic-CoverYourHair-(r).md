      <li>Nice designs &amp; colors but way to small for an average size head.</li>
      <li>Happy with them and only complaint would be not able to choose colors as I wanted the Orange as shown and didn&#x27;t get.</li>
      <li>For general use they are fine - for a hard spin class they don&#x27;t soak up all the sweat.</li>
      <li>The colors I received were as pictured EXCEPT for the pink one,  which is the one I really wanted.</li>

<li> These are very nice for covering bad hair days!</li>
<li> Too wide of elastic in the back.</li>
<li> but I found them a little loose on my head they tend to slip off the back...</li>
<li> These scarves are for little children will not fit an adult head</li>
<li> The fit was very tight which made them useless to me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to seek them out in other colors.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
<li> are especially helpful to cover wig caps so that I don&#x27;t look all kinds of crazy on my way to performances and also don&#x27;t have to overheat wearing my wigs too early.</li>
<li> No fading &amp; elastic is not too tight.</li>
<li> I wish they were a little heavier material or had a terry lining</li>
<li> so I wear them everyday.</li>
<li> these are so small.....</li>
<li> and I have a small hat size.</li>
<li> Maybe I gave a small head</li>
<li> Poorly made, some were frayed when I got them, after one washing the black one was destroyed.  </li>
<li> Hard to keep on ur head.</li>
<li> It is a very very thin wire with a piece of paisley fabric stitched around it.</li>
<li> I received 1 very thin wire thing that looked nothing like the picture.  </li>
<li> I hated these.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I received 1 very thin wire thing that looked nothing like the picture.  It is a very very thin wire with a piece of paisley fabric stitched around it. I only received the 1 item not 5 not that it matters as I have no use for the one unless I get a giant loaf of bread and I can use it as a fancy twistie tie ))).  I did receive an email with return labels but had been so busy at work I forgot about printing them out so it&#x27;s my loss.  So, as for headband review, I can&#x27;t review something I didn&#x27;t receive.</li>
    <li> These are comfy and cute.</li>
    <li> these are so small.....probably would cover a baby&#x27;s head</li>
    <li> Best headbands! Keeps you cool.</li>
    <li> Nice designs &amp; colors but way to small for an average size head. The fit was very tight which made them useless to me.</li>
    <li> These bandanas were just what I was looking for. And they arrived quickly. Right price, too!</li>
    <li> Poorly made, some were frayed when I got them, after one washing the black one was destroyed.  I would not recommend these, find better made ones somewhere else.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These scarves are for little children will not fit an adult head and I have a small hat size. Good colors but should be a lot fuller.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite hair accessories. I&#x27;m going to seek them out in other colors.&lt;br /&gt;They are especially helpful to cover wig caps so that I don&#x27;t look all kinds of crazy on my way to performances and also don&#x27;t have to overheat wearing my wigs too early.</li>
    <li> Perfect for covering my scalp when in the sun! Love the colors and they wash beautifully! No fading &amp; elastic is not too tight. Would be perfect for motorcycle riding as well!</li>
    <li> Wear these to gym. They hold my hair back and catch perspiration perfectly.</li>
    <li> A river promptly, and fits great.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my daughter and she loved them.</li>
    <li> The colors I received were as pictured EXCEPT for the pink one,  which is the one I really wanted. They shipped me an aqua one instead. Still a good deal, would recommend them to my friends and will definitely order from them again when I need new ones.</li>
    <li> I hated these. Hard to keep on ur head. Too wide of elastic in the back.</li>
    <li> Maybe I gave a small head but I found them a little loose on my head they tend to slip off the back... Wish they would stay bunched together also but I can sew them, overall tho I like em!</li>
    <li> keep the hear out off my face</li>
    <li> Happy with them and only complaint would be not able to choose colors as I wanted the Orange as shown and didn&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok, a little big but no big deal. wish I was able to pick the colors. I especially wanted the orange and yellow and didn&#x27;t get those colors at all👎</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to get the red and black ones the most. They were included in the picture but were not in the package. The picture should accurately represent what is sent, or provide options to choose 5 colors.</li>
    <li> They slip off my head.</li>
    <li> I love my new headbands they fit so good and I have a big head. My hair is falling out so I wear them everyday.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These are just perfect!  I&#x27;ve already used one at the gym (accidentally discovered that they are machine washable) and one in the garden.  As the weather warms and my hair gets longer, they will come in VERY handy indeed!</li>
    <li> I really like the size of these, they fit nice and snug.  I wish they were a little heavier material or had a terry lining so they would absorb sweat a bit more.  For general use they are fine - for a hard spin class they don&#x27;t soak up all the sweat.</li>
    <li> These are nice but wish they were bigger. So far one of them was fraying when I opened it. They are comfortable under my helmet.</li>
    <li> box was open but product was fine</li>
    <li> GREAT!! LOVED them!! They are made nicely!! Could be priced better!!</li>
    <li> These are very nice for covering bad hair days!</li>
