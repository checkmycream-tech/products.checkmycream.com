### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I wish they could make the suction 2x stronger, but still I am very happy with the purchase and the results.</li>
      <li>does* work and works best after a shower and a 10-15 minute steam.  </li>
      <li>I did my best to guess and read all the reviews to help me figure out how to use it, and still it is not working at all.&lt;br /&gt;Returning</li>
      <li>Worked great for me.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, well-designed, and attractive.  </li>
      <li>Worked great first two times used but then stopped suctioning and cleaning, etc. has had no effect on it.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more suction.  </li>
      <li>I have now used this thing for about two weeks and feel I can leave a more informative review.  </li>
      <li>Pulled up junk from the pores in my nose better than a comedone extractor.</li>
      <li>I was waiting something better.</li>
      <li>It does not seem to be able to suck anything out from what I can tell.  </li>
      <li>I have found that it depends on your individual skin type (or even where on your face you plan to focus) and you should try each way to see which works best for you.  </li>
      <li>You will be able to see it.</li>
      <li>These are ok to use in the shower, so use it</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;re safe to use it in the US.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you steam the area or take a hot shower before you try it and keep the area moist so you can get good</li>
      <li>My resultshave been pretty good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, this device can be used easily in shower or at the sink.</li>
      <li>is the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased that solved my long-lasting, never ending and recurring black head problem over my T zone area.</li>
      <li>it will make your nose too smooth and reduce the effect.</li>
      <li>It is pretty good to be able to quickly and safely address clogged pores and the fact that I feel like I have to use it less often kind of goes to show that it is doing something.  </li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s an interesting... thing.  </li>
      <li>I use it once a week, and my nose feels incredibly clean.</li>
      <li>It took a while to figure it out, but once I did, it was my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for keeping my face looking and feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I returned it for a full refund.  </li>
      <li>First of all it&#x27;s quite easy to operate as I can&#x27;t read the instructions as it is an import item.</li>
      <li>The second day, I was better at using the thing and was able to clean the areas I couldnt figure out.  </li>
      <li>At that time your pores are open, and more easy to clean.</li>
      <li>product never fails to extract considerable amount of sebum (much more effective than peeling mask), and prevents new one from forming.</li>
      <li>Your pores will be very clean - especially your nose area - and your skin will take on a healthy &#x27;clean&#x27; glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inherited an older model of a Panasonic pore cleaner (the progressions pore cleaner) from a friend years a go.</li>
      <li>The directions are all in Japanese but you can work it out on your own.  </li>
      <li>is it worth it?  </li>
      <li>Use it as often as you need, but know that you will not be able to really see much of a difference until you&#x27;ve used it for a week or so.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Firstly, you must prepare your face by steaming, or wash with a hot shower to open up the pores to maximise the effect.&lt;br /&gt;Second, moisten the face before hand to allow effective &#x27;suction seal&#x27; between the device and skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works best on wet skin but also works on dry skin (for me).  </li>
      <li>If you try that, you&#x27;ll probably just end up with a little hickey with a blackhead in the middle of it and you won&#x27;t be very happy with  </li>
      <li>Regardless, this just does not have the strength to suck out blocked pores, even after a hot shower...</li>
      <li>This allows even distribution of suction force (to minimise damage to one fixed area) as well as &#x27;rubbing&#x27; or &#x27;mechanically disrupting&#x27; the trapped comediennes more effectively.</li>
      <li>First, The thing *</li>
      <li>I have done lots of research and read many reviews before I&#x27;ve finally decided to buy this product.</li>
      <li>It makes a funny noise to use.  </li>
      <li>I also love bizarre japanese gadgets and since japanese gadgets tend to actually be real appliances and not snake oil</li>
      <li>Operation is very simple (just on-off), and cleaning out is easy with the provided brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t help too much</li>
      <li>As you move it around your face, it&#x27;ll gently pull your skin and the edge of the &amp;#34;suction cup&amp;#34; will gently scrape the gunk that gets sucked out.</li>
      <li>It also much faster, safer and easier to use compared with mechanical extraction.</li>
      <li>very useful！Remember steam face first！</li>
      <li>After using this for several times, I&#x27;ve decided to write a detailed review on this.&lt;br /&gt;FORGET</li>
      <li>It works on my whole face.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping it would work.</li>
      <li>Really really hoping.</li>
      <li>Dry clean skin right out of the shower works wonders for me.  </li>
      <li>I have suffered from an overabundance of oil on my nose my entire life, and cleaning with good facial soaps have never been enough.</li>
      <li>Take a hot shower or really steam your face to open your pores and give this tool a shot.</li>
      <li>You can combine these with trying to use it with wet clean skin from the shower/steamer or dry clean skin.  </li>
      <li>If you have thin or sensitive skin (like you bruise easily or take meds that make you bruise easy)</li>
      <li>You most certainly should slowly move the thing around on your face (no hickeys!) and repeat in certain areas until you get everything.  </li>
      <li>are the ones I was hoping to clear out!</li>
      <li>my pores are pretty big and get clogged and &#x27;swollen&#x27; and</li>
      <li>To me, it is worth it as long as this device lasts over a year.</li>
      <li>This model has more suction and a different &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s essentially the same.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and pink.  </li>
      <li>Many reviewers say to use it with wet skin from the shower and not to dry your skin at all.  </li>
      <li>(i&#x27;m doing every other day).&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, it works best with open comediennes (or black heads) rather than closed comediennes (white heads) and acne.</li>
      <li>Wish that the information had said that I was going to be receiving a product from Japan that had absolutely zero English on the box or instructions.</li>
      <li>It has a decent amount of suction and does an alright job of getting rid of some of the smaller blackheads.</li>
      <li>but I guess from here on out, I&#x27;m going to have to be a little more careful about which of their products I purchase.</li>
      <li>It easily costs the same as a half facial.  </li>
      <li>They are fun but the cost of all those boxes would add up after one year to this odd device.   </li>
      <li>My nose is definitely smoother, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for some of the larger blemishes.</li>
      <li>Amazon will not take back as over 30 days old, so stuck with it.</li>
      <li>After the first day of using it I went to bed and noticed my pores were smaller and less inflamed the next day.  </li>
      <li>My pores are less inflamed, but not as much as I hoped.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> NO DIRECTIONS WITH UNIT</li>
    <li> Does not work. Returning it.</li>
    <li> I think some folks expect this to suck out the blackheads like some sort of star-trek gadget. If you try that, you&#x27;ll probably just end up with a little hickey with a blackhead in the middle of it and you won&#x27;t be very happy with  your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what you need to know about using this.&lt;br /&gt;1. use it like a vacuum over your wet skin. Don&#x27;t just hold it in one place. Move around. These are ok to use in the shower, so use it there.&lt;br /&gt;2. hold it so that it maintains suction. As you move it around your face, it&#x27;ll gently pull your skin and the edge of the &amp;#34;suction cup&amp;#34; will gently scrape the gunk that gets sucked out. You will be able to see it. It&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use it as often as you need, but know that you will not be able to really see much of a difference until you&#x27;ve used it for a week or so. Your pores will be very clean - especially your nose area - and your skin will take on a healthy &#x27;clean&#x27; glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inherited an older model of a Panasonic pore cleaner (the progressions pore cleaner) from a friend years a go. It took a while to figure it out, but once I did, it was my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for keeping my face looking and feeling clean. It eventually died and I&#x27;m finally replacing it. This model has more suction and a different &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s essentially the same. If you&#x27;re patient and make it part of your shower, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever got on without it.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping it would work. Really really hoping. It does not.&lt;br /&gt;The suction power is not enough to affect anything. There are also NO instructions in English. I did my best to guess and read all the reviews to help me figure out how to use it, and still it is not working at all.&lt;br /&gt;Returning it today.</li>
    <li> The lower ratings perhaps may be due to misuse... I have suffered from an overabundance of oil on my nose my entire life, and cleaning with good facial soaps have never been enough. Take a hot shower or really steam your face to open your pores and give this tool a shot. I use it once a week, and my nose feels incredibly clean. I have found that it gets quite a bit of junk out. I wish they could make the suction 2x stronger, but still I am very happy with the purchase and the results. The instructions are in Japanese, but they have pictures that make sense...</li>
    <li> very useful！Remember steam face first！</li>
    <li> Worked great first two times used but then stopped suctioning and cleaning, etc. has had no effect on it. Amazon will not take back as over 30 days old, so stuck with it. Every piece of similar gear has stopped working in essentially the same way. I think this needs to be built so it can be disassembled, cleaned, and put back together, but obviously the mfr does not want one to fiddle with it.</li>
    <li> First of all it&#x27;s quite easy to operate as I can&#x27;t read the instructions as it is an import item. It has a decent amount of suction and does an alright job of getting rid of some of the smaller blackheads. My nose is definitely smoother, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for some of the larger blemishes. It might help to steam well (around 20 minutes) before using. I don&#x27;t regret purchasing.</li>
    <li> The directions were in Japanese so I never used this product.  I returned it for a full refund.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help too much</li>
    <li> It works! I use it after steaming my face or taking a shower. At that time your pores are open, and more easy to clean. I don&#x27;t recommend using the mist spay，because it will make your nose too smooth and reduce the effect. And only use for nose, do not use it for other place, it will make you skin hurt.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  Returning it.</li>
    <li> I have done lots of research and read many reviews before I&#x27;ve finally decided to buy this product. After using this for several times, I&#x27;ve decided to write a detailed review on this.&lt;br /&gt;FORGET about all those expensive or self-proclaimed miracle face wash lotions that claim to cleanse pores or prevent black heads from forming because they never work.&lt;br /&gt;FORGET those nose pores or masks that peel off black heads that always &#x27;dry&#x27; our your skin, never removes everything especially at both sides of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;FORGET those dreaded mechanical extractors that &#x27;squeezes&#x27; out black heads that are inefficient, slow, and invariably lead to unsightly scarring.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased that solved my long-lasting, never ending and recurring black head problem over my T zone area. Over the years, NOTHING I mentioned above worked besides this little device. I think those who left very bad reviews must have used it wrongly.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, you must prepare your face by steaming, or wash with a hot shower to open up the pores to maximise the effect.&lt;br /&gt;Second, moisten the face before hand to allow effective &#x27;suction seal&#x27; between the device and skin.&lt;br /&gt;Third, you must constantly move the device around the skin that requires treatment rather than keeping it still at a constant spot. This allows even distribution of suction force (to minimise damage to one fixed area) as well as &#x27;rubbing&#x27; or &#x27;mechanically disrupting&#x27; the trapped comediennes more effectively. The mist function in my opinion is not crucial and you can just get away with moistening your skin beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, do not over treat. If comedienne problem is particularly bad, it may not be wise to extract everything in one single treatment because this increases the risk of skin damage or irritation. Give the skin a &#x27;rest&#x27; and repeat at a later time (i&#x27;m doing every other day).&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, it works best with open comediennes (or black heads) rather than closed comediennes (white heads) and acne. I would suggest avoiding using this machines on acne totally as it will increase the risk of trauma and hence unsightly scarring.&lt;br /&gt;This product never fails to extract considerable amount of sebum (much more effective than peeling mask), and prevents new one from forming. It also much faster, safer and easier to use compared with mechanical extraction. Even those difficult to reach areas can be cleaned out very well.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this device can be used easily in shower or at the sink. Operation is very simple (just on-off), and cleaning out is easy with the provided brush.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is rather expensive up front, in the long term it will save lots of hassles and money on masks / specialty soaps / facial treatment. It worths every penny and I&#x27;ll highly recommend anyone with recurrent open comedienne / black head problems.</li>
    <li> I was waiting something better.</li>
    <li> This is a preliminary review that I plan to update after two weeks of regular use.  These are just my initial observations and tips that I have learned in the two days of having the thing.  Background: my pores are pretty big and get clogged and &#x27;swollen&#x27; and I figured if I &#x27;cleaned&#x27; (or VACUUMED!) them regularly the swelling might diminish and then the pores might look smaller.  I also love bizarre japanese gadgets and since japanese gadgets tend to actually be real appliances and not snake oil I thought I would give it a shot.  First, it&#x27;s an interesting... thing.  It has a cap so it doesn&#x27;t scream gross pore thingey the second you see it.  It&#x27;s very pretty and pink.  It is easy to use, well-designed, and attractive.  It makes a funny noise to use.  The directions are all in Japanese but you can work it out on your own.  The power can take 100-120v so you&#x27;re safe to use it in the US.  There are two ways to use it: 1) dry 2) with spray function.  You can combine these with trying to use it with wet clean skin from the shower/steamer or dry clean skin.  Many reviewers say to use it with wet skin from the shower and not to dry your skin at all.  I have found that it depends on your individual skin type (or even where on your face you plan to focus) and you should try each way to see which works best for you.  There is a speed of movement that works, and even a pressure on the device.  For me, wet skin does less than nothing and the sprayer doesn&#x27;t help.  Dry clean skin right out of the shower works wonders for me.  Also, not pressing it to your face but letting the thing suck onto your skin works well (to be gross, like when you vacuum a bath mat not the carpet).  It works on my whole face.  You most certainly should slowly move the thing around on your face (no hickeys!) and repeat in certain areas until you get everything.  You have to work out the technique/speed/pressure/wet/dry/spray that works for your skin.  It&#x27;s going to be different for everyone.  My resultshave been pretty good.  After the first day of using it I went to bed and noticed my pores were smaller and less inflamed the next day.  The second day, I was better at using the thing and was able to clean the areas I couldnt figure out.  My pores looked smaller and were less inflamed, still.  I will see how regular use will affect my skin and update my review.  If you have thin or sensitive skin (like you bruise easily or take meds that make you bruise easy) you should not use this.  UPDATE: I have now used this thing for about two weeks and feel I can leave a more informative review.  First, The thing *does* work and works best after a shower and a 10-15 minute steam.  It works best on wet skin but also works on dry skin (for me).  My pores are less inflamed, but not as much as I hoped.  It is pretty good to be able to quickly and safely address clogged pores and the fact that I feel like I have to use it less often kind of goes to show that it is doing something.  DO NOT LEAVE IN ONE SPOT YOU WILL GET A HICKEY THERE.  I did it.  I felt silly.    It&#x27;s expensive... is it worth it?  Well, I compare it to my purchases of those pore strips which cost like 12 dollars per box (maybe a buck a strip).  They are fun but the cost of all those boxes would add up after one year to this odd device.   It easily costs the same as a half facial.  To me, it is worth it as long as this device lasts over a year.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me. Pulled up junk from the pores in my nose better than a comedone extractor. Make sure you steam the area or take a hot shower before you try it and keep the area moist so you can get good suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning.....DO NOT squeeze your nose to get the junk out of you pores. Read information here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_triangle_of_the_face</li>
    <li> Wish that the information had said that I was going to be receiving a product from Japan that had absolutely zero English on the box or instructions. Box and device both appeared to be old and outdated, also. Normally,Panasonic is one of my automatic go-to brands -- but I guess from here on out, I&#x27;m going to have to be a little more careful about which of their products I purchase.</li>
    <li> Tried to figure out how to use this based on other people&#x27;s reviews. Directions are in another language. Regardless, this just does not have the strength to suck out blocked pores, even after a hot shower...</li>
    <li> Does not work waste of money.</li>
    <li> It does not seem to be able to suck anything out from what I can tell.  Maybe my pores are not as big.  I do use it after shower which is recommended by comments earlier.</li>
    <li> It works ... sort of.  I followed the instructions I found online since the instructions and packaging were not in English.  I was hoping for more suction.  It gets the big black heads, but not the little ones and those are the ones I was hoping to clear out!</li>
    <li> Acceptable. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t work for my blackhead. It feels like it is designed for preventing not removing.</li>
    <li> Suction is a little weaker than my old one that stopped working.</li>
