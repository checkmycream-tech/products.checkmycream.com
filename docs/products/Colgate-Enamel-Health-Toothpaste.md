### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;There are a lot of toothpastes on the market so picking one that works best for you is a matter of trial and error.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve  been using Colgate Enamel Health Whitening toothpaste for about a week now, and am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>it the best thing ever?  </li>
      <li>My teeth look great!</li>
      <li>This product promises a great deal: prevents enamel erosion, whitens teeth, prevents cavities, freshens breath.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommended if you still have your own teeth!</li>
      <li>So far...so good.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste seems to do a good job.</li>
      <li>If enamel health is a primary concern for you though I think this variety of toothpaste from Colgate should be a very good choice.</li>
      <li>A fine product with a great taste and whitening property.</li>
      <li>I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
      <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Whitening may not be effective</li>
      <li>I see no reason based on my own use of it that would discourage you from trying it.</li>
      <li>She said effective whitening requires a prescription strength solution.  </li>
      <li>The mint flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering and it smells nice</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it very effective after eating onions, but otherwise, it was fine.</li>
      <li>Colgate has a great taste and leaves my mouth fresh for hours.</li>
      <li>Again, winning.</li>
      <li>I suppose if you brush your teeth more often your gums will be healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>I like the refreshing taste</li>
      <li>Colgate has always been my favorite brand of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste is one of many toothpastes to hit the market claiming whiter teeth.</li>
      <li>The taste was more peppermint-like, or perhaps it just seemed this way to me because I often use baking powder/peroxide formulas, which tend to detract from the mint flavor.  </li>
      <li>I make sure and wash my face immediately.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the paste keeps it from sticking and glopping to the container - and that&#x27;s winning for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love acidic foods so being sure I can protect them</li>
      <li>I can’t say for sure if my enamel is stronger or if my teeth are whiter.  </li>
      <li>My teeth did feel smoother after brushing, there wasn&#x27;t any of that grainy feeling you get with many</li>
      <li>...there is something that has always irritated me about many toothpastes and that is the texture and how it &amp;#34;holds up&amp;#34; to brushing.</li>
      <li>Anything beyond that will take more time.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste has nice fresh flavor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The Enamel Health toothpaste is presented in a clear attractive tube, that stands upright and has an easy grip for opening it.</li>
      <li>and I love the taste and the clean feeling it leaves my teeth.</li>
      <li>It foams up well and was easy to spread around my mouth to brush.</li>
      <li>The taste is not as pleasant as most toothpaste and if you have sensitive teeth you may even want to avoid  this even though it does leave your teeth feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I did love the clean mint taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is fine toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>, whatever is fine.</li>
      <li>No annoying two-step process to just cleaning your teeth.</li>
      <li>The product&#x27;s claimed benefits of promoting enamel health are important to me.</li>
      <li>Having recently undergone a thorough dental visit, including some scaling, as well as the acquisition of a high dollar electric toothbrush, I wanted to use the best toothpaste I could find.  </li>
      <li>The product description claims that ‘Colgate enamel health whitening&#x27;s unique formula strengthens and smoothes weakened enamel to make it healthier.</li>
      <li>If you’re not worried about damaging veneers, then give the Colgate clean mint enamel health whitening toothpaste a chance.  </li>
      <li>mouth feels clean and refreshed after each use and</li>
      <li>so I know I started with a clean mouth.</li>
      <li>I brush my teeth, and they are as clean as ever.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>The claims are not like others-- to clean, whiten, freshen breath, and now To strengthen enamel.  </li>
      <li>The Colgate clean mint enamel health whitening toothpaste is designed to care for your teeth while making them stronger and whiter.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to notice anything but a clean feeling</li>
      <li>I will say it has a decent taste, and certainly does a good job of cleaning teeth.</li>
      <li>My enamel has been more and more sensitive lately and this product showed up at a great time to test if things could get better.  </li>
      <li>one gets a full five stars from me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It might be good for some people, especially if you don&#x27;t have fluoride in your drinking water.  </li>
      <li>but I believe that seemed to be true.</li>
      <li>#1 not a bad taste, #2 did notice improvement with whitening</li>
      <li>Frankly I don&#x27;t care much about taste - mint is fine, coolness is fine</li>
      <li>This has a pleasant enough flavor, cleans my teeth well, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>The flavor is on the mild side, and I have not noticed any increased sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any increased sensitivity, and my teeth look nice, white and feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>The whitening and enamel enhancing features plus the fact that it&#x27;s made in the States make this one worth</li>
      <li>It does have a mild but pleasant taste, with little lingering aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used mostly Colgate and Crest toothpaste over the years, and haven&#x27;t found any significant difference between the two products, which includes their various varieties.  </li>
      <li>Not gritty, gets your teeth clean, and tastes OK.</li>
      <li>This not only helps with brushing, but also with making the tube itself more clean.</li>
      <li>Yes, it contains silica, this will smooth the tooth surface: I&#x27;m almost certain most brands of toothpaste contain this and can make the same claim.</li>
      <li>good thing to report is that it cleans well - maybe a little better than my regular toothpaste - Sensodyne.</li>
      <li>I was interested in the \\&quot;Enamel</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t attribute it to the toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed this even more so if I used Colgate Optic White.</li>
      <li>How exactly can you measure that, and review how well a tube of toothpaste does all of this.</li>
      <li>I suspect that this might be an over-reaching claim, but we&#x27;ll see if there is any more positive news to report when I visit the dentist for my next checkup this summer.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel more abrasive than regular toothpaste, but I can tell my teeth are gently buffed after using it.  </li>
      <li>Nothing to write home about, but comes pretty much as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste to be superior nor inferior to any other major brand on the market.</li>
      <li>Another good thing - the cap stays with the tube - doesn&#x27;t come off unless you&#x27;re really strong or careless.</li>
      <li>Very nice and helps prevent the mess that seems inevitable when it comes to toothpaste and tubes.</li>
      <li>Not that I could really notice.  </li>
      <li>the rest is really just marketing.</li>
      <li>My teeth have felt much smoother themselves which I take as an effect of the enamel benefits.  </li>
      <li>As it replenishes and polishes, it gently whitens teeth, while fighting cavities and freshening breath.’</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of strengthening enamel, I really can&#x27;t say.  </li>
      <li>I had been using Crest 3D White before getting this sample, and I have to say I prefer the taste and foaming action of Enamel Health better.  </li>
      <li>while I didn&#x27;t have any stains prior to using this toothpaste it is keeping my teeth nice and white.</li>
      <li>It does such a great job protecting my teeth from all the things I subject my teeth to!</li>
      <li>Yes it has a great (and light) minty coolness - but the selling point for me is that translucent white solid texture, which means less mess, and better mouthfeel for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After this many decades of products you really don&#x27;t differentiate on anything other than texture and taste.</li>
      <li>While only time will tell about the long term benefits of whitening and enamel protection, so far so good.</li>
      <li>If he says &amp;#34;yes, look at that healthy enamel you now have&amp;#34;, then I&#x27;ll amend this review and give the product its due.</li>
      <li>The taste is good, it did not cause any sensitivity for me, and it seems to work well at strengthening enamel and whitening slightly (although that&#x27;s harder to notice right away).  </li>
      <li>Whitening toothpastes have limited effect and may make teeth more sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Not quite impressed with this Colgate paste as this one has a bit of an unpleasant after taste.</li>
      <li>toothpaste will please you, and promises to be more than the average toothpaste.</li>
      <li>We usually use Colgate in our house and have always liked the flavor, texture, and results.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m wasting less of this product to the sink, and keeping more of it in my mouth for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Until then, I would recommend this product as a decent toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Health\\&quot; because as I have gotten older (now in my 40s), I have had increasing issues with my teeth, including cracks and cavities.  </li>
      <li>It is smooth not harsh, and you feel like something is actually happening (enamel repair maybe?).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but with a trusted brand like Colgate, one is more willing to believe it is possible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Colgate paste has a mild mint taste, it&#x27;s not overwhelming when you brush and the taste fades pretty quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would recommend Colgate enamel toothpaste. #1 not a bad taste, #2 did notice improvement with whitening</li>
    <li> The product description claims that ‘Colgate enamel health whitening&#x27;s unique formula strengthens and smoothes weakened enamel to make it healthier. As it replenishes and polishes, it gently whitens teeth, while fighting cavities and freshening breath.’ And though some who drink a lot of coffee may see whitening I do not. Yet with longer use and the very long list of ingredients used to make this tooth paste they may be trying to make this the all in one paste. It not only cleans and ‘whiteness’ your teeth but fills in rough spots making them feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have reported bad reactions to the toothpaste. I have yet to notice anything but a clean feeling but I am concerned if long use of this product would actually weaken your teeth. Every  one reacts differently to products and this is one I do not plan to use long term. The taste is not as pleasant as most toothpaste and if you have sensitive teeth you may even want to avoid  this even though it does leave your teeth feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using Colgate Enamel Health Whitening toothpaste for about a week now, and am very happy with it.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any increased sensitivity, and my teeth look nice, white and feeling clean.  I like that it is also protecting my enamel.</li>
    <li> A fine product with a great taste and whitening property. It is supposed to strengthen then enamel on your teeth, a claim that will be proven (or disproven) with my next trip to the dentist. I have used this to replace a toothpaste by another company that I was using for its whitening claims. If a whitening toothpaste can also strengthen your teeth, it would be foolish not to use it. The Colgate&#x27;s name played a part in my decision.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it whitens that well, definitely not as well as Crest 3D and there&#x27;s a minty burn that&#x27;s a bit harsh.  Not sure if it benefits your enamel but I wouldn&#x27;t  recommend.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has nice fresh flavor.  I noticed that my teeth became less sensitive.  Normally, I use Sensodyne, and when I switch to non-sensitive toothpastes, my teeth become sensitive again.  After switching to this toothpaste and using it twice a day for two weeks, I did not notice any increase in sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste to be superior nor inferior to any other major brand on the market. It&#x27;s main ingredient, sodium fluoride is found in every brand that I know of except one and when speaking to my rep about this there was no clear answer beyond sales talk. Yes, it contains silica, this will smooth the tooth surface: I&#x27;m almost certain most brands of toothpaste contain this and can make the same claim. I found no whitening ingredients in it. I had no problems with the taste though that&#x27;s subjective. It&#x27;s a fluoride toothpaste basically and it&#x27;s going to do its job the rest is really just marketing.</li>
    <li> Colgate can be hit or miss for me (I prefer Aquafresh) but I know that the enamel on my teeth is weak and I thought this could be a solution. Or help, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems odd to me that a toothpaste claims enamel help and whitening, because I am feel like that is contradictory - whitening toothpastes generally are more abrasive and scrape at your enamel to remove stains, while enamel health seems to add to your enamel. So I have no idea what this toothpaste actually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not a fan of the mint taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a CREST aficionado, but grateful to have the opportunity to try Cilgate Enamel Health.  I like the refreshing taste and it&#x27;s a supplement to my oral care, which also includes swishing daily with Organic EVO Coconut Oil.  This is NOT to restore enamel because as my dentist told me once you lose enamel it&#x27;s gone.  So this toothpaste is preventative.</li>
    <li> Colgate has always been my favorite brand of toothpaste. The new enamel health is now my only choice. It does such a great job protecting my teeth from all the things I subject my teeth to! I love acidic foods so being sure I can protect them is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> This product promises a great deal: prevents enamel erosion, whitens teeth, prevents cavities, freshens breath. How exactly can you measure that, and review how well a tube of toothpaste does all of this. I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but with a trusted brand like Colgate, one is more willing to believe it is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Enamel Health toothpaste is presented in a clear attractive tube, that stands upright and has an easy grip for opening it. Very nice and helps prevent the mess that seems inevitable when it comes to toothpaste and tubes. The sensation when brushing is similar to a polish being applied at the dentist. It is smooth not harsh, and you feel like something is actually happening (enamel repair maybe?). It&#x27;s hard to judge the whitening part but I believe that seemed to be true. I did love the clean mint taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste will please you, and promises to be more than the average toothpaste. It almost has me convinced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mostly Colgate and Crest toothpaste over the years, and haven&#x27;t found any significant difference between the two products, which includes their various varieties.  Having recently undergone a thorough dental visit, including some scaling, as well as the acquisition of a high dollar electric toothbrush, I wanted to use the best toothpaste I could find.  I had been using Crest 3D White before getting this sample, and I have to say I prefer the taste and foaming action of Enamel Health better.  It does have a mild but pleasant taste, with little lingering aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I am a bit concerned about the various substances in this product, especially the &#x27;hydrated silica&#x27; and the &#x27;microcrystalline cellulose&#x27;.  My dentist told me that some patients had adverse reactions to the microcrystals, and seemed to frown upon this additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this toothpaste does as good a job of whitening as any other, perhaps a little better, and I have not experienced the burning sensation other uses note.  As to whether or not it &amp;#34;replenishes&amp;#34; enamel, I have no idea.  I do intend to ask my dentist upon my next visit in a month.  If he says &amp;#34;yes, look at that healthy enamel you now have&amp;#34;, then I&#x27;ll amend this review and give the product its due.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste for a few weeks, but I doubt that is long enough to experience all the benefits. I wish the package stated &amp;#34;within X weeks&amp;#34; or something similar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste with a Sonicare toothbrush once or twice a day. Simultaneously, I&#x27;m using Sensodyne as I usually brush my teeth three times a day. This Colgate paste has a mild mint taste, it&#x27;s not overwhelming when you brush and the taste fades pretty quickly. I didn&#x27;t find it very effective after eating onions, but otherwise, it was fine. My teeth did feel smoother after brushing, there wasn&#x27;t any of that grainy feeling you get with many toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if this paste strengthens my enamel, but all indications are that it will have some impact. I have sensitive teeth, and some pain after an accident and some dental work, and the Colgate Enamel Whitening Paste did not cause any problems for me, so I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and see if there are some long term benefits.</li>
    <li> My teeth look great! There is a burning sensation on my lips when I&#x27;m done brushing. I make sure and wash my face immediately. I have noticed this even more so if I used Colgate Optic White. Please note NO WHERE on the packaging does it say it&#x27;s going to cure your sensitive teeth. It claims to strengthen them.</li>
    <li> The Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste is just not for me. The taste and consistency were just off putting. Colgate usually has outstanding products but I just don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
    <li> We usually use Colgate in our house and have always liked the flavor, texture, and results.  My enamel has been more and more sensitive lately and this product showed up at a great time to test if things could get better.  The claims are not like others-- to clean, whiten, freshen breath, and now To strengthen enamel.  The texture and flavor are not my favorite, the paste seems much slicker and almost like thick jelly. My teeth have felt much smoother themselves which I take as an effect of the enamel benefits.  My teeth were never as rough as the touchable image on the side of the box, but nonetheless I have noticed a change.</li>
    <li> I have traditionally been a user of Colgate Total because of a recommendation from my dentist. I stuck with it because I have had no negative reactions and assume that my dentist recommendation was enough proof. For the past week I&#x27;ve been trying a different variety of Colgate, the Enamel Health with Whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given this product four stars. First, I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects from using and and I find the taste pleasing enough. The product&#x27;s claimed benefits of promoting enamel health are important to me. I trust that Colgate delivers on this promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I will most likely switch back to Colgate Total based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation. If enamel health is a primary concern for you though I think this variety of toothpaste from Colgate should be a very good choice. I see no reason based on my own use of it that would discourage you from trying it.</li>
    <li> So far...so good. This has a pleasant enough flavor, cleans my teeth well, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I believe that calcium in my toothpaste can restore enamel, but I do like the way this toothpaste cleans my teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t feel more abrasive than regular toothpaste, but I can tell my teeth are gently buffed after using it.  And the cleanness seems to last longer that normal, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will look for this Colgate variety the next time I need to buy toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Minty without being overpowering. Claims enamel protection without a chalky aftertaste. No annoying two-step process to just cleaning your teeth. While only time will tell about the long term benefits of whitening and enamel protection, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I just had my teeth cleaned by the hygenist so I know I started with a clean mouth. I then made sure that I brushed at least twice a day for the few weeks I have had this toothpaste on my sink. The taste is &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; tasting - not real minty but I like it. The consistency is gell-like but not a pure gell and definitely not a traditional paste either. I never really saw a toothpaste with this consistency but I guess I have a lot to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing to report is that it cleans well - maybe a little better than my regular toothpaste - Sensodyne. Another good thing - the cap stays with the tube - doesn&#x27;t come off unless you&#x27;re really strong or careless. That&#x27;s cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the toothpaste is made in the USA. My wife is careful about made in China / Mexico / not-USA products so this one makes her smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of toothpastes on the market so picking one that works best for you is a matter of trial and error. The whitening and enamel enhancing features plus the fact that it&#x27;s made in the States make this one worth your consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you still have your own teeth!</li>
    <li> Not quite impressed with this Colgate paste as this one has a bit of an unpleasant after taste. My usual preference is the Colgate Total.</li>
    <li> Here we have some whitening toothpaste. I haven&#x27;t had it for too terribly long, so I can&#x27;t judge the long term effects. I will say it has a decent taste, and certainly does a good job of cleaning teeth. Anything beyond that will take more time.</li>
    <li> This is fine toothpaste.  Nothing to write home about, but comes pretty much as advertised.  The taste is good, it did not cause any sensitivity for me, and it seems to work well at strengthening enamel and whitening slightly (although that&#x27;s harder to notice right away).  I always shrug about these whitening toothpastes.  With only a few exceptions, the effect is so negligible that it&#x27;s almost the same as non-whitening, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  This would be a solid go-to option for someone looking for a reliable everyday toothpaste, but probably not a top end option if you are looking for super powerful whitening effect.</li>
    <li> The Colgate clean mint enamel health whitening toothpaste is designed to care for your teeth while making them stronger and whiter.  This toothpaste helps replenish weak enamel areas with natural calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to my dental hygienist about whitening toothpastes.  She said effective whitening requires a prescription strength solution.  Whitening toothpastes have limited effect and may make teeth more sensitive.  The whitening products, in a way, mimic a cleaning and only remove surface staining.  Additionally, she indicated whitening toothpastes may reduce the shine on veneers, making them appear dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colgate clean mint enamel health whitening toothpaste works the same as any other toothpaste on the market.  I get my teeth cleaned regularly, and brush daily.  The flavor is on the mild side, and I have not noticed any increased sensitivity.  I can’t say for sure if my enamel is stronger or if my teeth are whiter.  I feel as though the enamel strengthening and teeth whitening could be a marketing gimmick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though the enamel strengthening and teeth whitening could be a gimmick designed to differentiate from other toothpastes on the market.  If you’re not worried about damaging veneers, then give the Colgate clean mint enamel health whitening toothpaste a chance.  However I wouldn’t be willing to pay extra for these features unless my dentist recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Helps replenish natural calcium&lt;br /&gt;Gently polishes and whitens&lt;br /&gt;Fights cavities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Whitening may not be effective</li>
    <li> Colgate Enamel Health Whitening Toothpaste is one of many toothpastes to hit the market claiming whiter teeth. This might be the first time I&#x27;ve seen &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; on the packaging, and I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is supposed to get healthier.  I suppose if you brush your teeth more often your gums will be healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Well, of course it does.  I brush my teeth, and they are as clean as ever.&lt;br /&gt;Does it whiten?  Not that I could really notice.  I could have taken before and after pictures, but my teeth are actually really white anyways, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have noticed.  Based on the ingredient list, regular brushing with this should whiten your teeth somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;Is it the best thing ever?  Not really.  It must have a high sodium content (disclaimer:  I didn&#x27;t actually look) because it makes me really thirsty.&lt;br /&gt;Gone are the days when the toothpaste aisle consisted of Colgate, Crest, store brand, something else.  Now there are multiple sub headings, multiple flavors, multiple sizes.  All designed to take up shelf space in a &amp;#34;look at me, I must be the best!!&amp;#34; sort of way.  Not any different than any other product, but complicating my shopping.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad.  Not gritty, gets your teeth clean, and tastes OK.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this toothpaste.  It was too paste like for my taste. I know that sounds weird when talking about toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use a sensitivity toothpaste and after a few days I noticed that anything hot or cold was extremely sensitive in my mouth.  At first I didn&#x27;t attribute it to the toothpaste.  The I had my a-ha! moment and had to stop using the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be good for some people, especially if you don&#x27;t have fluoride in your drinking water.  This toothpaste just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> ****I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**** Colgate has a great taste and leaves my mouth fresh for hours. I have noticed a change in the brightening of my teeth as I am a tea drinker.</li>
    <li> Colgate is my usual brand of tooth paste, although I tend to shift amongst their many different varieties.  I was interested in the \\&quot;Enamel Health\\&quot; because as I have gotten older (now in my 40s), I have had increasing issues with my teeth, including cracks and cavities.  I have been told that I have porous teeth, a genetic issues, but I figured that using this toothpaste could not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other brands that I have tried, the consistency of this paste seemed thinner, or less dense.  The taste was more peppermint-like, or perhaps it just seemed this way to me because I often use baking powder/peroxide formulas, which tend to detract from the mint flavor.  Usage was pretty standard for a toothpaste:  it worked as expected, with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of strengthening enamel, I really can&#x27;t say.  I suspect that this might be an over-reaching claim, but we&#x27;ll see if there is any more positive news to report when I visit the dentist for my next checkup this summer.  Until then, I would recommend this product as a decent toothpaste.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something very specific about this toothpaste that really sold it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s usually hard to say - because it&#x27;s toothpaste. After this many decades of products you really don&#x27;t differentiate on anything other than texture and taste. They _all_ whiten your teeth. They _all_ are designed to remove plaque and stains. So companies seem to be almost desperate to switch things up so you&#x27;ll buy a new product. Look, we all use toothpaste (well hopefully) and as long as you&#x27;re using something consistently and seeing a dentist you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...there is something that has always irritated me about many toothpastes and that is the texture and how it &amp;#34;holds up&amp;#34; to brushing. Frankly I don&#x27;t care much about taste - mint is fine, coolness is fine, whatever is fine. But when I put the toothpaste on my toothbrush I want it to stay there and I want it to hold its consistency during the course of brushing and cleaning. That&#x27;s where this product from Colgate shines for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a translucent white colour, with a texture unlike other pastes I&#x27;ve tried. This not only helps with brushing, but also with making the tube itself more clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed any glops of toothpaste clinging to the dispenser. Every other toothpaste in a squeeze tube is a MESS - but this one isn&#x27;t. The consistency of the paste keeps it from sticking and glopping to the container - and that&#x27;s winning for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it in my mouth it doesn&#x27;t immediately break up and fall out into the sink. It holds together and clings to my teeth for brushing. Again, winning. I feel like I&#x27;m wasting less of this product to the sink, and keeping more of it in my mouth for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do realize that differentiating a toothpaste seems a bit strange these days - but this is a product I can actually say I would get again for no other reason than the texture/consistency of the product. Yes it has a great (and light) minty coolness - but the selling point for me is that translucent white solid texture, which means less mess, and better mouthfeel for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gets a full five stars from me.he selling point for me is that translucent white solid texture, which means less mess, and better mouthfeel for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gets a full five stars from me.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste seems to do a good job. The color, sparkly white, surprised me at first, but color is merely aesthetic, and doesn&#x27;t affect it&#x27;s ability to clean my teeth. It foams up well and was easy to spread around my mouth to brush. The mint flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering and it smells nice enough.&lt;br /&gt;I like the cap where it is flat and the toothpaste can sit on the counter upright taking up less space.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels clean and refreshed after each use and while I didn&#x27;t have any stains prior to using this toothpaste it is keeping my teeth nice and white.</li>
    <li> My family loves Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. I use this toothpaste three times a day and I love the taste and the clean feeling it leaves my teeth. I only use Colgate because its a name i can trust for no cavities.</li>
