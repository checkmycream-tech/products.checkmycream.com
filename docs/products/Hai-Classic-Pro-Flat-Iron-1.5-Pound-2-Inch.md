      <li>My hair look soft, straight, healthy and its fast and easy to straight my hair</li>
      <li>I bought this flat iron and really wanted to love it...but to be perfectly honest, the  Conair CS19TCS Professional Instant Heat Straightener did a better job and is about 50% the price of this one...</li>
      <li>Big and nice; heats fast.  </li>
      <li>My hair is thick and curly and this iron gives me straight beautiful hair.</li>

      <li>This is my second HAI flat iron, my first one lasted over 6 years until someone stole it.</li>
      <li>B002B8Y5R8 Hai Classic Pro Flat Iron, 1.5-Pound, 2 Inch</li>
      <li>So I have very long very curly hair</li>
      <li>different?\\&quot; \\&quot;something has changed\\&quot;---it&#x27;s my new flat iron.</li>
      <li>Second choice of price comparator for online shopping; prices beat Ulta and eBay offers.  </li>
      <li>While they manufacturer has a 1 year warranty, they no longer have this straightener and have offered me a smaller, less powerful, cheaper replacement.</li>
      <li>This flat iron is amazing--I get arrow straight (almost too straight) hair in very little time.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and was looking for an inexpensive flat iron for when I want  a different look.  </li>
      <li>MINE IS READY, NOW, IN A FOURTH OF THE TIME FROM PREVIOUS IRONS</li>
      <li>My daughter has thick, wavy hair &amp; this one not only straightens, but also does it quickly....</li>

    <li> I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  She used it 1 time and then the LED light quit working and it won&#x27;t heat up!  My daughter has coarse hair and it worked great the 1 time she used it!  I am trying to return it and possibly try the same brand again????</li>
    <li> The product is excellent..especially for the price I paid. My daughter uses it every morning to get ready for school and is done within 5 minutes (wavy hair). So I have very long very curly hair and my daughter decided she wanted to straighten mine. We were done in 20 minutes and it was very straight and not at all frizzy!! I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> So dissatisfied. I order this item and used it once. The one time I used it I loved it. The next day,it broke. Yes. It broke after 1 use. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I was torn between this one and the chi. I decided to buy this one because the plates are wider than the chi.  My hair is very thick, wavy and long.  This flat iron is better than the chi.  It left my hair sleek, silky, and straight.  The time it took to straighten was cut in half because of the heat and the size of the plates.  I will never go back to the chi! It is lightweight, has this slight extension at the end for your thumb and forefinger to apply extra pressure without feeling the heat.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> My hair look soft, straight, healthy and its fast and easy to straight my hair</li>
    <li> This item was in my cart for awhile and when I went to buy it, I noticed the price doubled. I think all the positive reviews are based on the lower price point. I will wait until it goes back down to order... it was half this price a month ago.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t catch hair between plates and straightens hair the first time!!! I bought this product because of the good reviews everyone else gave it and I have not been disappointed yet and you wont be either. Definitely more straightening power for less money and thats always a plus :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron has been worth the money.  I have fairly long, thick, colored hair and this iron leaves it straight and shiny.  It gets hot fast, and the 2in. width gets the job done a lot faster.  The Chi I bought at the salon quit working after ten months.  The Hai is great, and I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> FASTEST FLAT IRON IN HISTORY!3 MINUTES TOPS FOR EXTREMELY HEAVY, SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR! MINE IS READY, NOW, IN A FOURTH OF THE TIME FROM PREVIOUS IRONS</li>
    <li> I was so excited about ordering this flat iron because of the reviews I read.  And the price was inexpensive which was a bonus.  But it only lasted me 3 days!!!  After only using it a couple of times, the LED light stopped working and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up like before.  I returned it. How disappointing!!! :(</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, and still have co-worker&#x27;s coming up to me and asking \\&quot;what are you doing different?\\&quot; \\&quot;something has changed\\&quot;---it&#x27;s my new flat iron. Previously, I had spent $40-$50 per year on the most expensive flat iron at a big box retail store...those fail in comparison to this one. It heats up quickly, and gets my extremely thick, frizzy, wavy hair instantly straight in one to two pass throughs...for the first time ever, my hair is perfectly straight--and it stays that way from morning to night, even on very humid days. I highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> UPDATE - I am sad to say this straightener lasted LESS then 1 year. It recently shorted out and no longer works. While they manufacturer has a 1 year warranty, they no longer have this straightener and have offered me a smaller, less powerful, cheaper replacement. And they charge you for shipping both ways (which would add up to about $30). While this was a great straightener while it lasted, I would NEVER buy from HAI again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW - I have only had this straightener for about a week but I LOVE it! It heats up fast and it really does the job. I have a LOT of wavy hair thin hair. I can straighten my hair in less than 5 minutes with this straightener, where my previous straightener (a Babyliss) would take at least twice as long. LOVE this straightener!</li>
    <li> Previoisly owned a cheap iron purchased from walmart.  This product is by far superior and worth the money.  The iron heats quickly, doesn&#x27;t catch/snag hair, and only need to pass through the hair once.</li>
    <li> I have several flat irons &amp; none are anywhere near as effective as this one. My daughter has thick, wavy hair &amp; this one not only straightens, but also does it quickly....great product. Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and was looking for an inexpensive flat iron for when I want  a different look.  This flat iron is amazing--I get arrow straight (almost too straight) hair in very little time.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd HAI flat iron. Each of them have lasted about 5-6 years. I was delighted to find this item priced so low through Amazon. The wire begins to split or disconnect if you fold and curl it around the iron (when storing), so be careful to take care of the cord.</li>
    <li> Likes:  Bargain shopping for flat iron shopping.  Second choice of price comparator for online shopping; prices beat Ulta and eBay offers.  Free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:  None.</li>
    <li> The ceramic plates glide very smoothly over my hair and get it very straight. Given the chunky, cheap appearance of the iron itself, I was surprised at how wonderfully it straightens. I got this to replace a my very elegant but 12-year old Hai after trying and discarding a different brand that felt like it was catching on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a pretty device, but you will like the way it makes  your hair look.</li>
    <li> Love it! Finally happy</li>
    <li> its work so good, i love it</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and straightens well, however, because the blades do not close properly I had to take thicker hair partings. the hair which touched the bottom blade and the hair that touched the top blade straightened well but the hair in between wasn&#x27;t sleek enough since it did not get enough heat which made it so that I had to pass the iron a few times which is a bit difficult when working on the hair behind your head.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY ITTTTTTTT&lt;br /&gt;VERY BAD I want my money back :(</li>
    <li> Big and nice; heats fast.  This brand is great on thick hair.</li>
    <li> fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love it! keeps my hair super stright and shiny!! I have prettty wavy hair and it does the job even in the humidity! i also love the long cord</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever used. My stylist uses this brand (different model) in his salon and recommended I buy one and toss my Chi in the garbage.  I&#x27;ve had several Hot Tools Pro and Chi irons, The Hot Tools irons don&#x27;t last very long and the Chi irons are over-priced for the quality. This iron heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t snag my ends.  You can&#x27;t beat this price anywhere else, 36 bucks WOW!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for a similar model (same brand) for my wife. She loves it. Highly recommended. She loves the results and so do I.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because of the reviews i saw, and i dont regret it! its a good flat iron, I have long, coarse, frizzy hair. With my last flat iron it took me like an hour to get it flat and it didnt even lasted so long, but since i&#x27;m using this HAI-2 flat iron i spend like 30-40 minutes and it last flat for hours!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the original price for this iron is $260!!!! ...but I only paid $35.00 for it here and it is def worth it!!  this iron is far better than my chi</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY brand of Hair Straightener that works and last both the hair style and the tool itself. Pay the extra money. I may be on my second one but the first lasted like 10 yrs.</li>
    <li> this is a great flat iron.  It heats up super fast and works really well.  Out of all of the expensive brands we have bought over the years we rate this one as one of the best we have used.</li>
    <li> Love love love my new straightener! Goes through my hair like silk and leaves it shiny! Love the long cord. I know this doesn&#x27;t seem like a big selling point but my outlet is above my head in my bathroom....my last straightener used to come UN plugged all the time. Very annoying. The only downfall I have with this product is there is no automatic shut off not a problem for me but I can see it being an issue for other users.</li>
    <li> Hai flat irons have been my go to for the last 10 years. I&#x27;ve had two other Hai flat irons (the older version of the 2&amp;#34; inch sold above). After a very sad parting with my last Hai involving a bad UK power converter and flames (not the flat irons fault), I went seeking a replacement. The older version is no longer available, but the 2&amp;#34; tourmaline is fantastic and dare I say better than the last. It&#x27;s inexpensive, heats up quickly and leaves you with silky manageable hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron so much I bought a second one 2 years later. My hair is thick and curly and this iron gives me straight beautiful hair. If you are looking for a straightener that gives amazing results this is a must buy. Believe me you won&#x27;t be disappointed. If I could have had this in my high school years life would have been a lot easier. Love love love this product. The first one I bought was for my daughter and I was afraid of life without it do  I purchased a second. Both work great!</li>
    <li> This is my second HAI flat iron, my first one lasted over 6 years until someone stole it. So i purchased this one and after 6 months the switch broke so it doesn&#x27;t stay on while using it. It did work great and I do take really good care of it not even sure how the switch broke but it just moves back and forth and I have to keep turning it back to the on position when using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent i love this brand of flat iron . I got them on time</li>
    <li> Gets super hot and the wide flattening panels are key when you want to straighten long, curly hair.</li>
</ol>
