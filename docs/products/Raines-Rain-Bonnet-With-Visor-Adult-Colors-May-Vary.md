<li> A little pricey for shipping, but had to purchase for my 68 year old mother who needed it.  </li>
<li> Actually nicer than I expected for the price!  </li>
<li> now it s dry</li>
<li> ade was getting wet  </li>
<li> My package was opened and it was pink.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> so my last resort was amazon.com thinking it was too small an item.</li>

<li> wish they still came in a small plastic pouch but a small plastic bag works well to keep in your purse.</li>
<li> i could not find these rain hats in any of the usual places here in the tampa bay area.</li>
<li> I am amazed that they are not easily avilable here--but they aren&#x27;t!!</li>
