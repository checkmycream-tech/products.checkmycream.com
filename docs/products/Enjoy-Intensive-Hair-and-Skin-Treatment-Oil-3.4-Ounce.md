      <li>The gold star oil is a little cheaper, and does a great joy too.  </li>
      <li>I like this one more then the Moroccan oil because it does not contain sulfates, and since you do not rinse this oil out it is important that you do not put sulfates into your hair.</li>
      <li>I love Enjoy when I straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>The regular is great.</li>
      <li>enjoy products rock.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel treaty, has a light feel but makes my curly hair feel softer.</li>
      <li>but the ENJOY wasn&#x27;t greasy and my hair felt as light as a feather.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In conjunction with the rest of my Enjoy products that I use</li>
      <li>hold a candle to this Enjoy product.</li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny &amp; feels silky smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a rich product that nourishes my hair...</li>
      <li>Another cool thing is that, if you have some leftover on your hands, you can just smooth it into your skin.  </li>
      <li>Honestly though, there&#x27;s no proof, so I&#x27;m stuck with it until it runs out because I can&#x27;t justify buying a new bottle at this price.</li>
      <li>You only need a dime to nickel size amount for this amazing product to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells, and this has a nice citrus scent that disappears.  </li>
      <li>intense version smells better.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for almost 4 years now, and it has helped my hair tremendously.</li>
      <li>I say it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>you can tell the difference, but both worth the $.</li>
      <li>I love the Enjoy INTENSIVE Hair and Skin Oil product with the red star.</li>
      <li>The product was shipped right away, received it in 3 days even though the website indicated it would not be shipped for two weeks.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser reccommended this to me to help my hair dry more quickly and generally look better.</li>
      <li>It works from the first use.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on the recommendation of a clerk at Beauty First.  </li>
      <li>I can tell the difference in drying time and the way my hair feels to the hand when i don&#x27;t use this, and using it definitely gets me quicker drying and a better hand feel.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to smooth down the top layer of my hair.  </li>
      <li>This oil not only keeps the frizz down, it also makes the hair soft, and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>I really like this product for my hair.  </li>
      <li>so this oil is very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Intensive leaves my hair clumpy, and did not use too much.</li>
      <li>My hair is super soft and natural looking.  </li>
      <li>I use just a tiny bit in my super processed and color damaged hair every night.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product several times, and this was the first time the color of the product was very off --</li>
      <li>usually the oil is bright yellow, this oil was nearly clear -- leading me to wornder if a substandard substitute product had been put into a labeled glass bottle.</li>
      <li>this is my hair splurge product that i cannot live without.</li>
      <li>The bottle lasts me a long time and is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>This makes your scalp and your hair soft!  </li>
      <li>I have long curly hair that tends to get dry as I work outside in all the elements, this stuff replenishes moisture and makes my hair feel amazing.  </li>
      <li>My brother started using it on his legs (psoriasis) and within a week it was all clear.  </li>
      <li>Much thicker than the regular formula, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in the results for my hair.  </li>
      <li>The only Con is that it&#x27;s not all natural, it does contain a lot of chemicals.</li>
      <li>this size bottle and with how much you use, it lasts for a long time!!!!</li>

<li> I have very crazy hair, and it calms it down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have think curly hair and this products does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times, and this was the first time the color of the product was very off -- usually the oil is bright yellow, this oil was nearly clear -- leading me to wornder if a substandard substitute product had been put into a labeled glass bottle. It seems to be working okay, but the look and the smell of this product (from this vendor) has me a bit suspcious. Honestly though, there&#x27;s no proof, so I&#x27;m stuck with it until it runs out because I can&#x27;t justify buying a new bottle at this price. Boo.</li>
    <li> I have thin dry hair and I usually apply a little bit of oil only on the end part of my hair, after i take a shower or whenever I feel like my hair is getting dry. I like this one more then the Moroccan oil because it does not contain sulfates, and since you do not rinse this oil out it is important that you do not put sulfates into your hair. It smells very good, and the bottle is cute. A little hard to get the oil out but no big deal. I usually put too much on my hand but i just rub in into my hands and even on my face and it makes your skin feel amazing! I have dry skin and dry hair and I wish I could take a bath in this stuff sometimes. I gave a bottle to my husband and he uses it on his hair as well, instead of the hair products. He used to have flaky skin on his scalp but this oil solved the problem! ENJOY!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The only Con is that it&#x27;s not all natural, it does contain a lot of chemicals. I would like to try 100% argan oil and see how it works...</li>
    <li> I love the Enjoy INTENSIVE Hair and Skin Oil product with the red star. However,  l was disappointed when l didn&#x27;t receive this right product. I got the one with the gold star. There was not contact information in the package.</li>
    <li> This product keeps your hair healthy. And this provider has the best price. Glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a clerk at Beauty First.  I was looking for something to smooth down the top layer of my hair.  When she told me it was an oil, I was instantly turned off (visions of my mom&#x27;s VO5 from my childhood).  But when I tried it, I was really pleased.  I only need a dime-sized drop for my chin-length hair.  My hair is super soft and natural looking.  And -- bonus! -- no static, even though it&#x27;s winter and I wear my hat.  Another cool thing is that, if you have some leftover on your hands, you can just smooth it into your skin.  I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells, and this has a nice citrus scent that disappears.  I say it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love Enjoy when I straighten my hair. Cuts the time in half and leaves it less frizzy and adds shine. The product was shipped right away, received it in 3 days even though the website indicated it would not be shipped for two weeks. Love the product!!</li>
    <li> This makes your scalp and your hair soft!  The seller sold it for an excellent price.  Even my hairdresser said she couldn&#x27;t get at the price I got it for through her beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! You only need a dime to nickel size amount for this amazing product to work it&#x27;s magic. My hair looks shiny &amp; feels silky smooth. I tried Moroccan Oil and it left my hair greasy &amp; heavy but the ENJOY wasn&#x27;t greasy and my hair felt as light as a feather.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my hair!!! I have a lot of hair and it is on the course side so this oil is very helpful.  After washing and towel drying I put about a dime size dot on my hands and rub together.  Flip my hair upside down and start working the oil into the tips of my hair.  It helps give it moisture, protection and calmness to my hair!!! and it doesnt have an annoying smell either!!! this size bottle and with how much you use, it lasts for a long time!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. I use just a tiny bit in my super processed and color damaged hair every night. It keeps my hair from being uber brittle and dry. The bottle lasts me a long time and is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this oil when I&#x27;m in the treat my hair/spoil it mood.  This is a rich product that nourishes my hair...well made/smells great.  Yes it&#x27;s a little  pricey but definitely in lines with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conjunction with the rest of my Enjoy products that I use I have nothing but great things to say.  The gold star oil is a little cheaper, and does a great joy too.  I order via best deal at the moment between the two.  The red star is thicker though...you can tell the difference, but both worth the $.</li>
    <li> Works well but the effects don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I prefer the regular (lighter treatment) Hair &amp; SkinTreatment Oil. Intensive leaves my hair clumpy, and did not use too much.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have been using it for almost 4 years now, and it has helped my hair tremendously. It was recommended to me by a hair stylist. My hair dries a lot quicker as well. It is a little on the pricier side, but it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and this works great.</li>
    <li> intense version smells better. bought two. this is my hair splurge product that i cannot live without. enjoy products rock.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff!  I have been using this Enjoy Intensive Hair and Skin Trmt Oil for years now, and I find Amazon is the best place to get it, for me.  I have tried several &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; products and none hold a candle to this Enjoy product. I have long curly hair that tends to get dry as I work outside in all the elements, this stuff replenishes moisture and makes my hair feel amazing.  A little goes a long way so one bottle lasts me 6 months or so.  Great stuff, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> keeps away frizz in the tropics a must-have for anybody effected by moisture in the air- with lots of shine</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel treaty, has a light feel but makes my curly hair feel softer.</li>
    <li> This stuff has helped my hair immensely! It works from the first use.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Used sparingly, this intensive leave in treatment leaves your hair shiny and manageable with less frizz, helps it dry a little faster and is nourishing. Great seller. Arrived quickly and loved that track and confirm sent a text to my phone letting me know when it had been delivered.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. My hair dresser gave me a sample. We live in a humid climate and it is hard to keep my hair not frizzy. This oil not only keeps the frizz down, it also makes the hair soft, and smells wonderful. It is a small bottle, but very little is needed when you apply it. After applying it I always use the left over on my arms. It makes for a great body oil too.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great I have very crazy hair, and it calms it down. In the stores it was twice the amount</li>
    <li> I started using this about 2 years ago and haven&#x27;t stopped! It&#x27;s the best heat protectant for your hair, love a lot of the Enjoy line.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair.  My hair is dry and just a little of this goes a long way. Use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Very gluey and hard to get absorbed.I should probably be used with gloves. I would not buy the &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34;again. The regular is great.</li>
    <li> This oil treatment feels good on my scalp, makes my hair shiny, and  has a wonderful natural fragrance. I love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product works perfectly with my hair.  This and the Kenra Blow Dry Spray is the prefect combo.</li>
    <li> Just buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!! I use it all the time and protects from heat styling.  Just a little goes a long way and makes your hair silky soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must for me. It keeps my ends hydrated and from splitting like crazy. Love the smell and you can&#x27;t beat the price. My hair is thick, wavy, and I&#x27;ve got a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Sounds crazy but I have been using this for my scalp Psoriasis.  My brother started using it on his legs (psoriasis) and within a week it was all clear.  it does not have a greasy feeling.  I love putting it on my elbows as well</li>
    <li> Much thicker than the regular formula, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in the results for my hair.  Still I like the product but will probably go back to the non intensive formula.  Great to put on your arms and legs for a silky finish.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser reccommended this to me to help my hair dry more quickly and generally look better. I can tell the difference in drying time and the way my hair feels to the hand when i don&#x27;t use this, and using it definitely gets me quicker drying and a better hand feel.</li>
