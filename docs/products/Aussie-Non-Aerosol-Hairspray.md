<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Aussie products for quite some time. Their products are affordable without sacrificing quality, and that&#x27;s what I love about them most! The Aussie Sprunch Hairspray did not disappoint; it was so easy to use and lasted a long day spent running errands. The Sprunch gave me just the wavy volume I was looking for. I am definitely pleased with this product and will continue using it for the long run.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product. The product had a great smell sprayed on my hair easily. The spray kept my hair in place neat no frizz at all. The curls stayed in place all day. I was very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Aussie Sprunch spray!! I use it whenever I scrunch my hair I just flip my wet hair upside down spray and scrunch! It also works on day 2 if your scrunched look looks squashed just spray the Sprunch spray in and scrunch again and your day 2 looks just as good as day 3!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product I have used it for years and would recommend it to anyone with wavy/curly hair. If you need a product to help hold your curls or waves this will definitely do it. I wash and pat dry my hair then apply this product to my damp hair and it holds my curls all day long. Thanks Influenster for allowing me test my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> The Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol Hairspray is great for everyday use. The hold isn&#x27;t that strong, but I like it for what it is. I have wavy hair that I want to still be able to move after spraying it. This helps me keep my waves, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or firm. It&#x27;s great and I recommend it to others looking for a bit of hold, but not stiff hold.</li>
    <li> I have big think wavy curly crazy hair. It takes something good to contain it. I used this product after a good wash, a little bit of raw coconut oil to moisten, then I prayed the Sprunch while still a little wet. I let it air dry, and BAM beautiful hair. It is very helpful, keeping my hair where I want it. Being a MOM I do not need my hair in my face, and I need an easy way to look presentable. This is a great recommended product!</li>
    <li> The best curl definer! I love this stuff. I have naturally frizzy hair and this stuff holds mt curl and smooths it down even in the humid florida heat my curls stay put!!</li>
    <li> I received this in a box box complimentary from influenster and have used it since on both my toddlers hair and my hair whish is naturally curly. It has helped keep the curl and has helped give the curls a little more bounce to them and has helped with the frizz. It is well worth it and does what it is intended to do just spare scrunch your hair and go and we quill continue to use! Much better than gel!</li>
    <li> The Aussie Sprunch is SO much better than any spray gel I have used, it holds my style, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all hard and feeling like it will break if I touch it!!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best hairsprays that I can recommend to any curly girl. It has amazing hold and keeps your hair shiny, frizz-free, and gorgeous. I find that the Aussie line has made amazing products that are sticky free for curly girls. I also love the fact that they have amazing scent to all of their products. No point in putting on perfume if your hair smells this great.</li>
    <li> Totally loved this product!! I have thick wavy hair and I love to curl my hair daily. This product left my curls soft but my hair stayed in place. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. Its very hard for me to find a spray that doesn&#x27;t make my thick curly hair crispy or dready. It has a great smell and works best when I spray it into my hair went its still wet more than damp. It holds throughout the day which is really important to me. I was given this product complimentary to review for Influenster but I would continue to purchase this product in the future because it works so well</li>
    <li> Great stuff, it keeps my fly-aways in check without leaving my hair feeling stiff or crunchy. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and is gentle enough I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the sprunch hair spray for my hair. It gives me flexibility and keeps the frizz away. I have naturally curly hair and the sprunch hair spray holds my curls without making them feel crunchy and I love that about it. I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have extremely frizzy and curly hair. This scrunch spray allows me to tame the frizz and keep my curls intact without the feeling of crunchy. The only con of this product for me is the smell. It&#x27;s not my favorite but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;*&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;However the thoughts and opinions are my own and honest!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for thick curly hair. There aren&#x27;t many products that work well for me but this is definitely one of them. It gives me just enough hold and lasts all day and the next day! I have been very happy with it so far. I also like the pump nozzle because I can use just the right amount and put it right where I want it.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of scrunch/curl products over the years but this was my first time using Aussie sprunch spray and I must say it is awesome! I used a little mousse with it and I was good to go all day! No frizz, no fly aways, nothing! I definitely think I have found a new favorite!!</li>
    <li> I love Aussie Sprunch spray. My hair is naturally wavy so when I don&#x27;t have time to dry my hair I just use this sprunch spray on my hair to make my hair curl and this is the only hair spray that will hold the curls in my hair all day! Aussie is the only hair spray that I will use! It works great!</li>
    <li> I tried this product on my thick wavy hair. I don&#x27;t really have curly hair because it&#x27;s too heavy but I wanted to try it. I washed and used the sprunch spray after brushing and towel drying.  I was really pleased that it wasn&#x27;t sticky or too hard. It kept my hair wavy and kept my hair from being frizzy. I normally feel icky after having hair products in but the sprunch spray felt normal. I will definitely buy this again. I was given this product for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this product because Aussie is a new brand to me. I have been using it daily for over a week now and I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. Good hold, makes waves out of nowhere if I scrunched my hair while drying. I marked one star off because it is a little sticky of you don&#x27;t work it through while blow drying enough. I did receive this from influenster as a complimentary trial, but I would buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair (that I hate!) I normally straighten it but with a 5 year old at home - I don&#x27;t always have time to do that! So after showering I let it dry a bit &amp; spray on. Amazing hold &amp; controls my frizz! Found my new go-to quick product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tested product at no cost but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This hairspray worked great for me. It kept my curly hair tamed without making it crunchy! It smells really good as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aussie Sprunch since high school (almost 10years) and I LOVE it.  I normally use the Aerosol version, but recently received the non aerosol complementary and love it just a little less than the other.  I spray it on my towel dried hair and let it air dry the rest of the way.  It always creates the perfect beachy messy waves.</li>
    <li> Did not like the texture for my hair.  Good  hold.@influenster#AussieVoxBox</li>
    <li> Scrunch spray is miraculous! It has helped make my crazy-thick, frizzy, wavy/curly long hair. I use it after showering, as a I feel I get a more even distribution that way. Not to mention my hair is unmanageable once it&#x27;s dry. My super frizzy, unmanageable hair becomes fabulously curly with just Sprunch apray. You do have to be careful to not use too much, otherwise your hair will look unnatural and will be clumped together in thick chunks. Too little does almost no good. Find your happy medium and you will be pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> I have really long (to my waist) thick curly hair, that has frizz issues lol. I prefer my mousse just because I like to stick with a product that actually works for me but I have to say I do really like this stuff, it holds pretty well and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard as a rock, I also really like the smell it has, it&#x27;s kind of fruity but not too strong. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First off this has the most delicious smell. Almost floral but not overpowering. You can still wear your favorite perfume without them fighting each other. I have really short hair and just spray a little and go. It has a light flexible hold. This is perfect for the girl on the go. This hairspray gives you a light airy feeling. If you want a strong hold all day hairspray, this is not the hairspray for you. This is great for girls with curly hair as well as straight.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the Sprunch Spray by Aussie. My hair is naturally wavy/ curly and I wear my hair curly and straight. When I wear it curly I&#x27;ll put a anti frizz serum in first and then spray it with hairspray. My last hair spray I used made my hair a bit too crunchy feeling so I was excited when I got chosen by Influenster to try a couple of Aussie hair sprays out. I&#x27;ve been using this hair spray for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m really pleased with the product. My hair look very natural with soft curls. No more weird crunch, 90&#x27;s perm curls. The smell of the spray isn&#x27;t too overpowering and i find it pleasant. a+ product in my book!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this spray! I use it on my curly hair days and it has excellent hold. I find it gets a bit too stiff for my personal preference so I combine it with leave in conditioner to keep my curls touchable, but I love the smell and the strength of the product!    I also will use this to style my children&#x27;s hair and it helps hold their hair in place without overwhelming them.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and it can easily get out of control. This spray helped keep my curls defined and left my frizz behind. I loved that it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or leave it crispy like most hair spray products do. My hair was still able to move and wasn&#x27;t stiff like a board. Great product &amp; will be using it daily! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes however the thoughts and opinions in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I have slight waves in my hair (post baby hair craziness!) and I love this spray to make my natural waves a bit more contained.  Its a great way to set the waves but have them still feel natural and not crunchy.  I recieved the sprunch spray in my Influenster VoxBox, BUT I had already been using this product for a year or so.  I love it.  It&#x27;s a staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> This product is just right for all the scrunching goodness that my hair needs. The hold is flexible, and it encourages my curls to be their best. It&#x27;s absolutely the BEST scrunch spray that i have ever used. I am totally impressed, and Aussie has gained a customer for life!</li>
    <li> This just one more amazing product from aussie!...literally I love them all ...but this one in particular beacuse I use it on my 5 year old. ..and I no longer have to struggle with her &amp;#34;fear&amp;#34; of the spray...since this is a non-aerosol spray. It keeps all her &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hairs in place and still has a natural look.....wich is exactly what I want  😁</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray. I have wavy hair that takes product and styling and tame it into curls. I use the sprunch mousse and hairspray to get my hair into nice curls and to tame the fly-aways! This hairspray also smells much better than any other hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aussie Sprunch Spray for years &amp; I absolutely LOVE it!!!  I would be lost without it... Literally!!  I have wavy hair &amp; discovered long ago that Sprunch spray &amp; a little gel is all I need to keep my hair looking great ALL day. It holds my curls so well without weighing them down or making my hair stiff &amp; untouchable. Most &amp;#34;curly sprays&amp;#34; are usually too weak to last all day, weigh down my curls leaving my hair flat &amp; miserable or turn my hair feeling into a crunchy unmovable  helmet. Sprunch spray is the only one I&#x27;ve found that meets all my needs &amp; wants! I even use it on days I go with a ponytail. It&#x27;s a great hairspray for a slick back look. Trust me when I say if you have curly/wavy hair, you NEED to try this spray!  It will be your new must have beauty item 😊</li>
    <li> This needs to be use more often. I loved the scent, the way it left my hair nice and soft not hard. I had bouncy curls and it last all night. I have very sensitive scalp and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all.</li>
    <li> Aussie continues to be one of the best choices for hairspray. It always makes my hair smell amazing, be soft and also it keeps my hair in the style that I wanted when I left the house in the morning. No need to retouch it or do anything. No matter what it always looks amazing and is not hard and stiff like some hairsprays does. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I got my scrunch spray from Influenster and I love my scrunch spray! It is great for a mom on the go. I have very little time to do my hair and love using this spray. It makes my curls look great and I love that it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I revived these product complementary form Infuser for testing purpose, great product styles my  wile curly hair. I will recommended to people this to people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product the day after I received it and was amazed by how it felt in my hair. It did not feel sticky while putting it in my hair or make my hair feel overly hard after being in my hair. It was perfect for my hair style. This held my hair style all day and there was no flaking.</li>
    <li> The sprunch and spray is the same quality product that  was originally introduced years ago. I have naturally wavy/curly hair and usually need a moose and spray gel over to keep it from frizz. I just wet my hair then sprayed it all through. Like the product says sprunch hair and then I diffused it for a few minutes. Hair dried and was not crunchy. Had soft defined waves. Holds stronger than moose. Best if going outside concerned about humidity and wind conditions. Would hold hair great!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and I have been using the sprunch spray to give my hair some more volume. I love the smell, and I also love that it isn&#x27;t sticky. I like how this product doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff and hard. I can barely tell it is in my hair. I blow-dry, spray, and go, and my style lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Please note, this stuff has a really good hold! With that being said, it leaves your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; in places. It&#x27;s great stuff and really helps boost curls, but I highly recommend the sprunch mousse with leave-in conditioner. :)</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a great hold that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;too stiff&amp;#34; and smells great!  I have dark hair and it left no residue whatsoever on my dark hair.  It also didn&#x27;t dry my hair out too much, either.  My hair is slightly wavy and I like that the hairspray is versatile enough to scrunch my hair and rock my curls and can smooth my hair when I flat iron it.  This is one of my favorite hairsprays!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it does not make my hair too crunchy, but gives my curl enough hold to last throughout the day. Before I was using mousse, and hairspray and this took the place of both products. I have weird hair in that it is not straight or curly without the help of products. If I want it straight I have to straighten it, and if I want it curly I have to scrunch it, otherwise it is just a frizzy mess. I did test this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy! Love Aussie sprunch spray!! Great price and makes my hair look absolutely fabulous! Spray in hair while wet and let it air dry for a wet look or spray and dry it a bit with a blow-dryer for a softer look. I personally love both ways!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have SUPER curly hair and it&#x27;s also very short.  It&#x27;s really hard for me to keep my curls looking like curls and not just frizz.  But when I used the Sprunch hair spray, MAN!  My curls look like real curls and not a frizzy mess!  Sprunch hair spray is really easy to use and it actually smells really good so you don&#x27;t have that chemically hair spray smell all day long!  I was able to test this product for free thanks to Influenster, but all opinions are my own.  :)</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan. I liked that it held without leaving the crunchy feeling that most curly hair product give. However, it leaves a gross white build up on my hair. When I went to pull my hair up at the end of the day my hair looked gross and dirty because of the hairspray build up.</li>
    <li> I received this as a complimentary sample from influenster. I am very familiar with aussie products. I grew up with my mom using them and smelling the &#x27;grape&#x27; scent. I loved it. However, when I used the sprunching spray it was so sticky and made my hair feel sticky. It didn&#x27;t have a very pleasing spell.</li>
    <li> Love this product have been using it for years, don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;d do if they discontinued it. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aussie sprunch hairspray for four days now and I&#x27;m loving it!! I have wavy, curly and straight hair(yea, little of it all lol) and this gives me a nice bounce and evens everything out to a nice wavy curl look. The smell is a nice &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell, hold isn&#x27;t a stiff hold and I would recommend this product! I received mine for sampling and reviewing purposes and will be purchasing when I run out!</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and straight, but I love to wear it with a little wave. This product is fantastic at provide my hair with a little &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; wave. It also did not make my hair crunchy at all. The waves stayed in all day and looked great! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this in the morning before work on my curly hair to hold a clip in place. The first few sprays it was difficult to gauge how much was going to come out since it is non aerosol so I ended up getting too much or too little. It kept my hair in place and helped scrunch my hair back into waves, but the smell was awful! There is nothing pleasing about the smell, it is damp, musty, and dingy and unattractive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I love that it holds my curls with out being sticky.</li>
    <li> Love the sprunch it kept my curls under control and smells great</li>
    <li> Ive used this product for a decade, and I&#x27;ve always loved it. It smells great and the hold is good. The only negatives are it can make your hair a little crunchy - AND the nozzle tends to get irreparably gunked up. Even so, I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this product this past weekend attempting to do an updo. I sprayed the product on my hair while it was in jumbo curlers to help hold the curl some when I took them out. However, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the stiffness of the spray. I ended up leaving my hair down as the curls &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; wonderfully when I was only attempting to add some body to my hair. I hope this helps you decide if this product is right for you.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and was skeptical to use this as I was afraid of what it might do. Then I figured I&#x27;d go for it and was happy I did!!! I like to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; my hair up a bit and have always had issues trying to find the right product to fluff my hair just right and HOLD it through the day! Especially living in WI with all the humidity! This ACTUALLY did the trick!! It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like it was plaster molded but kept it looking like I just styled it pretty much all day long!! Definitely would buy again!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My search is over for the perfect hairspray! I like to wear my hair in various types of curls, and with other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used in the past this is by far my fave. My end results are soft bouncy curls without the sticky and crunch feeling. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS. On days when I just dont want to do my hair i can get out of the shower and the spray this in, crunch it a little and im good to go. Holds all day and smells amazing. Works great with curly or straight hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it to scrunch my naturally wavy hair to get a tighter curl. I use the Aussie Instant Freeze Moose and then spray this while scrunching my hair and it gives a really nice, tight curl while keeping the hair manageable. I highly recommend this for anyone who needs a little help getting a tighter curl. I have used this product for a while, but recently received a bottle for free to test and was ecstatic when I saw it in the box because I just ran out of the one I had purchased.</li>
    <li> great for all types of hair. I tested this at no cost. I have thick hair so its always a pain to even try to style my hair, but with Aussie Sprunch it gives it just the right amount of hold and just enough to not leave your hair all crunchy that some products do. i would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a curly girl. Good hold is absolutely essential to keeping my hair frizz free. I tried the Aussie Sprunch hairspray immediately after I got out of the shower. I tried it first by itself, but realized quickly it was more of a hairspray so switched to gel instead. After I got my curls under control with gel I used the sprunch spray while I diffused my hair to maintain the body and hold I wanted. It worked FABULOUSLY!! It&#x27;s been quite a while since I was able to maintain the definition of curl and body that I got with this spray. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to define and hold their curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received spray free of cost but opinions are 100% MY OWN!!!!</li>
    <li> I struggle to find products for my wavy/curly/frizzy hair. I have found the Assie Sprunch spray to be one of the best. I spray it into my damp hair and either scrunch with my fingers or use the diffuser attachment on the blow dryer. It shapes my curls and keeps the frizz down. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the hold isn&#x27;t that great--the curls kind of go flat midway through the day. There is an easy fix though--just use a little bit of regular hairspray once you get your curls shaped the way you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also guilty of often (very often) just pulling my hair back into a neat ponytail. I use the sprunch spray to smooth my hair down and it works great--keeps the frizz away all day, even on rainy days, so I have a nice smooth ponytail without the weird shiny hairspray look. I did test this product at no cost, but have used it for years as well, and the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This spray does absolutely wonderful on my hair. I have thin hair and I have problems with sprays holding it in place without weighing it down. This spray does none of that. It&#x27;s lightweight and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love to scrunch my hair to get waves. I have not found a spray that would hold them long enough until now! This product held the wavy curls without being heavy, sticky, or flaking off later. Love it! I would definitely recommend this product for tame, but loose curls through the day or night. It also helped with my fly aways and baby hairs!</li>
    <li> This is a great spray! I have wavy hair with some frizz.  I got out of the shower put my head upside down sprayed this in and scrunched.  20 minutes later I have beautiful curls with no frizz.  It lasted all day and not in that sticky gross way in the cute bounchy curl way. It lasted through me running around after my kids and the baby grabbing it.  Smelled great as well. Definatly a must have for any beauty product lover!</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair! I have natural curly hair. I have problems with frizziness as well as fine hair. I really rely on the products I put in my hair to look good. This Sprunch product is amazing! It hold curls for over 20 hours! It also make my hair look naturally curly with no product. It smells great and increased the volume for my hair, right out of the shower. I will definitely keep using this product. I did receive this product for testing purposes but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Used this product on my naturally wavy thick hair.  I used it on my wet hair to enhance and hold my natural waves.  It worked pretty well. My hair was a bit stiff in some places, but the waves held most of the day so the product did its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own, and I will continue to use this product for my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have thick, wild and frizzy hair. My hair is naturally curly and when I leave it down I want it to look nice and not puffy, frizzy and all over the place. I tried this product and am in love with it. All I have to do is scrunch and spray my hair after getting out of the shower and that is it!! I don&#x27;t have to worry that by the end of the day it will look bad or out of place, it last all day. I definitely recommend this product to anyone with curly untamable hair like mine!!! :-D</li>
    <li> I am not new to the Aussie line of hair care but I am to the Aussie Hairsprays. I used this product on my natural African American hair I thought It was like a scrunching gel or mousse I did not get any curl definition  but Its just what it claims a hairspray I really like that there is no flaking or build up and provides a 6-8 hour hold and that there is 2 formulas with the same hold.  I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my  own.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  I&#x27;m generally a big fan of mousse products but always game for something new when it comes to my super curly hair.  Sprunch worked well as promised to add curl definition to my hair and kept a lasting hold.  After washing my hair, I let it air dry slightly, flipped my head over and sprayed the underside of my hair avoiding the top of my head.  I loved it and I&#x27;m glad to add it to my regular hair routine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have naturally curly hair but I have used this product and I love it! When I tend to curl my hair, I like to sprunch it the next day for a more naturally curly look and this does just that. I also like the while it does the job, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky like some other products do. Overall I really like this product and would recommend it. I did receive this product to try out free of charge, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying an Aussie product and I was very pleased with it. My hair is very curly and it worked great by holding the curl. I loved the scent and the fact that it left my hair soft and not crunchy. I tested this product at no cost courtesy of Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product all the time years ago, I would use the aerosol can. I loved the product in the aerosol can. In trying this in the non-aerosol i am npt impressed. Maybe it is because of the formula change or the fact it&#x27;s a non-aerosol. Though it still has that amazing smell that I remember Aussie products having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly/wavy hair, I used as the directions said and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a hold or any enhancement to my curls. As I normally do with products I give everything at least three tries. I went to use it the third time while I was out of town and the nozzle was clogged. I couldn&#x27;t use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did test this product at no cost and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Aussie sprunch spray is ok for the cost, however it is not my favorite product. I have naturally wavy hair and am always seeking a product that can define my waves and keep them from being frizzy, without weighing them down and creating a greasy look. It&#x27;s hard to find. I found the sprunch spray, when applied &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; worked, but often left my hair looking greasy. Also, I found the bottle hard to use with one hand. The trigger got stuck and was difficult to push....maybe I&#x27;m just weak, but it was tough at times. I think for the cost, it&#x27;s ok, but I would rather spend a little more and get a better product.</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy hair spray that just ends up giving me crunchy curls. I have tried to apply it to my hair while wet, damp and dry and every time end up with frizzy crunchy curls. I have to shampoo my hair twice to get all the residue out and not have the dry feeling left by this product.</li>
    <li> I think this product is good for the retail price. I got this product to try at no cost to me. I love Aussie products so I was happy!! Anyway I wash my hair at night. My curly hair takes too long to dry and I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry with twins at home. When I wake up my hair is still damp. So then I spray my hair down. I pull it up in a high bun &amp; feed my boys. After breakfast I pull down my hair and it&#x27;s ready to go! Be careful not to spray too much.</li>
    <li> This is the new Aussie Sprunch spray and it is not like it used to be!  They changed the product and all of the ingredients and claim it is the same as the old one!  I used the old one for 10 years and this one is like putting water on your hair!  They need to bring the old one back!!!</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie products.  My husband loves the smell.  Its fragrant, but not too strong and overpowering.  It allows me to style</li>
    <li> It does the job of holding your hair in place for the most part (I have frizzy, curly hair so controlling it is nearly impossible anyways), but leaves dandruff-like residue in my hair after application, and I don&#x27;t have dandruff so it must be the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie Sprunch spray for years. Works great on my curly hair to give a soft yet firm hold.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my tight curls. The hold is amazingly great so you have to be careful of how much you use. This product has been in my arsenal for at least 8 years and unlike many hairsprays, Aussie smells awesome. Unfortunately over time, Aussie has shrunk the fluid ounces to what it is today but a little goes a long way. My boyfiend and I both share this product and even though his hair is bone straight it keeps his faux hawk in place all day long. I enjoy having that fresh out of the shower shine all day as well.</li>
    <li> Such a good price on this very good hair product - have used it for many, many years and always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My local stores stopped carrying this particular product. Glad I was able to get it here for less than the store used to charge for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years on my naturally curly hair.  Wish it would help more with body, I have to combine it with several other products to get the look I want.</li>
    <li> I use  the Aussie Sprunch, on my naturally curly hair to help set my washandgo&#x27;s. A little goes along way and it helps prevent fizzy hair with drying out my hair.</li>
    <li> The Sprunch spray worked OK.  It didn&#x27;t seem to have as much hold on my waves as I had hoped so I had to pair it with another product to get the desired hold.  I ended up with frizz rather than nice soft waves so I definitely needed to do some prep work rather than spray and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Another great Aussie product that I love.  I have natural curly hair and this product does control the affects of humidity in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I could live without Aussie Sprunch &amp; I sure don&#x27;t want to test that idea!</li>
    <li> Favorite hairspray -- love the smell</li>
    <li> Aussie Catch The Wave Sprunch Hair Spray is a good, popular-priced product for those of us who find ourselves, whether we like it or not, curly-haired: particularly during the summer, when some of us have just given up on fighting the heat and humidity.  It makes it possible to wear curly hair, while keeping frizz at a minimum, at least for a day.  Or, of course, it&#x27;s great for those of us who do like that bushy-haired surfer look.  It&#x27;s easy to use, on wet or dry hair, and does not require the utilization of a damaging hair dryer.  Just spray it on, sprunch the hair up (I&#x27;ve actually always said \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot;), and there you are, bob&#x27;s your uncle, I get little curls I can manage.</li>
    <li> Never really heard of the word sprunch before until using this hairspray and I have to say, it&#x27;s the perfect name for it! For lasting (not so stiff) curls, I spray this on each individual section I am curling then after all sections are curled, I spray all over my hair while I &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34; or scrunch and tug to get desired look. My curls look fabulous! I have fine hair and the curls stayed all day for the most part. I really like how this smells too, not obnoxious at all. I will say that it can weigh your hair down if you spray too much but it&#x27;s not a huge problem for me. (Note: I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own and I stand by them.)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have very curly hair and this really helps me with the frizz.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or anything.  No flakes no anything!  I never used to wear my hair curly before this product! I was sent this product at no cost to test out and give my honest opinion.  I am so glad I did! It saves so much time to wear my hair curly!</li>
    <li> Perfect for when I want to scrunch my hair. It is the perfect hold, not too stiff. It has a very nice scent that is not too over powering.</li>
    <li> The aussie sprunch spray works wonderz for curls and wavy hair! It enhances the hair you have with little effort. It also holds throughout the day and doesnt get frizzy or flat. I would recommend this product, I tried it and now its the brand I use</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff....Absolutely love this it. Have been using it for years. Sprays easily and odor does not bother my asthma. Holds hair firmly, but not hard to the touch, gently controls my hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is amazing.  It smells incredible, without being overpowering or smelling like aerosol hairspray sometimes does.  And the hold is perfect....My hair and curls stay perfectly in place without being stiff or sticky and it lasts for most of the day.  I will definitely be purchasing this again when my bottle is empty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this hairspray at no cost to me, but the opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keeps my hair from being really frizzy and with curl even with the humidity of the spring-fall months. All I do is wash my hair normally and towel dry then I spray this product on. I like that the sprunch spray non-aerosol doesn&#x27;t leave behind a rough hairspray texture on my hair. I tested this product at no cost, the opinion is completely my own. I&#x27;ve bought another bottle and love to use it on my kids as well as my own hair. I recommend this product for anybody to use.</li>
    <li> I Love this product, Works great with unmanageble curls, smells great too</li>
    <li> Love it! It keeps my fly aways in place. Received this product to test through influenster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Aussie Hairspray!! I&#x27;ve never tried Aussie products before, but I&#x27;m hooked! I received this for testing purposes from Influenster and I&#x27;m lucky I did! First of all this spray smells divine, it smells amazing, I love it! I applied it on my damp towel-dried hair after washing it. Then I scrunched my hair with my hands, and let it air dry. It gave me soft, cute and amazing curls. The best part? My hair didn&#x27;t have that hard dry feeling/look most sprays leave. And even better? I walked around smelling yummy all afternoon! ;) I was able to comb my hair before going to bed without any issues, woke up with soft, manageable hair, you couldn&#x27;t&#x27; even tell I had put hairspray on it. That&#x27;s a big plus for me! I highly recommend it! Great results for an amazing price! What else can a girl ask for?</li>
    <li> I have curly African American hair- it&#x27;s natural so when Influenster sent me this product to test out I was excited. I hate most spritz type products but this one is different. It isn&#x27;t as tacky when sprayed and it dries without leaving my hair crunchy. What I needed it for was curl definition because the struggle is real with shrinkage. It was definitely a no-go for that purpose but I think for straighter hair textures or in conjunction with a stretching method, it just might work. All in all I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick wavy hair that i usually have to straighten in the morning before work.  This hairspray is great when I want to jump out of the shower scrunch my hair and be done with it.I have tried other leading brands out there that are sticky or too weak for me but this one seems to work well for my hair. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was sent this product from Influenster.com to test and review it for Aussie.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite hairspray! It gives me the hold I need without weighing my hair down or making it too crunchy. I have curly hair and it gives me that extra but weightless and non sticky hold after I mouse my hair. I also like to use it when I don&#x27;t have mouse in, I blow dry my hair, spray some Aussie scrunch, let it dry, brush through, curl with curling iron, then finish again with the Aussie sprung. It also smells amazing and is not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my curly hair! Love this hairspray for my 3b curls. It leaves me with manageable hold and virtually no frizz. I don&#x27;t like the pump, I&#x27;m used to a aerosol cans and do prefer them but this is worth it. I was given this complementary to test and as a result I went and bought the other Aussie products and they&#x27;re great. There&#x27;s no sticky feeling that sometimes happens with pump sprays, it smells great too!!</li>
    <li> Let me first start out saying that I&#x27;ve never tried an Aussie product before this one. I usually stick to the professional products as I am a registered cosmetologist. I was pleasantly surprised with the hold but it was not sticky or too &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;. I will definitely put it into my hair product rotation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love aussie and all their products. I have yet to find a product to tame and control my thick, curly, frizzy hair the way the scrunch spray and every other product does. If you have out of control, untameable, unmange able hair give aussie products a shot. I am 100% sure you will not beddisappointed.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie hairspray for years and although I like the Sprunch spray, I enjoy their Instant Freeze hairspray for my thick hair when styling to keep my locks in place. I use hairspray everyday and Sprunch is great for everyday use. Sprunch has a light, flexible hold and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy or hard. I&#x27;d like Sprunch to just have maybe a touch more hold ability, but would work great on fine hair!</li>
    <li> amazing for curls!!!  I recently got in a bad wreck and have broken my arm, I have a perm as well....which with one hand can be extremely hard to manage....bu with help from aussie&#x27;s sprunch haispray it&#x27;s really helped keep my curls in check and keep everything manageable!!!  It also smells great which is a huge plus, because who wants stinky hair products??  will definitely keep this in my beauty bag!!</li>
    <li> It is ok. Has really good hold to begin with and then seems to lose it rather quickly. I have fine wavy hair so maybe it would work better with thicker hair types. I love all their regular hairsprays so I was pretty disappointed that I didnt love this too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed using Aussie products. I have pretty straight hair but I like to put in loose beach waves sometimes. I don&#x27;t like heavy product in my hair. This was light feeling, with a very mild sent that didn&#x27;t overwhelm. It held my waves for most of the day. I also used it as a simple sprits to hold some bobby pins in place with my hair slightly pulled back and it did a great job. I would use this again.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample ofnthis to test and review from influenster and i like it. I love the smell and it holds my hairstyle the whole day. I have thick wavy hair but I straighten it pr use a curling iron to style it and whichever way i decide to do it has held the style all day long. Im happy with this product and will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It smells good (no chemical smell) and it did a nice job of keeping my curls looking great all day! There is just enough hold and movement in this spray that makes curls look great even after a long day.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has curly/ wavy hair!</li>
    <li> Very good product! I have thick hair that scrunching never last long in but with the help of sprunch it holds very nicely! I just spray in into my hair and work it through, crunching it and then I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
    <li> i got it free from influenster.com but i used to use this product all the time it has a great scent and also actually works it creates a great hold for down dews and up dews! not hard to brush through either such a great product</li>
    <li> I have wavy thick hair and tried the Aussie Sprunch Hairspray and I am a fan. I have &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; that stick straight up. The Sprunch spray helps it lay down without the hairs looking glued to my head. As a bonus, It smells fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> I love Aussie Sprunch! It has a wonderful smell and is so easy to use! I have tried other brands before this, but nothing compares! I just apply the Sprunch around the bottom of my hair, scrunch my hair with my hands, and I&#x27;m done! I get compliments all day long about how good my hair smells! This product is definitely a MUST HAVE! I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried the Sprunch spray this weekend. I&#x27;ve got a naturally beachy curly to my hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make it work when I&#x27;m being lazy and going the easy way out. It didn&#x27;t do much different than the normal products that I use, but it did have a pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t over saturate my hair so there wasn&#x27;t any crunchiness or excessive product build up. I don&#x27;t really care for pump bottles though. They never want to cooperate if you&#x27;ve transferred product on your hand. All in all it worked good, and did what it was meant to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always apprehensive about &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34; type products because being Korean, my hair is bone straight and they never work! I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so I decided that maybe the best time to try this product would be the second day. I had worn my hair up the day before and it was CRAZY. So I sprunch sprayed my hair to each side, the back and picked up half of my hair and sprayed there, too. Then a bounced it up and down in my hand giving a gentle squeeze and gently ran my finger through it. I then threw it up into the best messy bun I&#x27;ve ever made. Not only did it look cute, but it gave my hair some grip so that it stayed in place and my bobby pins didn&#x27;t slip out. Worked great, smelled good, a definite must have!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for when you want a quick and easy do. I use this after using a little mousse. I have curly, and at times wavy, hair and I spray a little of this on, use my fingers to scrunch my hair and then I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s super fast and easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell and is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a test product, free of charge, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and love to use Sprunch when I curl my hair.  Sprunch gives me a great hold but does not make my hair stiff. My curls last all day long.  Love this product and definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have extremely thick, curly hair and this is able to tackle my frizziness and flyaways.  I love using it both on days when I let my hair down and when I twist or braid it up.  The product also smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.  I tested this product at no cost but all of the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> So I have very  frizzy curly hair so this product was a breath of fresh air. My hair does best with less you do to it so a few squirts of this and im on my way. I also should note that I also use the freeze hairspray also just as a final set to my do. Great for beach waves or natural curl. I tested this product at no cost however all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Aussie Scrunch Spray. I like to keep my hair a medium length so I can try out and do different hair styles, For years I have tried doing the scrunch look. It always turns out wonderful, but only for the first few hours. After a few hours it falls flat and looks loose. I tried it a few times already and i immediately noticed that it held so much better than any other product i have used. The scrunch did not fall flat after a few hours, It held perfect for a full day. I usually have to use three or four products to keep the scrunch for a couple hours, but with this spray I only had to use this one product. I highly recommend this product to anyone.  I received the Aussie Scrunch Spray to test it out at no cost and these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> While the hold of this product is great and not flaky, I do not care much for the applicator nozzle. Maybe I am used to aerosol style hairsprays, but this spray felt messy and didn&#x27;t really apply well to the pieces of hair I was aiming at. Overall, it is a great spray and I plan on continuing to use it to tame my curly/frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. First off let me say I love Aussie products I used there shampoos and conditioners to there gel there moose anything lol I put my hair in bun brushed it back then used this hair spray to lock it on place ;) it stayed all day and I live in Florida and its hot and it didn&#x27;t budge. You can find this at your local Walmart for around $4 cheap right? And it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! It give my hair the right amount of texture and bounce without being too heavy. It smells amazing as well. Win win!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and I really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too stiff but still controls the wave/curl.</li>
    <li> I had some hold for about half of he day. It weighed down my hair after a while. I liked the Freeze hairspray a lot better. It may work differently on someone with shorter, lighter hair. I have very long and heavy hair.</li>
    <li> Love the easy use of this spray. It holds and yet doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands or your hair. My hair is incredibly thick and takes allot of product for it to hold to any hair challenge I&#x27;m faced with.I don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot to do the job. And it&#x27;s not very competitively priced compared to other high end products. I also like that after some use that it doesn&#x27;t clog or get stuck, a big plus for spray bottles. And the smell is just addicting. True Aussie scent of freshness. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly or wavy hair. It keeps the curls/waves in place all day with no frizz. It also has a very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sprunch spray that has just the right amount of hold. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or look wet. And the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;s used this product for about 2 weeks now on and off. I have thin wavy hair and this worked well, it didn&#x27;t create volume or bounce, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s its purpose. But it did keep my hair tame and frizz free for the time being. The plus is that it smells AMAZING!!! and the only downfall was it didn&#x27;t seem to last all day. I did test this product at no cost, but the opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product! I also love how when I use it my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and dry. It still moves naturally and feels soft. I use it everyday when I curl my hair . LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The  Aussie Sprunch Hair Spray is great for people who like me have very curly hair but that tends to get all fuzzy (do not how to explain it he he ) My curls just get so puffy the moment they dry that I end up with a big afro. But with The  Aussie Sprunch Hair Spray my curls behave amazingly. The hold lasts for a almost a whole day which is not problem for me. Easy to use, and good price.I will be buying this again when I run out! I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!! I&#x27;m totally loving this stuff I normally don&#x27;t put hair Products in my hair but every since I&#x27;ve tried this baby I use it just bout every day!! It&#x27;s gives me the perfect amount of volume love it!!  I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the sprunch product!  The packaging is easy to open, you simply pop off the clear plastic cap and spray away.  The instructions were easy to understand and cleverly written.  I love the phrase, “but your hair ‘do will do just nicely.”  I love the 30 day guarantee that is promised on the bottle along with two ways to contact via phone and internet.  The scent is not too overpowering and smells like crisp apples mixed with jasmine.  After applying the product to my damp hair I spray and scrunch, thus sprunch, and i’m out the door.  The strong hold allows for a firm structure that is flexible and manageable.  Overall, I’m am pleased with this product.  I feel like it was created especially for my curly hair.  Tip:  Follow up by using instant freeze by Aussie for a long lasting hold.  (I received a complimentary bottle of Aussie Sprunch from Influenster for sampling/testing purposes.)</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product! I have been using it daily for the last week, after I straighten my hair I use this spray and it keeps my hair from getting wavy and frizzy during the day. It has just enough hold to keep it from going crazy during the day!&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for complimentary testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 5 years now and I&#x27;m in love with it it always my straight hair the perfect balm punt of wave. It isn&#x27;t sticky but holds hair perfect I love everything about this product also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells amazing defiantly would recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product works great on my curly hair. Right amount of hold while still leaving my hair touchable. The scent is light and freshens second day hair while bringing back some bounce to your curls.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for that beach wave look that I can achieve in a hurry.  I must look no further.  Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol Hairspray helps accomplish that look.  It couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use.  Simply spray, sprunch, and go!  The spray is non-sticky, does not flake, and has a delicious scent!  If I had one thing Aussie could do to improve this product to earn that fifth star, it could be to create a stronger hold.  I found that I had to freshen my sprunch about 3 hours after the initial application.</li>
    <li> I received the Aussie Sprunch hairspray and I must say I do love it. It hold the hair in place and its does not make the hair extremely hard like many other hair sprays. Another thing I love it that it doesn&#x27;t cause flaking on my hair. I hate hair spray that flakes off. It make the hair look dirty. Overall I would buy this product again. Its one of the best hairsprays I have. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I have a mix between curly and wavy hair. Not quite as curly as I like. I can&#x27;t ever just spray something in my hair and go, I have tried several sprunch type products but it always takes a few to get the result I want. I tried the spray on a busy school morning. I sprayed it in my hair and sprunched and amazed at the results. I teased my hair a bit and that was it. It sprunched it without making it hard and full of product. I will definetly be using this from now on. Lasted all day and smells amazing and still gives hair a touchable movable feel!I was able to try this product for free!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly and very frizzy hair. The Sprunch spray helps define and keep my curls together. I have a ton of hair so a lot of product was needed, but it still didn&#x27;t get stiff! I will be using this product frequently. I tested this product at no cost but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love Aussie products, I currently use their Flexible hold hairspray. I decided to give the Sprunch hairspray a go and so far so good. I have really thick curly hair and I need something that will hold with all the humidity we have in Houston. It holds pretty good, it&#x27;s a lot more hold than I&#x27;m used too. So I have to watch out how I spray it on, I don&#x27;t like my hair to be &amp;#34;frozen&amp;#34; in place unless I&#x27;m putting it up in a bun or pony tail. In the end I end up with nice curls that last all day, the hair spray does it&#x27;s job. I tested this product at no cost, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I always use this product when sprunch my hair it smells great and has a long lasting hold!! I would recommend anyone to use it!! And i think its pretty affordable not over priced!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this..i had a perm a few yrs ago that i can never get even the waviness to show..but if i use this while my hair is wet sprunch it and viola curliness.. a great touch for even longer hold i combined with the instant freeze and my hair was perfect culry and hours of hold even on days my hair would be frizzy it worked!! I did.receive this.product free for testing purposes but opinions are my own..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received this product for testing purposes and I must say I&#x27;m hooked!! I have wavy hair that tends to get frizzy but this product controlled my frizz all day!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! My hair is frizzy and wavy. Nothing ever worked to tame my hair when i wanted to wear it natural. One time using this and i&#x27;m hooked! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE</li>
    <li> I use this particular Scrunch spray on my roots of my hair after blow-drying my hair. I then curl my hair to my style and use other spray products . Then I Love to use this Scrunch by spraying it into my fingers to then define different pieces of my hair to give the bangs area or other pieces a piece-y look. In place of using those styling pastes(that usually then you can&#x27;t restyle those pasted pieces after. It works well to hold your hair. I am a Hairspray fanatic. Used other Aussie&#x27;s but I really love this. Like I said it works Great as a Root Lifter. I use this product daily. My hair stays in place all day and looks natural. love this because, controls frizz on my wavy hair and smells good.</li>
    <li> My hair is normally very wavy, but it isn&#x27;t a normal wave that is constant. It has almost a Kinky look to it, like I have had it in a braid that was too tight or something. 1ST USE: Well anyways, I washed my hair and let it air dry most of the way, (if I don&#x27;t air dry it will be a frizz ball). I then sprayed my barely damp hair all over with the Aussie Sprunch Spray and bent over with my head down and my hair hanging I took my hands and grabbed random handfuls of hair and \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; my hair by making tight fists with my hair in it and pushing to my scalp. I repeated this one more time, again spraying and doing the \\&quot;scrunching\\&quot;! When I stood up my hair was curly, not just wavy it looked actually curly without any awkward kinks! 2ND USE: I used the product in the same way as stated above the second time and to my amazement it turned out just the same. I didn&#x27;t use any other products or anything and my hair stayed this way all day and night! AMAZING I highly recommend this product to anyone with thick kinky/wavy hair like myself as it kept its full body non frizz look for hours and was super easy to style my hair with and the SMELL is amazing, no other hair product I have ever used smells as good!  (I&#x27;m in the Pink Top Pictured)</li>
    <li> Love this spray! It&#x27;s perfect for my thick wavy hair. It has an all day hold and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aussie Sprunch Spray for years.  I have wavy hair, and this product is all I need to take fine hair from limp locks to kinky curls.  It lasts all day as well as having an amazing smell.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I usually wash my hair before applying hairspray. Wet hair is also easier to manipulate. Then I take a hair-curlier and give myself some small tight curls. Then I finish it up with sprunch spray. The spray lasts for 5-6 hours and then my hair starts to lose it&#x27;s bounce. Still it&#x27;s easy to use and it works! I have received this product for complimentary testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I really love this psrunch spray, my hair has a natural wave to it, and on days I am running late I can just wash my hair, or wet it down, add this psray, and sprunch my hair and it holds all day without getting frizzy or too crunchy!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle for review and have loved it! Prior to this, I&#x27;ve tried various gels and mouse with little to no luck. This is fantastic for helping me get a great scrunch with body, rather than weighing it down and falling flat as it has done with other products.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, however, compared to other Aussie products, this is only subpar. Yes, it will hold your hair in place. However, you have to spray a lot if you have medium - thick hair, and it&#x27;s hard to cover all of your head with the spray. For my particular type of hair (naturally curly, but still need to scrunch), it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is so simple to use and the directions are very clear. I love that I can just get my hair wait, spray the product  and scrunch up my hair. I find it works best if I use a diffuser on my hairdryer to help keep the curl in. My hair is very thick but this product really holds throughout the day. I typically can&#x27;t keep product in my hair due to the thickness of it, but this product is strong enough to hold all day! If it took less time to dry my hair with the product I would use it every day. It is reasonably priced and seems to last forever.  I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with any hair products before being introduced to Aussie sprunch hairspray! It gives my hair the perfect texture and shape without any frizz. It&#x27;s easy to use and takes only a few minutes to do. I love my curly hair when I use this hairspray! The best part is that I recieved this hairspray complimentary for testing purposes and I fell in love with it!</li>
    <li> I am not a huge hairspray user. I have curly hair, but, I tend to prefer gel and other hold products to style my hair because of the risk of crispy hair or sticky residue. This hairspray has done a fairly decent job on it&#x27;s own, but, I am not 100% in love with this product.    The first time that I used it, I used the product as indicated on the packaging (with a little help from other users of the product). I washed and styled my hair as usual (co-wash, leave-in condish, curl keeper, hard hold hair gel) and let it dry most of the way. Then, I worked in sections and spritzed Sprunch into my hair and scrunched it. I didn&#x27;t really notice any additional hold and I didn&#x27;t really notice any sort of curl enhancing benefits to using it in this manner.    However, I used it on fourth-day hair later in the week and it did much better things for my hair. I styled my hair that day by first spritzing my hair with some plain water and then flipping my head upside down and spritzing the bottom layer with Sprunch. I scrunched those sections of my hair and then flipped upright. I already noticed a huge difference when I righted myself. The bottom layer had a bit more wave in it than it usually does on the fourth-day (it&#x27;s all usually pretty straight at that point). I worked through the rest of my hair, lifting sections and spritzing Sprunch on them, first focusing on the lengths and then hitting the roots a bit. I did my whole head and my hair turned out pretty awesome for fourth-day hair! I usually have to topknot on the third-day and wash and style my hair, so, getting my hair to go into a fourth day was pretty excellent.    The only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is that it won&#x27;t be an every day product for me because it certainly isn&#x27;t a routine changer. But, it&#x27;s a great product to use to refresh my hair if I&#x27;m not quite ready to wash it yet. Another reason for only giving it four stars is that I won&#x27;t be using this product too regularly. While the silicone in the product is OK to use for modified curly girl routines and can be removed with a gentle low-poo, I don&#x27;t always low-poo, and certainly try to avoid it as much as I possibly can in the cooler/dry months of the year.    All in all, this is a pretty decent product and other people might enjoy it as much, if not more, than I have enjoyed using Sprunch. It does give you extra volume and wavy definition, so, this might be a great product to use in the summer if you want beachy waves/curls.

I have received no other compensation for my review of this product and the opinions expressed above are my own based upon my personal experience in using the product.</li>
    <li> When you need a bit of spray this product works great. My thick, wavy hair stayed in place without being stiff or stringy. I wouldn&#x27;t want to do a lot of spraying with this bottle (aerosol works better.)Overall, great product. I tested this product at no cost, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray. I don&#x27;t usually use hairspray because I can&#x27;t stand that crunchy feel most give my curls but this one didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and crunchy. It&#x27;s got great hold that lets my hair move naturally but still keeps the style in place. I also really like the smell of this spray as opposed to the aerosol versions of some of the Aussie hairsprays. I received this free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair so this product gives it just the right amount of hold, and, in my opinion, makes my curls more defined. I like the smell of it as it isn&#x27;t to &amp;#34;chemical-y&amp;#34;. I spray it in my wet hair and scrunch it up and once it is dry my hair looks wonderful. Will be purchasing this product again once my free sample from Influenster runs out. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have naturally curly, frizzy hair so I normally straighten it daily. After receiving the sprunch spray at no cost for testing I decided to leave my hair natural for a day. All I did was towel dry my hair after I got out of the shower, use my hands to scrunch it and let it dry. The results were amazing, I got numerous compliments on it throughout the day! The hold was fantastic and even in this Louisiana humidity my hair didn&#x27;t get limp or frizzy. The next day I sprayed it on my dry curls and used to hands to reactivate them and was out the door! This is now a must have for me!</li>
    <li> It works like most other inexpensive hairspray. Aussies Instant Freeze spray is much better than this product. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. First off let me say I love Aussie products I used there shampoos and conditioners to there gel there moose anything lol I put my hair in bun brushed it back then used this hair spray to lock it on place ;) it stayed all day and I live in Florida and its hot and it didn&#x27;t budge. You can find this at your local Walmart for around $4 cheap right? And it&#x27;s worth it! 😘</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so great for moms on the go!!</li>
    <li> For a mother of 3 and a full time real estate agent, I am always on the go. I always have to look my best as well, which can be tough after volunteering in the Kindergarten class all day to run to a showing that afternoon. I have long, fine and very wavy hair. Tough combo to keep looking great until the end of the day without the big guns. This product did everything I wanted it to do and then some, and it lasted all day and often looked even better the next day. It has a extra firm hold that doesn&#x27;t look overly stiff or crunchy, smells amazing, isn&#x27;t expensive but works like it costs SO much more. I use it almost daily, and it keeps my hair looking beach wave perfect all day long. I love this stuff and it makes my life so much easier by not having to curl or straighten it and being able to rock my natural waves!! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This sprunch not only keeps my curls and waves in line and looking awesome, but when it&#x27;s really nasty and rainy out it also keeps the frizz away! The first day I got it was after it was already raining and the frizz had started but it not only dialed down what frizz was already there but kept anymore from showing up while also keeping my hair soft at the same time!</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair and this product is great for her! It holds without being stiff! We love it and the lovely smell of Aussie!</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch hairspray is a product I have come to love. I have naturally straight hair, and often when using a curling iron I can&#x27;t get the curls to hold. Aussie Sprunch hairspray provides me with an alternative. I just add a little mousse to my damp hair, spray on the sprunch, style with my fingers, and I am ready to go. It does make my hair a little crunchy to the touch, but it is one of the few ways to liven up my straight hair. I tested this product at no cost, but my opinions are my own and were not swayed by the free sample.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; I am totally in love with this product. I have very thick and heavy hair, this product actually works to give my hair a nice bounce. Most products are not able to hold up to the weight of my hair but this one has proven itself time and time again.</li>
    <li> Controls my hair without leaving it feeling crunchy!  I have naturally curly hair and am always on the lookout for something that will tame the frizz without leaving me looking like I dipped my head in glue.  This does the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray! It is a great value and really holds my curls all day. I recieved a free sample to review from Influenster.</li>
    <li> Finally some products for us curly haired girls ! First let me say that the price is great and affordable! I also love the smell of this sour chicken spray it smells so soft and fresh. The spray helps keep my hair cutly without making it stuff or crunchy like other hair sprays. I like that it helps define my curl but also is manageable. I did test this product at no cost to me but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This product is great for creating those soft waves or soft curls that last all day yet don&#x27;t feel too harsh or crunchy. I use this hairspray after I dry my hair, and then use a curling iron and within a few minutes I have the exact hair style that I want. It is such a good hairspray that this hairstyle lasts for longer than any other hairspray that I have used. I have also used it on slightly damp hair and then just scrunched up my hair and it creates slight waves that look like the perfect beach hair. I definitely recommend this spray. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the lasting effects of the Aussie Sprunch Hairspray. I spray my curls in the early a.m. around 6 and I still have my curls after leaving work at 4 p.m. It&#x27;s not a heavy spray so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.  It also has a mild scent not over intoxicating like other brands. It works well with my hair type. My hair is thick and long and so it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works with my hair type. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is okay. It makes my hair really crunchy and wet-looking so it doesn&#x27;t really do well with my hair. I have very thin hair and it gets greasy really quickly and this stuff makes it worse. It does get the job done if I have nothing else to use, though.</li>
    <li> I love using the sprunch spray, it is great for my curly hair. I need a good strong product since my hair is super frizzy and unmanageable at times. Sprunch spray smells good and keeps my curls from going crazy. Love it and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for great hold.</li>
    <li> I love this spray because it is not too heavy. I use it to hold my hair back in a ponytail. A little spray goes a long way. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> It has good hold without feeling super stiff. I have naturally curly hair that is usually hard to tame, but this hairspray helped tremendously! It&#x27;s somewhat sticky when first applied, but once it dries, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love this spray it holds my hair and I live in the South where it is very humid it helps my hair I  tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> With long hair and two small children, I need something quick and easy when I do not have time! This product worked great for me. Easy to spray in and work for loose curls. Loved the wavy look it gave me.</li>
    <li> I am part of the population of females whom have super thick hair and has curls throughout. I loved this product for the sole purpose of ithe maintaining my sometimes crazy hair. It adds volume as well as providing a hold to enhance my already there curls. It&#x27;s easy to use, just spray, scrunch and go. I would highly recommend this product. I did receive this product for free but I do provide all my own opinions.</li>
    <li> I used this right out of the shower. My hair is usually really frizzy, but with this I had nice ringlets. I get a lot of compliments on my hair whenever I use it. It&#x27;s definitely going to be a part of my regular hair routine from now on. I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol Hairspray. Worked great for me. I have very curly, thick, frizzy hair. Nothing EVER works, until I tried this. I got out of the shower, towel dried my hair, just a little, sprayed some Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol Hairspray in my hair and it not only kept the frizz down, but my curls were amazingly tight. It also stayed that way for the rest of the day. Didn&#x27;t leave a weird feeling in your hair like most hair sprays do, which I was very happy about. Nothing I dislike more is that weird feeling most hair sprays leave in your hair. I would defiantly recommend trying this if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has finer hair than me) and my own to keep it together and it works wonderful. It is lightweight but gives you flexible hold. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> After I apply leave-in conditioner, this sprunch spray is a must. It helps keep my curly hair tamed and under control, without affecting my curls. As far as inexpensive hair products go, this spray is at the top of my list!</li>
    <li> People often ask me what my perfume is because they love it, but I don&#x27;t use perfume. Aussie Sprunch has a delightful, fresh scent. I buy it mostly for that. It works fine as a hair spray, but so do a lot of other products. But they don&#x27;t have that wonderful scent!</li>
    <li> Excellent--Fast Shipping--Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and paying $3.99 for years at the red logo&#x27;d store.  Sure I will take a bit of time to use 3 but the price ended up being 2.37 a bottle, a steal via subscribe and save, and be sure to look for amazon coupons! The product is perfect for my curly hair, I use this with mousse and a little bit of gel. My hair has soft touchable curls that are humidity resistant (read no frizz) and that is exactly what I am looking for.  No other hairspray can deliver that (in my 28 years of research at least)</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair in place like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used and washes out easily. It doesn&#x27;t have a negative effect on my hair either, unlike some products I&#x27;ve used. Also, you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hairspray I have ever used in my life! It is EXTREME hold! I have super straight hair and this hairspray allows me to curl, tease, whatever I want.</li>
    <li> I really liked Sprunch. It was a lighter hold, but kept the fizz away. It has a good mist-unlike some pump bottles, this one doesn&#x27;t clump up or spray so much that it wets your hair. It smells great and does it&#x27;s job. I have short hair that requires stronger hold, but definitely a product I would recommend to those who need something a bit more movable. All in all, a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.*</li>
    <li> I love this product because its easy and it doesn&#x27;t feel like hairspray on my hair. Of course I don&#x27;t have to apply a lot, a little goes a long way. Just spray and go. But you really have to try it out yourself. Great for curly hair. Great day for shopping from home.</li>
    <li> Love this Aussie Sprunch Hairspray.  I have very thick curly hair and this spray worked great in my hair.  Made it easy, right out of the shower, with towel dried hair, scrunched my hair with the spray and it looked great all day long, with no frizz!  It also smells so good!  As a mom with three young boys who keep me on the go, I appreciate a product that really works and feels great.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel gross at the end of the day.  Thank you Aussie for making this great product, I will definitely recommend it to my friends and purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> does what it says! scrunch and go for causal, carefree hair. It&#x27;s prefect for those days you just don&#x27;t have enough time to blow dry and straighten or curl.</li>
    <li> I love how this spray leaves my curls feeling! Holds all day and i like the smell also. I think this is going to be my go to spray for sprunching! So much love. I used it on my damp curls and off i went for the day. Now i need to stock up!</li>
    <li> I really do love this product. It gave my hair the look I was going for without all the trouble of the hair spray looking like it was glued into my hair. I really love the finish and the hold it gives and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I have told all of my friends and family how wonderful this product was to try  and will definitely be getting more of it in the future with how crazy my hair can get day to day.</li>
    <li> I have super thick curly hair, so it can be hard to control. I started using a salon brand light hold curl spray, but I&#x27;ve been hoping for years that a drugstore brand would come up with a similar product. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It keeps my curls in shape and gives a great shine, but allows them to move and look natural. Hooray!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol hair spray.  I have very curly natural hair, and this gave me the right kind of hold while still letting my curls bounce.</li>
    <li> Really holds curls. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down as it is drying like gels do.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good. I mean it works but I don&#x27;t feel like it gives me much better results for scrunching than normal hairspray. I could see how someone with naturally curly hair would love this!</li>
    <li> Great for people with naturally curly hair, really tames the frizz, and holds the curls beautifully. I love that it didnt make my hair stiff like many other hairsprays do. I could still run my fingers through my hair without them getting stuck. I am very pleased with this product. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have to start by saying I have hard to manage hair. I typically get out of the shower, put leave-in conditioner in, and then let it air dry for 20 to 30 minutes. I haven&#x27;t found products that work with my naturally curly hair. Most products make my hair look greasy immediately. I&#x27;ve even tried the more expensive brands. The only way I can wear my hair down is if I spend nearly 90 minutes blow drying and flat ironing my hair. And seriously, who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I didn&#x27;t have much confidence in this sprunch spray. Boy was I wrong. (And I&#x27;m an attorney...so I HATE admitting when I am wrong!!). I got out of the shower, towel-dried my hair, and used my leave-in conditioner (which is actually more of a frizz-reducing liquid serum than a creme). After that, I immediately used this scrunch spray. I flipped my head over to get the underside of my head, and picked up the top half of my hair to be sure to get the mid-section of hair. My biggest fear was that I would either a) use too much product, or b) watch my hair continue to grow in size as it dried. However, I have rather thick and lengthy hair, so I was more afraid of b). Once I was done spraying my hair, I used my hands to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my curls and adjust my hair before the spray &amp;#34;dried.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to say that my hair never a) looked like I used too much (or any!!!) product, or b) grew larger as it dried! This is by far the best product on the market for curly haired girls! This is now my go-to product, and I&#x27;ll make sure I always have some on hand!!</li>
    <li> This is perfect spray and go hairspray! I don&#x27;t even have to fully dry my hair, I can scrunch a little of this into my curls for all day bounce and frizz control - LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> This produce works so great with my already curly hair, it does not make my hair frizzy. Aussie as always been my go to hair stuff. I have tried others but never got that great out of it. I would spread the word on how great this works for me..</li>
    <li> This works great for holding my curls and defining them, without adding a lot of weight/product to my hair.  The smell is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my body spray/perfume, and it washes out easily enough!  It withstood recently a lightly windy day outside in Southwestern Florida at a local pumpkin festival, with a decent amount of humidity!  I would totally recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are mine*</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, thick hair that normally will not hold a curl or wave for more than a few hours. The weight of my hair is too heavy to hold the curls/waves especially with the addition of hair spray. I received a complimentary sample of Aussie Sprunch hair spray just in time for two formal events this past weekend. I curled my hair both nights and to my amazement, my curls held up both nights, the best they&#x27;ve ever been.  The hair spray was easy to use, pleasantly scented, didn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, brittle or feeling dry.  It definitely didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I got this product for testing and I&#x27;m in love with it. My hair is curly but they tend to frizz and all I have to do is spray this in and I have nice pretty curls the rest of the day. When I want beach waves all I do is brush out my hair a little and I have a whole new look. I love this hairspray.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or brittle! It has lasting hold and keeps my fly aways in check!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product from testing purposes. All opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> Aussie sprunch hair spray is an inexpensive hair spray that packs a lot of hold. The quality is better than that of more expensive sprays. I&#x27;ve used many other brand hair sprays, and they mostly fall flat. I have curly hair and it keeps my hair frizz free for hours. I&#x27;m really satisfied and will definitely buy again. Thanks Aussie!    * I recieved this product to test, but all opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I usually wear my hair wet/wavy 3 days a week by putting mousse it in. I received this free to test from Influenster so I gave it a shot.  I was surprised that it held my hair the same, if not better, than mousse. It was a different kind of wavy, more curly than wavy. However, it held all day long and gave me a lot of volume.  One downside is that when I wore my hair in a pony tail the next day (as I usually do after moussing), it was very tangled and ratty from using this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. It smells great and works good on my wavy/curly hair. It is really hard to find a good hairspray for my hair. But this spray really brings out my curls. I can also use it on either wet hair or dry hair. I love that it gives you that scrunchy look and feel, but it is not too hard like I put way to much gel in my hair. I will def. be buying this! :)</li>
    <li> I received this product from an Influenster VoxBox for testing purposes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically prefer &amp;#34;Sprunch&amp;#34; style hair sprays to have a wave/curl inducing aspect to them- just for that extra little oomf. However, I do have naturally wavy hair so it isn&#x27;t necessary.  I applied this to wet and dry hair and had similar results each time. I typically spray products like this directly in to my hand and then apply it as I&#x27;m scrunching the hair. I found that the product left my hands really sticky and felt more like hairspray on my skin, BUT the spray did not do this to my hair at all. I could still easily run my fingers through my hair without it feeling &amp;#34;producty.&amp;#34; It was a flexible hold, but my hair was tamed all day long. I thought the scent wasn&#x27;t all that great- just smelled like standard hair spray, but luckily the scent didn&#x27;t stick with me all day long. It faded over time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Its my holy grail when it comes to hair products. I have been using it for at least 10 years and its the only product that will make my hair look full and with volume and will hold in my curly hair in place. I am very very satisfied with this brand and i would definately recommended.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the sprunch spray. I have thick, naturally curly hair. The sprunch spray is strong enough to hold my hair together, while letting it still move freely. No stiffness. And, as always with Aussie products, it smells wonderful. I like this as an every day spray.</li>
    <li> I love Aussie Sprunch Hairspray.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  After washing my hair, I spray it with Sprunch spray, flip it over and dry it with a towel.  Then I&#x27;ve got awesome beach waves.   I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are mine own.  I have been using this product for years!</li>
    <li> I like this product as a texurizing spray, but as a hairspray, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job holding my style. It smells great, which is a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> i am always looking for a good hairspray that will hold my hair in whatever style i am trying to accomplish and i am so happy to say i FINALLY have found it!!! my hair is hard to manage and get to do what i want it to even with hairspray, i have to use gel mouse jam and spray and then still throughout the day i have to constantly add more spray but i have to say i was so pleased when using Aussie Sprunch Hair Spray and Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray. to hold my curls and reduce frizz and loss of curls i added Aussie Sprunch Hair Spray while hair is wet then Aussie Instant Freeze Hair Spray as soon as my hair dried and i was so happy with the results i didnt have to touch up as often. i received this product for testing purposes at no cost, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> After a few years of flat ironing my hair, I have decided to go back to wearing my natural curls. I have been using the Aussie Sprunch Spray and it is doing a great job of holding my curls in place. I live in the midwest where it isn&#x27;t too humid and it worked really well at home. However, I did take it to Florida on a recent vacation, and it was humid there, so I did notice my hair start to frizz and lose shape a bit. If you live in a more humid area, this product will probably not hold your curls as well as expected, but for those of us who live up north, I think this is a great product for curly hair. It smells good too!    *I did receive a sample of the product for the purpose of a review, but all opinions stated are my own and not influenced by promotional products.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and don&#x27;t usually do my hair because it takes so long. After washing my hair I towel dried. Then applied Aussie Sprunch. As I applied it I scrunched my hair with hand and blow dried. It left my curls soft not hard and dry. It made having curls truly fun. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. Works well in curly hair. Doesnt leave your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; or sticky.</li>
    <li> i love this spray  it is great for my naturally curly hair...i love the ease of spray and go styles that hold my curl all day on the go...plus it smells great...i tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own. received from influenster</li>
    <li> I have curly hair but it limps if I don&#x27;t put some sort of product on it. I have tried many products and was excited to try this when it was given to me. I really liked how it feels. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel nasty and hard like regular hairspray and it kept my curls nice and bouncy. I used this product both when my hair was damp out of the shower and when my hair was dry. In both occasions the result was good &amp; there was no nasty residue or excessive hardness.</li>
    <li> Great for spritzing on freshly curled hair and squeezing or &amp;#34;sprunching&amp;#34; as Aussie calls it. Really gives that beachy, piecey, surfer-girl look that&#x27;s so sought after right now and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Smells fantastic too!</li>
    <li> I personally loved the aussies sprunch non aersol. first of all because it was not an aerosol. Secondly it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling all nasty and greasy, and didn&#x27;t leave it nasty. plus it was still really easy to brush threw for me. I used this product after a shower because I love to bring back the little bit of curl that I have to my hair after a shower. The product was a success and I shared it with all of my friends and family. its also a nice and quick thing to take with you if you are traveling.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product! It works great for loose curls and waves and also for messy buns and ponytails, it gives the hold that you need without making it crunchy or weighing your hair down. This product was at no cost to me but all of my opinions are my own.!!</li>
    <li> I love Aussie Sprunch spray!! It makes my hair crunchy and stay in place . I use it on my wet hair right after I get out of the shower. I just flip my hair over and spray it everywhere. I then let it air dry. It makes my curls look great. My hair is wavy anyways. I would suggest this to anyone that needs a product to do a good scrunch job.</li>
    <li> I am only basing this review on the fact that I have SUPER fine hair. It is stick straight and getting curl to hold is normally very hard..&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this on my hair and it did nothing to it. Absolutely nothing. I didn&#x27;t get any kind of kink, or wave, or anything. But like I said, my hair is very straight. BUT, it did work for me as an all over hold spray after I had teased my hair and put it into the style that I wanted. I found that it had nice hold, the smell wasn&#x27;t overly strong and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;So, the only reason that I am rating it a 4 is because it didn&#x27;t do what the bottle said. But I still did like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This product was given to me for review from Influenster. All opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> Great, lightweight, and perfect for ethnic hair post shower! Loved this product!</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie Sprunch Hairspray for when i decide to sprunch my hair. Only thing i wish they did different was the bottle because the nozzle will get clogged sometimes.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I would purchase this product again! It doesn&#x27;t have that nasty hairspray smell to it and it is perfect for those who have natural curls or want some light waves! I would defiantly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have used the same scrunching product for 8 years, and may make a change! This product kept my frizz down and my hair was soft.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used this product and I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like a finishing hairspray though so I don&#x27;t recommend if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and I found this to be perfect to apply while I&#x27;m styling to try and get some textured curls. It&#x27;s definitely more of a styling product vs a hairspray. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or stringy. Would repurchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This does not make my hair hard or crispy at all which is a positive thing. I don&#x27;t like that wet look after using hairspray so this is just perfect while holding up my natural waves. If you spray it after a shower and give your hair a little scrunch all around, it holds up well without making your hair feel weighed down. I&#x27;m not a big fan of hair that looks gel&#x27;ed up, greasy, wet, or feel crunchy so this is perfect for soft, natural looking waves. Don&#x27;t spray too much, 4-5 sprays should work fine. Contains natural Australian ingredients and no animal</li>
    <li> My hair is thin, blonde, and curly/wavy so finding a good hair product is extremely difficult to me. The Spruch Spray was overall a good product that I will be keeping. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but still gave it a good hold. It also didn&#x27;t seem to give me a hair a greasy dirty look, which SO many products tend to do. My old complaint is that it makes my hair feel like I&#x27;ve been in salt water, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to that though.  I had tried Aussie products years ago, but the smell (while nice) was so overpowering throughout the day I stopped using it after the first attempt. I&#x27;m glad they toned down the smell a bit.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, not-quite-straight but not-quite-curly hair.  At best I get a good wavy day.  THIS STUFF.  This stuff takes my usually messy-in-between hair and makes fun waves.  My go-to now is to wash my hair at night, twist it into a ballerina-bun for sleeping, then taking it down, still damp, in the AM, giving it a few quick spritzes of the Sprunch spray and I&#x27;m good to go for the day!  All day bouncy, wavy hair!  SERIOUSLY MAGICAL!  Thank you Influenster for sending me this fabulous product!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try out this product! I LOVE the &amp;#34;sprunchy&amp;#34; look that a lot of girls seem to be styling lately! However, I&#x27;m one of those people that have been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with stupid-straight hair. I was really hoping that the Aussie Sprunch Spritz would change my luck around and help me achieve the look all my curly/wavy friends can pull off but no luck for me. I quickly got discouraged with the sprunch look and just through my hair up into a messy bun and went on with my day. Later that evening after my hair was dry I still had that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look to my hair and when I let it down I had some wave/sprunch look to my hair. NOT ideal but better than nothing! So, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have curly/wavy hair I say give it a try!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I loved towel drying my hair and puting this in for waves and curls. the hold lasted all day.</li>
    <li> I loved this product for my curls! My hair didn&#x27;t feel stiff at all! The smell was great too, not too strong!  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just LOVE the Aussie Sprunch! Been using it ever since I got it! I would recommend to family and friends!</li>
    <li> love the ease of this project…….love the  hold without the stickiness.</li>
    <li> Once i Started using this spray my hair was way more manageable. The frizz was much lower as well. I definitely recommend using a frizz ease before using this spray though. I have really thick wavy hair. I almost always Straighten my hair because i feel it is just unmanageable when i just let it go natural! This Product saved me an hour in the morning. I just sprayed my hair when it was damp and then let it dry with a diffuser. BAM..... Amazing curls and they stayed all day! Including after i played 2 softball games..</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I received it complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in their VoxBox and it is perfect for my wavy hair! It is just enough hold to &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; my hair and leave it still feeling touchable!</li>
    <li> I received the Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol hairspray from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. I have natural wavy hair so I like to sprunch my hair often. I had been using another brand or regular hairspray that I thought was working ok. I tried this Aussie product today. I sprayed it on my wet hair and used my diffuser on my hair. I could instantly tell how much better that this product held my curls than the other brand. I also like the fact that if did not make my hair feel sticky and hard. I will 100% buy this from now on. I finished it off with a little of the Instant Freeze spray, and my hair looks wonderful with a lot of volume!</li>
    <li> Barely holds by the time my work day is over my hair is flying everywhere. Flakes a bit and I feel it doesn&#x27;t hold much. I have very thick and coarse hair I guess that&#x27;s why. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have thick hair. Now my daughter on the other hand has very fine curly hair and it works wonders. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Loved this product for my natural curly hair! I love that it allowed the flexibility of my curls to show while still maintaining the hold I need to avoid a frizzy mess! I used it right after a shower with my hair wet and maintained a nice controlled look! I loved it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the sprunch spray. It leaves no residue and has a flowy hold.</li>
    <li> I like sea-salt sprays to add texture to my hair, but I only use them on days where I know I will be washing my hair that night. Plus, I feel like sea salt sprays dry my hair out, so I try to use them sparingly. With that said - I tried this when I wanted something to add a little texture to my hair when I was wearing it in a side ponytail. It worked like a charm and smells amazing! I spray it on and scrunch with my hands to create waves, then spray again to hold. And it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel gross like sea salt sprays do! I will definitely repurchase this! So glad I tried it. :)</li>
    <li> Love the product, works so much better then my tresseme hair spray! :)</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s strong enough to keep my toddler&#x27;s fine hair back from her face, but not crunchy like gel! The smell isn&#x27;t obnoxious so my toddler doesn&#x27;t pitch a fit when it&#x27;s hairspray time. And you can&#x27;t beat the value! I like to spray it before I comb her hair to keep all the fly-aways back from her face and hold them in. Even while using it every day my daughter doesn&#x27;t get gross build up on her scalp.</li>
    <li> I was amazed by this product. My hair is fairly short and very wavy and frizzy. I was able to finally get something to make my hair scrunch up the way I wanted it to without all the frizz. I will be buying this again and be using it for my everyday hair product.</li>
    <li> Was hesitant because I received the sprunch hairspray for testing purposes ... And it worked great!!! I hate those pesky fly away hairs and when I used previous hairsprays to scrunch my hair it left my hair feeling crunchy ... This product works great and smells great too!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this spray! And it has a lot of holding power to it. But it does make a dulling on your hair if you spray it too heavy, so you need &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; sprays when you use it. Otherwise it is a good spray for holding your style all day long.  I  tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> So loving this product, it keeps my hair frizz free and still has bounce and life. Considering that my hair is super coarse, frizzy and unruly this is truly a gift to my hair! Best part I got a change to test this product at no cost. :)</li>
    <li> I was never a big fan of the Aussie hairspray scent in the past, but now that I was give a sample to try, I can say that I would definitely purchase it! Usually spritz hairspray leaves hard/stiff spots throughout your hair. I use hairspray to keep fly-aways down when I have my hair pulled back and this hairspray did the job without any sign of using the spray! I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product was so awesome for my little 4 year daughter that has curly/wavy hair. i had braided her hair earlier in the week and let her sleep in the braids. this left a very beautiful wavy effect on her hair but it was kind of out of control. when i received this product i was so excited to try it out on her and it came just in time! i spritzed, then scrunched then spritzed lightly one last time and her beautiful waves stayed in tact while being soft to the touch. i highly recommend this product to anyone that has curly/wavy or unmanageable hair :)</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch Spray is a great option for a beach-y/tousled look.  I think it might be a little too light, though, for my fine curls to actually create real curls.  It gave me a pretty wavy, beach-y look, but did not enable my curls to form ringlets like my normal mouse does.  It does, however, have a great hold without being too stiff and and the scent is not overwhelming which is big plus in my book (some of the hair products on the market should really come with a perfume warning!!!)  It works really well at restraining my frizzy &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; when I pull my hair back into a pony tail and holds up when I teach my dance classes, definitely a good sign! All in all, I think it is a pretty good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need to mention that I received my Sprunch Spray at no cost to me to test it out and review it, but I still am giving my honest opinion. All in all, I would say it is a great addition to my hair &amp;#34;regime&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray when I just want some light waves it doesnt have that hairspray crunch and It smells good too! Only think I dont love is its not the bessssst for humid weather but I will buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> With naturally curly hair, this sprunch spray lets my curls appear natural and feel natural without stickiness and stiffness like the other brands do. I have used this before because my grandmother used Aussie products! I am proud to be using them again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Having naturally curly hair can be rough sometimes. Most curl products leave my hair hard and crunchy. I perfer for my hair to be soft and bouncy. With Aussie Sprunch I can have full curls that don&#x27;t look like I just came out of the rain. I love it. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Really nice hairspray for a quick scrunch and go. I have very curly hair and haven&#x27;t found a hairspray to keep the curl nice and not make it go frizzy. Its fall here so no high humidity, I&#x27;ll try this again in the summer and see if I get the same results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Its easy to use, tames my hair and gives me volume and nicer waves! It holds everything in place and doesn&#x27;t just get flat after an hour in the town.  Not to mention it smells fantastic. I will definitely continue to use this product. Makes for an easy everyday hairstyle that even a mom on the go has time for!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair is pretty much straight. It has a slight wave to it but nothing major. I spray Sprunch in my hair after washing and towel drying and it makes my hair super wavy. I just found this product a few months ago and I am so glad that I did. I recommend it to anyone who wants to add some wave to their hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! JUst got it the other day and I can already tell we&#x27;re a match made in heaven! It works great on my thick curly hair and gave it a soft hold, I used it with my daily hair routine and it totally amped it up a notch.  I like how it kept my hair intact but without the crunchy feel normal hairspray gives me. I would recommend highly to everyone!</li>
    <li> Product sucked the moisture from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hair was left horribly dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again. Thank you</li>
    <li> Since having kids I have INSANELY curly hair. I&#x27;ve looked high and low for products that will hold my curl without giving me that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try using this stuff, alone, with no other products.  LOVE IT! I spray it on wet, scrunch and let air dry.  Then hit it with a little more Sprunch Spray and we&#x27;re off.  No frizz, no crunch, just awesome curls.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time recently and I enjoyed it. It has a decent scent and it does not leave your hair looking or feeling stiff and ridged. I was given this product for free through a sampling program but the opinion stated here is my own and by my own free will to do so.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair. I love this product because it helps to turn my waves into more defined curls that last all day! I spray the Aussie Sprunch Hairspray on my damp hair after showering. I give my hair a few scrunches, and my hair dries into curls! I was so happy with this product! I received it free to test, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this hairspray complimentary from Influenster and I am very pleased with this product. It has flexible hold for those days when I just want to let my hair down with some curl. It leaves a nice shine as well. The fragrance is light and pleasant and does not smell like alcohol which most hairsprays tend to do. I will definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I think that this stuff works wonders I have extremely flat hair and if I wash my hair the night before and put it in a pony tail over night I wake up and spray this on it and my hair looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of this to try for free from Influenster. I&#x27;m not a fan of the new smell and the hold isn&#x27;t very strong. Not my favorite hairspray and I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing. Please go back to the old formula and scent. This was a let down.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!!! I have super fine hair and it gave me great volume that lasted all day! It smells amazing!!! I highly recommend this to anyone that wants great volume that lasts all day!!</li>
    <li> It felt a little sticky at first and I was worried it would make my hair crispy, but once my hair dried it felt natural and light wait. It held my hair in a nice beach wave all day and I even was running and playing outside. I Really like it. This review is by Mallary Cline and I got to do a complimentary test from influenster.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product. It smells so fresh and clean. I have curly frizzy hair and i tend to wear my hair down with mousse and hairspray, I replaced Aussie with my old hairspray one time and noticed a huge difference. I start with damp hair add mousse and scrunch it and end with hairspray for that long hold. Usually i end up with a hard stiff heavy hold. I used AUSSIE once and i&#x27;m saying GOODBYE to my old hairspray. Aussie leaves your hair manageable but also gives it a natural look. Not like you just piled a month worth of hairspray to your style. A loose but in control hairstyle. I love it and i&#x27;m so happy i gave another hairspray a chance. You will never look back after you have used it. The great smell alone will sell this product. Not to mention it is fairly priced.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hairspray it is flexible enough for you to change it if you need to and strong enough to keep your &#x27;do. I think this is a good hairspray to use like on kids so its not completely stiff but still workable and hold the baby hairs in place.</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie Sprunch Hairspray. I think that it does wonders for my hair. I love how it lasts all day long with a casual scrunch and it will hold all day long.</li>
    <li> I really liked the smell of this product and how light and refreshing it was. Although, for my hair type, it didn&#x27;t quite provide the hold I needed. This would be great for someone with thinner hair and not looking for an all day &amp;#34;hold.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am so glad I tried this product. I have used Aussie shampoo and conditioner in the past and liked it so I was excited to try the Sprunch spray. I have naturally curly hair and its on the medium thick side of the spectrum. I incorporated the Sprunch spray into my routine when I got out of the shower. It worked wonderfully. My curls had a nice bounce to them without being stiff. It left my hair with a faint nice smell which was nice. Some hairsprays have a tendency to be stiff and aresol smelling. It was also nice that I was able to use the product on my daughters hair because it helps me save money not having to buy different products for everyone in my home.</li>
    <li> I really love the Aussie sprunch hairspray. It make creating beachy waves so easy. Getting ready in the morning has really been simplified. I spray it, curl, and go!</li>
    <li> I typically do not like to use &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; in my hair because with curls you typically get stiff crunchy curls with hairspray. NOT THE CASE. With Aussie Sprunch you get soft curls that are manageable without the dreaded crunch. I would recommend this product to people with curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have frizzy spiral curly hair problem and by using this product it kept it in control by eliminating the frizz and defining my curls that the traditional hair spray causes. It also does not flake or leave a powdery white residue. I really like how this product defines my curls without leaving them stiff or hard.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Sprunch Spray! It has a fafabulous scent and a great hold for my wavy hair! Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product I have curly hair I use the sprunch  spray  to keep my cruls in place.. It does its job.. I highly recommend this product.. And talk about the smell OMG love it..</li>
    <li> I absolutely loves the outcome this spray gives my hair. I use this spray when I don&#x27;t have time to use a curling wand. I just spray all over my head, run my fingers from root to tip the scrunch and shake. That method leaves me with the perfect curls that last all day. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this spray, It holds all day. I let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s *almost* dry and spray and blow dry to get that curly/scrunched look. I love it because you can use it on wet or nearly dry hair to get a different look. I have tried other brands but I always come back to Aussie and it also smells great!</li>
    <li> I used this hairspray to crunch up my hair I applied after I got out the shower. I recommend on wet hair and let it air dry after you apply this product then I applied the hairspray and it made my hair hard all day :) it works! Its an easy and fast way of getting your hair all together. Not having to take so much time on curling it or straighting it. I tested this product at no cost thanks to influester!  :)</li>
    <li> This product was mediocre and wasn&#x27;t as good as the Aussie Freeze Spray. I felt that it really weighed my hair down when I used it. And maybe that is because it&#x27;s a non-aerosol spray and the mist doesn&#x27;t get distributed evenly. I only ever use hairspray when I curl/scrunch my hair and this didn&#x27;t help my style stay longer. One thing I did enjoy was the scent of the spray, but then again I love the smell of al the Aussie Products. I did receive this product from a subscription service at no cost and all of the opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Just love Aussie makes my hair feel great. Better then before . I get awesome curls and hold.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Aussie products, so when I was sent the Aussie Sprunch (isnt that a cute name) for testing and review from Influenster I might have done a happy dance. This stuff is amazing. I love to use it when i have my hair curly because it will hold those bad boys in place all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you are missing out if you haven&#x27;t tried this stuff yet!</li>
    <li> I used this product and I think that it smells nice, but it is just not for me. I prefer aerosol sprays, so that is the only reason why it is not for me.  I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray for YEARS! My hair is wavy and I usually either have to scrunch it with lots of hairspray or straighten it. I use this spray when I scrunch it. It works great. I love the way it holds my curls and is so simple to use. Straightening my hair seems to take FOREVER! Plus the heat is bad for my hair. When I use Aussie products to scrunch it, it holds for days and is healthier for my hair. The smell is great also and one of the things that make Aussie products my favorite!</li>
    <li> This worked ok but i think if i had curly hair out would have worked better. Loved the smell</li>
    <li> I was so tired of doing the same thing over and over to my hair so I decided to try something different. Different for my thick hair was making it curly. I have curl when my hair is wet but I can never make it stay curly. Until I got Sprunch spray. I added the sprunch spray to my hair as I was drying it with a blow dryer.  It kept the curl in my hair all day. Fragrance is very pleasant also with the product.</li>
    <li> i like this product for my curly hair styles. I was actually very surprised that it worked on my hair. It kept my curls  without leaving my hair with that stiff feeling. I will definitely use this product again with my curly hair styles.</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use. Just spray and &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34;, just like it says. This product gave some volume to my hair as well which it never has. Definitely a nice change for once. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and I have a hard time keeping my curls vibrant and not bushy. I like to use a nice finish and this product works great. It is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t have the extra cloud associated with aerosol cans. My hair sprunched well and my curls formed beautifully and stayed with this product. I would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a lightweight finish for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch hairspray is perfect to use for the days you don&#x27;t have time to do your hair. I have extremely thick hair, I would spray some of this in scrunch and let it air dry. Held all day long and controlled frizz very well. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try a new scrunch spray</li>
    <li> The spritz spray is a little annoying because I feel like I&#x27;m spraying and spraying. The hairspray does its job though by holding my naturally curly hair. After washing my hair I scrunch it with my hands. I&#x27;ve actually been spraying the hairspray directly into my hand and then &amp;#34;sprunching&amp;#34; it into my curls. It seems to hold all day and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue. Does the job right!</li>
    <li> I received it complimentary from Influenster in the Aussie VoxBox. I have thick wavy hair and sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to fix my hair. This product is perfect for my unruly hair! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy or sticky, it&#x27;s really light and has a flexible hold for my long, thick and wavy hair. It makes it possible to wear curly hair, while keeping frizz and product at a minimum. It&#x27;s easy to use, on wet or dry hair, and does not require the utilization of a damaging hair dryer. It&#x27;s a great addition to my hair routine and easy to style when on the go.</li>
    <li> I received these products to try for free. I am not usually one to use much hair spray because I don&#x27;t care for the texture it makes my hair and the crunch it creates. This product is very light-weight and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gross and crunchy! I spray it on my wet hair in the morning and it helps my curls look nice and not crazy frizzy!</li>
    <li> This product did a wonderful job on my curly, wavy, frizzy hair.  My curls looked great and held all day.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel extremely crunchy.  Smells great too!  Will definitely continue using this product.  I received the Aussie Sprunch Non-Aerosol Hairspray at no cost as a tester but my opinions are my true opinion.</li>
    <li> This Sprunch spray works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has wavy hair and it defines the curls really well. It holds well and smells great. The only downside is if you put too much your hair gets really hard. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used sprunch on my daughter&#x27;s wavy hair and it worked great! It was easy to spray on her hair and scrunch it. I really liked how it created more curls and waves and also held them throughout the day. She loved the way her hair looked and I loved how easy it was!</li>
    <li> My favorite sprunch spray. I&#x27;ve used this sprunch spray in the past and forgot how much I loved it. I have wavy hair and once I get out of the shower and brush my hair, I flip over and spray this all over and then get to scrunching. It does wonders for my hair! I did receive this complimentary, but this review is 100% all my own. I will definitely be buying this product.</li>
    <li> This hair spray works well on both my hair and my daughters. My hair is thick and wavy and her hair is very thick with curls/waves. It helps control the frizzyness that we both get from the humidity outside. I usually apply it to our hair when it is damp. It helps control the frizz for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I  have been using this spray daily for two weeks. I am disappointed in its hold and wouldn&#x27;t purchase it. I have fine long layered hair. I tried sprunch spray to add volume to my waves. It lasted about five minutes,then looked like nothing was in my hair at all. I gave it two stars for smelling nice. That&#x27;s really all I liked about it. I tested this product at no cost, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. Made my curls frizz free and not crunchy or hard like normal strong and extreme hold sprays do. I was a bit leary trying this bc i figured it would make my curls stiff but this totally did the opposite. I haven&#x27;t had a hairspray work this well for a long while. This might just be my new HG spray from now on!</li>
    <li> I love the Sprunch Hairspray! I am a fan of non-aeresol hairspray anyways, but this one is really good!! I love the classic Aussie scent and the hold is amazing. I actually use this for my daily style even if I ham not &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34;-ing my hair. Best little hairspray I have used in a while!</li>
    <li> This is my go to spray. I have been using this product for over three years and I love it.  I love the look and feel I get when using hs product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have frizzy, curly hair and the Aussie Spruch Spray cut out the frizziness and left me with soft curls.  This product did not make my curls hard and crunchy like other products I have tried in the past.  It was very easy to use.  Just spray, sprunch, style and go.</li>
    <li> Aussie is one of my go-to brands because of the value. Pay little and get lots. I have naturally wavy hair and this stuff keeps it in place all day while giving it a natural finishing look. It&#x27;s easy to use and smells great!</li>
    <li> Aussie Sprunch Hairspray worked awesome in my very very curly hair. I used it on the days I worked my 10 hour shifts and my hair never went frizzy. The hairspray felt light and didnt leave my hair feeling sticky or stiff. I love the way my hair was still able to be touchable but still kept under control. I gave this hairspray five stars because it is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used in trying to control my naturally curly mess.  I did test this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> this product is great for the affordable price!!! I got to sample this through influester.com and I am glad I did!! This is the first time using it and I am in love!! I use it on the day I don&#x27;t want to straighten my hair! It has great holding power and makes my hair look great!!</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy and curly hair that after washing it, it I don&#x27;t add product to my hair it gets wild and frizzy. I started using Aussie Sprunch Hairspray on my wet hair recently and it holds my curls perfectly! I just spray it on my wet hair and skrunch the curls in my hands and let it dry. Keeps the frizz down too. Love it and will definitely keep using this product. I am testing this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday on my wavy/curly hair so that it dries into a nice curl.  It works great!  All I do is brush my hair then spray this all over, scrunch it up a little with my hands, spray a little more, and then off I go.  It holds just long enough for my hair to dry and then doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff like most hairsprays or curling gels or mousse do. I would absolutely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost, but my opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and the hairspray really does freeze your hair. But this product isn&#x27;t for me because I don&#x27;t need my hair to be froze in one spot and not move. The sprunch spray is ok.. It smells good but my hair still got a little frizzy after using it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so it doesn&#x27;t need &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; with other products. This product is great for people with wavy hair that need some extra help getting some curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who like to scrunch your hair curly, this would be a great place to start!! As for me, the frizz stayed out, but my curls weren&#x27;t as curly has they could be.</li>
    <li> Never tried Aussie until now and I&#x27;m hooked!!  It works for hours and hold up through my vigorous work day.  I&#x27;m so lucky I got to try this at no cost,  but I&#x27;ll def be purchasing it when I run out.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to try for free and I was impressed with the results.  I usually use hair gel everyday in my naturally curly hair, this made styling my hair easy because I did not have to get gel all over my hands to apply and it was a quick spray.  I would recommend this spray to others with curly or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair and this spray gave my hair volume with a little curl. I sprayed it on my hair then used a diffuser to dry. Unfortunately, the curls only lasted about half the day but my hair still has some volume!</li>
    <li> This works great for using on wet hair versus styled hair. I love the smell and how I can go to bed with wet hair and then spray this on in the morning! Works well for that casual curl look, but don&#x27;t use it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product for days that I wanted a beachy wave in my hair. I didn&#x27;t find that it added a lot of curl, but it does add definition and helps hold curl. I wish it were aerosol and easier to apply, but it smells great and also tamed some frizz.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have always had a problem with my hair getting frizzy within hours of doing my hair. I applied Aussie&#x27;s Sprunch spray to my hair and &amp;#34;sprunched&amp;#34; it and had frizz free hair all day long! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This product actually works good for people with curly hair. Sometimes we dont have the strengh to straighten out our hair everyday. The product doesnt leave hair stiff. It gives my hair enough hold just to keep my curls in place. My bair is really curly so most of thr time i look for a hairspray that doesnt leave it really hard. I was a little hold just to lock curls up.</li>
    <li> I personally really like this spray! I don&#x27;t usually &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; my hair because it is naturally curly, but I wanted to see if this would help define my curls and keep the frizzies to a minimum and it did! My hair looked great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff when I am able to use it, I will say that if you have thick,long hair it is a little bit more difficult to use, just because of all the time it takes to sprunch ones hair when you have to go through so many different layers, but as usual, aussie doesn&#x27;t disappoint! I was lucky enough to be able to try this product free of cost, but I promise you all my opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray for my boys it doesn&#x27;t spray their face and it holds their hair all day. And theyou play rough they are 4 and 9.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite hairspray!! I have very curly hair and this product gives my a perfect flawless style without being too hard or sticky!! After receiving a sample I have already bought 2 bottles!!</li>
    <li> This hair spray smells great and is not sticky. You can adjust your hair after spraying without the sticky mess on your hands. It holds well but is likely not a full day (8-10hr) hold. I do tend to like aerosol cans better, but I could adjust to the pump eventually. I received this hairspray free to test and review based on my own opinions.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly with my curly, fine hair. Usually products I encounter make my hair too stiff. I have to admit I usually only use this spray when I putting my hair up in a pony tail or braids though. It has amazing hold, and this controls all my fly aways. I also think the smell is amazing. Sometimes hair sprays have an extreme smell, but this one is not too bad. I recommend this product for all my friends with curly hair. The one downside is that a little goes a long way. Be careful!!!  I was lucky to be able to test this product for no cost, but all these opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> I normally am not a fan of Non-Aerosol hairsprays so I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It did not clump when it came out and the texture of the spray was very nice as was the smell!  I use this spray when I curl my hair and it keeps my curls in all day and doesn&#x27;t leave them crunchy like other hair sprays.</li>
    <li> Overall, I liked this hairspray. It did a nice job of adding some body to my curls and held really well through the day. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it made my hair feel a bit dry and straw-like.</li>
    <li> I have been an Aussie product user for years. I swear by their 3-Minute Miracle and enjoy that there is a quality brand that isn&#x27;t at salon prices. I have very thick, wavy hair and have a difficult time finding products that actually work. Aussie comes the closest to the salon brands. When I use this hairspray with mousse, it gives my hair the right amount of hold without being &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and making my hair look like a slicked down mess. It keeps my waves feeling natural. I&#x27;ll continue to use Aussie and this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair that is very thick and I have a hard time getting my curls to stay nice during the day.  This product managed to keep my curls in check.  When used with a diffuser my curls were not crunchy or sticky feeling.  When I used this spray and allowed my hair to air dry it was kind of sticky.  So I recommend drying with a diffuser!  For me because my hair is so thick I don&#x27;t think this is the most effective product.  Mousse gives me better coverage.  I would use this spray as a finishing product or a refresher spray on my hair.  I did find that the spray was drying, but using a leave in conditioner before applying the spray helped with that issue.  Also, the scent wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for, it smelled mostly of alcohol.  I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this under my husband&#x27;s account. I received this from Influenster to try and review. I typically straighten my hair and then curl the ends out. I used this product as a finishing product to hold the style. What I liked about it--it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard and it had some flexibility. I did also try wearing a curl-style ponytail and the curls held well. I&#x27;d buy it again for to use for curls.</li>
    <li> I have used Aussie products in the past and I did not like how it made my hair.  But when I got a sample of the Sprunch hairspray I thought I would give it a try and I was disappointed again with Aussie.  Yes it holds your hair in place, but it also made my hair sticky and crunchy.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for about 10 years and it&#x27;s my favorite hair product when I want wavy hair. There are two ways I&#x27;ve found that work best for me. In the morning after showering, scrunch, spray, air dry until damp, and then use the diffuser attachment on the hairdryer to finish drying set the waves. Spritz all over one more time. I also use this at night before bed. Wash hair, spray, scrunch, air dry until damp, and go to bed. In the morning I either use the hairdryer and diffuser or a curling iron to clean it up a bit. I love that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet or crunchy. The only downside is that my hair is naturally frizzy and it&#x27;s not very good at taming it. However, every time I use this product I get compliments on how nice my hair looks and that I should style it wavy more often. I received this product for free from Influenster, but all opinions are completely my own.</li>
    <li> I first decided to try the non aerosol Aussie Sprunch spray while my hair was slightly damp. It held, but felt very heavy, thick, and stuck my hair together making it look like a rats nest. I immediately re-washed my hair and decides to use it on more of a wet head. First day, I used it in conjunction with mousse; 2nd day, by itself. Both times, it felt so completely different. Very light, and gave my hair a little more &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;. I definitely was shocked. I did test this product at no cost, but this is surely my experience and opinion!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. Not only did I get this to try with no out of pocket cost but it&#x27;s so great for lazy no fuss hair days. I apply it when my hair is damn and mess with my hair a little and bam! All done and ready to go. Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> i used this product to help with my naturally curly/wavy hair. since i wear my hair straight a lot my curls went dead and frizzy. I used this and not only did it help with the frizzing but helped curl my hair. I sprayed and scrunched my hair and than used the diffuser to add some depth and volume. the spray works like a charm with a lil bit of mousse.</li>
    <li> I like this spray because it isn&#x27;t a very strong hold. It&#x27;s just enough to tame a little frizz. If you want something super strong this isn&#x27;t for you. I also like the way it smells. Nice and light. I recieved this for free to test out.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for my fine, wavy hair. My go to style is scrunching my hair after a shower and this product really holds that style and smells FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair so most products don&#x27;t do much to give me body, but Sprunch gave me nice bounce with no stickiness! I didn&#x27;t have any residue build-up and was pleasantly surprised the day after my hair wash when I used Sprunch again and got a lot of the body back! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my curly hair! Now that I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s I am finally starting to appreciate my curly hair and the ease of getting out the door (with 2 kids) in less time than if I straighten my locks. This product helps to get me to that polished curly hair look in less time. I reduce the frizz and seriously have had so many compliments on my curls. I&#x27;ve even re-sprayed my &amp;#34;2nd day hair&amp;#34; and gone to work the next day with just as nice locks as the first (GASP).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did test the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My hair styles wavy fairly easy as long as it has help from a little product.  I generally wash my hair with a curling shampoo to help in the process of getting a more natural, wavy finish.  When I add the sprunch hairspray it really helps the hairstyle hold all day.  I do have to use this with other products to get the look that I want, such as mouse and other curling agents, but this has definitely earned a spot in my waving routine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairspray! I have naturally wavy hair and constantly deal with frizz. I can now wash my hair, use a tad of gel, then when almost dry use this Sprunch spray. My hair looks great and it&#x27;s without spending a ton of time on it, and as a busy mom that&#x27;s very important to me. I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for a couple weeks now and so far always the same results. I plan to always have this on hand for my hair routine!</li>
    <li> Works great on your hair and has a great smell I have used for years and I got my sister using it and it&#x27;s a must at both houses!</li>
    <li> As far as a sprunch spray goes this one is pretty decent.  I tried it with and without mousse.  I definitely like it better with the mousse although it did make my hair a little crunchy.  Without mousse I feel like my hair was a little too frizzy for my liking.  I would have to use way too much to eliminate the frizz.  It smells really good though and made my curls look nice and shiny.  I would definitely consider purchasing in the future.&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer--I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This Hairspray is the bomb y&#x27;all!&lt;br /&gt; I receive this product for free for review purposes but it is my very own personal opinion how I feel about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you that I have the finest , lifeless hair on the whole planet earth, but somehow, I apply this product after showering , scruch it a bit with my fingers up and down and I know I will enjoy the softest wavy hair that no hot tool ever gave me. This stuff works amd it dosen&#x27;t make your hair stiff and crunchy as so many others. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely short hair for a very long time and have just recently been growing it out some - which of course means a whole new beauty regiment &amp; products. When I had short hair I used to buy the big name expensive aerosol hairspray, but as it started getting longer, I wanted to find something that was a little less damaging and a little less like glue - but I have fine hair, so a lot of non-aerosol hairsprays just weigh it down &amp; make it look greasy. I&#x27;ve used Aussie Instant Freeze as my backup for years, so I trust the brand and assumed correctly that this would be exactly what I was looking for! Versatile, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, &amp; gives me a perfect piece-y, wavy look that holds up (I&#x27;ve never been able to &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; my hair before - but this kept it from going too limp). A little of this on my damp hair before I blow dry works wonders to add volume too!</li>
    <li> I use this product a bit differently than advertised.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to tame my fly-aways but still allow my hair to be touchable and bouncy - this product is perfect.  It&#x27;s a great light weight spray that keeps my hair in place!  I did receive this product complimentary, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been an aussie fan and user for 18 years now! I am really impressed with the sprunch spray. The sprunch spray keeps my hair in place yet allows it to maintain movement. The scent is also very flattering without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I got this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in their Vox Box. It is great! It holds my hair great, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry and brittle like other products!</li>
    <li> I received the Sprunch Spray complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. All I can say is I LOVE AUSSIE!!! Where to start. The hold is amazing. I like that each of their products have a scale on what type of hold it gives, because “EXTREME” isn’t always the best. I love the Sprunch Spray for two different reasons. When I curl my hair I know the Sprunch Spray will keep my curls from going flat all day, and it still leaves them soft and springy!!! Secondly, I love to use it as I am drying my wet hair, it is great for that “scrunched” look!!! The smell is also AMAZING. I love all of Aussie’s products. Amazing product, for a great value. Give it a try, you’ll love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a single one of these hairsprays from &amp;#34;influenster&amp;#34; and I am very pleased with the hold of this product!! Great for scrunching!</li>
    <li> I am new to using this product and so far I love it. I have wavy/frizzy hair, but with this Hairspray and I can curl, or even do a little beachy wavy and add some of this product to it and it wont get frizzy at all. It also has a wonderful smell to it. love it and defiantly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster, and I love it a lot! It holds my hair and keeps it bouncy and wavy without being crunchy. The hold is wonderful, and it washes out really easily. It doesn&#x27;t bother my scalp or cause dandruff, like most other sprays I&#x27;ve tried do. This is one of the best hairsprays that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I really like this sprunch hairspray. It really gives you a nice hold without being stiff or sticky. I have curly hair that tends to frizz and this hairspray kept my curls looking soft and frizz free all day.I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave any build up or cause any flaking either which is also something that I love.  It is definitely my new go to hairspray!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for my somewhat wavy hair!  It gave it the &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; wave look thats popular right now!  It has a good smell to it as well!</li>
    <li> Good product. I have curly hair and sometimes I want a soft easy hold. My hair is also frizzy. It&lt;br /&gt;Tamed my frizz for a bit but not all day. I felt like this product worked better when I had my hair in a loose messy bun or ponytail. Or topped with instant freeze hairspray. A nice product of U want to go natural&lt;br /&gt;But you might need to use another product for&lt;br /&gt;Boost. Let me just say that I prefer a crispier hold, so&lt;br /&gt;I may be partial.</li>
    <li> love love this..its the best yet that i have every used.i have thick hair andit holds omg im loving it.thanks for such a great brand.</li>
    <li> While I like the non-aerosol smell of this product, I found that it left me hair a little sticky.  It did hold nicely and tamed my wild frizzies, but the stickiness is a little icky!  I usually use mousse in my hair, and this was stickier than that, but not as sticky as a gel.  It does smell awesome! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray! Normally I hate non-aerosol hairspray but I really do love this one. Normally non-aerosol hairsprays take forever to dry and are sticky. This is one is nether! It dries fast and isn&#x27;t sticky and that is coming from someone that not only has a husky but works with yarn all day. I normally have issues with yarn or dog hair sticking to hair when I have hairspray in but I didn&#x27;t this time. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out, if anything it actually made it softer which is also saying something because I bleach the bottom of my hair regularly so that I can put crazy colors in it. I received a complimentary bottle of Aussie Sprunch from Influenster for sampling/testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I was asked to try and review Aussie Sprunch hairspray from Influenster and i liked it very much!! My hair felt amazing. I felt like my curls came back!! Also you must spray and style fast with this product. Dont wait 15 min after you sprayed. I recommend you trying this product out!!!</li>
    <li> This being a product I frequently see and I have never purchase myself  was excited to get to try this! The product was good and did it&#x27;s job but the scent of this smells like corn tortillas .! I would continue using if it didn&#x27;t have such a bad smell .!</li>
    <li> I have long (down my back) curly hair and the scrunch spray has been great! I can take a shower, put some leave in conditioner in my hair, use the scrunch spray and go. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too stiff or wet looking, there are no flakes, and keeps the frizz away all day! I am definitely a fan of Aussie products and would recommend the scrunch spray to anyone!</li>
    <li> I really like this hairspray.  I have really curly hair and some time its gets out of control.  I sprayed this on while my hair was wet and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry or stiff. My curls were still bouncy.  I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Kept my hair nice and curly. The smell was great and the way my hair felt was great.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Left my curls feeling free and incredible!!! Didn&#x27;t leave them feeling matted down or sticky! I would recommend this product to anyone with curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have fine but wavy hair and am always looking for a product that gives me pretty waves and it doesnt look like I tried so hard. This spray was perfect. It also smells great and did not leave a greasy residue! Love!</li>
    <li> This hairspray holds my curls in all day long and doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy and crunchy feeling like other hairsprays do. Helps me manage my curls all day.</li>
    <li> Sprunch works really well for my wavy hair. I usually spend an hour or more getting my hair straight in the morning. Since ive been using sprunch my hair has been easier to get just right. And the hold is great too. I dont want anything heavy and noticeable but i also want something that will last longer than an hour. This product is exactly what im looking for!</li>
    <li> I currently have very short, thick, straight hair that I am trying to grow out. On my test run this product appeared to offer great hold, but didn&#x27;t give my straight hair any &amp;#34;sprunch&amp;#34;. I think that once my hair gets a little longer and is easier to style, this stuff will be great. Looking forward to trying it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;*I tested this product at no cost. But all opinions are entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I received the AussievSprunch Non-Aerosol Hairspray for testing purposes only. I myself would have to say I love the product all in all. It&#x27;s not a product I use daily, but when needed it does amazing work. I am African American and have natural long thick hair. When I wear braidouts or wash and goes I use the sprunch to define my curls and it definitely does the job. Most sprays have a strong alcohol smell to them, but the sprunch spray smells amazingly wonderful. I don&#x27;t like the light crunch it leaves on my hair, but I do like that it&#x27;s not a strong hold, so it still leaves my hair with enough bounce movement while defining the curls.</li>
    <li> Great scent and flexible hold. It helped my curls hold, but wasn&#x27;t stiff feeling. Not sticky at all!&lt;br /&gt;I do have naturally wavy hair. This spray didn&#x27;t do much for my frizz, but it did help my curls.</li>
    <li> Great sprunch spray! I use it when my hair is wet to scrunch my curls and keep them non-frizzy. I appreciate the pleasant, clean smell and non-greasy, non-crunchy effect on my hair. Great product! I look forward to using the sprunch spray along with the other great Aussie products for a great layering of their unique and fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I use sprunch spray when I want a smooth curly look that holds all day. Spray my hair, scrunch it with my hands, and go. No need to check the mirror later or retouch it. It does feel sticky if your hair isn&#x27;t damp enough but towel dried after a shower is a good way to avoid that. I did get this free to try but the opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I have, naturally, very curly hair. For me, it&#x27;s important to find a nice holding hairspray that works for my curly hair as well as when I straighten it (nothing TOO stiff). I really enjoyed the sprunch hairspray. It was light and did the trick with both my curly and straight hair. I felt that my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the spray and it still had decent movability without being frizzy or dull. Also (huge plus) it wasn&#x27;t sticky as some hairsprays are.</li>
    <li> Just recently tried since i have naturally curly hair i have tried many products to tame my frizzy curls and this has been the first to suceed. I usually straighten my hair cause i could never get my curls to stay looking good all day but  since trying aussie sprunch hairspray i am going to let my curls down love it</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Aussie Sprunch Spray to test and review and I liked it well enough. It has a nice fragrance and it does hold my curls well. I do like my curls to maintain some bounce though and this holds my hair a little more than I like. I will still use this and it will stay in my back up arsenal of hair products. I don&#x27;t think I will be giving up my current hair product for it though. I may have to try other Aussie products to get a softer feel. However, it did hold my hair really well after I braided it and keeping my flyaways down without making me feel like I had a hairspray helmet head!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and a great price too.  Saves me from having to buy at the store so often.</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie Sprunch Hair Spray for my curly hair. I generally either wear my hair up in a bun for work, or down for a more fun look. The Sprunch hair spray lets me maintain my curls and avoid frizz (which my hair tends to do without product). It holds all day, but allows my hair to still move and not feel crunchy or stiff. And on the occasions that I do wear my hair up in a bun, I can still spray the Sprunch hair spray on my hair to keep everything in place and not sticking up all over. Great multipurpose hair spray!    I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair so this Sprunch spray was the just the encouragement my hair needed to stay curly through a night out or a day at work. I have pretty thick hair and it made it look fuller and wavier without crunch or stiff. Plus it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Disclosure: I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly which was nice, but one of the bottles completely leaked all over and not only was half of the bottle gone, but everything is sticky and the front of the bottle is destroyed. The cap came half open. Probably should package your items better. Not really happy I spent money on something I could of gotten cheaper in the store with a full bottle. Wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the normal (aerosol) Sprunch hairspray for a few years now and love it because it has exactly the right amount of hold.  I&#x27;m not sure what else they changed when they changed the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Sprunch product, but this non-aerosol version has no hold whatsoever.  You may as well spritz Aussie-scented water on your hair.  That being said, I have naturally very straight hair, and I think this product is designed more for girls with curls; if you have naturally wavy or curly hair, this might do something for you.  But it does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use hairspray, but I really love this stuff. Gives my hair plenty of hold with a lot of bounce!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and sometimes need an extra pick me up when styling it. As soon as I wash my hair and towel dry it a little, I then spray it onto my damp hair. Then \\&quot;sprunch\\&quot; my hair while blow drying. The spray brings out my natural curls without all of the frizz! It&#x27;s a no fail every time I use it. Perfectly defined ringlets are the end result. Wonderful smell and results- happy consumer! I CAN&#x27;T do without it when styling my hair!I tested this product at no cost, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I&#x27;m loving it it works great with curly hair I also spray a little when I do my daughters hair so it stays in place while&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s at school I&#x27;m loving it and will be buying this regularly!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I use it when I want my crunchy look. Holds curls and is flexible. Perfect for an everyday look.</li>
    <li> I have medium thick wavy curly hair that has a tendency to frizz as it dries but this spray definitely helped remedy that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the hairspray along with my usual leave-in conditioner, and it worked really well! Not only did it add extra bounce to my hair, but it kept my style from frizzing totally out of control. It has just enough &#x27;hold&#x27; without making my hair crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to others with wavy/curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, crazy hair!  When shopping for hairspray I look for a few things: it must smell great, it must tame the crazy and it must rinse clean and not leave buildup. Aussie Sprunch spray fits e bill!  I use it when I want to go curly. After drying my hair a little with a diffuser I use sprunch spray all over and then set the curls with the diffuser. My curls are big and stay all day without being crunchy. I love this spray!</li>
    <li> Very much a fan of the Sprunch spray! I received a free sample to try but after giving it a go, I&#x27;m a fan! Btw these are my views not in any way was this written for receiving the product. Works really well for my curly/ wavy hair. It keeps the curl in tact without drying out my hair or giving that snowy look some hairspray does when you run your hands through your hair. I&#x27;ve used it either with my hair dryer and diffuser or while I let my hair air dry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the way that this spray made my hair feel. I enjoy &#x27;scrunching&#x27; my hair, but I hate the feeling of my hair being crispy or crunchy just to hold the look the way I want. This hairspray held my hair for hours and hours and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling crunchy. It&#x27;s definitely an awesome product! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long heavy hair and no it did not hold my curls at all. However I was able to make pretty waves by spraying while my hair was really wet (not damp) and gently scrunching with my hands. It helps a lot with frizz and I would definitely recommend if you want a more natural look. Downside was that my hair was very greasy looking by the end of the day. I got to try this item for free as a tester but my opinions are completely honest.</li>
    <li> I have wavy think hair and I use this product to get my wavy curls. I spray Sprunch on my hair when it is still wet and then scrunch my hair with gel which turns out perfectly! Great if you already have curly wavy hair!</li>
    <li> I was pretty nervous about using a non aerosol spray, but I was pretty surprised at the result. I use it on damp hair and just scrunch as it&#x27;s drying. Messy, textured (short) hair that stays. It doesn&#x27;t get much easier than that, folks. One product, two simple steps, and you&#x27;re done. How could that not be considered a win?&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost to myself, but this is my own opinion.</li>
    <li> This spray is amazing! Provides a great hold and flexible curl all day long with no crunchy feeling. It has a great smell too. I love that it is so versatile in the amount of hold you want, spray a little get a looser hold, spray a bit more get a much tighter hold. I got to test this product at no cost as part of a Influenster program and was so glad that I did! I am hooked and once this bottle is done, I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It left my hair very flexible and very managable. And soft which i really liked. I will be using this product more often.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. I have been using it for a few years on my permed hair. It gives my waves more definition and the perfect amount of hold. It isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crisp or crunchy. I love the smell too. It even works well when my perm is almost grown out. I would recommend this to anyone with wavy or curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free in an Influenster box. All statements are my own opinions of the product</li>
    <li> I received the Aussie sprunch hairspray last night, I tried it this morning and I loved it!! I am definitely going to replace the current hairspray I have been using for this one! definitely two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Aussie Sprunch Spray to lend texture to my wavy, layered hair for years.  I have tried many different products but ALWAYS come back to the Sprunch Spray.  It is PERFECT and lends just the right amount of texture and hold to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first hairspray that I&#x27;ve used that actually holds a curl in my hair. It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s very light. It&#x27;s an amazing product. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again and sharing it with friends/family.</li>
    <li> i love this product. my hair is wavy and the hold is amazing. i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with thse product. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received this hairspray free from Influenster and I love the way it works with my styles. Sometimes I rock curls and sometimes I rock the famous Snookie bump but with either this hairspray keeps my pieces in place without making my hair feel like a helmet!!</li>
    <li> great for thick frizzy hair like mine keeps the curl not the frizz</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray! Aussie is the best to use when you live in  Humid climate :)</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found so far to hold my natural curls and its not sticky and doesn&#x27;t drip. Its log lasting as well. &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I cannot find the &#x27;minimum hold&#x27; formula at any stores here in Houston so I bought this on Amazon.  I love it!  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough to hold my very fine hair in our wind and humidity but it works great.  It isn&#x27;t so stiff that it looks fake or unnatural.  If you hold your head out the window of your car, I&#x27;m sure your hair will blow out of place but a quick &#x27;hand brushing&#x27; will put it right back where it goes.  It doesn&#x27;t create the mummy-type or fiberglass-like coating like the stronger formulas do.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my sister. I washed my hair at her place and she told me about this scrunch spray. I sprayed it into my hands and gently scrunched it into my hair. My curls became more defined and I noticed more shine to my hair. The curls stayed put throughout the day. The only problem I have with this is that it leaves my hair just a little crunchy. I try to use a little less to avoid that but overall, I really like this products. I liked it enough to buy for myself when I left my sister&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff in bulk. It&#x27;s perfect for my wavy hair and has enough hold to get me through the day without my hair falling. Hoping Aussie doesn&#x27;t discontinue this stuff anytime soon!</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair which has a lot of curl to it. It helps hold shape without frizz but I find it a little sticky. A good choice for the value though.</li>
    <li> I have used Aussie products for years for my thick curly, unruly hair and Aussie Sprunch Hairspray has been a favorite for years.  After I get out of the showed and brush my hair I just spray the Sprunch hairspray and scrunch my curl for a great style that lasts me all day without frizz. The best thing about Aussie products is the wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair. I normally flat iron it straight because finding just the right products to wear it in a more natural state is a task. I tried this sprunch spray after a regular washing and conditioning of my hair. I let my hair air dry and it did not hold the curl. I felt that it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel rock hard like some other sprays do for hold, and even though it is for flexible hold, it did not hold my hair. The second time I used this I used it in conjunction with the Instant freeze hair spray, that did hold the curl amazingly but made my hair feel a little crunchy.</li>
    <li> Its a great product for curly/wavy hair. It helps define curls and cuts the humidity</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since high school which is about 10 year loved it then and love it now. It leaves ur hair not sticky but has the perfect hold. It also smells really good</li>
    <li> I loved this hairspray for when I am trying to get out of the house fast on a busy day! Some days I just don&#x27;t have enough time to worry bout my hair so i just shower, towel dry and now i can use this hair spray for a &amp;#34; messy&amp;#34; look that looks great and hold throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had kinda messy curly/wavy hair that I would have to barrel curl or straighten because most products made my hair crunchy and stiff. I was given this product courtesy of Influenster for review purposes, and personally had my doubts. After towel drying my hair, I spritz some of this into my hair and scrunch it up. It looked pretty beachy-wavy while it was wet, so I went on about my business. I personally don&#x27;t have the time to blowdry or diffuse my hair anymore. So much to my surprise when I catch myself in the mirror an hour later, I had these really pretty waves in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t anything too crazy or wild, but it was this cute carefree happy go lucky hair that I never thought I could attain. The product smells great! and I&#x27;m overall extremely satisfied. I&#x27;ve used it at least twice a week.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I was happy with the results of Aussie&#x27;s Sprunch hairspray. I felt that it maintained my look with ease without a hard sticky feel. I was still able to tussle my hair with my fingers and style it as desired after the product had dried. One thing I wasn&#x27;t too keen on was the spray bottle nozzle. I found this particular nozzle caused the product to spray out in too broad of an area, rather than the aerosol nozzles which have a narrower spraying field, which allows you to concentrate on a particular area. The spray bottle nozzle caused hairspray to go on my neck and shoulders when using it which left a sticky film. I would recommend to spray with a towel draped over your neck/shoulders.</li>
    <li> I used this hairspray as i would any other. While my hair was still damp i sprayed my head. The hairspray itself is amazing in my opinion. If your are someone who dopiest like a lot of hold in there hair this isn&#x27;t for you. It lasted all day for me so more than 8 hours.</li>
    <li> I use this daily it keeps my wavy crunched but soft  I will recommend this to anyone who love beautiful waves and the hair.</li>
    <li> Love the scrunch spray... This is my go to spray when I don&#x27;t have time to straighten or curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a hairspray that allows your hair to bounce and looks natural but still holds my hair without my hair feeling hair crunchy, sticky, or stiff. &amp; it smells great! It is a great hairspray!</li>
    <li> Love this product I normally buy the tres emme brand but when I tried this I liked it now I can easily do my hair because I don&#x27;t have so much time with my kids I&#x27;m always in a hurry and it holds perfect</li>
    <li> I really like the Speunch product from Aussie. I received it complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I spritzed my hair before bedtime and woke up to bouncy waves. The smell is great and it&#x27;s an easy product to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it almost everyday and it gives me perfect curls without the frizz!. This lasts all day and does not leave any residue in my hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this spray because I have natural curly hair and it&#x27;s super frizzy! This helps control the frizz and gives me beautiful curls. I love how my hair feels. It also works great for thick hair. My bonus daughter&#x27;s hair is always very difficult to style and this spray is very good  for her. We are really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I tested this product at no cost and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much because scrunching sprays generally don&#x27;t work great for my hair.  This one was able to get the job done. I sprayed it in before heading to work.  It gave me a nice natural wave without the crisp crunch that I have experienced with other brands. It also smells great! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This sprunch spray is great for achieving the wet, wavy look on rainy days and days I don&#x27;t have time to straighten or deal with curls! It feels light and looks great! The smell is rather strong but not unpleasant. Overall love the product and will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I think I would have benefited more from this produce if my hair was more naturally curly.  I tried this produce on both wet and dry hair, and was disappointed when my hair was sticky and frizzy both times.  I am giving this three stars because I think this product would work well on curly hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you Aussie! Absolutely love this product! It smells wonderful, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get your desired effect. I have super curly hair that is really thick. This is great! I tend to use it more when I have to put my hair up when I&#x27;m working out. It holds great and stays in tact even when I&#x27;m sweating. I would recommend. Thanks Aussie!</li>
    <li> First of all i want to say that i have extremely curly and freeze hair and its really hard to find a product that really works. i wind up spending hundreds of dollars constantly trying new hair care products. I was exited when i was send this product for free to test and write my honest opinion on. Aussie sprunch hair spray is great and affordable choice for soft, laid back curl look. i just sprayed it on damn hair and styled as usual. When my hair dried i had soft and defined curls and it smells great. Only downfall is that it didn&#x27;t last me the whole day, but the weather in NY has been really humid lately. if your hair is not too freeze this is an ideal product for you to try.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster. It is a great product. It gives my hair just enough hold without being too crunchy. It stays great all day. An added bonus is it smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a great hairspray to use when you scrunched your hair, as I did! It has a soft, flexible hold! It could be a little stronger hold, but really was perfect as a medium hold hairspray. However, I really did not like the non-aerosol bottle as I am used to a continuous spray from an aerosol can. If I buy it, it will be in aerosol form as to me it&#x27;s easier to use this way. It held my hair in soft waves very well though and was not at all sticky! (I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own).</li>
    <li> I recieved this scrunch spray to test at no cost but these opinions are my own! I like this product. My hair is pretty wavey and it deffinetly helped hold my curls! It was the right amount of hold for what i need anyways. I have used many product and most make my hair that crunchy hold and this is more of a softer hold and its nice to not have my hair super stiff. It smells really nice also so thats a plus! Im not sure how it would work out for someone with straight hair but for someone with wavey hair like mine i would deffiently recommend this product to them.</li>
    <li> Really like the scent and the long lasting hold.  Used product on towel dried hair and it kept the hold without feeling sticky or too stiff.  I will definitely be recommending this product to friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the Aussie Sprunch spray to try at no cost, but opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aussie Sprunch spray for the past week. My hair has been looking awesome.  I have had so many compliments on my curls,  and how long my hair lasts!  I love this stuff and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Amazing product and amazing results. I live that I spray one time in the morning and my hair is AMAZING all day with Aussie Spunch and Spray!  I couldn&#x27;t imagine living without such an amazing product! ThanKS Aussie! #sprunchnspraygal #bestproductever</li>
    <li> I have straight hair so the only time I would use this product is before I curl my hair and after. Before- because it helps my hair curl. After- so I can scrunch it a little bit and give it the naturally bouncy look. I like it. It stays put. It is not heavy on the hair.</li>
    <li> So I was a little sketchy trying this product, for someone like me who is African American.  I was sure this product would work well for my hair. I wanted this product to keep my hair &amp;#34;sprunched&amp;#34; all day long and keep a look that would not make my hair look dry. My first few hours were great, but the end of the day my hair lacked a decent look. I like the smell of this, which is a plus for me. I will still use this product regardless. I did receive this complimentary,  and my feelings about this Aussie Sprunch spray are completely of my own.</li>
    <li> I use Aussie Sprunch Hairspray on my kids ponytails and braids for the fly aways. It works wonders, especially when I go to pick them up from school and all the running around they do on the playground, I just assumed it wouldn&#x27;t work at all, but when I see what it does to my daughters hair is the perfect hold for kids. Now for me it holds light weight curls, nothing more than that for curling iron curls. Of coarse my fly aways too, when I straighten my hair I always have fly aways in the front and on the top. When I want to be lazy and throw my hair in a ponytail for the day, &amp;#34;Fly-A-Ways No More&amp;#34;. The smell is still as amazing as all the other Aussie products, fresh smelling &amp;#34;you could just stick your nose in your hair all day long&amp;#34;. Its not sticky when you apply it, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on your face or hands. Aussie is a trusted brand and I stand by it to the fullest! I&#x27;ve tested this product at no cost, and all my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was in love with the hairspray. I was looking for something that did not make my hair hard or crunchy when I use it. Which with this product I was very satisfied. It also didn&#x27;t make my hair flake by the next day. My her style held and was still soft. So I would definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Once I discovered Sprunch spray, there was no turning back. I have very thick, wavy hair, and it gives me the most beautiful scrunched look on a daily basis.  I use this product to essentially &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my look after I use a mouse and then hit up my hair with a diffuser. It is amazing! I&#x27;m also constantly getting compliments-- not only on the look/style of my hair, but also on the smell. Great product! If this is ever discontinued I would be totally lost (and would more than likely rock a bun every single day). :-)</li>
    <li> I dreaded wearing my hair curly for most of my life. I had perfectly straight hair until puberty and straighten it often. I absolutely love this product!! I was a bit skeptical being that my hair is frizzy and very curly. But once I tried it I was impressed with the over all look this product helped achieve. I now like to wear my hair curly when I am in a hurry or feeling a little sassy, instead of just a quick wrapped bun when in a hurry! This product is awesome and should be tried on one of your favorite hairstyles for that natural looking touch of beauty. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are definitely my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairspray! I have used a lot of different hairsprays before, and I traditionally used an aerosol spray.  I was a little skeptical to try a non-aerosol, and this product does not disappoint! This is the only spray that keeps my naturally stick straight hair curly when I curl it with my curling iron.  My curls stay all day with this product, and it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy.  It has a natural hold that is strong enough to last me a full day during my nursing shift.  I will definitely be buying this hairspray again!</li>
    <li> For a long time I been looking for a product that would help my curls last for the entire day. Usual I would find my hair looking pretty good for half of the work day but after trying out the product my hair still looked good by the time I made it back in the house. I will keep this product on hand. I love the way my curls looked.</li>
