      <li>I like these rollers better</li>

      <li>They work better than anything he has ever tried.  </li>

      <li>Work great with my Emoji and much better than the blue ones!</li>
      <li>They are great when you first use them but it seems the granular material wears off fast.</li>
      <li>the head that comes with the emjoi at purchase is good, but if you really want to make a difference quickly, these are going to do it--super easy to pop in and out</li>
      <li>The rollers are so easy to change out, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast and effective these were.</li>
      <li>I purchased the emjoi micro pedi nano and these files and my feet are soo amazingly smooth now.</li>
      <li>They will keep your feet smooth if you pedicure and maintain with these</li>
      <li>make my feet feel smooth.</li>
      <li>These green rollers work great!</li>
      <li>I am ticklish and I don&#x27;t trust them to clean the tools, so I prefer doing it myself.</li>
      <li>Just the perfect coarseness to handle very rough skin or quickly smooth with normal pedicure.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product I have ever used, It takes a little bit of time at first</li>
      <li>Thought the generic would not be as good.  </li>
      <li>I loved the Microplane for feet, but it was such a strenuous exercise to get it all off, that I&#x27;d procrastinate on doing it until the skin on my feet were snagging my clothes and bedding</li>
      <li>I really like my Emjoi Mico-Pedi, but was looking for more aggressive rollers.</li>
      <li>I do not have feet that are pampered nor are they sandal ready withoust use of these better than the one with razor</li>
      <li>and they last for quit a good while--</li>
      <li>Love these, they really help my feet</li>
      <li>But fits the device, so not bad.</li>
      <li>These smooth them right off.</li>
      <li>but the fit is not quite right.</li>
      <li>Product is as advertised; arrived quickly; does the job.  </li>
      <li>These do get clogged quickly</li>
      <li>I happily and highly recommend this (and these coarser replacement rollers) to anyone looking to easily combat dry and cracked feet</li>
      <li>These rollers fit but the unit makes a high pitch shreeking sound when it runs.  </li>
      <li>Works perfectly to remove dead old skin!</li>
      <li>The extreme coarse is perfect, works quickly, and doesn&#x27;t damage skin.</li>
      <li>as far as I can tell he is pleased</li>
      <li>Nothing has worked, until I found the affordable, powerful and portable Emoji system.  </li>
      <li>Work great for the first use but they wear down a lot if you have troll feet like I do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great value! I also bought the Power Emjoi Micro-Pedi. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Worked as I expected. Arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> They are great when you first use them but it seems the granular material wears off fast.</li>
    <li> These work so amazing, my feet were what i thought was beyond repair. I was too embarrassed to go to a salon to have a pedicure, and I was not even sure if they could do anything for me. I purchased the emjoi micro pedi nano and these files and my feet are soo amazingly smooth now. I don&#x27;t even know how it is possible but these files work.</li>
    <li> These do get clogged quickly</li>
    <li> This is a most amazing product. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in years! Living in Arizona takes a toll on your skin but with this product and foot cream my problem is solved. It is also very gentle. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for keeping your feet in good shape!</li>
    <li> For this to be extra coarse,  it barely touches the rough skin on my feet. I purchased this as a supplement to the coarse rollers but,  although my feet are not that rough,  it doesn&#x27;t do much and my feet are rougher than they started two days later.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my heels are really bad, cracked, callused, hard sides, and I felt I would need the most aggressive roller to do anything with them. The rollers are so easy to change out, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast and effective these were. Five minutes per heel and I have heels that are softer and smoother than I can ever remember. My heels have always been bad, I can remember smothering them in lotion and covering my feet with socks in HS. My grandma and mom had the same feet, winter, summer, year round. I have tried so many lotions and potions and files and graters but the only thing that came close was heeltastic, which soothed the cracks, healed the sores and made them soft but still callused and cracked. These rollers along with the emjoi nano are nothing short of a miracle for my feet!</li>
    <li> Not that much better than the blue ones that came with it.</li>
    <li> bought these as replacements for my dad. as far as I can tell he is pleased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these for myself and my daughter, we found that  they actually work.  I use them when my skin is dry (golly - no moisture in my skin? - not a problem) before I shower.  They remove the dead skin without the cutting, scraping or whatever else I could think of.  The rollers cause no pain at all, they are safe because there is no digging into the skin.  You can&#x27;t overdo it.  My routine has become using these rollers, washing my feet to remove any remnants of the callous and then applying Surgeons Skin Beeswax Moisturizer.  I now have baby-soft feet.</li>
    <li> Perfect for rough feet</li>
    <li> Much more aggressive than the blue stones. Pedi perfection for an old fat dude.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that these weren&#x27;t made by Emjoi and decided I would try one out before writing this review. I think this roller performs just the same as the brand name does, which is fabulous.  I can have baby soft feet in a matter of minutes and believe me, that is a feat!</li>
    <li> Replacement rollers fit perfectly into the unit, the extreme course rollers were just the right version I needed to tackle a tough job !  Shipping was prompt, and packaging just right.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Looks like I can go further between pedis and keep my feet looking warm weather sandal ready.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the far more expensive brands of rollers. The extreme coarse is perfect, works quickly, and doesn&#x27;t damage skin. I suggest this instead of the finer rollers.</li>
    <li> The best for rough spots.  Use it all the time</li>
    <li> These work very well on the tough areas of my feet.  I hike and work out alot and end up with callouses.  These smooth them right off.</li>
    <li> I love these...they work go good and it makes a difference. I will be buying these again!</li>
    <li> The extreme grit is the best version of this product. I wear slip on shoes very frequently and my heels turn into a dry, cracked mess. Within a few minutes they are super soft after using these. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Do better than what came with my nano, but still don&#x27;t ladt very long</li>
    <li> the head that comes with the emjoi at purchase is good, but if you really want to make a difference quickly, these are going to do it--super easy to pop in and out and they last for quit a good while--if you clean them off and let them dry COMPLETELY, you can get more use out of them</li>
    <li> These green rollers work great! I also have the regular (blue) and the super coarse (dark blue) rollers. I use them all ~ and all work really great. Why did I get all three? Because I&#x27;ve noticed that each roller-type seems to best work on specific areas. But that&#x27;s just my whimsy speaking. You can use only one roller-type on your foot and that will be okay, too. But why not pamper yourself?</li>
    <li> Good as originals, just wish they made an even coarser version.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34; Extreme coarse&amp;#34; are not as good as the &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;.  I won&#x27;t use them anymore.  tried once, that was enough.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried to order these because they were NOT MADE BY EMJOI. I know I read one bad review but, I kept thinking this is not a complicated item so how bad can they screw this up? So I took the chance. I used one of the four pack so far and I had no issues at all. It worked just as well as the ones from EMJOI and cost less. I recommend these if you are using them on a severely callused foot  (LIKE A MAN). lol The thing you have to remember is not to push hard! I think some people think if you push down hard it works faster. NO! If you push hard it will stop the roller from spinning. Lightly just run it across the dry skin and it will do its job safely and quickly.I have decided that this whole system gets my vote for &amp;#34;best invention&amp;#34;. I hate going for pedicures. I am ticklish and I don&#x27;t trust them to clean the tools, so I prefer doing it myself. This system has made it so easy and I have the best pedicure I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> These are amazing.  I go barefoot all the time and my feet show it... these took off a lot more skin than the regular blue ones and still made my feet very smooth.  They work perfectly in my Emjoli and are much cheaper- order them!</li>
    <li> These extreme course rollers do the job in less time. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> These work great, no complaints here, will buy more.</li>
    <li> Have used these in several grades. The coarse works well for me as my feet tend to form rough areas. Works great and price of these replacement rollers is excellent.</li>
    <li> trust me I do not have feet that are pampered nor are they sandal ready withoust use of these better than the one with razor only wish it put moisture in when using</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> They are what they say and fast two day shipping. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> They fit my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano Callus Remover perfectly, and did the job.</li>
    <li> Really works...smooths your skin with NO pain...if you press to hard the emjoi stops working. I would even like the rollers to be more coarse.</li>
    <li> Really good quality.  I am happy with purchase and good quality.</li>
    <li> These work great but I think the difference between extra coarse, ultra coarse, extreme coarse and all the other coarse versions (too many!) is very small.</li>
    <li> Great item and fits my device. I WILL order more in the future. It&#x27;s also a good price.</li>
    <li> These work wonders on my extra thick rough heels. Just the right grit for me. The other grits aren&#x27;t quite enough. Have purchased these several times now.</li>
    <li> These work OK, not as good as the originals.  They make a strange sound when in use which the originals do not.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> really eats away all the dead skin and very safe to use.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using one on the 4 but it seems  to work just as good as the other like extreme coarse roller</li>
    <li> These are more coarse than the ones that come with the micro pedi I think they both work great, nice to have the extra coarse ones when my heels get very rough. I use the coarse ones once then use the others as maintenance.</li>
    <li> work as well as the ones from Emjoi for half the price......</li>
    <li> These are the most effective on my crappy thick heels! Im finally ahead of this game and with a price point i can accept</li>
    <li> I have been plagued by rough feet my entire life.  If I had the time and money, I&#x27;m sure weekly pedicures would solve the issue, but I have tried every file/razor/cream etc in order to keep them looking lovely during the weeks I go between salon treatments.  Nothing has worked, until I found the affordable, powerful and portable Emoji system.  I happily and highly recommend this (and these coarser replacement rollers) to anyone looking to easily combat dry and cracked feet</li>
    <li> Love them. Great value.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly to remove dead old skin! My feet look and feel great again! I love it!</li>
    <li> These work OK, but I guess I was expecting something a little more aggressive.  I really like my Emjoi Mico-Pedi, but was looking for more aggressive rollers. I can&#x27;t tell much difference between these and the regular ones that came with the Emjoi</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money,,,terrible product :(</li>
    <li> Great addition to my new Emjoi pedi regimen.</li>
    <li> I have an Emjoi unit.  These rollers fit but the unit makes a high pitch shreeking sound when it runs.  They also don&#x27;t seem to do much different than the Super Course I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;But the loud noice is really annoying. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this manufacture again.</li>
    <li> Works better than the regular rollers and not too course.</li>
    <li> Works great, quickly and painlessly removes callouses I get on feet.  I use about every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Item received as described! Works Great!</li>
    <li> Work great with my Emoji and much better than the blue ones!</li>
    <li> My husband uses the Extreme rollers for foot calluses--extreme foot calluses!  They work better than anything he has ever tried.  Battery powered devices just don&#x27;t do the job and aren&#x27;t coarse enough.  Good product.</li>
    <li> These work well but the fit is not quite right. I have an emoji and the fit is loose.</li>
    <li> They work better than the original rollers but not by a lot. I must have the worst feet on the planet because I can use this each week and spend an hour getting the dead skin off. I like these rollers better but they aren&#x27;t THAT different in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These are MUCH more coarse then the stock ones (blue) they almost feel prickly like a cactus. They work much faster than the blue ones, so you should probably be more careful when using them. These are definitely for the hard hard heels. highly recommened if first time using EVER and need to sand down some seriously calluses.</li>
    <li> Worked better than the blue ones that come with the gadget.  Much faster.</li>
    <li> Not much different than the original blue ones. But fits the device, so not bad.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised; arrived quickly; does the job.  I am totally satisfied!</li>
    <li> Love love love my Emjoi. So glad they have come out with the coarse roller. It really works  so well. Will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> They work well but I did not see a whole lot of difference between the regular rollers and these.</li>
    <li> THE&lt;br /&gt;ROLLER WAS TOO WIDE FOR THE MICRO PEDI  AND  IT WOULD NOT TURN FAST ENOUGH TO WORK. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> I have nasty feet.  I mean, really nasty feet.  They split and crack and hurt and look just awful.  When I couldn&#x27;t afford frequent (weekly) pedicures, the ladies in the salon would treat me ugly because my feet are so nasty to work on.  I don&#x27;t blame them.  I became too embarrassed to even get professional pedicures.    I loved the Microplane for feet, but it was such a strenuous exercise to get it all off, that I&#x27;d procrastinate on doing it until the skin on my feet were snagging my clothes and bedding and I just couldn&#x27;t take it any more.    In comes the micro-pedi.  Add the Extreme Course Rollers, (These cheap imitation replacements work GREAT), and I now can do my feet often because it&#x27;s not so strenuous.  It does take a little patience, but my feet are so difficult that nothing else even comes close.  My husband likes my feet again...and so do I! :)</li>
    <li> Love these, they really help my feet</li>
    <li> Really works well for troublesome areas on the feet.  Good to use first time then use the extra coarse for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Great product gets the job done nicely without a lot of time. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> These work great for rougher feet.  Go over my feet with these green ones, and then change to the blue ones to smooth them out.  When i was using just the blue ones, i had to do it a lot longer to get the same result, and that made the blue ones wear out faster.</li>
    <li> works wonders for my rough calloused feet . GREAT product</li>
    <li> Fantastic for dry cracking feet</li>
    <li> Great price and product.</li>
    <li> I have the older micro ped and its great. I just. started ordered the extreme coarse refills and I can&#x27;t say enough about this product it really works well remove all of the dry hard skin from my feet and they are baby soft. Great product.</li>
    <li> Not genuine replacement rollers. Don&#x27;t fit perfectly so the roller rubs. Very annoying. Grit is ok.</li>
    <li> not as coarse as I would like., but does a decent job.</li>
    <li> These are as good as the original.  Just the perfect coarseness to handle very rough skin or quickly smooth with normal pedicure.  Fits emoji and seems easier to clean than the other sizes. Could probably suffice as the only size needed for less regular pedicures as opposed to biweekly high-maintenance pedi people.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I like them.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t find these extreme they are very similar to the blue regular ones. I would skip this and go straight to the next step up.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used, It takes a little bit of time at first but when you keep up this keeps your heals nice...I use these because I have always  have had this problem. Heels used to crack so bad I could not walk as it hurt so much...I would tell anyone with this problem, to try the Extreme Coarse as they work faster for removing callous  skin.</li>
    <li> These are not genuine Emjoi replacement rollers. They come in \\&quot;The Pedi-Store\\&quot; packaging and do not have the Emjoi insignia on the roller ends. This may be why some reviewers don&#x27;t rate them highly. I&#x27;m not even opening them, I&#x27;m returning in favor of the real thing and I&#x27;m tired of companies being able to get over on consumers by using the word \\&quot;Compatible\\&quot;. Since I wrote this review, they&#x27;ve added the term \\&quot;generic\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> very pleased!  works great!</li>
    <li> These work great. I use them with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi for the feet. This is the best price I was able to find on them and I did some shopping around.</li>
    <li> I bought the micro-pedi so ended up buying the replacement rollers with varying degrees of coarseness. At the end of the day, it gets a bit costly to keep buying the rollers and the micro-pedi was not as effectively as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> These are NOT the same as the real  replacement rollers for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  They dull much faster need to be replaced much more frequently.  Buy the real ones, and save yourself time and money.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! make my feet feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Smooth feet, even gave as a birthday gift to my son in law,  as he wanted one badly as he works in lawn care</li>
    <li> Feet don&#x27;t fell me now! No more embarrassing feet, I can wear sandals with confidence.</li>
    <li> bog the motor when you turn it on will by orginal brand next time.</li>
    <li> Affordable Emjoi replacement heads.  Such a great convenience to click and buy, and have my product show up in the mail the same week.  Excellent resource.</li>
    <li> Thought the generic would not be as good.  I was wrong. I walk barefoot all the time, even on my driveway.  These work. Don&#x27;t expect miracles if you haven&#x27;t maintained your feet or haven&#x27;t had a prof pedicure in awhile. They aren&#x27;t going to slice off callouses. They will keep your feet smooth if you pedicure and maintain with these</li>
    <li> works beautifully in Emoji, fast shippment.</li>
    <li> These are the best but always get on sale, I got 4 for $14 but they do work and get the machine that plugs in rather than the battery operated.</li>
    <li> More effective than the less coarse rollers with the MICROPEDI ROLLER</li>
    <li> Work great for the first use but they wear down a lot if you have troll feet like I do.</li>
    <li> The extreme coarse rollers work much better and faster than either the super coarse or the &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; rollers that come with the Micro Pedi unit. I will definitely order more of these when I need them.</li>
    <li> They work great but they make a very loud noise because they don&#x27;t fit as tight as the original.</li>
