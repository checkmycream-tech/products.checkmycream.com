<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Ok, I didn&#x27;t see any different</li>
    <li> These really do work! Hints the name it works! People selling on Amazon have them a little too high priced though. I found a friend that sells them for $59 a box of 4 at [...]    Pros- quick and easy in 45 minutes.  -you see immediate results and they keep working for 72 hours.  -super easy to apply yourself  -you can use them anywhere on your body  -they are made with botanical ingredients  -cheaper than going to the salon for a body wrap    Cons- sometimes you have to complete 2 before you see the results.</li>
    <li> I have recently gotten into the It Works products.  I started my journey at 229 pounds and am now down to 158!  This has been an experience - some days good, some bad.  Throughout my journey, I didn&#x27;t really change my diet but I did change what I was doing.  I exercised at least 5 days a week and I started using It Works products.  When I lost the weight, I needed to tighten up.  I started using the body wraps and was pleasantly surprised at how my stomach and arms started to look.  I started taking New You to build lean muscle and was just as amazed by that product.  I have regularly started adding other It Works products to my daily regimen and could not be happier.  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have never felt or looked better in my entire life.  The journey is not easy but the products definitely boosted my results, my ego, and my appearance.  I recommend you do not buy from Amazon/Ebay/Craigslist etc.  Buy from a distributor that knows what they are talking about.  I buy mine from (...).  She is living proof that the products work and extremely knowledgeable.  She doesn&#x27;t just care about selling me the products - she cares about how to help change your life.  I have changed mine for the best and have a new friend from the experience.  Try it for yourself and see if these products are right for you.  Ask her for her before/after photos so you can see what the products have done for her, and her customers.</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have bought two boxes and I just wasted $160......</li>
    <li> I love the it works wrap, at first I thought it was a water loss wrap but I was wrong ! I was a skeptics for like 2 years !!! What was I thinking ? When I finally give it a tried I was completely amazed. Thanks to the wraps I don&#x27;t feel self conscious when I put on my bikini !!!! Yasssss</li>
    <li> This product, I have been heard amazing things about. But this didn&#x27;t works to me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it. You gonna loose your time and money!!</li>
    <li> Product does not work. I followed the instructions exactly and nothing happened. I reached out to the seller, and the seller advise I did not follow directions. There were no other directions except for how to put it on and for how long. Apparently there were more instructions to follow that were not included (which would of been helpful). If I could get a refund, I would&#x27;ve done so. Apparently there is nothing the seller could do. No refunds since I used the product. I am very unhappy.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! It gives the illusion that it works but very temporarily tightening the area you use it on.  You are expected to drink a lot of water which by doing that has a slimming effect on its own.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> until midnight tonight ( 5/22) $99 8 wraps from someone who has knowledge to tell you how to use them CORRECTLY and 4 mini tubes of defining gel and fab wrap winslowteach at gmail dot com</li>
    <li> No benefit of its uses</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 boxes of wraps from a distributor, not on Amazon. However, it is such a scam that I felt motivated to warn people here since there is no way to warn consumers through the distributor. These wraps do not work, plain and simple. I did not notice any difference after 4 wraps and did not bother to use the rest. Same with their fat fighter pills. I was on a diet when I used these products and lost 1 pound per week. Before using the products I had already lost some weight and once I stopped using the products I kept losing weight at the exact same pace. The products made no difference. My sister tried the products after I stopped using them. She made no changes to her diet or exercise routines, she also achieved absolutely no results with this scam.</li>
    <li> Pyramid scheme products sometimes work (cutco knives weren&#x27;t that bad) but this isn&#x27;t one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not going to help you lose weight (do your research). It may help with water retention, but you&#x27;re better off using saran wrap than believing everything you hear from a salesman and buying into this snake oil stuff.</li>
    <li> works if you follow all the instructions (only availalbe through a distributor) thats why most people on here have bad reviews from &amp;#34;not having all the directions&amp;#34; ALSO, much cheaper from a distributor. Message me any questions mariannav920@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this item.</li>
    <li> They were great!  Totally blew me away when I saw the results.  If you have problem areas, don&#x27;t hide them, wrap them!</li>
    <li> Product does not work, please save your money.</li>
    <li> These wraps are amazing!! Before you use them lookup It works wrap tips and tricks! I&#x27;ve seen awesome results! loosened the pants, better definition, and shrank the belly.  if you go to this website and sign up as a seller you get a load for only $100    [...]    Business Builder Kit includes:  Half size Fab Wrap (1)  Defining Gel 1/2 oz. Sample (4 pack)  Ultimate Body Applicator wraps (4 pack)  Until Friday 5/22 extra 4 wraps! (8 total)  #IW Adventure bracelet (1)  Country-specific Business Tools  1st Month eSuite and replicated website free  Makes you commission qualified for the month you join    If you tell your friends about it and they order stuff you could earn $120 free stuff from them too! You should see the pile of stuff I got for free! All kinds of perks and bonuses too!</li>
    <li> I ordered these and they didn&#x27;t work. I ordered a second pack to soon after to see if maybe it was a late body response. I did everything correctly, drank half my body weight in water, I had showered prior, everything. But it didnt show any of my gym progress. No inches lost or weight.</li>
    <li> Tried these before and honestly got better results the first time and I only used 2. Did everything the same but these ones didn&#x27;t work as good. Wrapper said it was It Works but not really sure after using them. Did see toning after the 3rd one so still good. No inches lost like before.</li>
    <li> I could instantly see results after using product. Easy to apply &amp; clear directions.</li>
    <li> good seller, good product</li>
