      <li>Package arrived and it was in original packaging, unbroken seal; same stuff I&#x27;d get at the store but about $30 cheaper!</li>
      <li>The seller ships quickly and the same item pictured is what you get.</li>
      <li>She said the printing on the box was the first indication that this was not the actual Coach product.  </li>
      <li>I am 28, and this is not too young or old of a scent for me!</li>
      <li>She said the scent is similar, but definitely not the real thing.  </li>
      <li>The only difference between the real thing and this cologne is the perfume costs double</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Alas, it seems I the wrong type of Coach.  It would have been nice to have known that there were different Coach scents with almost the same name.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance ever!!</li>
    <li> after a few sprays i decided i didnt like it anymore. not overpowering or anything, just &amp;#34;old lady like&amp;#34; after a while i guess. cant think if what it truly reminds me of, but &amp;#34;poppy&amp;#34; collection has a much nicer smell to it</li>
    <li> The smell was not what I had imagined.  I smell the product in a store and the one I got smelled liked it was old.</li>
    <li> I love this smell!!! The seller ships quickly and the same item pictured is what you get. I am 28, and this is not too young or old of a scent for me!</li>
    <li> This perfume is great. I love the smell. It&#x27;s really good for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;A little poof goes long. It wont wear off easily.</li>
    <li> Scent is very nice not overpowering.  I have a problem with many perfumes, can even be standing behind someone in line at&lt;br /&gt;the store and my sinus starts getting tight eyes will start to tear. My throat gets tight and I start to cough.  Does not happen often but&lt;br /&gt; I am careful to try a sample before I buy.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for a dear friend.  I will have to get her opinion.</li>
    <li> This smells so classy and lovely! Kind of floral, just super feminine and stylish. Love it so much! ... But there is a dupe out there! Go to Big Lots and try to find \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; which is their impression of this scent. Smells exactly the same, and I got 3.4oz plus a body wash and lotion for $5. :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift (2012).  Yesterday she opened the box  and advised me that this is a knock-off..she said.one would not know unless comparing to the actual Coach item which she does have. She said the printing on the box was the first indication that this was not the actual Coach product.  She said the scent is similar, but definitely not the real thing.  My daughter-in-law is a real Coach fan.....purses, shoes, etc and would never buy a knock-off.</li>
    <li> The only difference between the real thing and this cologne is the perfume costs double and there is a real coach chain hanging from the bottle .. I am very satisfied and think this company will bend over backwards to help. I wouldn&#x27;t have cared if it was a week late because its worth waiting for ...so for all you dissatisfied whiners, Get Over It!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is OK. The smell just doesn&#x27;t linger on me so you can&#x27;t tell that I have it on.</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever, bought one for my daughter too.</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Been wanting this perfume since I sampled it at Sephora! Price was right &amp; now it&#x27;s mine. Love it.  Beautiful playful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I t was a gift...she loved it!</li>
    <li> My mom loved it and I loved the price!!! Beats going to the store and going out there shopping. I don&#x27;t know how it smells yet ill find out later but looks like the real thing.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance! Definitely my favorite one!</li>
    <li> I first received Coach Signature Eau De Toilette Spray as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift from my son. I just loved it and this is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered it.</li>
    <li> Great scent, blending soft, fresh fruits and florals, warm hints of amber.. Nice looking bottle and package..&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for anytime and all occasions...</li>
    <li> I had this at home, liked it. Then purchased the real coach. Smells very similar, just doesnt last as long. Just have to reapply more often. Soft smelling, good at work or out for the evening.</li>
    <li> Its definitely a summer perfume. It smells like honeysuckles</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume, but within a couple of hours, the scent can&#x27;t be detected.  Very disappointed.</li>
