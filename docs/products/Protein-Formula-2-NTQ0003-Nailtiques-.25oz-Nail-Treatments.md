<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
<li> I have read a few reviews saying that the product peels, but I have never had this problem</li>
<li> They appear to be stronger and thicker and have grown slightly longer than usual.</li>
<li> Extremely small bottle for the price.</li>
<li> been using this for years, and when my nails won&#x27;t grow, or are weak, I can rely on Nailtiques.</li>
<li> The nail was so weak it would start to split and catch on everything!</li>

    <li> Have used this product forever and it works.  What happened to the smaller packaging?</li>
    <li> First of all it arrived  in 3 days. It&#x27;s great product. I have been using Sally Hanson for about 8 month, NO result. Since i bought Protein Formula #2 and i use it about 3 weeks, I see that my nails got really strong and long... So i highly recommend this product.!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and it is wonderful. Really makes a difference, especially for those that used to have artificial nails. I wore them for many years and the damage ... well, let&#x27;s say my natural nails had a loooong way to recovery. This is the only product, out of MANY, that I had/have tried that really made a difference. My nails no longer split or peel, they strong yet pliable. This product is not an overnight cure but will get your nails looking nice quicker than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m a manicurist, so I really do know from where I speak in the most professional manner. Fabulous product!!!</li>
    <li> this is the only product that keeps my nails strong, they do not chip or get brittle anymore. love it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful produce.  Does what it says. I&#x27;ve used similar products in the past that have not worked on my nails.  Cost if very reasonable compared to the stores.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product, made my nail peel even more.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have found to strengthen weak nails. Watch out for the imposters, only buy nailtique.</li>
    <li> In 2 weeks my nails have improved drastically! I had cracked nails on my toes for years, and after a few weeks of applying this product, the cracks are almost all gone. I use it for my finger nails too, and I definitely feel them to have grown stronger, no to mention faster. I haven&#x27;t tried many products, but I definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love acrylic nails I&#x27;ve used them since I was in high school so my nails are like paper! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I have noticed my nails improve. I recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Extremely small bottle for the price. Did not notice any improvement in my nails. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> been using this for years, and when my nails won&#x27;t grow, or are weak, I can rely on Nailtiques. It works!</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I did not get the same WOW results that some of the other reviewers got. I have had weak, flaky nails since I was a kid (never did gels) and thought this wonder product would finally grow out my nails and prevent nail chipping. I&#x27;ve been using it around a month now and have gotten OK results. My nails have definitely been able to grow out longer and are overall less flaky, but not necessarily stronger. I don&#x27;t think I would re buy this when I finish out the bottle.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this works! I have one nail on each hand that has been splitting right down the middle for several years----getting worse lately. The nail was so weak it would start to split and catch on everything! From the first application of this formula #2 my nails have not split.  I have been able to let them grow again. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Just ordered a .5 oz bottle for me and another for my daughter. Will never be without this again.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.....just got to give it time....and you will see beautiful nails sooner then soon :) I will order again in the bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Think I got my reviews mixed up, but I have bot ever purchased a nailtique  product that was not a superior product. Items arrive as promised, no damage.</li>
    <li> If you have soft nails and your polish is forever chipping, this is the answer. Use Nailtiques as a base coat and a top coat and your manicure will last longer and your nails will get so much stronger. I love this product and was delighted to find it on line.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now and I can already see a bit of a difference in my nails, which says a lot because my nails have always peeled and split very easily.

I have read a few reviews saying that the product peels, but I have never had this problem (it has always gone on just like clear nail polish). I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a month or two!</li>
    <li> Very very good producy</li>
    <li> This product has saved me several times.  As I age, my nails have become brittle, peeling and split.  Use Nailtique for about six weeks and nails become healthy again.  Love it!</li>
