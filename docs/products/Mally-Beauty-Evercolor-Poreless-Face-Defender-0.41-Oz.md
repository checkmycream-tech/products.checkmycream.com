### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is a great alternative to powder!  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product at all!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>BEST EVER TO SET YOUR MAKE UP</li>
      <li>But the product is great: shine coverage without looking like coverage.</li>
      <li>My sister recommended this product and I could not be happier with how it keeps my makeup looking great all day.</li>
      <li>Probably a great product in a drier climate.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>It also caused itching and a very warm feeling on my face, as it was not allowing my face to breathe.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased...</li>
      <li>Love this Mally  Face Defender, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Try at your own risk.</li>
      <li>So you have to add it very lightly</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Great item and really works</li>
      <li>and you go through it very quickly.</li>
      <li>The compact with the hidden sponge is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Use the sponge to pick up product from the compact and then apply, tapping lightly over your made up face.</li>
      <li>This product did make my skin look fabulous but seemed to cause my skin to break out</li>
      <li>Apply after makeup and your face and pores look really smooth.</li>
      <li>Still looks fresh when it&#x27;s time to remove it.</li>
      <li>Right now, it is spring season.</li>
      <li>This product seemed promising first couple of times, then all it did was turn my skin oily!</li>
      <li>In my opinion if you really need a product to keep your face from being greasy this is it!</li>
      <li>My face feels soft and smooth with no oily residue.  </li>
      <li>Delivers exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>A lil bit of the product over the shiny areas on my face, really lasts.</li>
      <li>and my face seemed to look much whiter..</li>
      <li>I live in a humid climate (south Florida) and the pore defender certainly \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; in my makeup, but it also made me feel like I was wearing a mask.  </li>
      <li>It provides a smooth look and during the colder months, keeps my skin from looking too dry like it does with powder.  </li>
      <li>The only draw back is that I have oily skin, so during hot, humid months, too much of the product will leave my face greasy.  </li>
      <li>just a little bit on the provided sponge applicator applied over makeup (or without) leaves a smooth finish, eliminating that powder/makeup in the crinkles look.  </li>
      <li>My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
      <li>For the price, and how long it has lasted for me - I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>no shine only a soft dewy look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;d never used this before, but saw a write-up in a magazine (not an ad) and decided to try it...gather it was sold QVC, which I don&#x27;t shop.  I&#x27;m very pleased...just a little bit on the provided sponge applicator applied over makeup (or without) leaves a smooth finish, eliminating that powder/makeup in the crinkles look.  If I run my hand over my face and it feels like baby&#x27;s skin, and it seems to last.</li>
    <li> AWSOME NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!!!!  BEST EVER TO SET YOUR MAKE UP</li>
    <li> Love this product. My sister let me try hers and I was hooked. Apply after makeup and your face and pores look really smooth. Great item and really works</li>
    <li> Been using it a few years. Can&#x27;t go without it. Make-up stays put all day. Still looks fresh when it&#x27;s time to remove it.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid climate (south Florida) and the pore defender certainly \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; in my makeup, but it also made me feel like I was wearing a mask.  It also caused itching and a very warm feeling on my face, as it was not allowing my face to breathe.  Probably a great product in a drier climate.</li>
    <li> This product did make my skin look fabulous but seemed to cause my skin to break out so I discontinued using it.</li>
    <li> Delivers exactly what it says it will. My horribly oily skin stays looking lovely with this product. I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great alternative to powder!  It provides a smooth look and during the colder months, keeps my skin from looking too dry like it does with powder.  The only draw back is that I have oily skin, so during hot, humid months, too much of the product will leave my face greasy.  Otherwise, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes your skin feel like silk.  My only complaint is it&#x27;s pricey and you go through it very quickly.</li>
    <li> In my opinion if you really need a product to keep your face from being greasy this is it! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  used this product for some time and like how it completes the makeup process</li>
    <li> I bought this two years ago and I keep it in my purse for touch-ups when my foundation feels alittle shiny... and I love it! I still have some left and it feels like it has lasted for so long! A lil bit of the product over the shiny areas on my face, really lasts. For the price, and how long it has lasted for me - I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Use the sponge to pick up product from the compact and then apply, tapping lightly over your made up face. The result is that your pores seem to disappear and your skin feels like silk. Leaves no shine only a soft dewy look. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
    <li> Well, that is not exactly what I was expected, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. When you put it on, it instantly get rid of the shine&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;3 .Does not have any scent.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. It makes my face a little too white. So you have to add it very lightly&lt;br /&gt;2. It only last about 1 hour or 2, not even. Note: that I have extremely oily skin, maybe that why it does not last.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to prepare myself for the summer, b/c that&#x27;s when my skin get extremely oily (like a mirror). However I wonder, if it&#x27;s going to help at all, when summer comes. Right now, it is spring season. The weather is around the 30 to low 60</li>
    <li> Love this Mally  Face Defender, it&#x27;s great.  My face feels soft and smooth with no oily residue.  The compact with the hidden sponge is perfect.  I don&#x27;t have to carry it in my purse because one application in the morning last all day.</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff would work well for keeping shine down, but it just made my foundation crease around my eyebrows, nose, and under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Bad compact: it breaks constanly (I use a rubber band to hold mine together, and no, it was not traveling or in the bottom of a makeup bag). But the product is great: shine coverage without looking like coverage.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and hope this will help. It does BUT I get tons of little acne all over my face after 3 days of using. Try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this product and I could not be happier with how it keeps my makeup looking great all day.</li>
    <li> This product seemed promising first couple of times, then all it did was turn my skin oily! For some odd reason. Plus it felt caky after a while and my face seemed to look much whiter.. Wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product at all!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so wanting to buy it for a long time and I was truly disappointed.</li>
