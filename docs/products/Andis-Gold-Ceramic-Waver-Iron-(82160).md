      <li>I also recommend using some kind of heat protecting hair product with this to minimize heat styling damage.  </li>
      <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the one thing to keep in mind is the kind of wave</li>
      <li>It came with directions that were very easy to follow and helped me get started.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, they said it was very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love this tool for creating waves in both my hair, and I also used it on my granddaughter</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that someone with more experience might have fared better with that tool than I did, but it was too tricky for me, even with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Okay, maybe you have to be a rocket scientist to figure this Andis Gold Ceramic Waver Iron out, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so glad I purchased</li>
      <li>part your hair into two sections, top and bottom.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a much better option than a hair waving wand for creating defined waves and recommend it.</li>
      <li>This curling iron is convertible, which I love.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First, they love how durable it is.</li>
      <li>Okay, then on to the top section....</li>
      <li>I’m glad I did because they love it.</li>
      <li>My daughters especially loved it for their long hair, and have created some really cute hairstyles, even up-dos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well-made and sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Even with practice I had a good section at the root and tip that was still very straight.  </li>
      <li>I was extremely excited to try this waver iron!  </li>
      <li>Still, it was kind of fun, and I will use this on occasion.</li>
      <li>They both have thick hair and it gave them very nice, beautiful waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To make it great, I wish it had more surface area to make it go faster for those with long hair :)</li>
      <li>design of the iron makes it easy to hold, and manage.  </li>
      <li>It also warms up very quickly, which is a plus when strapped for time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The controls are easy to operate.</li>
      <li>(mine is fine, her&#x27;s is thicker and fuller).</li>
      <li>But for the more skilled, I could see this being great for traveling when you may want to cut down on the number of hair styling tools you bring with</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally, the final product looked great.</li>
      <li>I think it would go much more quickly with practice and full attention).  </li>
      <li>It is designed so that I very rarely accidentially touch it and burn my skin.</li>
      <li>Decently priced, works great, and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage your hair much.</li>
      <li>I have four young, \\&quot;tween\\&quot; daughter who were more than willing to experiment with this waver and they really loved this one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product for any woman wanting waves in her hair with minimal hassle.</li>
      <li>It works best when sectioning the hair on thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I love how fast this curling iron heats up.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
      <li>Which if that is the look you are hoping to achieve, is certainly not a bad thing.  </li>
      <li>I also love that it makes such interesting patterns in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Because of the large size of these plates, I don&#x27;t think it will be easy to use on hair</li>
      <li>The plates heat up very quickly and this was ready to go in just a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>My hair is shorter (chin length) and my granddaughter has long hair, but it worked wonderfully on both cuts, as well as different types of hair</li>
      <li>It works pretty quickly: it took me about 20 minutes to do my whole head of hair (and that was with a first use, and I was watching baseball playoffs at the same time, lol.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the $40 price tag.</li>
      <li>My daughters are having so much fun with this waver iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a bit of fun</li>
      <li>Gets super hot</li>
      <li>Heats quickly, and it gets pretty hot on the higher setting.  </li>
      <li>I like how easy it is to get soft waves from an iron.</li>
      <li>I also wish that it had a stand to rest the hot iron.  </li>
      <li>and they lasted about 2 days, which is about two days longer than the waves made with my Hot Tools 3 barrel waver.</li>
      <li>It took FOREVER to heat, the lights in our house were flickering (newer house, newer wiring), and it smelled funny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third, it’s pretty versatile, creating two types of waves, having variable heat settings, and even doing curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This iron achieves pretty defined waves.  </li>
      <li>This creates really soft, light waves.</li>
      <li>They used it on their little sister with fine hair, and it was adorable.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t going to be published) hair dryer without the diffuser (which left it straight).  </li>
      <li>My older girls, 13 and 14 years old, found this really easy to use.</li>
      <li>One nice thing about this waver is it offers you a choice of two different depths depending on the type of wave you are going for.  </li>
      <li>I had to use a ceramic dish from my own kitchen to set the hot iron down.</li>
      <li>Heats up very fast and i was able to do all my hair in about 10 minutes(i have really long, straight hair, and LOTs of it)</li>
      <li>I have very wavy/</li>
      <li>, here I sit with straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair was straight.  </li>
      <li>pretty cool feature that gives you a choice, rather than having to buy two different wavers.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants a quality waver iron for a decent price.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair, and I look forward to using it again with some kind holding gel or a longer lasting look.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to approximate anything that looks like a more natural wave.  </li>
      <li>after a minute or two, moved it down and repeated until the top section was finished.  </li>
      <li>, I also liked that this heated up quickly and maintained heat well, even when styling my thick and long hair.  </li>
      <li>I only clamped down on my hair for about 5 to 7 seconds and was able to do my whole head in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And, I especially like the convertibility for travel: more stuff, less space.  </li>
      <li>I did have to use a high temp setting (almost max) to get the curls to come out, and there is no low, medium, and high setting to gauge, just a positive/negative dial.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The curls are soft and defined.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I much preferred this waver iron to the Remington waving wand.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping this would do well to touch up stray areas of my head that mysteriously went straight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty large and the plates are fairly heavy duty and this is reflected in the weight.</li>
      <li>I think the previous reviewer who described this as looking \\&quot;kind of perm-y\\&quot; is dead on.  </li>
      <li>On handling it, its pretty big and bulky I had a hard time using it right handed.</li>
      <li>found this waver iron to be much easier to use, even with minimal practice.  </li>
      <li>The shallower waves are better for everyday, to wear your hair down.</li>
      <li>- I have naturally curly hair, so I blew it dry with my</li>
      <li>Makes big nice waves or subtle small ones.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Decently priced, works great, and doesn&#x27;t seem to damage your hair much.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using a styling tool to create waves in my hair.  My previous experience has been with [[ASIN:B00BQYMCYQ REMINGTON T Studio SILK Ceramic Elliptical Styling Wand / CI96Z1 /]], which as the name suggests is a waving wand and not a waving iron so this review will compare my experience with these two different tools.  Overall, I much preferred this waver iron to the Remington waving wand.  My biggest issue with the waving wand is that for a hair styling novice, it was tricky to use.  Without a clamp you have to hold the hair on the wand yourself using the provided glove which minimizes dexterity and doesn&#x27;t even fully protect the hand from heat.  I found my hair was frequently slipping off and it was tricky to get waves from root to tip.  Even with practice I had a good section at the root and tip that was still very straight.  I&#x27;m sure that someone with more experience might have fared better with that tool than I did, but it was too tricky for me, even with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this waver iron to be much easier to use, even with minimal practice.  Working in sections you simply hold the tool horizontally and  clamp down over hair and continue working until you have tackled your entire head to create wave.  One nice thing about this waver is it offers you a choice of two different depths depending on the type of wave you are going for.  You can also use it as a clampless curling iron as well, which expands its functionality.  I&#x27;m not skilled enough with a clampless curling iron to give up my traditional curling iron.  But for the more skilled, I could see this being great for traveling when you may want to cut down on the number of hair styling tools you bring with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the one thing to keep in mind is the kind of wave this waving iron creates.  I think the previous reviewer who described this as looking \\&quot;kind of perm-y\\&quot; is dead on.  This iron achieves pretty defined waves.  Which if that is the look you are hoping to achieve, is certainly not a bad thing.  However, if you are looking for something softer, more natural and \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; you might be disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been playing around with this, trying thicker sections of hair and different heat settings and I haven&#x27;t been able to approximate anything that looks like a more natural wave.  So if that is the look you are trying to achieve, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the actual styling experience, I also liked that this heated up quickly and maintained heat well, even when styling my thick and long hair.  It is a bit heavy so I found my arm did feel a bit tired after doing my entire head, but not prohibitively so.  I also recommend using some kind of heat protecting hair product with this to minimize heat styling damage.  For me that has been key so I can use this without my hair taking on the texture of straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a much better option than a hair waving wand for creating defined waves and recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a man, I got this product for my wife and teenage daughter. I’m glad I did because they love it. Here is what they had to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they love how durable it is. It’s sturdy and has survived some of the banging around and dropping that can inevitably occur with a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they said it was very easy to use. It doesn’t require a lot of work and great technique. Whoever designed this product did a great job. It also warms up very quickly, which is a plus when strapped for time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it’s pretty versatile, creating two types of waves, having variable heat settings, and even doing curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the final product looked great. They both have thick hair and it gave them very nice, beautiful waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for any woman wanting waves in her hair with minimal hassle.</li>
    <li> Works as a curling wand and waver! Gets super hot so glad I purchased</li>
    <li> Okay, maybe you have to be a rocket scientist to figure this Andis Gold Ceramic Waver Iron out, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions and dried my hair - I have naturally curly hair, so I blew it dry with my (name brand goes here but I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t going to be published) hair dryer without the diffuser (which left it straight).  Then I turned on the Waver Iron and tried doing what it said:  part your hair into two sections, top and bottom.  Next, I closed the Waver Iron on the bottom section (about an inch or so from my scalp) and let it squeeze shut....after a minute or two, moved it down and repeated until the top section was finished.  Okay, then on to the top section....repeat the steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing!  My hair was straight.  It was as if the Waver Iron is a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to give up, so I tried it again, turning the Waver Iron a different direction.  Maybe I had it horizontal and it was supposed to be going vertically?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here I sit with straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t give up, though.  Tomorrow I will dry my hair with the diffuser and keep a bit of curl and then try the Waver Iron.  For now, though, I have to give it just TWO stars.  Maybe I can come back and EDIT my review.  We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> This creates really soft, light waves. I didn&#x27;t use any holding spray or gel or anything and they lasted about 2 days, which is about two days longer than the waves made with my Hot Tools 3 barrel waver. which lasts about three hours without putting product on my hair. This one seems to work faster as well. I only clamped down on my hair for about 5 to 7 seconds and was able to do my whole head in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a not a light-weight tool. It&#x27;s pretty large and the plates are fairly heavy duty and this is reflected in the weight. Because of the large size of these plates, I don&#x27;t think it will be easy to use on hair that&#x27;s shorter than chin length. The plates heat up very quickly and this was ready to go in just a couple of minutes. It didn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair, and I look forward to using it again with some kind holding gel or a longer lasting look. It&#x27;s definitely worth the $40 price tag.</li>
    <li> I love this tool for creating waves in both my hair, and I also used it on my granddaughter and she just loved it too (not sure when I am going to get it back from her...). I have not seen anything quite like it on the market, so I like how easy it is to get soft waves from an iron. My hair is shorter (chin length) and my granddaughter has long hair, but it worked wonderfully on both cuts, as well as different types of hair (mine is fine, her&#x27;s is thicker and fuller). This is a great investment for yourself or as a gift if you are looking to change up your hair style every once in a while, in a convenient and easy way. Nice product.</li>
    <li> My older girls, 13 and 14 years old, found this really easy to use. One has average thickness hair, but lots of it. The other has thinner, lighter hair. Both of them had great results that stayed in for the day. They used it on their little sister with fine hair, and it was adorable. Overall, a good product. To make it great, I wish it had more surface area to make it go faster for those with long hair :)</li>
    <li> I have four young, \\&quot;tween\\&quot; daughter who were more than willing to experiment with this waver and they really loved this one.  It makes waves very similar to what you get after a day in braids.  The curls are soft and defined.  It works best when sectioning the hair on thick hair.  On thin hair, sections could be considerably thicker.  I did have to use a high temp setting (almost max) to get the curls to come out, and there is no low, medium, and high setting to gauge, just a positive/negative dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really great gadget to have and it definitely adds body to the hair. I also wish that it had a stand to rest the hot iron.  I had to use a ceramic dish from my own kitchen to set the hot iron down.</li>
    <li> I love this waver iron! The controls are easy to operate. It is designed so that I very rarely accidentially touch it and burn my skin. Now on to it&#x27;s uses which is my hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with the flattening and waving features that this iron has. It does a very good job of adding waves. If you practice different techniques you can actually flat iron with it as well. It came with directions that were very easy to follow and helped me get started. I recommend this for anyone who wants a quality waver iron for a decent price.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to try this waver iron!  I have very wavy/o-so-slightly-curly hair.  I was hoping this would do well to touch up stray areas of my head that mysteriously went straight.  Turns out it&#x27;s completely unsuitable for that use, as the waves look too fake.  It&#x27;s still a bit of fun though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROS:  This curling iron is convertible, which I love.  It converts from a regular waver to a deep waver.  So, not only do you get two-for-one, you don&#x27;t have to make a decision on which you need!  And, I especially like the convertibility for travel: more stuff, less space.  It locks in a \\&quot;closed\\&quot; position, and the ceramic plates are safer for your hair (no \\&quot;fried\\&quot; look).  Cord is long.  Heats quickly, and it gets pretty hot on the higher setting.  It works pretty quickly: it took me about 20 minutes to do my whole head of hair (and that was with a first use, and I was watching baseball playoffs at the same time, lol.  I think it would go much more quickly with practice and full attention).  The waves creates had body and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONS:&lt;br /&gt;My biggest disappointment was in the depth and definition of the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; wavers&#x27; waves.  They didn&#x27;t look as sharp as I wanted.  Overall, I felt the look was a little too \\&quot;permy.\\&quot;  Still, it was kind of fun, and I will use this on occasion.</li>
    <li> I love how fast this curling iron heats up. I also love that it makes such interesting patterns in my hair.  I found that I could use it not only for crimping and waving, but for straightening and flipping the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the iron makes it easy to hold, and manage.  My daughters especially loved it for their long hair, and have created some really cute hairstyles, even up-dos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well-made and sturdy.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This waver stands out against the rest by utilizing the reversable wave form. You can pull it off and flip it depending on whether you want deep or shallow waves. pretty cool feature that gives you a choice, rather than having to buy two different wavers. Heats up very fast and i was able to do all my hair in about 10 minutes(i have really long, straight hair, and LOTs of it) Not too bad in terms of how long it takes. I personally felt that the deeper waves made me look like i had an 80&#x27;s perm, but that just might be because i had no idea what style i was going for. i was just making waves! The shallower waves are better for everyday, to wear your hair down.</li>
    <li> Makes big nice waves or subtle small ones. My hair is down to my butt and super thick, so it actually took me about 2 hours to do. I can say I won&#x27;t be doing this often AT ALL because of just the time and effort it takes to do it.</li>
    <li> I think I may have received a defective Waver. It took FOREVER to heat, the lights in our house were flickering (newer house, newer wiring), and it smelled funny. When I tried to use it, when it seemed warmer, it did some waves. On handling it, its pretty big and bulky I had a hard time using it right handed.</li>
    <li> My daughters are having so much fun with this waver iron. It makes big waves and little waves, and they even wrap their hair around the bars to make curls. I like that it turns itself off after not being used so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them forgetting. It has different settings so you can set the iron for your hair type and thickness. We are very pleased with this iron and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This thing sucked, sorry. Made my hair look awful and took forever to even get it to look awful.</li>
