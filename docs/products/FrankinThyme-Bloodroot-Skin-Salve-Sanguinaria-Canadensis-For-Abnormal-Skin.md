      <li>Though applying it on a dog is hard, I have to shave a good size amount of hair off to be able to apply the bandage material or else it will not stick.</li>

      <li>This product is worth</li>
      <li>but no worse than a sun burn or a mild bee sting.  </li>
      <li>I put some bloodroot salve on the spot and left it for more than 24 hours.</li>
      <li>When I first had this reaction, the doctors didn&#x27;t recognize what was happening at first.</li>

      <li>I have had a skin lesion on my upper lip for 9 months that my Primary Care Physician said was not a cold sore and believed it was skin cancer and that I should see a qualified dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I may also have to avoid certain foods, and I stopped using beauty products that contain salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>For the price, I certainly hope so.  </li>
      <li>Product was shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Would really like to return it.  </li>
      <li>I got my Epi-Pen ready in case</li>
      <li>Very prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>I really was at a loss about it</li>
      <li>We did a lot of research about Black Salve and watched many videos about its used on abnormal skin before buying it.</li>
      <li>I put a decent amount on my leg covering the lump and the skin around it for 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>But I noticed that the lumpy scar was still not affected, so I put a little more on that spot.</li>
      <li>It was not a comfortable experience, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, a scab came off with most of the tumor.</li>
      <li>After it arrived we applied it to the skin right away and applied a Band-aid over it and left it there for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Not sure how long product is good for though so can&#x27;t answer that....</li>
      <li>First one I purchased gave to a friend, second one I have kept.</li>
      <li>So I worried that I hadn&#x27;t put enough salve on that spot, so I applied a little more.</li>
      <li>The last time I had a reaction, Benadryl didn&#x27;t help that much, so I was worried, and paid close attention to how I was feeling.</li>
      <li>So far it has worked as advertised.  </li>
      <li>There is contact information in each package, if you have specific questions and want to email me pictures of particular areas of application please do so.</li>
      <li>Now there were four tiny holes in the newly infected area, but the lumpy scar hadn&#x27;t changed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel right, but it wasn&#x27;t until I had severe itching all over my body, swelling of my face and lips, and trouble swallowing that they figured out what it was.</li>
      <li>Recently, it started to get worse, and it felt like two more cysts were beginning to form underneath it and to one side of it.</li>
      <li>goo gone is a total lifesaver for bandaid removal (apply it to the bandaid and in a few mins it falls right off)..and either coconut oil,neosporin or whatever u prefer to heal it.</li>
      <li>The next day the skin above the bump had opened yet the other skin around it had remained perfectly normal and intact.  </li>

<li> A few weeks went by and a pussy mess of flesh fell out of where I used to have a hard lump and now normal soft skin has filled the area.  </li>
<li> When it did, all of the mole was gone and it was flat again.</li>
<li> This will not remove moles that are not precancerous or cancerous, it is not a general purpose mole remover.</li>
<li> The edges of the scab were milky white, like there was infection, but that area felt dry to the touch.</li>
<li> There were two tiny holes in my skin in the area where the new cyst was forming The holes were black inside, as if the salve had sunk down in my skin and stayed there.</li>
<li> This is usually the first symptom I experience before coming down with the flu.</li>
<li> As for my chest, the big black scab is still there, but milky white edges are on the lower part only, and it&#x27;s starting to ooze a little bit.</li>
<li> only a small amout is needed..just enough to cover your mole/spot...</li>
<li> I just let the salve to its job just like the directions say and over the next week and a half it scabbed up and fell off.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m totally healed up, with no scar, and just a little discoloration still.  </li>
<li> The lumpy scar went down a tiny bit, and the redness and swelling have also lessened a little.</li>
<li> Over the course of the next few hours, the four tiny holes began to get larger and by the following day, the holes had merged to become one big ugly black scab, with milky white edges that looked infected.</li>
<li> I will not support this company again and will look for other manufacturers if I ever need another jar of product.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but other reviews said it did for them.</li>
<li> I use this on myself and other family members and each batch is very carefully prepared and tested.</li>
<li> prob because we are active ppl etc.</li>
<li> It turned the skin lesion black and it &amp;#34;fell off&amp;#34; 2 days later, leaving a small hole in my skin that healed by the end of two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used black salve before , it works.</li>
<li> With a half hour, that area began to burn and tingle.</li>
<li> applied this Black Salve from Matrix of Holistic Health and kept it on the lesion for 24hrs with a band aid.</li>
<li> two was less dramatic, less painful, in spite of applying the salve to sensitive skin, and the second scab came off really clean.&lt;br</li>
<li> skin tags died and turned black and fell off.</li>
<li> I had read up on  salves and figured that I&#x27;d try this black salve on this spot on my leg.  </li>
<li> There was still a dark spot underneath though, so went for round two.&lt;br /&gt;Round</li>
<li> The skin on the lumpy scar, which still felt like there was infection underneath, peeled a little.</li>
<li> Regardless of what is said, it didn&#x27;t destroy my skin.  </li>
<li> I started having trouble swallowing, and worried that I might need to go to the ER.</li>
<li> I had a few questions in how to apply, emailed and called,got immediate response.  </li>
<li> A few tips..</li>
<li> After a few hours, it created a reaction at the site.</li>

    <li> Works great and very helpful service.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! My dog has dermal himangiosarcoma. It has not spread internally but it definitely has spread on her skin. The product works great! I have successfully healed 3 tumors. Though applying it on a dog is hard, I have to shave a good size amount of hair off to be able to apply the bandage material or else it will not stick. And I&#x27;ve had to put and e collar on her to keep from licking it off. But the product it self works wonders!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very useful for pulling out my skin cancer,  Thanks</li>
    <li> great stuff, does what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> What is the % of zinc chloride that is used in this product? 30 or 40 %? I want to purchase some but the % amount is important to whether I do or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to rate this salve. It is definitely powerful stuff, but I have it one star because it triggered an anaphylactic reaction in me, and scared me. Last August, I got a cyst on my chest that healed badly and left an ugly lumpy scar. The scar felt like there was still infection underneath. Recently, it started to get worse, and it felt like two more cysts were beginning to form underneath it and to one side of it. It was awful. So I put this salve on the affected area, covered it with a band-aid, and left it on for 24 hours. When I took the band-aid off, I could tell something was happening. There were two tiny holes in my skin in the area where the new cyst was forming The holes were black inside, as if the salve had sunk down in my skin and stayed there. The edges of the scab were milky white, like there was infection, but that area felt dry to the touch. I thought maybe it was the salve drawing out whatever was in there, so I left it alone. The skin on the lumpy scar, which still felt like there was infection underneath, peeled a little. So I worried that I hadn&#x27;t put enough salve on that spot, so I applied a little more. Immediately I could feel something happening. It started tingling and burning, so after about an hour I washed it off. Now there were four tiny holes in the newly infected area, but the lumpy scar hadn&#x27;t changed. Over the course of the next few hours, the four tiny holes began to get larger and by the following day, the holes had merged to become one big ugly black scab, with milky white edges that looked infected. I started to get worried that the scab would continue to get bigger. The skin around that area was quite red, and I felt swollen lumps underneath. So I covered it with a band-aid and left it alone. Around the same time, I felt like I had a toothache. This is usually the first symptom I experience before coming down with the flu. By the following day, the toothache feeling had become a sore throat. The lymph nodes inmy neck were swollen and hard (and still are). I don&#x27;t know if this was my body reacting to the salve, or my immune system kicking in. At the time I didn&#x27;t make that connection. Now I wonder. But I noticed that the lumpy scar was still not affected, so I put a little more on that spot. With a half hour, that area began to burn and tingle. I started to feel ill, and I realized I was having an allergic reaction. Last summer I had a very serious allergic reaction to anti-inflammatory medication I was taking, after severely breaking my leg and ankle and undergoing surgery. There are many medications that I can no longer take because I can&#x27;t risk having another reaction. I may also have to avoid certain foods, and I stopped using beauty products that contain salicylic acid. I think something in this salve contains that ingredient. When I first had this reaction, the doctors didn&#x27;t recognize what was happening at first. It took 3-4 trips to the doctor and ultimately two visits to the ER before they figured out what was happening to me. For 2-3 months, I kept telling the doctor I didn&#x27;t feel right, but it wasn&#x27;t until I had severe itching all over my body, swelling of my face and lips, and trouble swallowing that they figured out what it was. Now I have to take an Epi-Pen in my purse, where ever I go. So after applying this salve for the third time, I started to have a similar reaction, except without the itching. After 20-30 minutes, my lips were started to swell, so I immediately washed off the salve. I began to worry that my sore throat was also part of an allergic reaction, and not the flu. So this is definitely potent stuff. I started having trouble swallowing, and worried that I might need to go to the ER. I got my Epi-Pen ready in case I got worse, and took a Benadryl. I set the timer on my iPhone for four hours, so I could take another Benadryl as soon as possible. The last time I had a reaction, Benadryl didn&#x27;t help that much, so I was worried, and paid close attention to how I was feeling. I got into bed to rest, and as the Benadryl kicked in, the reaction slowly subsided. But there is NO way I can use this save again! It is very powerful stuff. If you have allergies to anything containing salicylic acid, e.g. aspirin, I wouldn&#x27;t advise using this salve. As for my chest, the big black scab is still there, but milky white edges are on the lower part only, and it&#x27;s starting to ooze a little bit. The lumpy scar went down a tiny bit, and the redness and swelling have also lessened a little. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see what happens with this scab, and will post an update about the end result. If it cures this lumpy cyst, I&#x27;ll increase my rating. But for now, for me, it is one star. This stuff is no joke, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner and the product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this produce to use in the removal of a sarcoid on my mules ear, it worked within days.  I had a few questions in how to apply, emailed and called,got immediate response.  Product was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and can&#x27;t say if it works or not.  For the price, I certainly hope so.  However I was not expecting as part of this inflated cost proselytizing garbage from the vile cult of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.  I will not support this company again and will look for other manufacturers if I ever need another jar of product.</li>
    <li> We have yet to try the product so we are ok with it for now.  If it works anywhere as good as the CanX that we use to use it will be great.</li>
    <li> Regardless of what is said, it didn&#x27;t destroy my skin.  I used it three times.  Twice nothing happened, the third time bingo!  It took a lesion about the size of a dime and about three quarters deep out of my arm in eight days.  It&#x27;s been 18 days since and I&#x27;m totally healed up, with no scar, and just a little discoloration still.  This product is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  Look what it would have cost me to have this lesion removed.</li>
    <li> I have had a skin lesion on my upper lip for 9 months that my Primary Care Physician said was not a cold sore and believed it was skin cancer and that I should see a qualified dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this Black Salve from Matrix of Holistic Health and kept it on the lesion for 24hrs with a band aid. It turned the skin lesion black and it &amp;#34;fell off&amp;#34; 2 days later, leaving a small hole in my skin that healed by the end of two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any skin tags or lesions that have been diagnosed as &amp;#34;skin cancer&amp;#34; it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try this before resorting to surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly worked for me</li>
    <li> This was a God sent to my family. We did a lot of research about Black Salve and watched many videos about its used on abnormal skin before buying it. My husband was diagnosed with skin Melanoma on his ear. The treatment prescribed by his doctor was to cut part of his ear off. We decided to find an alternative and found that the Salve was being used to treat this condition. After it arrived we applied it to the skin right away and applied a Band-aid over it and left it there for 24 hours. After a few hours, it created a reaction at the site. This Salve alerts the immune system of anything abnormal and the immune system attacks it from within. The area became red and after a day or two we could see the immune T cells at work. The area formed a yellowy scab and after 10 days or so it fell off. Now the skin is totally normal and best of all his whole ear still attached.</li>
    <li> Thanks for making this available.</li>
    <li> I have used black salve before , it works. Very prompt delivery. Will buy again. First one I purchased gave to a friend, second one I have kept.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but other reviews said it did for them. After seeing pictures of what it can do to skin didn&#x27;t use anymore</li>
    <li> I used it on a spot on my foot and it did nothing. My daughter used it on a spot on her back and it did as advertised. The spot got weepy after a day then after a week is now gone. Very pleased, would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> So far it has worked as advertised.  Two places on my hand are gone.  one on my face gone except redness. The big test is on the left side of my face.  I need help to see the application margins.  I will keep you posted. Ken</li>
    <li> I had a boil that healed improperly and had turned into a hard itchy lump in my skin.  I really was at a loss about it so I ignored it for almost a year.  I had read up on  salves and figured that I&#x27;d try this black salve on this spot on my leg.  I put a decent amount on my leg covering the lump and the skin around it for 24 hours.  The next day the skin above the bump had opened yet the other skin around it had remained perfectly normal and intact.  It was like the salve somehow only affected the abnormal area.  A few weeks went by and a pussy mess of flesh fell out of where I used to have a hard lump and now normal soft skin has filled the area.  I&#x27;ve very happy.</li>
    <li> Great salve.Very useful.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed with this product.  Would really like to return it.  The salve is extremely difficult to apply and is impossible to keep on.  Very expensive and would not recommend.  Save your money</li>
    <li> I had a nasty spot of melanoma on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;I put the salve on for 24-hours with a bandaide over it. It was not a comfortable experience, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, a scab came off with most of the tumor. There was still a dark spot underneath though, so went for round two.&lt;br /&gt;Round two was less dramatic, less painful, in spite of applying the salve to sensitive skin, and the second scab came off really clean.&lt;br /&gt;There is no trace of the Melanoma spot left, it&#x27;s totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;Now just letting the healthy skin grow back.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have a happy ending!</li>
    <li> I had a spot on my face that was a flesh colored mole. It&#x27;s been there all of my life but over the last several years I noticed it was beginning to protrude some and I feared it could be cancer. My hubby had something that looked similar removed several years ago that turned out to be cancer so I was concerned. I put some bloodroot salve on the spot and left it for more than 24 hours. When the bandage was removed I could tell something was happening. I just let the salve to its job just like the directions say and over the next week and a half it scabbed up and fell off. When it did, all of the mole was gone and it was flat again. It left a tiny scar that has healed up nicely on its own. My mom has a spot that may be skin cancer so we&#x27;re going to put it on her and see if it takes care of her spot too. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> overpriced. didn&#x27;t do everything that it advertised.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used..ever. Does EXACTLY what it claims to do..fast shipping..good packaging. Used it on hubs questionable mole and some skin tags on me. Was absolutely amazing!! Although ..two applications worked better for us than the one..prob because we are active ppl etc. A few tips..I used...toothpicks to stir and apply..lots of fabric bandaids...goo gone is a total lifesaver for bandaid removal (apply it to the bandaid and in a few mins it falls right off)..and either coconut oil,neosporin or whatever u prefer to heal it. Sooo thankful we don&#x27;t have to spend thousands getting them removed...this gets it ALL. Mole scabbed up and popped off...skin tags died and turned black and fell off. Some irritation at site..but no worse than a sun burn or a mild bee sting.  Soooooo worth the $...was leary at first...but veryyyy satisfied. Hubs been tellin and showing everyone at work lol and I&#x27;ve been posting about it to all my facebook friends..yes..it&#x27;s that amazinggg!!! If u have any q&#x27;s feel free to ask ;). Not sure how long product is good for though so can&#x27;t answer that....only a small amout is needed..just enough to cover your mole/spot...I&#x27;ve found that applying product to bandaid then stick bandaid to mole worked best for us. Simply loveee it!!!! Would DEF order again.</li>
    <li> Save your money.. I have used Bloodroot paste off &amp; on over the past 20 years,,, This is a non-effective product...</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It works!</li>
    <li> I am the seller and manufacturer, please contact me with any questions on usage as I provide free product support. There is contact information in each package, if you have specific questions and want to email me pictures of particular areas of application please do so. For most application purposes you only need to apply one time and cover with a bandage for 24 hours. This will not remove moles that are not precancerous or cancerous, it is not a general purpose mole remover. Thanks for shopping and thank you for all your wonderful reviews. I use this on myself and other family members and each batch is very carefully prepared and tested.</li>
