### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I heard years ago that Vitamin C was excellent for the eye area.  </li>
      <li>Anti-puffiness, Best Anti-aging,</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is organic, has a pleasant smell, &amp; it keeps the area around my eyes</li>
      <li>The product itself is very nice, love the smell!  </li>
      <li>My eyes look really good</li>
      <li>I loved the consistency and the fact that it has no smell.</li>
      <li>Nice touch before bed as well.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say whether this cream is effective or not.  </li>
      <li>Never ever in my life I had any kind of reaction on any creams or lotions.</li>
      <li>I used this product before (the one pictured) and I liked it</li>
      <li>Apart from my particular condition, this cream is a wonderful eye cream.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really comment yet on results, but it does feel very nice on my skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>and I like it better.  </li>
      <li>I guess that is just want I need, maybe this product will work better for you.    </li>
      <li>but Vitamin C Serum works better for me.  </li>
      <li>In town, I pay way more for this product.  </li>
      <li>but on the top under Vitamin C is says \\&quot;renewal\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>love this eye cream - have been using for years.</li>
      <li>I figure that serum has more power, if you need it.</li>
      <li>but when the company comes up with a better pump, I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I figured I better not continue using it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great on gentle skin too.</li>
      <li>Seller is great - shipped fast.</li>
      <li>This product is okay</li>
      <li>This rich cream is actually more effective in minimizing these bumps than the prescription lotion that I have used.</li>
      <li>Within a week I could see a difference , more fine lines and droopy eye lid.</li>
      <li>sometimes this comes at a really cheap price elsewhere which is nice because i don&#x27;t think its worth more than $10 a bottle</li>
      <li>However, I had to discontinue use because I noticed that my vision was becoming blurred.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines and was just using this for prevention.</li>
      <li>okay the first two or three times but then stops working.  </li>
      <li>I end up opening the bottle and dipping a clean finger into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Eliminates fine lines and makes my skin look moist and fresh looking.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my contact lense wearing, seems to keep lines at bay, rich and creamy but not greasy at all, absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look and feel good overall.  </li>
      <li>so I guess I was lucky.</li>
      <li>I have used other products that work just as well as this one but prefer this one because the company doesn&#x27;t test products on animals and the ingredients are good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference the first week I started using this product.</li>
      <li>Love this and have been using for several years!</li>
      <li>I am 24 years old and was using this at night and lightly in the morning.</li>
      <li>Pure Vitamin C Serum for Eyes, Skin Brightening.</li>
      <li>I have seen no visible improvement (not even slightly) in fine lines or skin tone &amp; texture (as it advertises) after using religiously for 2 months.</li>
      <li>but i do really like this product.</li>
      <li>I used it a couple times and it burned my skin so much</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really recommend it if the formula is being manufactured by another company.</li>
      <li>Very creamy.  </li>
      <li>I was gifted with a certificate ,so this was a fast, well priced way to get a good product that is sometimes difficult for me to find locally.</li>
      <li>I noticed in the first week that I had less fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the &amp;#34;vertical&amp;#34; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids.  </li>
      <li>I will not purchase this again and will search for a new eye cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this.  </li>
      <li>This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  </li>
      <li>I could still see, but I felt like I had a film over my eye that I couldn&#x27;t get to clear.</li>
      <li>Smell is faint but good.  </li>
      <li>I was extremely distressed to read that this company has been purchased by health food giant Hains and that other product formulas have been changed and are no longer effective for whatever they were supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Old bottle had poor squirting mechanism - they&#x27;ve upgraded and it seems to work much better now.</li>
      <li>This most recent bottle has new packaging and the lotion now is thin and watery.</li>
      <li>It helped to clear up some dry patches I had in the winter around my eyes and didn&#x27;t break me out on the parts of my face near my eye area where this product touched.</li>
      <li>no waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C  - like it, but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use.</li>
      <li>I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so</li>
      <li>It sounded good but broke me out so badly</li>

<li> and it is not a new product nor is it manufactured by Hains</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used similar organic eye products that cost less and saw at least slight improvement.</li>
<li> I have used this product for about 2 weeks and its not oily or greasy and it helps with my puffy eyes and dark circles a little bit.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have much black under my eyes but the little bit I had is gone now.  </li>
<li> I have a dermatological condition called keratosis pilaris which consists of small raised bumps that appear on one side of my forehead and on my arms.</li>
<li> Not sure how to go out today.</li>
<li> The first time I used Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  </li>
<li> big disappointment, however, is the pump!  </li>
<li> My eyes still became uncomfortable.</li>
<li> This one fails.</li>
<li> Looks awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and it has become my go to eye cream.  I ran out and  was using up an eye cream I had on hand. Within a week I could see a difference , more fine lines and droopy eye lid. I reordered  and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I have a dermatological condition called keratosis pilaris which consists of small raised bumps that appear on one side of my forehead and on my arms. This rich cream is actually more effective in minimizing these bumps than the prescription lotion that I have used. I was extremely distressed to read that this company has been purchased by health food giant Hains and that other product formulas have been changed and are no longer effective for whatever they were supposed to do. When I purchased this bottle there was only one left and it is not a new product nor is it manufactured by Hains so I guess I was lucky. If this information is correct then I assume Amazon will be restocking another facial cream that is ineffective. Apart from my particular condition, this cream is a wonderful eye cream. It softens and smooths this area just as you should expect. Can&#x27;t really recommend it if the formula is being manufactured by another company.</li>
    <li> I heard years ago that Vitamin C was excellent for the eye area.  I have definitely seen the change.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is organic, has a pleasant smell, &amp; it keeps the area around my eyes pretty well hydrated for at least 1/4 of the day. The negative to that is there are cheaper products that will give the same result. I have seen no visible improvement (not even slightly) in fine lines or skin tone &amp; texture (as it advertises) after using religiously for 2 months. I&#x27;ve used similar organic eye products that cost less and saw at least slight improvement.</li>
    <li> The first time I used Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C eye cream, my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours.  I thought that maybe I had used too much, so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount, being careful to keep it away from my lashes.  My eyes still became uncomfortable. This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do.  The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and, if it does, it should not sting. That&#x27;s why eye cream is different than face cream. This one fails. I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> Never ever in my life I had any kind of reaction on any creams or lotions. This one burned my skin. Not sure how to go out today. Looks awful.</li>
    <li> My eyes look really good</li>
    <li> I ordered for:&lt;br /&gt;Avalon Active Organics Vitamin C Revitalizing Eye Cream, but they send me another cream for eyes i didn&#x27;t order for, and&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT EVEN NOTIFY OR ASK ME!!&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t like the other brand they send me, so i have to buy for another eye cream now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams, but I always come back to Avalon Organics.  It works!</li>
    <li> fades acne scars too! sometimes this comes at a really cheap price elsewhere which is nice because i don&#x27;t think its worth more than $10 a bottle but i do really like this product.</li>
    <li> It sounded good but broke me out so badly I ended up giving it to my mom who is in her 50&#x27;z.</li>
    <li> Love this and have been using for several years! No scent and no toxic preservatives.</li>
    <li> I tried this product with a lot of hope for quite sometime. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement what so ever. I would not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I cannot say whether this cream is effective or not.  I used it a couple times and it burned my skin so much I figured I better not continue using it.</li>
    <li> In town, I pay way more for this product.  Have used it for a couple of years and will continue now that I found it here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was gifted with a certificate ,so this was a fast, well priced way to get a good product that is sometimes difficult for me to find locally.</li>
    <li> Eliminates fine lines and makes my skin look moist and fresh looking.  I noticed a difference the first week I started using this product. It&#x27;s great on gentle skin too.</li>
    <li> Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the &amp;#34;vertical&amp;#34; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids.  I&#x27;m 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this.  Nice touch before bed as well.  Smell is faint but good.  Very creamy.  Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so no waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C  - like it, but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 Star rating if the pump worked.  I took it apart and did everything I could to get the pump to work, but it&#x27;s faulty.  The product itself is very nice, love the smell!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I can&#x27;t really comment yet on results, but it does feel very nice on my skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> love this eye cream - have been using for years. I&#x27;ve often tried more expensive ones, and always come back to this. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my contact lense wearing, seems to keep lines at bay, rich and creamy but not greasy at all, absorbs quickly. Old bottle had poor squirting mechanism - they&#x27;ve upgraded and it seems to work much better now.</li>
    <li> I am 24 years old and was using this at night and lightly in the morning. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines and was just using this for prevention. I loved the consistency and the fact that it has no smell. It helped to clear up some dry patches I had in the winter around my eyes and didn&#x27;t break me out on the parts of my face near my eye area where this product touched. However, I had to discontinue use because I noticed that my vision was becoming blurred. I could still see, but I felt like I had a film over my eye that I couldn&#x27;t get to clear. Once discontinuing, the problem went away. It is unfortunate because I really did like using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 and definitely need help in the eye area.  This product is okay and when I use it, I do see immediate smoothing under the eyes and on the eyelids.  I have used other products that work just as well as this one but prefer this one because the company doesn&#x27;t test products on animals and the ingredients are good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big disappointment, however, is the pump!  It simply doesn&#x27;t work.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and the pump works okay the first two or three times but then stops working.  I end up opening the bottle and dipping a clean finger into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the product because it does work but when the company comes up with a better pump, I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used this product before (the one pictured) and I liked it but the product I received was not the same...it&#x27;s still the revitalizing eye cream but on the top under Vitamin C is says \\&quot;renewal\\&quot;...and the box is different too...not enough for me to complain and sent it back but the pictures need to be updated because this is not the product you get.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 weeks and its not oily or greasy and it helps with my puffy eyes and dark circles a little bit.  Makes my skin look and feel good overall.  I decided to do the research between the different of eye \\&quot;cream\\&quot; and eye \\&quot;serum\\&quot;.  This eye cream works well but Vitamin C Serum works better for me.  I guess that is just want I need, maybe this product will work better for you.    I switched to this product and I like it better.  [[ASIN:B00DIGE3EW Pure Vitamin C Serum for Eyes, Skin Brightening. Anti-puffiness, Best Anti-aging, Anti-wrinkle, Instant-lift Solution Benefits for Your Skin Care - Protect Your Skin - 30 Day Money Back Guarantee]]    I noticed in the first week that I had less fine lines around my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t have much black under my eyes but the little bit I had is gone now.  I figure that serum has more power, if you need it.</li>
    <li> Seller is great - shipped fast. HOWEVER, the formula of this eye cream has changed! I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several years, and it has always been thick and creamy and very moisturizing. This most recent bottle has new packaging and the lotion now is thin and watery. It&#x27;s just not the same. I will not purchase this again and will search for a new eye cream.</li>
