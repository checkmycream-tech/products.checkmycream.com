      <li>It&#x27;s the best.  </li>
      <li>works best int</li>
      <li>This is definitely a great price for a great product.</li>
      <li>My favorite eyeliner!</li>
      <li>This stays on your eyelids nicely and does not smear or leave streaks.</li>
      <li>Love, love love this product!</li>
      <li>This product has been a favorite of mine for years.</li>
      <li>Long-lasting and extremely gentle, it applies great kohl liner without pulling the eye area.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this eyeliner and why Benefit has discontinued</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love all benefit makeup, but this pencil not for summer.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Super excited and satisfied!!</li>
      <li>well you can wear this and not worry about it rubbing off right away- good price</li>
      <li>/&gt;the product is pretty good though.</li>
      <li>I am hoping that other customers will ask them to continue to offer this great product!</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using different brands before and so far this has been the best.</li>
      <li>This little eye liner does a great job stays on well and goes on</li>
      <li>i was not happy that my pencil has a cover which doesn&#x27;t stay on the pencil, not the best for tossing in your purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I basically rubbed the pencil right off.  </li>
      <li>So sad this was discontinued but so happy I found it online and was able to stock up.</li>
      <li>its very soft and should be applied lightly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>When I first learned about this pencil, the lady at the Benefit store told me to just run it along my eyelid and blend it with my finger...</li>
      <li>First of all</li>
      <li>Love this big pencil, I use it on my brows.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t have a large makeup sharpener...get one.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>NOT the real Benefit Brand.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner ir really chunky, great for that smoky eye or even dramatic eye.</li>
      <li>and I am sure other customers.</li>
      <li>not worth 20 dollars unless you really love this&lt;br</li>
      <li>:) Ok...I use it as a primer on my lid for dark shadows.  </li>
      <li>so my dissatisfaction is with the particular product, not the brand.</li>
      <li>If your looking for bold, look no further.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite black liner so far.</li>
      <li>I use a different Bad gal product and am very happy with it</li>
      <li>Looks AMAZING in a few different ways, and is definitely a versatile pencil for a variety of eye looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works better than the new eyeliner - I wish they would bring back the old one - onyx was soooo black!!!</li>

<li> For those that left negative reviews because some of you were wondering about that.</li>
<li> this is not your average liner.  </li>
<li> I always find it all over my eyes by a few hours.. even with a primer.</li>
<li> Ok...this looks like a boring, regular big black pencil...</li>
<li> pencil is too thick for me to use up against my eye lids</li>
<li> If you want a slim line try amazons bobbie brown ,tarte, or smashbox thin liners.</li>
<li> when I \\&quot;rediscovered\\&quot; the pencil, I tried lining the inside of my upper eyelid with it, and holy crap, it worked!  </li>
<li> he cold winter months.  </li>

    <li> Best Eyeliner EVER! So sad this was discontinued but so happy I found it online and was able to stock up.</li>
    <li> When I first learned about this pencil, the lady at the Benefit store told me to just run it along my eyelid and blend it with my finger... I thought she was nuts- every time I tried it, I basically rubbed the pencil right off.  Then, I put it away for a while and forgot about it... when I \\&quot;rediscovered\\&quot; the pencil, I tried lining the inside of my upper eyelid with it, and holy crap, it worked!  Looks AMAZING in a few different ways, and is definitely a versatile pencil for a variety of eye looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last forever, I am averaging about 1 a year and I use it daily... it has become a staple in my makeup repertoire!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner ir really chunky, great for that smoky eye or even dramatic eye. If your looking for bold, look no further. If you want a slim line try amazons bobbie brown ,tarte, or smashbox thin liners.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I always find it all over my eyes by a few hours.. even with a primer.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. The pencil will last you along time&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1.Its not worth 20 dollars unless you really love this&lt;br /&gt;2.The  pencil is too thick for me to use up against my eye lids&lt;br /&gt;The benefit artist showed me how to apply this on the eyes using a liner brush&lt;br /&gt;3.Its rubs on like charcaol</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeliner and why Benefit has discontinued it is a question to me and I am sure other customers. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I am hoping that other customers will ask them to continue to offer this great product!</li>
    <li> Super excited and satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Works better than the new eyeliner - I wish they would bring back the old one - onyx was soooo black!!!</li>
    <li> I love all benefit makeup, but this pencil not for summer. works best int he cold winter months.  its very soft and should be applied lightly</li>
    <li> i was not happy that my pencil has a cover which doesn&#x27;t stay on the pencil, not the best for tossing in your purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product is pretty good though.</li>
    <li> Discovered Benefit cosmetics in 2007. Love this big pencil, I use it on my brows. One swipe on each side is all I need.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite black liner so far. I&#x27;ve been using different brands before and so far this has been the best. It&#x27;s really smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> NOT the real Benefit Brand. It&#x27;s definitely a knock off. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> This product has been a favorite of mine for years. This is definitely a great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Terrific eye crayon.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and am so glad to find it again - think it&#x27;s been disconnected by Benefit for some crazy reason.  Long-lasting and extremely gentle, it applies great kohl liner without pulling the eye area.  Love, love love this product!</li>
    <li> Ok...this looks like a boring, regular big black pencil...I&#x27;ve read some other reviews...this is not your average liner.  First of all if you don&#x27;t have a large makeup sharpener...get one.  They&#x27;re very inexpensive.  You can get one at the dollar store or Target.  You will need to sharpen it some day. For those that left negative reviews because some of you were wondering about that. :) Ok...I use it as a primer on my lid for dark shadows.  It&#x27;s the best.  I was introduced to it at the Benefit counter and I get compliments all the time on my shadows.  It&#x27;s the best.  It&#x27;s my #1 essential makeup piece.</li>
    <li> This little eye liner does a great job stays on well and goes on well you can wear this and not worry about it rubbing off right away- good price</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product and returned it to the seller. It didn&#x27;t go on well. I use a different Bad gal product and am very happy with it so my dissatisfaction is with the particular product, not the brand.</li>
    <li> I am devastated that this product has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite eyeliner. I am so dissapointed that it was discontinued by benefit. Amazon or Ebay are the only places I can find it now. I have a couple on back up in case mine run out. This stays on your eyelids nicely and does not smear or leave streaks. Great eyeliner!</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner!</li>
