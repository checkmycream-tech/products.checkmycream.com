      <li>This glue is better.  </li>
      <li>Because of this I no longer need to use eyeliner on my top lid.</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite eyelash adhesive.</li>
      <li>glue its self is okay</li>
      <li>(mostly my lack of skill) but held well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
      <li>It is a molded plastic tube with a screw top wand.</li>
      <li>I also love the &amp;#34;wic&amp;#34; on the inside it make the application easier.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Love this glue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy some more when I run out :)</li>
      <li>It requires more work.</li>
      <li>I love this glue.</li>
      <li>I found myself able to apply the tinniest line of adhesive.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d always had better luck with lash duo glues.</li>
      <li>got everywhere so easily.</li>
      <li>Plus it has an easy applicator wand.</li>
      <li>did like how it had a wand applicator, as that made it easy to put the product on the falsies before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came off easily with soap and water and I am recommending it to all my friends.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like i used before.</li>
      <li>The first time I wore it, I was honestly worried if it would come off-</li>
      <li>Black glue is so so awesome!</li>
      <li>The description is accurate that it is 1 gram each.</li>
      <li>but they work fantastic.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think that even though I have come to learn more about what to consider when purchasing eyelash adhesives, for this price, it is good.</li>
      <li>This product works great &amp; keels the eyelashes on for long periods of time.</li>
      <li>am given two star because the item was two tinny pieces and very had to even hold, other than that it fit perfectly to my fakelashes</li>
      <li>its ok works as good as any other one out there</li>
      <li>But this stuff is so easy and fast!</li>
      <li>Quick and efficient.</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s a decent lash glue at a great price, but I would recommend to only those who are pros at putting falsies on.</li>
      <li>black color is also great and blends w/mascara and eyeliner</li>
      <li>Isnt exactly water proof, but it works!</li>
      <li>I ordered the eyelash adhesive yesterday and received it today which is great except the adhesive leaked at some point maybe in storage, and was stuck to the plastic wrapping it came in and the glue had completely dried out.</li>
      <li>I just wish it came in a bigger size, but it&#x27;s still an amazing glue</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing another because so far this is my favorite brand of eyelash glue.</li>
      <li>You will be better off paying the $1 extra and getting one that has more product inside and (designed better to hold product inside bottle verses outside the bottle) one that does not get caked up around the opening.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great product &amp; I will most likely buy it again.</li>
      <li>Works good but kinda a mess.</li>
      <li>Love it just need big bottle now ;)</li>
      <li>it dries out pretty</li>
      <li>and this was my first adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Make sure your products are actually usable before you sell them.</li>
      <li>glad I only paid $3 or so.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Stay on long &amp; really strong!</li>
      <li>It isnt hard to use at all but just like eyeliner, you need a steady hand and no pets bumping into you as you are applying, lol.</li>
      <li>When I took my eyelashes off the glue stayed stuck to my lids and also pulled some of my natural lashes off even after using mild soap and water</li>
      <li>Oh and dries black, blends nicely with your eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>you dont need much for the lash there</li>
      <li>2 stars because of the fast shipping....</li>
      <li>Okay, so, I purchased this eyelash adhesive not really knowing what to look for in a product of this sort.</li>
      <li>travelling with this item, make sure the screw top is completely closed and placed in a purse/luggage pocket that will ensure it will not be crushed as it could leak.</li>
      <li>Really is water proof</li>
      <li>The bottle is small but very cute.</li>
      <li>It arrived really clumpy, this product didnt work</li>
      <li>and it made putting on lashes much easier.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of its size it is very convenient to carry in your purse or makeup kit when travelling.</li>
      <li>wow!!!</li>
      <li>Its nice n dry faster than regular glue really like it  </li>
      <li>glue definitely takes a full 30 seconds to get tacky, just check it before applying.</li>
      <li>The screw top wand is a nice touch as it allows for more accurate application of glue to the false lash or touch up on the corners of your eyelids should the false lash come loose.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Kinda small but does the job</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. The bottle is small but very cute. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like i used before.</li>
    <li> It arrived really clumpy, this product didnt work I had to go out and buy one</li>
    <li> Hardly worked. Didn&#x27;t keep the lashes on longer than 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> This glue is good but its too sticky .. even when I put it on and wore it all day .. when I went to take them off it hurt it would pull on my eyelids and the bottles are tiny ..</li>
    <li> I had no luck, the glue get completely dry, 😔😔 waste of money.</li>
    <li> I know how to put eyelashes on but this glue sucked SO BADLY that i used BOTH containers of glue up and never had ONE single eyelash stick. NOT ONE! The glue came rock hard inside of the package while the other one was wayyyyy too watery and both were not working. This product is HORRIBLE! DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all replace the whole things not sticky enough they were not good at all</li>
    <li> Love this glue. Works great!</li>
    <li> I used to use Ardell, thinking it was the best on the market. Wrong! This stuff is much longer lasting and you only have to use a tiny amount. I especially like that it is black, so you don&#x27;t see the glue if it smudges. The first time I wore it, I was honestly worried if it would come off- the adhesive is that good. It came off easily with soap and water and I am recommending it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Both of the containers were old and dried up. Terrible</li>
    <li> I love this glue. Really is water proof I went swimming and my lashes stayed on. Great deal .worth paying the shipping</li>
    <li> As pictures can be deceiving, this is no exception. The description is accurate that it is 1 gram each. The item you are viewing/will be ordering is about the width of a half dollar or likened to the rectangular size of a small piece of gum (like Trident or Chicle). As a product review this item performs as it should--it is indeed waterproof, black, dries quickly, and is a firm adhesive when used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Because of its size it is very convenient to carry in your purse or makeup kit when travelling. It is a molded plastic tube with a screw top wand. The screw top wand is a nice touch as it allows for more accurate application of glue to the false lash or touch up on the corners of your eyelids should the false lash come loose. When empty, you can put a drop of (Ardell, etc) black, waterproof glue to refill or merely reorder. The container can be re-purposed for a variety of cosmetic perishables (e.g. cuticle oil) after being cleaned with an alcohol saturated Qtip.&lt;br /&gt;When travelling with this item, make sure the screw top is completely closed and placed in a purse/luggage pocket that will ensure it will not be crushed as it could leak. Or place in a small ziploc bag for safe keeping/peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expose to heat or sunlight, as this will affect performance of glue.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product a few days after ordering and in a full-size, bubble manila envelope. All intact.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected. got everywhere so easily. didn&#x27;t even stick my eyelashes. glad I only paid $3 or so.</li>
    <li> its ok works as good as any other one out there but the only thing that i didn&#x27;t like is that shipping cost way more then the product...and you can actually pay less if you go to the store</li>
    <li> I&#x27;mm rating this product a 2 out of 5 stars based on the shipping time. I ordered the eyelash adhesive yesterday and received it today which is great except the adhesive leaked at some point maybe in storage, and was stuck to the plastic wrapping it came in and the glue had completely dried out. A  complete waste, save your money. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend said &amp;#34;While they are very small you dont need much for the lash there I also love the &amp;#34;wic&amp;#34; on the inside it make the application easier. Also the dark color help to blend in with you eyeliner better.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be small :( I think it would get over in 2 applications. Not happy !</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use the glue, it was awful, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t sticky at all .. You might as well put black food coloring in water .. You will get the same results for a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> Okay, so, I purchased this eyelash adhesive not really knowing what to look for in a product of this sort. I bought it &#x27;blindly&#x27;, not really knowing what to expect. Let me begin with saying that each little tube has a tiny applicator stick attached to the top, making it much easier to control how much adhesive to apply to the lashes. I found myself able to apply the tinniest line of adhesive.  Overall, I think that even though I have come to learn more about what to consider when purchasing eyelash adhesives, for this price, it is good. I find it harder to conceal since it dries black. It requires more work.</li>
    <li> Buy Buyyy Buyyy it!! I love it! very good! Best glue and saving money is what i like best about any product! :)</li>
    <li> i wish they hadnt been sooo smalll bnecause i really liked this product alot!~ the best ive tried and it made putting on lashes much easier. however! dont get black because if you need to replace your lashes it will leave a black sticky tacky film and hard to get off after applying make up</li>
    <li> This products works however the amount one obtains is not much(you get about a dime size of adhesive inside). Also, the top tends to get caked up with the adhesive (design of the product- poor). You will be better off paying the $1 extra and getting one that has more product inside and (designed better to hold product inside bottle verses outside the bottle) one that does not get caked up around the opening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing false eyelashes and this was my first adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used. Thus I have no experience to compare it with. It would be nice if there was a better applicator for it.</li>
    <li> SoBold both tubes were dried up once I received don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> Best eyelash glue ever!!!!! Tubes are kinda small but they work fantastic. I will be getting more for sure! Love it</li>
    <li> Works good but kinda a mess.</li>
    <li> Black glue is so so awesome! I&#x27;m in love with it. Plus it has an easy applicator wand. Will rebuy when I run out. RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Both bottles arrived dry! I pulled open the lids only to pull out clumps of rubber! One bottle that I opened pulled out the entire contents of the bottle. Waste of $!</li>
    <li> glue its self is okay BUT if you get the glue anywhere on your face it is a nightmare to get off.  I bought this as and emergency adhesive. I used it one day before i went into the grocery store and accidentally smudged it on the corner of my eye and it wouldnt come off! It looked like it had an eyeliner problem. had to go home anyway to fix the problem.</li>
    <li> CAME DRY!! this is so bad don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> great value for the price. glue definitely takes a full 30 seconds to get tacky, just check it before applying. this was my first time putting on false lashes and it held all night - took a few tries to get it right (mostly my lack of skill) but held well. black color is also great and blends w/mascara and eyeliner</li>
    <li> I like that this glue is black, but I hate it at the same time, because if you get it anywhere, it looks like you smudged your eyeliner or mascara. The glue itself works decently, but is EXTREMELY sticky, and doesn&#x27;t get tacky like most other eyelash glues. It does last all day however, especially once you finally get the eyelashes to stick. The glue tubes are very small, only about 1 1/2 inches tall. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> works pretty well. kept my lashes on all night, had no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new in the faux eyelash world but I think next time I will go with a clear adhesive. This was on for a couple days despite my attempts to remove. However, it just blended in with my eyeliner so it was not noticible. Worked well and held lashes in place, even in the rain.</li>
    <li> Best adhesive out there!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Only need a tiny amount and lasts well. I don&#x27;t use this often, so I need to know it will keep the lashes stuck for at least an entire evening. It does.</li>
    <li> Because of this I no longer need to use eyeliner on my top lid. I don&#x27;t like how fast it dries, it either stays attached on the corner of my lashes and is loose in the middle or other way around. Every time I wear lashes I need to touch up the sides. When they say water proof they mean it. I spilled a tube all over my leg and it took three showers to get off. Over all I still prefer it over any other eyelash glue.</li>
    <li> these sticks of glue are very tiny~</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be bigger the tubes are as small as quarters. Too over priced for a product that stains your eyes and messes up your make up.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected, did not use and leave them on for the night</li>
    <li> So hard to apply. I wish it was clear but it is black so if you make mistake applying it you have to fix your eye make up completely.</li>
    <li> I apply a thin layer onto my false lashes and I have about 4-7 seconds to put them in the right spot and it dries pretty fast without all the clumps. I really like this because I usually wear half falsies everyday/every other day. Quick and efficient. Oh and dries black, blends nicely with your eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-You only have a few seconds before it dries. (pro&amp;con)&lt;br /&gt;If you get it in the wrong spot and don&#x27;t remove the glue from your eyelid, it&#x27;s pretty tough to get out.&lt;br /&gt;-Very small amount of product&lt;br /&gt;-If you don&#x27;t close it carefully it dries out pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;Which is what happened to mine, and I lost the other one.&lt;br /&gt;So I will be purchasing another because so far this is my favorite brand of eyelash glue. The others are too clumpy and rubbery for me.</li>
    <li> I love that black color and there was no strong glue smell.  It held all night (several hours) with no loosening.  Very easy to use.  I think this might be the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I did not use this product.</li>
    <li> These tubes of eyelash adhesive are small...but they work so so good! Other eyelash glue that I&#x27;ve tried would come off within hours and is a pain to put on. But this stuff is so easy and fast! It stays put all day until you take it off! I&#x27;ll buy some more when I run out :)</li>
    <li> This seems like a good glue in terms of staying power.  BUT, you better be a pro at putting on lashes, because if you&#x27;re not, the black glue is visible and does not try clear.  I&#x27;ve practiced with pretty thick eyeliner on my lash line, but still ended up not putting the lashes on correctly, having to shift, which resulted in black glue all over my eye lid.  It looked like I went crazy with black mascara or eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like how it had a wand applicator, as that made it easy to put the product on the falsies before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I think it&#x27;s a decent lash glue at a great price, but I would recommend to only those who are pros at putting falsies on.</li>
    <li> Theyre a little messy but they work good enough for that price i do recomend buying these to anyone lol</li>
    <li> wow!!! one of the best eyelash adhesive!! thank you!</li>
    <li> do not like  to messy</li>
    <li> Isnt exactly water proof, but it works!</li>
    <li> I wear fake lashes, and I hate when you can see the glue.  This glue is better.  I will let you know as I am still experimenting with this glue.</li>
    <li> It is what its advertised to be but I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Buen producto! Gracias</li>
    <li> I dont recommend this, I bought this exited wantin eyelash glue, it ripped my eyelashes. DONT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! It&#x27;s a great product!.</li>
    <li> One of the tubes I purchased dried out with cumps by the third time I tried to use.  I am very disappointed in this product. Will not order this item from this site. Purchaser be ware.</li>
    <li> The glue was realle sticky, I loved it. But its not good for first time users. If you mess up, its gets all over ur eyes and its hard to wipe off.</li>
    <li> am given two star because the item was two tinny pieces and very had to even hold, other than that it fit perfectly to my fakelashes</li>
    <li> This eye lash glue does not stay on... I do not recommend ive worn fake eyelashes for years and this glue sucks</li>
    <li> My daughter was happy with it.</li>
    <li> These are garbage. Both tubes were all dried up and served absolutely no purpose. Make sure your products are actually usable before you sell them.</li>
    <li> The glue is hard to apply and does not hold very well. I do like how it is black, but it isn&#x27;t very sticky.</li>
    <li> Not that great of lash adhesive. The application is way too thin and moveable even after waiting 1 min+ for it to dry. I&#x27;d always had better luck with lash duo glues.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a BLACK smug when applied.  It is not a &#x27;clean&#x27; application.  I am dark skinned and thought this product would work-total opposite.  I went back to the invisible eyelash adhesives instead of the ones made for dark tones.  Maybe if they made it in Brown..</li>
    <li> Its nice n dry faster than regular glue really like it  ill buy more n recommended to my friends thank you</li>
    <li> Good price.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> It will stil black after dry so if you do a little mess you will need to use a makeup remover and it may run all your shadows out.</li>
    <li> Nice adhesive, and handy applicator, only complaint is the bottles are tiny... But than again it&#x27;s not like you need a Ton of this stuff anyway, a little goes a long way. Hold well...even while swimming in a pool and the ocean.</li>
    <li> the package came on time I havent had a chance to use it because the eyelashes i rdered with it havent came yet. The tubes are itty bitty</li>
    <li> Glue was dried up, the last ones I bought were the same and they were great but small, but these ones are really completely dried up. Not worth paying 5 dollars for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good adhesive!! Stay on long &amp; really strong!</li>
    <li> This is an all star adhesive! It&#x27;s dark so it matches my skin tone perfectly. I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This adhesive keeps your lashes on all day! No need to worry about being embarrassed by your eyelashes coming unattached half way through your day. I just wish it came in a bigger size, but it&#x27;s still an amazing glue</li>
    <li> 2 stars because of the fast shipping....&lt;br /&gt;1 of it was completely dry what a waste of money. The product was smaller than I was expecting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Great, stays on for days without adding more to the lash . No clumps ,no stings, no burn . Love it just need big bottle now ;)</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite eyelash adhesive. gives you long lasting hold.Good buy!</li>
    <li> Tube was clumsy and hard to handle. the glue was too slippery and doesn&#x27;t dry fast enough making individual lashes move from original placement.</li>
    <li> The glue is not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t hold the eyelashes on at all! The applicator is not a brush. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Terrible! my eyelashes did not stick what so ever with this glue.</li>
    <li> received the glue bottles both squshed and damaged.A huge mess in the bag it came it.not happy.atleast it was little money I spent.but im not pleased</li>
    <li> Both of mine came dry. It was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Dont buy! Not good quality even for practicing</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stick at all flour and water would work better than this stuff</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Mine came completely dried out and is unusable.</li>
    <li> When I got my package it look like it&#x27;s been torn and the adhesive was all over inside the package :(</li>
    <li> Great to use as eyeliner that won&#x27;t come off... Won&#x27;t adhere the lashes to my eye though :-( just is not sticky enough</li>
    <li> Terrific that it is an eyeliner and glue all in one. Now if I could jut get someone to put it on for me I would be thrilled.. It isnt hard to use at all but just like eyeliner, you need a steady hand and no pets bumping into you as you are applying, lol.</li>
    <li> This is crap... don&#x27;t order it.</li>
    <li> Beware...Really small</li>
    <li> This product works great &amp; keels the eyelashes on for long periods of time. The only problem I would have is that the glue is very hard to remove, sometimes after using makeup remover &amp; washing my face well the glue would still be there. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product &amp; I will most likely buy it again.</li>
    <li> One bottle arrived dry. Poor quality and waste of money. When I took my eyelashes off the glue stayed stuck to my lids and also pulled some of my natural lashes off even after using mild soap and water it&#x27;s was hard to remove. I even tried a little Vaseline and eye makeup removal gel and was very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even keep the lashes in place</li>
</ol>
