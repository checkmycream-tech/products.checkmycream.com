      <li>It was not as good as my expectations.</li>
      <li>good investment for your feet.</li>
      <li>and it just isn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>She has always liked taking footbaths, but this stuff has been THE best by her account since I bought it for her for the first time 2 Christmases ago.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also great to put a packet or two in a full bath.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something magical about Johnson&#x27;s foot soap.  </li>
      <li>What more can I say?  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>I found that a plastic &amp;#34;dish washing tub&amp;#34; works perfect and only costs a couple of bucks.</li>
      <li>Amazing and the product does exactly what it states.</li>
      <li>I have burned through 12 doses of this stuff and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it did help a little.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But cheap and delivered to your door via Amazon.</li>
      <li>and she is happy that her sore feet finally met their match.</li>
      <li>Loved it since the early &#x27;60s, when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the relief it does provide is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and a God send when your feet are really hurting.</li>
      <li>Just like the old days except on line, fast service and good price.</li>
      <li>Its smells a little of soap and iodine, but boy...does it feel good on the feet, and then all over.  </li>
      <li>So soothing, I boil water in a kettle before, so once my feet are in I add hot water as needed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first learned of Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap packets in an Amazon review by a man soaking his feet in a dishpan.</li>
      <li>It definitely does something to your skin, making it softer and more supple.</li>
      <li>Son and frined have used, really helps with smelly feat</li>
      <li>On a side note; if you are like me with a size 13 or larger shoe size, you foot wont fit into one of the &amp;#34;foot tubs&amp;#34; they want you to use.</li>
      <li>Aside from that , I didn&#x27;t feel a real difference in the soreness of my feet.</li>
      <li>I have never used anything but Epson salts, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to.</li>
      <li>In the opinion of a normal guy who works a real job for a living, this stuff is more for women who care about the softness of their feet or for those that don&#x27;t have the deep foot soreness of a blue collar</li>
      <li>One of those &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; things that still live up to everything they claim -- which a lot of products can&#x27;t really say.  </li>
      <li>I stand all day and my feet look forward to this  reward, I find a half a packet (4  packets in each box) plenty to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>To date, after nearly 15 years of marriage, she&#x27;s not cared for anything as much as these.</li>
      <li>Its an old standby I will use forever</li>
      <li>I am a professional mechanic and on my feet all day long.</li>

    <li> My wife LOVES this stuff.  She has always liked taking footbaths, but this stuff has been THE best by her account since I bought it for her for the first time 2 Christmases ago.  It was under the tree again this past Christmas.  In the past, my wife had tried several different brands and types of products.  To date, after nearly 15 years of marriage, she&#x27;s not cared for anything as much as these.</li>
    <li> good investment for your feet.</li>
    <li> I am a professional mechanic and on my feet all day long. I read all the glowing reviews about this stuff and gave it a try. I have never used anything but Epson salts, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to. It definitely does something to your skin, making it softer and more supple. Aside from that , I didn&#x27;t feel a real difference in the soreness of my feet. I have burned through 12 doses of this stuff and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it did help a little.&lt;br /&gt;  In the opinion of a normal guy who works a real job for a living, this stuff is more for women who care about the softness of their feet or for those that don&#x27;t have the deep foot soreness of a blue collar worker.&lt;br /&gt;  ** On a side note; if you are like me with a size 13 or larger shoe size, you foot wont fit into one of the &amp;#34;foot tubs&amp;#34; they want you to use. I found that a plastic &amp;#34;dish washing tub&amp;#34; works perfect and only costs a couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as my expectations. It did not bring the relieve I was needing.</li>
    <li> I first learned of Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap packets in an Amazon review by a man soaking his feet in a dishpan. I was shopping for a dishpan. I thought, why don&#x27;t I take a look and give Johnson&#x27;s a try. I just did. I have a foot bath, but I used the dishpan. I feel like I died and went to heaven. Wonderful. Seriously softens your skin, calluses. Smells good. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Makes my feet so happy!</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery very happy with the product. Its an old standby I will use forever</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something magical about Johnson&#x27;s foot soap.  Its smells a little of soap and iodine, but boy...does it feel good on the feet, and then all over.  Loved it since the early &#x27;60s, when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great to put a packet or two in a full bath.  Just makes you feel good.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years for my pedicures. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Son and frined have used, really helps with smelly feat</li>
    <li> SOAK MY FEET ALL THE TIME FEEL SO GREAT MY WIFE JUST CANT STAND TO SEE ME SOAKING WITH A BEER IN MY HAND HA-HA-HA.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I stand all day and my feet look forward to this  reward, I find a half a packet (4  packets in each box) plenty to work it&#x27;s magic. So soothing, I boil water in a kettle before, so once my feet are in I add hot water as needed.&lt;br /&gt;. I thought I was getting a quantity of 4, 3 pack sets, total of 12 boxes but no, just one - 3 pack. This item is found elsewhere around three dollars a box, just not everywhere.</li>
    <li> works great in my foot spa</li>
    <li> One of those &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; things that still live up to everything they claim -- which a lot of products can&#x27;t really say.  Not a cure-all, but definitely a relief for tired, achy, itchy feet!!</li>
    <li> Just like the old days except on line, fast service and good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Invigorating. A little messy but worth it.</li>
    <li> A must have for dry feet! Amazing and the product does exactly what it states.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of foot problems, from aching feet when on them too long, to skin issues around the toes. There are times when I come home from work that my feet hurt so bad, I can barely walk. Soaking in this every night is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that provides any relief, including soaking in Epsom Salt. Granted, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.....only staying off my feet does that....but the relief it does provide is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and a God send when your feet are really hurting.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> What more can I say?  I sent this to my child at college and she is happy that her sore feet finally met their match.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard to find in local stores! But cheap and delivered to your door via Amazon. Johnson&#x27;s works just as stated. Very good in helping remove corns on feet.</li>
    <li> Sent to aunt in nursing home</li>
    <li> Feet never had it so good!  Our local drug store stopped carrying Johnson&#x27;s in favor of their store brand and it just isn&#x27;t as good.  I was thrilled to find on Amazon.  I usually add some epson salts too and it&#x27;s like a mini vacation for your feet.  I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Soothes tired muscles and smooths the skin. Wonderful!</li>
