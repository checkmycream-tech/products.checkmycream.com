### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In an office it&#x27;s perfect though.</li>
      <li>This is the best deodorant I have ever used.</li>
      <li>On a good day it lasts for perhaps an hour at best.  </li>
      <li>Does great in the 6 hour sitting-at-your-desk test, but crank it up at the gym or go for a 4 mile run</li>
      <li>It smells great going on but</li>
      <li>This is a great DEODORANT, this is not antiperspirant .</li>
      <li>this is a wonderful product for men that&#x27;s safe and smells good!:-)</li>
      <li>smells good, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
      <li>This one is my favorite!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and works fine.</li>
      <li>It may smell nice, but that comes of no use midway through the day when you&#x27;re thinking that you may have forgotten to put your deodorant on.</li>
      <li>The scent is really nice and it lasts through the day for me.</li>
      <li>Would love a good cedarwood deoderant</li>
      <li>I found EMJ at my favorite grocery store, and I&#x27;m sold.</li>
      <li>Really glad to have found it.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum, and this was one of many that I tried.</li>
      <li>Three reps into the Overhead Pull-Down, and like Magic, I chose to switch over to a Legs Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Needs to be applied more than once a day.</li>
      <li>but I still love it</li>
      <li>and I hope to be wearing it for many years.</li>
      <li>but I suggest staying away from the deodorant unless you enjoying smelling like Pysh.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s noxious after wearing it for more than an hour.</li>
      <li>short, it&#x27;s the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found on the market</li>
      <li>Only good thing was that it smelled good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about, this product is great and offers me all day protection.</li>
      <li>Smells good at first, and I was happy to use something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but DOES NOT LAST.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better all-natural, aluminum free, animal free testing</li>
      <li>This is the first deodorant, or antiperspirant, that I have been able to use in many years without breaking out in a rash.</li>
      <li>This PitStick had me feeling confident at first...</li>
      <li>But everyone has a unique B.O., so you&#x27;re gonna have to keep trying ones out until you find a match.</li>
      <li>The price is high, but it seemed like a good product at first.</li>
      <li>It keeps me dry and smelling good from morning to until afternoon</li>
      <li>The product smells quite lovely and would be fantastic if it actually worked to i</li>
      <li>I rarely ever email the company for a refund</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant products in hopes of finding the right one</li>
      <li>Even non-antiperspirant deodorants irritate my skin, and this is the first thing I&#x27;ve been able to buy regularly that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>so my experience might be different from yours, but I personally enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild and pleasant, my wife likes it, and despite the other reviews thus far (which sound like they might be the same person bearing some sort of a irrational grudge) has given me all the \\&quot;protection\\&quot; I could need or desire.</li>
      <li>This product smells very nice, I enjoy being able to find a deodorant with a &#x27;mature&#x27; scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like a middle school dance, but this product wears off before lunchtime, and you end up smelling worse than having worn nothing at all.</li>
      <li>really wanted to like this item.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re out working with your body for much of the day, it probably won&#x27;t cut it.</li>
      <li>It produced a very musty odor</li>
      <li>This deodorant and antiperspirant  really works  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to succeed.</li>
      <li>I am very thankful to have found Every Man Jack deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was tempted to give this a higher rating, as I really appreciate the natural profile (no animal testing, no propylene glycol, etc.).</li>
      <li>However, I can say from experience that leaving a stick in your gym bag in your car (even in cool Colorado), or putting it in your suitcase in a car trunk in California, will melt the whole thing in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>The only downsides are that it fetches a premium at the aforementioned grocery store such that it is best purchased when on sale (or over the internet...), and so far it hasn&#x27;t been the easiest brand to find (only at said</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of many other EMJ products due to the value/quality balance but this product smells great when you remove the top but provides, at least for me, zero odor protection.  </li>
      <li>The scent is great, but for anyone even remotely active, it wears off after a few hours.</li>
      <li>I live high in the Rocky Mountains and did quite a bit of work (and play) outdoors this summer and was never found wanting.</li>
      <li>I put it on right before a 5 mile run and came back smelling like a farm animal.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to people who have sensitive underarms.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly the same experience.</li>
      <li>found that this product offered no protection from BO, and even made it worse, due to the, at first pleasant, perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I understand making things natural, but they need to be functional too - and this product is not up to snuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the Every Man Jack products, but this deodorant offers zero odor protection whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because it was advertised as being all natural and &amp;#34;cedarwood&amp;#34; scented..</li>
      <li>After 4 hours or wearing this product, the product did not keep me fresh and the weather was only 55 degrees outside.  </li>
      <li>I have to assume there are better natural deodorants out there, though I sense that this might be a common issue.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re doing any kind of serious physical activity, forget about it.</li>
      <li>I am probably going back to my Old Spice which is non-anti-persperant.</li>
      <li>I have to reapply this multiple times a day, whereas if I use Degree or Old Spice, it lasts me all day.</li>
      <li>It kind of froths up when you put it on, which he didn&#x27;t mind, but all the witch hazel dried him out and made his underarms raw and red.</li>
      <li>These are not extreme temperatures, just regular travel issues that kill the product.</li>
      <li>I prefer non-antiperspirant deodorants (antiperspirant deodorants have the opposite effect on me), and my choices have historically been somewhat limited to those scents reminiscent of old people.</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, as a matter of fact</li>
<li> It does not &amp;#34;Get Long Lasting odor protection&amp;#34;; initial i thought it was my environment/food/conditions but after reading other experiences of the product</li>

<li> Based on this description, I expected it to smell like, you know, cedarwood.</li>

<li> I can&#x27;t detect a trace of cedar, or any of the other ingredients listed, like rosemary or sage.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, as several other people have pointed out, it basically fails as a deodorant.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few days now and almost midway through the day, I start to develop serious body odor.</li>
<li> Sucks.</li>
<li> It almost makes it worse because it is scented like cedarwood.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll have people around you annoyed, wondering why you&#x27;re not wearing any deodorant.</li>
<li> Sorry, EMJ.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep buying your shaving products but your deodorant stinks.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s THAT bad.</li>
<li> The rest of their products seem to work, but this is the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> This product is terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Would love a good cedarwood deoderant but this isn&#x27;t the one. It doesn&#x27;t last very long, as a matter of fact it doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan. If you&#x27;re out working with your body for much of the day, it probably won&#x27;t cut it. In an office it&#x27;s perfect though. Even non-antiperspirant deodorants irritate my skin, and this is the first thing I&#x27;ve been able to buy regularly that doesn&#x27;t. Really glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now and almost midway through the day, I start to develop serious body odor. It almost makes it worse because it is scented like cedarwood. I am probably going back to my Old Spice which is non-anti-persperant. I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s THAT bad. I&#x27;d rather not smell like a bag of onions.</li>
    <li> I am very thankful to have found Every Man Jack deodorant. This is the first deodorant, or antiperspirant, that I have been able to use in many years without breaking out in a rash. I highly recommend this product to people who have sensitive underarms.</li>
    <li> This product smells very nice, I enjoy being able to find a deodorant with a &#x27;mature&#x27; scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like a middle school dance, but this product wears off before lunchtime, and you end up smelling worse than having worn nothing at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Every Man Jack products, but this deodorant offers zero odor protection whatsoever. It may smell nice, but that comes of no use midway through the day when you&#x27;re thinking that you may have forgotten to put your deodorant on. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I rarely ever email the company for a refund but this is product is everything other customers have said about the deodorant. It does not &amp;#34;Get Long Lasting odor protection&amp;#34;; initial i thought it was my environment/food/conditions but after reading other experiences of the product it&#x27;s exactly the same experience. Every Man Jack has lost me as a customer and everyone that i work nearby.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was advertised as being all natural and &amp;#34;cedarwood&amp;#34; scented.. Based on this description, I expected it to smell like, you know, cedarwood. I can&#x27;t detect a trace of cedar, or any of the other ingredients listed, like rosemary or sage. Instead, this smells like some department store cologne and it&#x27;s noxious after wearing it for more than an hour.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve been a fan of Every Man Jack for years, it was not until a few weeks ago I decided to give the deodorant a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I feel as if like EVJ needs to go back to the drawing board with this product because it doesn&#x27;t offer any protection what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still continue purchasing Every Man Jack products but I suggest staying away from the deodorant unless you enjoying smelling like Pysh. Ed class.</li>
    <li> I have had two sticks of this deodorant - both of them melted within a week, rendering them unusable. The price is high, but it seemed like a good product at first. If you only leave it in your bathroom - it still may be. However, I can say from experience that leaving a stick in your gym bag in your car (even in cool Colorado), or putting it in your suitcase in a car trunk in California, will melt the whole thing in a short amount of time. These are not extreme temperatures, just regular travel issues that kill the product. I understand making things natural, but they need to be functional too - and this product is not up to snuff.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to succeed. It smells great going on but what happens after even just a few hours of wearing it is you literally stink worse than if you had never put it on even if you were only lightly perspiring. Im talking really pungent stink which i never get even when i wear no deoderant at all... strange and unfortunate. .i really wanted to like this item.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and works fine. I appreciate the all-natural ingredients for all the hard work they do, but around that 3pm doze in the office, you&#x27;ll be kept awake by faint swifts of your own B.O. Does great in the 6 hour sitting-at-your-desk test, but crank it up at the gym or go for a 4 mile run and you&#x27;re back smelling au naturale in no time. I put it on right before a 5 mile run and came back smelling like a farm animal. I&#x27;ve used better all-natural, aluminum free, animal free testing, whatever else it is that powers that drive to search organic deodorant on Amazon. But everyone has a unique B.O., so you&#x27;re gonna have to keep trying ones out until you find a match. Every Man Jack just wasn&#x27;t the man for me.</li>
    <li> This deodorant and antiperspirant  really works  It keeps me dry and smelling good from morning to until afternoon I just wish it lasted all day but I still love it and I even got my dad a stick and he loves it too.</li>
    <li> Works well but causes some irritation</li>
    <li> Sucks. Needs to be applied more than once a day. Only good thing was that it smelled good. But didn&#x27;t last long. Not a working mans deodorant. Gotta find something else for hubby</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used. Go for it. Works well and no aluminium.</li>
    <li> This is a great DEODORANT, this is not antiperspirant . It will keep the smell away but not the water!!</li>
    <li> I was tempted to give this a higher rating, as I really appreciate the natural profile (no animal testing, no propylene glycol, etc.). Unfortunately, as several other people have pointed out, it basically fails as a deodorant. The scent is great, but for anyone even remotely active, it wears off after a few hours. If you&#x27;re doing any kind of serious physical activity, forget about it. You&#x27;ll have people around you annoyed, wondering why you&#x27;re not wearing any deodorant. So unless you&#x27;re planning on carrying it around with you and reapplying every so often, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I have to assume there are better natural deodorants out there, though I sense that this might be a common issue.</li>
    <li> I prefer non-antiperspirant deodorants (antiperspirant deodorants have the opposite effect on me), and my choices have historically been somewhat limited to those scents reminiscent of old people. I found EMJ at my favorite grocery store, and I&#x27;m sold. The scent is mild and pleasant, my wife likes it, and despite the other reviews thus far (which sound like they might be the same person bearing some sort of a irrational grudge) has given me all the \\&quot;protection\\&quot; I could need or desire. I live high in the Rocky Mountains and did quite a bit of work (and play) outdoors this summer and was never found wanting. The only downsides are that it fetches a premium at the aforementioned grocery store such that it is best purchased when on sale (or over the internet...), and so far it hasn&#x27;t been the easiest brand to find (only at said grocery store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found on the market and I hope to be wearing it for many years.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.  After 4 hours or wearing this product, the product did not keep me fresh and the weather was only 55 degrees outside.  It produced a very musty odor so I threw the product in the garbage where it belongs.</li>
    <li> I love this product. this is a wonderful product for men that&#x27;s safe and smells good!:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman so my experience might be different from yours, but I personally enjoyed this product. I was looking for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum, and this was one of many that I tried. This one is my favorite! The scent is really nice and it lasts through the day for me. I&#x27;ve tried GeoDeo, Kiss My Face, and Jasons and this is my number one pick! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I work a desk job, I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time I broke a sweat at work.  This PitStick had me feeling confident at first... a few hours later I was aware of a faint BO smell, mixed with the Cedar scent.  By the end of my work day, I was not looking forward to my gym session.  Three reps into the Overhead Pull-Down, and like Magic, I chose to switch over to a Legs Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this product offered no protection from BO, and even made it worse, due to the, at first pleasant, perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever buy it again, it would be as a White Elephant Gift, for someone I wanted to see squirm...</li>
    <li> The product smells quite lovely and would be fantastic if it actually worked to i don&#x27;t know....STOP ODOR. I used this for 4 days and had a noticeable stench at the end of each day. The product simply does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Smells good at first, and I was happy to use something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but DOES NOT LAST. I have to reapply this multiple times a day, whereas if I use Degree or Old Spice, it lasts me all day. The rest of their products seem to work, but this is the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of many other EMJ products due to the value/quality balance but this product smells great when you remove the top but provides, at least for me, zero odor protection.  On a good day it lasts for perhaps an hour at best.  I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant products in hopes of finding the right one but this is the only one where I actually smell worse at the end of the day than if I had applied nothing at all. Sorry, EMJ.  I&#x27;ll keep buying your shaving products but your deodorant stinks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and after a week he refuses to use it. It kind of froths up when you put it on, which he didn&#x27;t mind, but all the witch hazel dried him out and made his underarms raw and red. He&#x27;s never had topical allergies, but this is going in the trash.  smells good, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about, this product is great and offers me all day protection. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
