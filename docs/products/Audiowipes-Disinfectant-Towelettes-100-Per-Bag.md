      <li>I know my hearing aids are completely clean every night.  </li>
      <li>Keeps them clean</li>
      <li>and I also like knowing my hearing aids are clean.</li>
      <li>When I clean my hearing aids off with these</li>
      <li>I periodically have to instill medication in one ear and need to clean it off the earpiece.  </li>
      <li>They are the same brand his audiologist had given him, and at a good price.</li>
      <li>I think the company could do better by making a smaller wipe and putting more in a box.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has to wear hearing aids and know for sure will never get an ear infection like I had.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the size and don&#x27;t let them go to waste.</li>
      <li>Very convenient way to clean my aids each day.</li>
      <li>At 5&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;,  they are just too darn large!  </li>
      <li>The size did not bother my (a little larger then most) because they clean nicely.</li>
      <li>We bought them for a&lt;br /&gt;much higher price at the audiologist&#x27;s office so the price&lt;br /&gt;is</li>

      <li>The towelettes work good, but they could be a little smaller.</li>
      <li>Worked good as cleaners, just seemed like a waste for a one-time use towlette being so big.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was the only place I was able to locate these wipes to purchase and have purchased this item several times since then using them every evening before bedtime cleaning my hearing aids.  </li>
      <li>Open the individual packet, cut the towelette (folded in fourths) in four, tuck the other three back into the packet, fold the top of the packet over to keep them moist, and these last longer and are much more practical to use as a wipe when you take your hearing aides out for the day before putting them away.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have several hearing aids to clean at once, but I only have one.</li>
      <li>and I can keep a couple in my bag for her aids or as hand wipes or to clean other things.</li>
      <li>Luckily I kept the box from a prior purchase from a different vendor.</li>
      <li>These are not as good as the Audiowipes Disenfectant towelettes in the canister (also by Oaktree Products) because they are VERY thin.</li>
      <li>For my use, they&#x27;re just a little too big for just grabbing one to clean my hearing aid every night just before I put it in the de-humidifier.  </li>
      <li>Only complaint would be that they are pretty large.  </li>
      <li>They are individually wrapped and do not dry out before you&#x27;re done.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be a waste to make them this large since you really only need a 2&amp;#34;</li>

    <li> These are not as good as the Audiowipes Disenfectant towelettes in the canister (also by Oaktree Products) because they are VERY thin. When I clean my hearing aids off with these it doesn&#x27;t feel or look like I am getting them clean like it did with the wipes in the canister. The reason I decided to get these this time was because the canister comes with 160 wipes and by the time I got down to about 50 wipes left they had dried out so I couldn&#x27;t use them (I stored the canister upside down so the wipes at the top would be moist - which ended up being detrimental to the wipes at the end of the roll - can&#x27;t win). I am not happy with these wipes. I bought 100 of them because I thought they would be the same as the ones in the canister, just individually wrapped, be warned, they are not!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with the use of the 100 pack wipes that I reordered. I thought I would try the popup container, thinking it would be easier use.  I could not open it and returned it.  I reordered the 100 pack and am using them.  I find my hearing aids are in much better condition than before.  Most of the wax stains are removed and my ears and hearing are improved.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy and satisfied with the Audiowipes and the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> These are fine but I find I do not use them as often as I thought.</li>
    <li> Perfect for daily cleaning your hearing aids- dries quickly! These should be sold in drugstores!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time. The wipes were in a box not loose as another customer experienced. I used it on my two hearing aids and it only took a minute for them to dry. Some customers expressed that they are too big. I am happy with the size and don&#x27;t let them go to waste. After wiping off my hearing aides, I used the wipe on my computer and the remote controls. They are a handy thing to have.</li>
    <li> These work well for their purpose.  We bought them for a&lt;br /&gt;much higher price at the audiologist&#x27;s office so the price&lt;br /&gt;is good.  They are a bit larger than needed but do the&lt;br /&gt;job quite well with cleaning my husband&#x27;s hearing aids.</li>
    <li> I write music for a living, and so often bring earphones to public events for people to listen to my work. I always swab the earphones with these before I give them to people, both for my benefit and for theirs.</li>
    <li> these do a great job for me because I wear aids in both ears and one towelette handles both of them.  I periodically have to instill medication in one ear and need to clean it off the earpiece.  I have a dryer for my aids and want them clean going in.&lt;br /&gt;I have the canister for home and the bulk individuals for my briefcase and car and luggage for travel.&lt;br /&gt;They contain no alcohol which is not good for plastic on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with these hearing aid wipes. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had the loose product before they seemed to dry out before I used them up. The packets are great.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning the hearing aids at home or on travel. Only complaint would be that they are pretty large.  I cut one packet into  1/3 piece and easily cleaned my device for a week.  Just fold the foil pouch over itself to self seal.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to clean my hearing aids, especially when I travel, but they&#x27;re pretty expensive for what they are...</li>
    <li> My husband uses these when he travels.  They are the same brand his audiologist had given him, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I keep some of these handy towlette wipes, in my truck, purse and in a drawer beside my bed. I like that they come in individual packets and I also like knowing my hearing aids are clean.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THESE BETTER THAN THE CANISTER BECAUSE THEY ARE SO PORTABLE. I STASH THEM ALL OVER SO THEY WILL BE NEARBY</li>
    <li> very useful for traveling with hearing aids</li>
    <li> Audiowipes is an excellent product,  It does the job effectively, no mess, and dries quickly.  I really like this product because it&#x27;s alcohol free, and will not dry the rubber hearing aid inserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe.  At 5&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;,  they are just too darn large!  It seems to be a waste to make them this large since you really only need a 2&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34; square at most.  They could also be 2-ply, therefore saving a lot of material and waste on the customer&#x27;s part.  It&#x27;s really a shame that most folks end up throwing most of this wipe away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I really like this product, I gave it 4 stars simply because of the waste factor.  I think the company could do better by making a smaller wipe and putting more in a box.  If this were to happen, it would definitely be more economical, and make a very good product an excellent one.</li>
    <li> Back in July while daily wearing my hearing aids I ended up with a horrible, terribly painful ear infection ending up with 4 visits to the ear, nose and throat doctor for treatment.  Sometime back then I found out these Audiowipes containing no alcohol are recommended by my audiologist doctor.  Amazon was the only place I was able to locate these wipes to purchase and have purchased this item several times since then using them every evening before bedtime cleaning my hearing aids.  I am absolutely confident to never again experience another ear infection like I had.  I know my hearing aids are completely clean every night.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has to wear hearing aids and know for sure will never get an ear infection like I had.</li>
    <li> Very convenient way to clean my aids each day.</li>
    <li> Great sized towelettes that I purchased to clean my hearing aids. They come 2 pkgs per sheet and 100 per box. The wipes are perfect for those like me who have difficulty with those smaller wipes.  The hearing aids don&#x27;t fall out of the towelette.  Definately will reoder these from the seller. I love them. Sold by LIBERTY Supply and Fulfilled by Amazon. Gift-wrap available. Recounted and boxed by seller.</li>
    <li> Good product, shipping &amp; price</li>
    <li> INDIVIDUAL CLEANERS THAT YOU CAN EASILY CARRY IN MY PURSE TO CLEAR SWEAT AND WAX IN MINUTES AND BE ON MY WAY.</li>
    <li> What can you say about disinfectant towelettes?</li>
    <li> My audiologist recommended that I care for my new hearing aids a certain way.  I just spent 4K on them.  This is a small expense and can help me are for them.</li>
    <li> Nice and moist work great</li>
    <li> I  found out about the towelettes from my audiologist. Open the individual packet, cut the towelette (folded in fourths) in four, tuck the other three back into the packet, fold the top of the packet over to keep them moist, and these last longer and are much more practical to use as a wipe when you take your hearing aides out for the day before putting them away.</li>
    <li> My husband liked them</li>
    <li> They do the job well, and don&#x27;t dry out like the canisters do sometimes. The biggest downside to them is the cost.</li>
    <li> Half of these wipes are completely dry upon opening them! Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use these on my aids every night. Keeps them clean so they work well. Think I&#x27;ll get the dispenser next time and save these when we travel</li>
    <li> These are great wipes for my daughters hearing aids. They are larger than you would expect, but I like that they are a little bigger and I can keep a couple in my bag for her aids or as hand wipes or to clean other things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the wipes work as advertised, but I was not prepared for the warnings posted on the packets. Why a disinfectant should require washing &amp;#34;contaminated&amp;#34; clothing and hand washing after use is beyond me. I will use these up, but I don&#x27;t see my reordering them any time soon.</li>
    <li> Works just fine.  Towelettes clean and disinfect a pair of hearing aids with no mess or fuss.  I&#x27;ve used them for several years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously since it was recommended by my audiologist.  I assume it is sanitizing hearing aids.  I know it does not in any way affect the color of my hearing aids, which other harsh products would do.</li>
    <li> The towelettes work good, but they could be a little smaller.</li>
    <li> AS advertised. repeat order</li>
    <li> For my use, they&#x27;re just a little too big for just grabbing one to clean my hearing aid every night just before I put it in the de-humidifier.  Was looking for just small, purse-size packets.  If the size of each little packet was in the description somwhere and I missed it, then my fault.  They looked small in the picture.  Worked good as cleaners, just seemed like a waste for a one-time use towlette being so big.  Maybe if you have several hearing aids to clean at once, but I only have one.</li>
    <li> The packets just came in the plastic package they were shipped in.  Luckily I kept the box from a prior purchase from a different vendor. Otherwise, all is okay.</li>
    <li> The wipes immediately and properly cleaned my hearing aids.  Better that the ones I received from my audiologist.  They are individually wrapped and do not dry out before you&#x27;re done.  The size did not bother my (a little larger then most) because they clean nicely.</li>
