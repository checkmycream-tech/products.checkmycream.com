<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To start off this review i say WOW! Super fast shipping and the product was not what i expected. This is my wife&#x27;s signiture perfume and she was low on her small bottle so i ordered this one. Thr price i payed for her other bottle i thought i was going to get another small bottle because the price was a dollar off here so when we got the package it was a surprise that we got a large bottle for such a cheap price. Thank you guys so much i will be ordering from you again.</li>
    <li> I paid $ 58 for the jean paul classic and received the madame that has a value of 35$&lt;br /&gt;  I feel robbed and cheated. Do not recommend them because they sent me a lower priced product</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good quality</li>
    <li> Quality product and price where as promised. Delivered and received as expected and did a great job.</li>
    <li> i love it so so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it love it love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best perfume i ever had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks a lot</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic fragrance, but my review is useless because how do you describe a scent?  I love it and so does my husband.  It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;!  whatever that means!  Sorry I can&#x27;t do a better job describing it.</li>
    <li> She loves it... I love it. What more can i say? Anytime i perceive it&#x27;s scent from the garden of her embrace, i cry for help in a weird way that gladdens my heart and fills it with the steepness of awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume can make a guy write poems of love even without knowing. Wear it with confidence. It works!!! I know it does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the 90s.. I switch to different perfumes but always come back to this. I love the bottle and the special editions of them as well. This is a new classic like Chanel 5.</li>
    <li> If you want a perfume that doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or like body splash then this is the one. This perfume smells like it was made for royalty. My father bought this for me at full price $95, and it was worth every dollar to me. I didn&#x27;t give this four stars because it can be too strong at times so if you are not feeling in a good mood or you&#x27;re having a headache, it&#x27;s best to use something lighter. This is a rich, strong but womanly scent. This is not a little girl&#x27;s perfume, this is women&#x27;s perfume. My friend&#x27;s love this scent. They always say how I smell like a superstar. It just gives you that rich woman air and feel. Trust me, this is one for sophisticated ladies only.</li>
    <li> The perfume is old.  Smells bad and not what I used before.  I didn&#x27;t know this would come from somewhere other then a reliable department store cosmetic counter.  They will not let me return it.  Say they won&#x27;t take perfume back.  Sam&#x27;s SUCKS....I am now stuck with a $60 bottle of perfume that smells like old ladies wear. all fragrance can get old, even expensive perfume!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Sweet and delcious smell, stays on for hours. Very good quality perfume made with quality essential oils.</li>
    <li> JPG men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s my favorite, not to strong very fresh smelling just like getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE GENUINE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Its intensity and flavor are delicious. It keeps all the time and even after washing the garments retain the nuances of perfume.</li>
    <li> Strong and sweet. My mom makes me buy one of this a year. We use a lot of this parfum to go out at night. Its one of the best ever.&lt;br /&gt;(not for daily use)</li>
    <li> This perfurme is the best perfume of all times, it has a longlasting smell, sweet smell, but not too sweet, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and received another, inspite of Classique I received Classique Summer, which costs lot less than I supposed to bought!!!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this scent.  Have worn it for about 15 years now and even tho I try others from time to time, keep coming back to this one.  It is nice to layer it with the lotion, and eau de toilette, and it lasts all day. I have never found a better price than the one on Amazon. I never buy from department stores any more, as it costs about $20 more.</li>
    <li> Good scent, good price - not over powering.  My friend loves it I would recommend this product I bought it as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and it is one of the few, that doesn&#x27;t bother my nose, and drive my sinus&#x27;s to headache</li>
    <li> Gaultier Always have excelent products than evoques about how good is smell something light and delicate any time you want</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
    <li> Vendor shipped on time, not a sample the real Eau De Toilette.  I have used this secent for years and it&#x27;s a hard find.  Leave it to Amazon to find vendors that can sell me my old time favorite.  I always try to change perfumes and the only one that I get complements when I&#x27;m wearing is Jean Paul Gaultier!!  Great purchase and I highly recommend it..</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! recommend</li>
    <li> I was offered a perfume and they send me the \\&quot;DEMONSTRATION\\&quot; that says NOT FOR SALE with a box that is not the original package (maybe not even an original)....how can they sell it like that.... I want my refund ITS A 100% SCAM THIS SALE</li>
    <li> Slightly disappointed in the longevity of the aroma.  I love the bottle, it is a hoot and its great to have to show around.</li>
    <li> Very upset about this.  Cap to bottle was open before opening the package, causing 1/4+ of the liquid to spill out in tin container / box.  Item cannot be returned to Amazon because it is a liquid, so there is no way to get a replacement / refund!</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS DELICIOUS.  LOVE THE BOTTLE AND THE UNIQUE PACKAGE CAN.  THE REASON I ORDERED WAS BECAUSE I GOT A SAMPLE SWIPE THROUGH THE MAIL AND I WAS HOOKED.  THE SCENT STAYED ON FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE ME FEEL FAB.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL REFER THIS TO MY FRIENDS/FAM.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU..</li>
    <li> Love this perfume but leaked and was half empty when it arrived.</li>
    <li> everything went well. The perfum arrived very fast. Recomended!</li>
    <li> Coz its sexy for winter time give u a&lt;br /&gt;Warm feeling n wherever i go ppl asked me  wat is the name of my perfume n its stay for a day or so i highly recommended it</li>
    <li> My wife loves as well as I do.  I first got this for her while enjoying a vacation I won in a design contest that sent us both 1st class everything to St. Thomas.  It powered up the love there and still does.&lt;br /&gt;GW</li>
    <li> thank you very much for being so diligent, everything is very good, and can recommend, I will be ever alert for future purchases</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it and has been using it for years, So if she&#x27;s happy, then I&#x27;m happppppy. I use the man&#x27;s version of it and the price is good to boot.</li>
    <li> What can I say about perfume? I bought this for my wife because it&#x27;s one of her favorites. It smells good. Lasts all day too. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> buenos d&amp;iacute;as gracias por el producto estoy muy satisfecho,la entrega fue rapida como estaba indicada en la compra bay hasta luego</li>
    <li> I Love the smell of this perfume. Just enough. Not too strong. Mild and last all day. When I saw that this is on sale. I bought it right away.</li>
    <li> The recipient loves the product. It is her favorite scent. The product was exactly as expected. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend is very happy with it, I think that I am going to buy a new one asap.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Xmas gift for my wife.  She had bought the men&#x27;s version for me this past summer...which she absolutely loved.  Was told the fragrance was similar.  However; upon receiving, and trying.. , easily determined that it was not even close.  Strange strong fragrance that seems to lean more toward stale cigar /tobacco odor as the dominant aroma.  Cant return so both of us are extremely dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this product based on the description of the scent and a recommendation of a friend.  When it arrived it turned out to be a tester bottle, which I don&#x27;t mind so much because the price was so good.  I fell in love with this scent.  It smells wonderful - very feminine without being too sweet or flowery.  It lasts a long time too.  Definitely a repeater.</li>
    <li> love this fragrance, smelled it in New Zealand and could not believe that i had waited so long to even sample this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great packaged and good shipping will do business again.</li>
    <li> Love this and the men&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> The Perfume is original. I love it, the scent is irresistible, I recommend this item, it&#x27;s the best, no doubts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jean Paul for over 15 years. This perfume is a statement,  a signature! Stays long. Every time I wear it, I get tons of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Woody, fruity, a keep!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful! I was looking for a replacement for Fendi and this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Nothing great about this scent.  It smells almost cheap.  I was very surprised.  I think with perfumes you get bad batches sometimes.  I&#x27;ve bought Boucheron for 20 years, and every five years it just smelled worse and worse, so I think they cheapen them sometimes too.  Who knows, but, it was not what I expected.  Luckily I got a small amount just to try.  I won&#x27;t be buying this one.  Too cheap smelling.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto.... Vino en la lata donde debe venir, excelente empaque y tiempo de entrega justo al momento que se indico</li>
    <li> wonderful service and I love the cologne. packaged so it would not break.  I am sure i would order again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who loves it.</li>
