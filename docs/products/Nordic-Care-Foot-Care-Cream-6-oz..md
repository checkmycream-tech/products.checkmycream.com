<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product was recommended for my heels, while getting a peticure. They were cracked and sore. I have the softest , nicest looking heels now. I also use it on my shins, chest and the backs of my hands. It makes them look and feel younger. I love the product, and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It arrived as promised!  Both my husband and I use Nordic Care Foot Cream in our dry Colorado climate!</li>
    <li> NORDIC CARE CREAM IS VERY SOOTHING FOR ACHING FEET.  I USE IT TWICE A DAY MOST DAYS, BUT ESPECIALLY SOOTHING TO USE JUST BEFORE BEDTIME. I HAVE NEUROPATHY AND IT MAKES MY FEET FEEL BETTER.  ABSORBS VERY FAST, SO NO GREASY RESIDUE TO DEAL WITH.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with cracking heels and dry feet for years, and nothing seems to work for more than a few months. I guess maybe my skin gets used to whatever cream I am putting on it, and then it quits working as well. That may happen with this cream too, but the difference is that when I used this cream, I had good results after the first application! I could really tell the difference after 10 minutes, and that has never really happened before. I have high hopes that my search for good foot cream is over.</li>
    <li> I have always had very soft skin on my feet, but that all changed when I walked a mini-marathon a few years ago.  About the time I was training for that, I noticed that the skin on my feet was changing and I was having dry skin and cracks around the heels.  I began having pedicures just for the sole purpose of dealing with all the dry skin.  The last time I was in, the man who owns the shop mentioned the continuing problem I was having and suggested I purchase this cream.  Since I had been going there for about six years now and he has never suggested I buy anything from him, I decided to give it a try.  He recommended that for best results I put it on every time I got out of the shower or tub.  I faithfully used it for the first week just like he said and the problem was solved within three days!  Since then I have not been as vigilant and sometimes put it on before bed or forget to put it on at all that day.  Even with the more hit-and-miss approach, I can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made.  My feet look like they way they did ten years ago and if I hadn&#x27;t seen it for myself, I would be skeptical.  If you are having problems with dry and cracked skin on your feet, I would definitely give this a try.  Just a very small amount works wonders so the cost is more than reasonable (plus nothing else was working in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magical stuff --</li>
    <li> A little medicine smell. But sure makes me feet feel nice. This is also the product that the nail salon uses</li>
    <li> I was having a pedicure and started chatting with the lady in the next chair.  She recommended this product and said she hasn&#x27;t had cracking feet since she began using this product.  I just received the product and am hoping for the same results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous!  It saved my feet !  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> This foot cream is fantastic! It has helped me heal cracked heels and keep them soft. I nearly always use them with &amp;#34;O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Foot Cream&amp;#34; which is a wonderful product too. Sometimes I use them with gel heel socks, but now that my heel cracks are healed I usually don&#x27;t need to use the gel heel socks anymore.</li>
    <li> Softens cracked heals without that greasy feeling! I would highly recommend this wonderful product, especially for anyone with dry feet.</li>
    <li> There is NO other product that softens feet as well as Nordic Care Foot Cream&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t understand that all pedicurists don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;No more hard skin - just like a baby&#x27;s feet-)</li>
    <li> Finally after all my searching, doctors prescriptions and over thhe counter medcines I have found the cure. I have got to have been born with the worst feet. They crack and bleed and had horrible callouses on them. I got a pedicure once every four weeks, nothing worked until I found Nordic Care foot cream,it comes from Sweden. Actually the very next day after using it I saw a change, within 3 days it was unbelievable my feet were healing up. I&#x27;m 60 now, and the is the first time I can remember having normal looking feet. No cracks no bleeding no callouses. sandals here I come. After I put it on my feet I would rub the excess on my hands. Yes, they look a lot younger looking from using it. So I ordered the hand cream, and the body lotion, can&#x27;t wait to see the results from that also. You have got to try Nordic Care  products there great.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best product out on the market..BUT you must be faithful and apply it every night for 3 weeks..then every other night.</li>
    <li> This foot cream is a million times better than any prescription creams or other products I&#x27;ve used.  It truly does soften the skin, especially dry cracked heels.</li>
    <li> Item came in exactly as ordered and in good time. That&#x27;s about all I ask of bsiness.   Very good.</li>
    <li> Best foot care cream I have ever used. Just the right amout of emulsion and hydrant. This is my second order.</li>
    <li> Love this I even use it on my hands and my body it helps keep everything soft and I have very very dry skin.</li>

    <li> Living in the desert can be tough on your feet. Nordic Foot Care Cream is FANTASTIC when used daily to get rid of cracked, rough heals.  I use it everyday. What a difference Nordic Care Foot Cream has made on my heels and feet.</li>
    <li> Received sooner than I expected. Very pleased with product &amp; price. So much less than buying in a shop. Will definitely purchase more of this product through Amazon. Note:  after applying product I slipped on a pair of socks and kept them on over night. Amazing how my feet looked the next morning.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this product before from my regular nail shop. It really works. Makes your feet and hands smoother. Sometimes I even use it as regular lotion for my really dry legs after I get out of the shower. Good product!!!</li>
