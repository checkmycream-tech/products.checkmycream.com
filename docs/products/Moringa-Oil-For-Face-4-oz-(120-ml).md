<li> Maybe that&#x27;s the difference since the discription of this brand does not indicate that it&#x27;s &#x27;cold pressed&#x27;.</li>

    <li> It is significantly reducing aging spots on my hands and face. It is working much better than any of the other 3 products I tried. My only concern (a minor one) is that there have been a few very small red spots where I used it (allergy?). When I cut down to once a day the red spots went away.</li>
    <li> Used moringa oil for awhile. Best healing oil. Absorbs in skin without oily feeling.</li>
    <li> My face feels very soft , it absorbs in and doesn&#x27;t  feel oily.</li>
    <li> Great product from the Moringa Tree for dry skin and age spots, I use it daily.  I will reorder! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> l don&#x27;d like  this,sorry</li>
    <li> its a little thick but if i add a little water it smoothes on very nicely. it absorbs beautifully and a little goes a long way. not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought several bottles of this oil for myself and family members. It works great however it does not have the nutty scent found in the natural Moringa seed oil. I have bought from several other sources and loved the natural scent. It seems as if the scent was somehow removed from this brand to be more appealing because some people don&#x27;t like the nutty scent. I would recommend this for those who prefer a milder scented oil. But I prefer the natural nutty scent so will not buy this brand again. If you like the natural nutty scent try Organic Veda or Moringa Source where the oil is &#x27;cold pressed&#x27; to remove it from the seeds. Maybe that&#x27;s the difference since the discription of this brand does not indicate that it&#x27;s &#x27;cold pressed&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I found the Moringa oil very healing. I take the powder every morning and the oil on my face at night is very soothing. I would highly recommend this company .</li>
    <li> This oil is phenominal. A must have in every man or woman&#x27;s medicine cabinet. It is truly a miracle oil that is good for the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing for healthier more vibrant skin. It defies wrinkles and even existing scars are fainter. I&#x27;m hooked! I put Lemon Oil on first, avoiding the eye area, and then the Moringa. BTW, you can use it on your hands, arms, and chest if you&#x27;re battling sun damage.I</li>
    <li> Just trying it now - waiting for results</li>
    <li> Oil works great on your face</li>
    <li> I bought it-- not really sure if it works.. I do NOT like the bottle--- there is no spout--- it will pour out and you only need a few drops.</li>
