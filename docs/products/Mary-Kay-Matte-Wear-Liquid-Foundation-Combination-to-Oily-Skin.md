<li> I am an acne sufferer and it makes it hard to find make up that doesn&#x27;t make it worse and covers it up!</li>
<li> , I was also sent the wrong shade.</li>
<li> Extremely disappointed considering</li>

    <li> Feel great. I use the Mary kay cosmetics has been for 6 years, I am a loyal consumers. This is the first time after I come to the United States to buy on the net, I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> First off, received the product very quickly! It is an awesome foundation. Love how it covers so well without feeling heavy on my face. No complaints at all!!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation.  Last all day with great coverage.</li>
    <li> Great to carry in your purse for those little touchups during the day.  Many good colors and looks very natural.  No chin line problem.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loooove this product! Probably one of the best matte foundations out there</li>
    <li> Mark Kay foundations and consealers are the best. Smoother than many of the other high quality competitors.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Not only was I sent the wrong foundation ( I was sent the luminous one when I ordered matte ) , I was also sent the wrong shade. I ordered ivory 5 (I&#x27;m extremely pale with pink undertones) and I received a much darker color most likely in the beige range. I gave it to my mom because it matches her way darker skin. Extremely disappointed considering this was my first time purchasing a Mary Kay product and I&#x27;ve tried a million different foundations trying to find the perfect one.</li>
    <li> I like most (if not all) of the Mary Kay products out there!  Reasonably priced too!</li>

    <li> The Mary Kay Timewise Matte foundation is my all time favorite foundation and the only one through out the years that I have actually re-bought multiple times. I have combination/slightly oily skin and this foundation keeps me so dry that I don&#x27;t even need to set it with powder. I would say the coverage is medium as it covers my acne and old scars with ease, but is not super heavy feeling either. I usually keep a shade lighter and darker than my actual skin tone on hand and then just mix the two to make whatever color I need at the time. I apply using a stipple brush lightly all over my face and it blends beautifully and looks so natural.</li>
    <li> This is the only make that has covered any of my imperfections. I am an acne sufferer and it makes it hard to find make up that doesn&#x27;t make it worse and covers it up! This does it for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and love it.</li>
    <li> So far this is one of the best foundation ive found i love this makeup and would recommend it to orhers to try</li>
    <li> Great foundation !! Make your face flawless. Also it has a beautiful matte finish that make it look like your own skin and not a foundation. Will buy again !!</li>
    <li> Product came right on time, no problems.</li>
    <li> Awsome seller with Great affordable Mary Kay product! My wife has found a new Mary Kay dealer in this girl! FAST SHIPPING and Great product!!! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s is very good for my wife</li>
    <li> Great...Delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> The shade was perfect, I loved the coverage.  I was looking for an alternative to Revlon Colorstay as my t-zone gets oily and it separates.  I wanted to love Mary Kay but it made me break out.  I hadn&#x27;t changed anything but this foundation and I was getting zits in areas that Never break out.  It&#x27;s a shame because the coverage was good.  I still got oily during the day, but I guess that&#x27;s just my skin.</li>
