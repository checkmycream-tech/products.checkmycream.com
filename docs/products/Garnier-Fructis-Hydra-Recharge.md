    <li> I use this along with the shampoo.  I leave it on while i wash my body then i rinse my hair. My hair feels soft and silky not heavy and weighed down at all. My hair is very long very thick and curly.</li>
    <li> A very hydrating conditioner for hair that needs moisture yet leaves no heavy residue. It works easily through the hair, rinses out well and leaves the hair feeling healthy. Terrific product for the price.</li>
    <li> yay clean hair! shipping was fast and product was as described.</li>
    <li> Pretty good value for the size and price. I like this stuff because I can have it in my bathroom and my girlfriend can use it too. I can&#x27;t say the same about the &amp;#34;Axe 2 and 1 Shampoo&amp;#34; that used to grace the corner of my shower and to quote my lady friend, &amp;#34;smells like a frathouse and removed every bit of life from my once supple and graceful locks of hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Keep this in your shower if you want women to possibly shower with you. Giggity.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair feel like hay covered in wax. It was gross. My hair looked dirty after using this.</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and in perfect condition (hehe). Solid product, and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am so... afraid they will discontinue this specific formulation.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner. After shopping for years looking for a conditioner that leaves my hair feeling light and smooth, I am hooked on any of the Garnier Fructis products. This type in particular is great on thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my dry hair manageable even in the winter.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and after one use I already feel a huge difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> best products on the market today I use all of their line even the hair color it is the best and it does not drip</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly surprised at how well this conditioner works since it&#x27;s so cheap. It has a surprisingly thick, creamy consistency and left my hair feeling very soft. It smells great too, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I have used this product while staying at my cousin&#x27;s over the week end.  I could not believe how soft my hair became.  This is an amazing product and this is coming from an hair products junkie.  I will buy it for myself and the fact that it is so affordable does not hurt either.</li>
    <li> I love this Conditioner, It makes my hair Pretty and Shiny, and CLEAN!  What more could you ask for in a conditioner?!</li>
    <li> Great product. Really makes hair manageable and well textured.  Note the name is misleading.  &amp;#34;Hydra&amp;#34; is greek for a serpent-like many headed monster.  That&#x27;s NOT what this product does to your hair!  I think they meant &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; which is greek for water, which more reflects what the product is about, i.e. moisturizing. I think the product manager needs a short course in classics.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and the shampoo.  Big difference from the Pantene I was using.  I&#x27;m not into spending big bucks on my shampoo and conditioner.  This has worked great for me.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling weighted down.  I have noticed also that my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy looking quickly like it did with Pantene.  Definitely going to continue with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, hydrates well.  Great conditioner, definitely getting more...</li>
    <li> I find that I only have to use a small amount of the conditioner after shampooing.  It moistures my hair and keeps it from flying all over.  I think it also makes my hair thicker.</li>
    <li> Great Price! Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I started using this last fall. I was determined not to go through another winter with fly away hair. This conditioner and shampoo did the trick. No more electric head;-)</li>
    <li> Great price for a lot of conditioner! ☺️</li>
    <li> Smells good, works well</li>
    <li> Loved how soft it made my hair</li>
    <li> It made my old knotty hair into gorgeous silky hair! The first time I used it, the next day I didn&#x27;t even have to use my detangling spray! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is conditioner. It smells nice and it conditions my hair. I love Garnier and since they stopped selling the curl and shine or whatever, and sleek and shine really isn&#x27;t right for me- I started with this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;My container burst open during shipping and amazon promptly replaced it. They gave me a return label to sent the burst one back. It was in a plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t get on anything.</li>
    <li> Every 3 months I change my brand but this stays in my rotation! It re-moisturizers my hair every time I use it! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Works fine for my wife&#x27;s needs. It is a good price and shows up fast at the door. Beats going to the store.</li>
    <li> I was shocked how big the bottle was and it works great , not greasy feeling or heavy.</li>
    <li> makes my hair shiny and soft</li>
