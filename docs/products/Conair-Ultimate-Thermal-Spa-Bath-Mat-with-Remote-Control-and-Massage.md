      <li>Feels wonderful on your back</li>
      <li>I say, buy it and ENJOY IT!</li>
      <li>Could be more so but for the price ($49)</li>
      <li>We love this product.</li>
      <li>the bubbles are pretty good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the 100%, most comfortable thing ever, but way better than nothing.</li>
      <li>but I have never been able to get the head rest to work, it doesn&#x27;t produce good bubble action, and be sure you have an electircal outlet close to the tub.  </li>
      <li>I do not have a newer tub with a textured bottom, I have a smooth tub.</li>
      <li>Comfortable?</li>
      <li>I really enjoy bathing using aromatherapy liquids, it truly relaxing and soothing.</li>
      <li>My son and I are enjoyable with this hot product for use oftens.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really use the foot massage that much, but it is ok!</li>
      <li>This is the closest thing to a hot tub you can get!  </li>
      <li>She got excited until she used it the first time.  </li>
      <li>Bought this as a Christmas present for my parents, and they love it!</li>
      <li>They are easy to remove, thereby allowing more room the put your entire body in the water.  </li>
      <li>the positive about the unit is that the bubbles are pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>They had something similar many may years ago and this was the closest I could find.</li>
      <li>Even on the low mode, is is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing.  </li>
      <li>Non-slip factory tubs do not work very well with this product.</li>
      <li>Both I and my wife use this item and we really like it.</li>
      <li>Normally when something new doesn&#x27;t work right</li>
      <li>It creates a full jacuzzi in the comfort of your standard bathtub, and is so much cheaper than reinstalling a jacuzzi bathtub.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Does well to create bubble action, but very bulky and rigid.</li>
      <li>It might be normal length</li>
      <li>overall I did enjoy the relaxation but because the mat kept moving the effect was short lived.</li>
      <li>Glad I only spent $54.  </li>
      <li>However the motor is very loud.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s recommended that you don&#x27;t keep it on for more than 15 minutes, although we usually push 20 or so.</li>
      <li>My regret that it is so hard to find any more.</li>
      <li>Set up is simple and it feels just like the $4,000 real thing.</li>
      <li>I just bought this product as an early X-mas gift for my girlfriend</li>
      <li>It is LOUD</li>
      <li>The product is extremely bulky and if  you dont plan on using it everday taking it in and out of the tub is going to get old really fast.</li>
      <li>The various speeds allow for personalized bubbling action.  </li>
      <li>you do get a decent massage, if you can keep the mat still long enough.</li>
      <li>I would think&lt;br /&gt;twice about purchasing this as its not very wide.</li>
      <li>With this product, you can take it with you if you move, have the wonderful bubbly whirlpool, and if it goes wrong, you aren&#x27;t stuck with a broken bathtub.</li>
      <li>Lots of bubbles, but extremely uncomfortable and very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>It could stand to be a few inches longer so you could fully submerge your legs, but they are fine bent at the knee a little.</li>

<li> It did not fit the tub was hard to setup and take out and   didn&#x27;t work well.   </li>
<li> Not only is it difficult to set up, it does not function.</li>
<li> It is loud as well which can be annoying while you are tryin to relax.</li>
<li> It works just as advertised, but to make the neck massager work, I had to press so hard on it that it hurt!</li>
<li> and then it can expensively go wrong.</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>
<li> Otherwise, I would have been disappointed.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m disappointed in it.</li>

    <li> My son and I are enjoyable with this hot product for use oftens. I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> not enough power, padded yes but not much padding, very low quality, had to return it.</li>
    <li> I am sure this bath mat is wonderful when it works but I have never been able to get the head rest to work, it doesn&#x27;t produce good bubble action, and be sure you have an electircal outlet close to the tub.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product even after reading some unfavorable reviews about it. After setting it up I would like to warn those of you who have a textured bottom to your tub to not get the product because the suctions dont work. The product is extremely bulky and if  you dont plan on using it everday taking it in and out of the tub is going to get old really fast. the bubbles are pretty good but it does not heat up well so if you sit in the tub longer than ten minutes your water is sure to be cold. It is loud as well which can be annoying while you are tryin to relax. overall I did enjoy the relaxation but because the mat kept moving the effect was short lived. All in all...save your money.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my Mother, she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at it, and it seems to be constructed fairly&lt;br /&gt;good...but, if you weigh over 150 lbs. I would think&lt;br /&gt;twice about purchasing this as its not very wide. My&lt;br /&gt;Mom is around 125# (don&#x27;t tell her I said so) and short&lt;br /&gt;so she fits on something like this with no issues. I was&lt;br /&gt;happy SHE was happy.  FYI, Amazon had the BEST price on&lt;br /&gt;this, I looked all over before I purchased it, so I have&lt;br /&gt;done your footwork for you!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my husband.  He loves it!! Uses it every day for his sore back.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This item I bought was about $50.00 compare to others at $150. Off course it is not a jet tube but the the price it work fairly well.    Both I and my wife use this item and we really like it. Good value for the price and serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> Glad I only spent $54.  Otherwise, I would have been disappointed. Does well to create bubble action, but very bulky and rigid.</li>
    <li> The bath mat works great.  Well worth the cost.  There is just one thing, I wish the mat could be wider in width.</li>
    <li> Having moved to a different home that didn&#x27;t have jets in the garden tub proved to be a challenge.  I have fibromyalgia and the current in the water helps to relieve the pain.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the time or money ripping up the bathroom to replace the tub.  This unit is not a visual enhancement to the bathroom, it is not completely comfortable and it is noisy.  However, it does what it is meant to do, move the water around.  The various speeds allow for personalized bubbling action.  The footrests are designed it a way that you&#x27;re bent and your knees stick out of the water.  The plastic, bumpy rollers they call massagers can be irritating to sensitive feet.  They are easy to remove, thereby allowing more room the put your entire body in the water.  It is not going to be as relaxing as a whirlpool tub or spa, but for the price it will help to relax your muscles.</li>
    <li> This is the closest thing to a hot tub you can get!  It is great. Very relaxing.  Don&#x27;t really use the foot massage that much, but it is ok!</li>
    <li> I just bought this product as an early X-mas gift for my girlfriend and it&#x27;s great! Noisy? Yes. Comfortable? Could be more so but for the price ($49) it is well worth it. Set up is simple and it feels just like the $4,000 real thing.</li>
    <li> Great, but slips everywhere if tub is not the right type. Must have a \\&quot;flat floor\\&quot; bathtub for the feet to stick. Non-slip factory tubs do not work very well with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and I&#x27;m disappointed in it. It is a little noisy but I can handle that. What I can&#x27;t handle is the wrestling match i have to go through just to keep it from sliding in the tub. IT WILL NOT STICK. I do not have a newer tub with a textured bottom, I have a smooth tub. Also  the bottom part for the feet is a joke. I can barely feel anything coming out of there and the rollers that your suppose to use to massage your feet are useless. the positive about the unit is that the bubbles are pretty strong. you do get a decent massage, if you can keep the mat still long enough. I don&#x27;t recoomend it as a buy.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  Not only is it difficult to set up, it does not function.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as a presant. Big mistake.  She got excited until she used it the first time.  It did not fit the tub was hard to setup and take out and   didn&#x27;t work well.   Normally when something new doesn&#x27;t work right she   askes me to fix or adjust it. With this she said   toss it out, don&#x27;t bother storing it or trying to adjust   it.  Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> We love this product. It&#x27;s awesome. It creates a full jacuzzi in the comfort of your standard bathtub, and is so much cheaper than reinstalling a jacuzzi bathtub. It&#x27;s a totally great gift. It&#x27;s not the 100%, most comfortable thing ever, but way better than nothing. It could stand to be a few inches longer so you could fully submerge your legs, but they are fine bent at the knee a little. The bubbles that it creates are amazing and with just the tiniest amount of bubble bath or salts, you are good to go. It&#x27;s recommended that you don&#x27;t keep it on for more than 15 minutes, although we usually push 20 or so. There are a few different modes (I think 3). Even on the low mode, is is fantastic. I say, buy it and ENJOY IT!</li>
    <li> Lots of bubbles, but extremely uncomfortable and very cheaply made.  It also is too heavy to be lifting out of the tub, especially if you have a bad back!</li>
    <li> It feels wonderful but the noise level can put a damper on the relaxation level.  It is LOUD</li>
    <li> The power of the bubbles is excellent. However the motor is very loud. Feels wonderful on your back the foot massage is just rollers that you roll your feet over, it does feel relaxing but if you don&#x27;t keep your feet on them they float off. The back massage comes from the power of the air bubbles.</li>
    <li> This product would be OK, I guess for short people, but it is extremely uncomfortable for me. It works just as advertised, but to make the neck massager work, I had to press so hard on it that it hurt!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement order and enjoying all of its benefits!  The only drawback is the rollers, they keep coming undone, so I just removed them at this time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It is the perfect solution to have the massage/whirlpool experience without investing in a whirlpool tub. Being external, it is a smarter idea than having the equipment integrated into a tub and then it can expensively go wrong. With this product, you can take it with you if you move, have the wonderful bubbly whirlpool, and if it goes wrong, you aren&#x27;t stuck with a broken bathtub. It is relaxing, it soothes sore muscles. It is just all around a wonderful idea and product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my parents, and they love it! They had something similar many may years ago and this was the closest I could find. The only thing is it is a little short (my parents are rather tall: 6&amp;#34;7 and 5&amp;#34;11). It might be normal length and they&#x27;re just super tall, lol. But this product is wonderful and works great!</li>
    <li> I use this product extensively. My regret that it is so hard to find any more. I really enjoy bathing using aromatherapy liquids, it truly relaxing and soothing.</li>
