    <li> Love this cleaner for my Sleep Apnea dental device.  I just wish I had started with it on a daily basis.  If I had done that I imagine that my device would look a lot better.</li>
    <li> Good!  Simple to use. . . and it works!</li>
    <li> I have used Polident for Partials a very long time.... I like them very much.  Julia</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was exactly what I asked for.</li>
    <li> It was new&lt;br /&gt;and it works great&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have a product dedicate to partials&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend trying it if you aren&#x27;t already using it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear my partials much.  but when I do it does the job..  Have used it with my CPAC mask as one reviewer suggested and that works as well</li>
    <li> Cleans fast and easily...no waitng fdr hours</li>
    <li> Polident does what it SAYS it does. It cleans dentures. There&#x27;s nothing more to say. It cleans dentures. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product and would recommend it. WATCH PRICES I found this at Walmart $2.98 same quantity 40ct.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleaner for my partial if I need a quick 3-5 minute cleansing.  Love using it (as directed) while brushing my teeth before going it.  While brushing my teeth, my partial always comes out for a cleaning with this product.  Overnite, I use the Overnight Polident.</li>
    <li> Great as my dental assistant HIGHLY recommended this for my sleeping night guard. I have been a life-long grinder of my teeth. These work better than the &#x27;standard&#x27; denture type cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is great to clean tea stains out of white mugs! Works great. Also works great on glassware that has soda or tea stains as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I have a new partial made out of a new material that has no metal. It does collect gooey stuff that&#x27;s really hard to just brush off and straight brushing never really made it feel clean. The material is a soft fibrous plastic and I was warned that it might scratch and get rough if not handled gently. I didn&#x27;t want to go the whole &amp;#34;Polident for Dentures&amp;#34; route since my partial is so small and pliable (bad excuse, huh?) but this stuff seems different. I can break a tablet in half, drop half in my little container with warm water and in a few minutes my partial is squeaky clean and fresh. It also makes the teeth appear cleaner and whiter than just brushing and I don&#x27;t have to worry about brushing and maybe damaging my new partial. I really like this Polident for Partials.</li>
    <li> I USE FOR SLEEP APNEA SUAD DEVICE, CLEANS AND YOU NEED TO USE A TOOTH BRUSH TO RUB IT CLEANER~</li>
    <li> Handy and easy to use cleaners that work well on Invisalines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially fine price when you are trying to avoid the tentacles of CVS.  Particularly fine when you can add them with a click to an order of other items and hit the magic $35.</li>
    <li> Like them very much. Do a good job of cleaning</li>
    <li> I use it to clean an anti-snore device that I found. It really cleans it perfectly. You should look for a small container or box to use it daily. You can find it also at Amazon for denture safe cup... .</li>
    <li> This cleaner is the best that we have ever used.  it works like magic to remove discoloration.</li>
    <li> These tabs for partials work better on my partial plates than the regular Polident Tablets. They clean them thoroughly overnight, leaving them crystal clean.</li>
    <li> These tabs work great for cleaning my sleep apnea mouthguard. Does a good job of getting rid of my not-awesome breath. I&#x27;ll probably continue using these when my teeth fall out and I get dentures.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product on a routine visit to my dentist and dental hygienist. I have worn a partial denture for some years now and never found a way to keep it pristinely clean. Even soaking it in Clorox did not really do the trick. I was not expecting very much when I began using these tablets but mirabile dictu I realized that help had arrived as my denture now looks better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product enthusiastically and unconditionally.&lt;br /&gt;Humphrey E. D Lloyd M.D.</li>
    <li> Switched from the standard overnight denture cleaner, which was doing an okay job, to this product. The metal of the appliance seems brighter than it did and it is reassuring that this is a cleaner specifically made to protect my partial.</li>
    <li> Polident Partials Denture Cleanser leaves my partials feeling smooth and clean, after brushing in the morning and putting my partials in, my mouth feels super clean and fresh. I highly recommend this product.  sometime, we get so use to one and we never venture out. Venture out, you will be pleased you did.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed. Not able to buy at a store in my area. Ordering it was great for my grandmother.</li>
    <li> I LOVE POLIDENT FOR PARTIALS IT TAKES THE METAL TASTE OUR OF THE DENTURES</li>
    <li> I like this product very much and have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Good price and great delivery but for some reason these leave a deposit in the container after use.  I use them for my dental mouthpiece for sleep apnea.  It might have something to do with the material it&#x27;s made out of.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use.  Cleans fast.  Does not harm my partial.  And the monthly subscription service makes sure that I get it on time and at a good price.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I wanted. I use this product every day as part of my oral hygiene. I am pleased with it, and I like the fact that is readily available. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice and cleans and disinfects partials....like very much...</li>
