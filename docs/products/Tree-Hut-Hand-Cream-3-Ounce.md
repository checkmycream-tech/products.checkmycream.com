### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price!</li>
      <li>Plus the smell is so wonderful</li>
      <li>but I was happy to see it on Amazon</li>
      <li>absolutely love it !!</li>
      <li>then it settles very nicely.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizing product with pleasant feminine smell.</li>
      <li>this smells amazing, and its a great purse size, it leaves a very nice sheen on your hands without it being greasy.</li>
      <li>I use this cream 3 to 4 (sometimes more) times during the day and my hands feel incredible.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this hand cream!</li>
      <li>Love the scent too!</li>
      <li>so I bought more when I found it on amazon!</li>
      <li>this hand cream is amazing</li>
      <li>My husband bought me this lotion and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing</li>
      <li>If you are expecting ROSE scent - forget it.  </li>
      <li>, otherwise it&#x27;s good but could be better.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s fine !</li>
      <li>anyway I love the fragrance</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure</li>
      <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
      <li>I first found this lotion at a kmart &amp; loved the smell</li>
      <li>It keeps my hands smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>But definitely not any kind of rose</li>
      <li>so I always have it accessible if I need it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of rose and musk, two of the components in this fragrance, but this just smells far too much like a cheap Avon-type product.</li>
      <li>Well, the price is right, and it&#x27;s actually a fairly effective hand moisturizer, but these benefits are trumped by the fragrance, which is simply way too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Best hand cream I have used in a long long time!</li>
      <li>Not terrible, but DEFINITELY NOT like roses.</li>
      <li>And, it moisturizes really, really well.</li>
      <li>It is on the cusp of smelling too perfumey, but it mellows out really well.</li>
      <li>A bit too much fragrance for my liking</li>
      <li>It smells very synthetic.  </li>
      <li>It has a more rose scent than just plain musk, but has the same long term scent after application like musk....but smells more rosey, but not too heavy and not too cheap.</li>
      <li>Others have said the initial smell fades quickly, I did not find that to be the case with this.</li>
      <li>so I bought a few of them :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used others like aveeno, but this one is the only one I felt really works.</li>
      <li>but it apparently doesn&#x27;t like me.</li>

<li> I am constantly washing my hands and doing dishes, not to mention cleaning something, so my hands tend to dry out like crazy, especially in the winter.</li>
<li> I think the lotion goes on well and feels slightly sticky for a minute</li>
<li> I hope the price goes down a little bit.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s like a little escape every time I use it.</li>
<li> Tough dry spots have appeared that I usually don&#x27;t see until winter or just lots of hand washing.</li>
<li> Not a rose</li>
<li> But like I mentioned, the scent is going to linger forever on your skin, but it is subtle</li>
<li> I like the price but the smell is overpowering and it&#x27;s not pleasant.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so addicted to it that I have 5 around my house:</li>
<li> I was really sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore</li>
<li> I have very dry hands, especially in cold weather, and this lotion keeps them moisturized for hours!</li>

    <li> this hand cream is amazing I have eczema on my hands and it&#x27;s the only cream I have found that works</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing product with pleasant feminine smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this hand cream! I&#x27;ve used others like aveeno, but this one is the only one I felt really works. I&#x27;m a stay at home mom of 3 kids under the age of 4. I am constantly washing my hands and doing dishes, not to mention cleaning something, so my hands tend to dry out like crazy, especially in the winter. I use this cream 3 to 4 (sometimes more) times during the day and my hands feel incredible. Plus the smell is so wonderful it&#x27;s like a little escape every time I use it. I&#x27;m so addicted to it that I have 5 around my house: kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, diaper bag and purse so I always have it accessible if I need it. I definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I like the price but the smell is overpowering and it&#x27;s not pleasant.</li>
    <li> A bit too much fragrance for my liking, otherwise it&#x27;s good but could be better.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local Fred Meyer&#x27;s store for a whopping $7 (and that was after being on sale for 20%!!) anyway I love the fragrance but I think that this lotion is actually drying my skin out. Tough dry spots have appeared that I usually don&#x27;t see until winter or just lots of hand washing. I am bummed. Smells amazing but it apparently doesn&#x27;t like me. 😔</li>
    <li> If you like womens musk perfume, then you will like this hand cream. It has a more rose scent than just plain musk, but has the same long term scent after application like musk....but smells more rosey, but not too heavy and not too cheap. It is on the cusp of smelling too perfumey, but it mellows out really well. But like I mentioned, the scent is going to linger forever on your skin, but it is subtle (you actual have to put your nose up to your skin to smell it, but boy does it smell). I think the lotion goes on well and feels slightly sticky for a minute then it settles very nicely.</li>
    <li> this smells amazing, and its a great purse size, it leaves a very nice sheen on your hands without it being greasy. Great price!</li>

    <li> Not a rose that&#x27;s for sure but I&#x27;ll keep it for my purse .... It reminds me of sun lotions and summer days ... So it&#x27;s fine ! But definitely not any kind of rose I know smell like this ....</li>

    <li> Love this hand cream. I got hooked on the smell and that way it makes my hands feel. I was really sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore but I was happy to see it on Amazon so I bought a few of them :)</li>
