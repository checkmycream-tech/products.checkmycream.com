      <li>Keeps my feet looking their best.</li>
      <li>The shape of this is perfect.</li>
      <li>This has been the best version of a pumice stone I have ever used to date.</li>

      <li>Also happy to report mine</li>
      <li>I was happy and</li>
      <li>The person I bought this for was happy with it and uses it every day.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say everything is going well.  </li>
      <li>:) It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
      <li>Its doing a farily good job of debriding the skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this stone!! :)</li>
      <li>I love this volcanic stone!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing,</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this kind of stones before.</li>
      <li>The way it&#x27;s shaped gives me a nice grip when holding it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best I have ever owned!</li>
      <li>I had a good pumice stone years ago but lost it moving and have bought many since then</li>
      <li>and you would never know that I did my own pedi</li>
      <li>Good size to fit in the hand.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t more popular, because if you bought this baby, you&#x27;d be set for life.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy and I love it!</li>
      <li>It feels very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>I was pleased with level of scrub</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>I think a whole stone would have been more attractive and would have more mass for easier handling.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>What a fantastic pumice stone!</li>
      <li>I like it better than those rectangular gray manufactured stones</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do wonders but its still pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly no bad smell or odor being emitted from it after months of use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Great shape; contours the under foot very well in most scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also perfectly shaped to fit comfortably in your hand and it&#x27;s huge, so I expect that it will last for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t bleed and the shape is mound like--very easy to hold and use.</li>
      <li>I would for sure recommend this to anyone and quick shipping</li>
      <li>and they really weren&#x27;t effective as scrubbing the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>I used the Johnson&#x27;s 24 hour body lotion (also available on Amazon</li>
      <li>This one is FANTASTIC.  </li>
      <li>Hey, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased to remove dead skin from my feet EVENLY.</li>
      <li>It also feels natural and has a good grip.</li>
      <li>I love this moom pumice so much that I just ordered another one!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive this volcanic stone.</li>
      <li>I was on the search for something environmentally friendly and functional.</li>
      <li>this stone feels good in the hand, does the job well, and feels as though it will last forever.  </li>
      <li>The shipping price is ridiculous, but this is literally the best pumice stone I&#x27;ve EVER owned</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it will get even smoother or mild dew over time.  </li>
      <li>Tried other stones and this is the best by far.</li>
      <li>And, believe me I&#x27;ve tried many things because I was always looking for something easy and simple.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s sort of worth it.</li>
      <li>but none of them were worth a plug nickel.  </li>
      <li>far I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
      <li>not much to say, it holds up is decent size and has a nice grit not too fine.</li>
      <li>Love how this product really works but is also a natural stone.</li>
      <li>so I have soft, smooth skin on my feet again.  </li>
      <li>I like supporting our Canadian neighbors (mine was made in Canada).</li>
      <li>I just wish that it was a bit more coarse...</li>
      <li>If really made of volcanic stuff, I approve!</li>
      <li>The stone, most importantly, leaves a smooth even surface behind.</li>
      <li>Color, a nice dark black!&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to wear out after months of use so far!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Seems like it will last forever and is easy to grip and use.</li>
      <li>Maybe in the past I just haven&#x27;t sought out the right kind of pumice stones.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t much so it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
      <li>(so you need to be more careful with it too).</li>
      <li>was that it wasn&#x27;t a whole stone and was cut from another stone.</li>
      <li>Works even after having it a whole year.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It has good wide holes for solid scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I decided to spend a little bit more than two dollars at Wal-Mart.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably going to buy a few more so that I&#x27;ll never ever run out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite rough, so it really works quickly.</li>
      <li>So much better than the usual pumice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s properly rough, effective at quickly sloughing down rough feet.  </li>
      <li>I have bone spurs on both my feet that cause my big toes to rub in a certain way to acquire calluses.  </li>
      <li>Use with caution on soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say it&#x27;s a miracle worker, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>I rinse with hot water and let dry.</li>
      <li>Works very well and seems like I&#x27;ll have it for a long time.</li>
      <li>This particular stone seems to be better than other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past as it&#x27;s a bit rougher</li>
      <li>I have had a few other ones which were either smooth or were sanded too much</li>
      <li>so you have to be careful, but used gently and repeatedly I found my feet to be softer, smother, and altogether healthier.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be sharp near the very soft areas of the foot.</li>
      <li>Yet it seems that every stone I&#x27;ve used over the years has been dull and hardly worthy of the porous bit of minerals a pumice stone ought to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was so excited to receive this volcanic stone. I have very dry, and calloused feet from walking around barefoot all the time. I have not had a mani or pedi this year and was going to my brothers wedding out of state.  I used this product on my feet as directed and was amazed with the results! They recommend using a lotion after getting out of the shower too. I used the Johnson&#x27;s 24 hour body lotion (also available on Amazon and I&#x27;ve wrote a review on it too) and you would never know that I did my own pedi, my feet were so soft!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stone a couple of times now and you still can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve ever used it!  I will never have to buy another one, unless I get some for my family or friends. It was a great price too for a quality product.</li>
    <li> The shipping price is ridiculous, but this is literally the best pumice stone I&#x27;ve EVER owned so it&#x27;s sort of worth it. It&#x27;s fantastic! It&#x27;s quite rough, so it really works quickly. It&#x27;s also perfectly shaped to fit comfortably in your hand and it&#x27;s huge, so I expect that it will last for a couple of years. I&#x27;m probably going to buy a few more so that I&#x27;ll never ever run out. I may buy them as gifts, too. What a fantastic pumice stone! (The one I had before I bought this was worthless.)</li>
    <li> I love this volcanic stone! It&#x27;s great! I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t more popular, because if you bought this baby, you&#x27;d be set for life. :) It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I was on the search for something environmentally friendly and functional. The price wasn&#x27;t too bad, a bit more than you want to pay for a rock, but the darn thing works. It isn&#x27;t too abrasive, and it took me two or three days to remove several months of neglect. As with anything, go slow and remove in sessions.  As with any other product you need to use it at least twice a week as maintenance.  I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say it&#x27;s a miracle worker, but it does the job. Fits well in your hand. The only draw back is that some of your dead skin does stay put in the small holes. No biggie. I rinse with hot water and let dry.</li>
    <li> I bought a &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; stone that did nothing for me. It wasn&#x27;t rough enough to take off the dead skin. This stone is great! It is rough and the holes in the stone are big enough to really slough off the dead skin. My husband likes the stone too and I would definitely buy this for family and friends. I like supporting our Canadian neighbors (mine was made in Canada). Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Hey, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased to remove dead skin from my feet EVENLY. No need for any other smoothing tool. How much dead skin gets removed is solely based on how much pressure you apply. That&#x27;s it. The stone, most importantly, leaves a smooth even surface behind. This stone is perfect. And, believe me I&#x27;ve tried many things because I was always looking for something easy and simple. Well, I found it and I don&#x27;t see myself having to replace it for YEARS to come!</li>
    <li> The person I bought this for was happy with it and uses it every day.  I also bought them a few other stones and they chose this as their first to try, and haven&#x27;t tried others.</li>
    <li> not much to say, it holds up is decent size and has a nice grit not too fine.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with level of scrub this stone provides for my heels during my showers. I have had a few other ones which were either smooth or were sanded too much and they really weren&#x27;t effective as scrubbing the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it wasn&#x27;t a whole stone and was cut from another stone. I think a whole stone would have been more attractive and would have more mass for easier handling.&lt;br /&gt;But I was happy and if I can&#x27;t find a bigger one with the same coarseness I would buy again. Although I think this one will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Bought this over a year ago so it is living up to the \\&quot;lasts forever\\&quot; claim. Keeps my feet looking their best.</li>
    <li> Why would I write a review for a pumice stone? Only because it&#x27;s f****** awesome! this bad boy will make your soles smooth with little effort. I use it in the shower or after a foot bath (with epsom salts). It also feels natural and has a good grip.</li>
    <li> Works even after having it a whole year. Tried other stones and this is the best by far.</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect. The way it&#x27;s shaped gives me a nice grip when holding it. As another reviewer said, I did receive mine with what looked like sticker residue. It wasn&#x27;t much so it doesn&#x27;t bother me and it doesn&#x27;t change the product in any way.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was sick of all the cheap, fake, pumice stones you see at generic stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Color, a nice dark black!&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to wear out after months of use so far!&lt;br /&gt;- Surprisingly no bad smell or odor being emitted from it after months of use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Great shape; contours the under foot very well in most scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;- If really made of volcanic stuff, I approve! Seems healthy.&lt;br /&gt;- Minimalist packaging, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be sharp near the very soft areas of the foot. Use with caution on soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;- This has been the best version of a pumice stone I have ever used to date. After a couple months of use, I just ordered another one for my other bathroom! Sold!</li>
    <li> I have bone spurs on both my feet that cause my big toes to rub in a certain way to acquire calluses.  This product removes that skin so I have soft, smooth skin on my feet again.  This particular stone seems to be better than other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past as it&#x27;s a bit rougher (so you need to be more careful with it too).</li>
    <li> A little rough for my taste.  Good size to fit in the hand.  Instructions say to use after bathing, not with dry skin.</li>
    <li> The shape of this is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a must have! The color doesn&#x27;t bleed and the shape is mound like--very easy to hold and use. Absolutely the best I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> I love this moom pumice so much that I just ordered another one!  I had a good pumice stone years ago but lost it moving and have bought many since then but none of them were worth a plug nickel.  this stone feels good in the hand, does the job well, and feels as though it will last forever.  no more gritty, disintegrating pumice in the bath!  I love this stone!! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this cause I cant find it in stores and finally something that works!! I would for sure recommend this to anyone and quick shipping is always a plus.</li>
    <li> This stone is quite rough so you have to be careful, but used gently and repeatedly I found my feet to be softer, smother, and altogether healthier.</li>
    <li> Best volcanic stone I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Works very well and seems like I&#x27;ll have it for a long time. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Nice product. It gets the job done. I just wish that it was a bit more coarse... but I still like it and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this rock.  I use it almost everyday on my heals that are cracked a little.  Its doing a farily good job of debriding the skin.  It feels very comfortable in my hand.  I always put lotion on my heels/feet afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a few others, I wish it was a little sharper.  I&#x27;m wondering if it will get even smoother or mild dew over time.  I hope not.  As a precaution I let my dry outside the show on a little stand/caddy that you&#x27;d drain your soap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m pretty pleased and I&#x27;ve recommended it to some of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;d give it a B at this point.  Doesn&#x27;t do wonders but its still pretty good.  I&#x27;ve given these as gifts to some of my girlfriends and a couple of their male friends have usurped them. Who knew men would like these too!  Also happy to report mine has never mildrewed and don&#x27;t show any signs of aging.</li>
    <li> So much better than the usual pumice stone- the shape fits the contours of your foot.</li>
    <li> Could easily have been a 5 star rating, but I found it the rock to be a little too small for comfort.</li>
    <li> However, this would be kinda dangerous for clumsy me if it were any sharper. Seems like it will last forever and is easy to grip and use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kind of stones before. So I know that they don&#x27;t have to be this dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I received has whitish stuff on it (use your imagination) and spider web like things in the holes.&lt;br /&gt;I had to brush and brush and brush it and they don&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little disgusting... considering that you will be rubbing it against your body!</li>
    <li> A quality stone. It has good wide holes for solid scrubbing. I expect it to last for a while. I like it better than those rectangular gray manufactured stones</li>
    <li> Love how this product really works but is also a natural stone. Fits in hand well and has lasted quite well. Still doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me. Maybe in the past I just haven&#x27;t sought out the right kind of pumice stones. Yet it seems that every stone I&#x27;ve used over the years has been dull and hardly worthy of the porous bit of minerals a pumice stone ought to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to spend a little bit more than two dollars at Wal-Mart.  This one is FANTASTIC.  It&#x27;s properly rough, effective at quickly sloughing down rough feet.  I have been using it every day to treat particularly rough heels and I&#x27;m happy to say everything is going well.  The shape is meant to be held in a hand, rather than those awkward blocks one can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stone, this one.  It&#x27;s what you imagine pumice stones to be.</li>
    <li> Skip all the other stuff, just get this one for dry heels.  It&#x27;s amazing, it&#x27;s easy and I love it!</li>
