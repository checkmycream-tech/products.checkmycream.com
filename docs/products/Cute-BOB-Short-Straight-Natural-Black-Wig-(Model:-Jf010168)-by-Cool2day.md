      <li>I have gotten many compliments while wearing this wig.</li>
      <li>, I am so glad I did.</li>

      <li>/&gt;It is light and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>It looks super cute and doesn&#x27;t look wiggy.</li>
      <li>Super cute bob wig.</li>
      <li>but I use the adjustable straps to secure it in place.</li>
      <li>Hair is cheap as price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a normal-looking wig for everyday wear rather than a bizarre-looking costume wig for Jap cartoon conventions, but if you wear it every day it&#x27;ll probably spontaneously disintegrate off your head like Son Goku hit it with a Kamehameha. :P</li>
      <li>It is so much fun!</li>
      <li>This is such a nice wig!</li>
      <li>this wig makes me  look great and feel pretty and feel wild and free and powerful</li>
      <li>I wish all my wigs were this real and fantastic!</li>
      <li>Honestly not as bad as I thought it would look.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad wig.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s synthetic hair but the quality is great, looks very realistic and it&#x27;s so short, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it tangling!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
      <li>Fun for dressing up.</li>
      <li>fun to wear this piece</li>
      <li>Though it does come more as a dark brown than a black, it is a wonderful wig.  </li>
      <li>It was a decent wig for being as cheap at it was.</li>
      <li>brush through be cause of the super blunt edges of the fibers, even so, it doesn&#x27;t shed much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed any more than other cheap wigs, though, so I guess it has that going for it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what it looks like</li>
      <li>I think that It would cost me more to ship the back  than what I paid for it.</li>
      <li>For the price it is exactly what I would expect it to be.</li>
      <li>People were asking if I had really cut and colored my hair on Halloween!  </li>
      <li>It looks and feels like REALLY HAIR!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty wig .</li>
      <li>When I finally did, it had ripples on the top from excess fabric.</li>
      <li>All in all, looks pretty natural for being a cheap wig.</li>
      <li>It even looks natural when you tuck the hair behind your ears which is a great plus!</li>
      <li>I did try to lightly fix one little piece of the bangs with a straightener which kind of made that section of hair not as soft anymore.</li>
      <li>The wig was easy to comb and did not require much extra styling.  </li>
      <li>It looked real.</li>
      <li>Everyone was asking If I had gotten my hair cut haha.</li>
      <li>I really like this wig.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore it.</li>
      <li>It feels real and looks real too.</li>
      <li>thanks a lot lot</li>
      <li>When I brushed it gently the first time an inch width of track detached from the wig!</li>
      <li>Decent wig for the price</li>
      <li>I have longer hair, most of the way down my back and put it up into a flat bun and put the wig cap (included) on top</li>
      <li>You can definitely tell this is a wig, it has a slight hole/opening in the hair at the very top</li>
      <li>Quality of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is high, not fuzzy or flyaway or overly shiny</li>
      <li>So for my high cheek bones and oval face</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal fit the price and cheaper than a bad hair cut.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made well with a good dark black colour</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better quality than what I expected for the price and has minimal shedding.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and wasn&#x27;t messed up when I opened it.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t look bumpy which really surprised me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This wig turned out good for a Halloween costume. (Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction). For the price it is exactly what I would expect it to be. Honestly not as bad as I thought it would look. The hair is soft and wasn&#x27;t messed up when I opened it. I did try to lightly fix one little piece of the bangs with a straightener which kind of made that section of hair not as soft anymore. So I would advise not using heat on it. All in all, looks pretty natural for being a cheap wig.</li>
    <li> Its an ok wig. I don&#x27;t like it too much to wear outside unless it&#x27;s as a part of a costume. The hair wasn&#x27;t cut right had to make adjustments of my own and it looks plastic.</li>
    <li> Really thin. Took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> Bought this wig to go as Mia Wallace to a Pulp Fiction party and it was GREAT!!!!  I French braided my hair and pinned it up, and the wig didn&#x27;t look bumpy at all.  Stayed on my head throughout the night, I hardly noticed it!  Didn&#x27;t shed at all and looked great.  Give it a big 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!! Fits like a glove but I needed it for an ejyptian project.</li>
    <li> The quality of this wig is amazing. I absolutely adore it. It arrived earlier than expected as well. It did take a bit but that is expected considering how far it came. Definitely would buy from this buyer again!.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s suitable for my costume and is the perfect colour, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but, am I just being stupid or is it ridiculous to put on? I can&#x27;t seem to be able to put it on at all and it feels way too small to fit on my head and stay there. Plus, what are the clips for? This seems to be the modt complex and frustrating wig to put on ever and I am highly disappointed. It just seems a shame because everything else about it is satisfactory, but a wig that can&#x27;t be worn is a useless wig. If anyone has any idea how to put this wretched thing on, I&#x27;d love to know.</li>
    <li> I could barely get this wig on. When I finally did, it had ripples on the top from excess fabric. I kept adjusting the wig, and eventually gave up. The sides are noticeably uneven. This might just be the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever had. It doesn&#x27;t shed any more than other cheap wigs, though, so I guess it has that going for it.</li>
    <li> I used this for my halloween costume and it was/is an amazing wig. I recommend buying these brand of wigs over the usual cheap wigs.</li>
    <li> I paid 6.70 for this wig. Best money ever spent. This little black wig is very cute. Natural looking. I wear blonde hair all the tme. I thought at the price I would try something different, I am so glad I did. Would compare to a 40 dollar wig.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it looks like and it looks even better on my head. Its said it would have taken up to 3 weeks for me to get it but i got it in the mail within 7 days. Im probably going to order me 2 more soon so once this one wears out i got some to replace it with.  I love it and its great quality</li>
    <li> This is one of my lesser quality wigs, but i do like it. The colour matches the picture and the bangs didn&#x27;t need to trim. I find that it&#x27;s difficult to come/brush through be cause of the super blunt edges of the fibers, even so, it doesn&#x27;t shed much. It also doesn&#x27;t do well with wind, not because of tangling, but because the fibers are so light, a short dive with the windows down will give you a completely different style. I&#x27;ll continue to wear it, but not for a day/night where I have to be dressed up.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price! Quality of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; is high, not fuzzy or flyaway or overly shiny let most synthetic wigs.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig since I wanted to dye my hair a bright color but I have an office job where it isn&#x27;t allowed. It&#x27;s very cute! It&#x27;s a short bob and I had to trim the bangs a little bit but it&#x27;s so cute! I sent pictures to my friends to see what they thought and they all thought I cut my hair! I have longer hair, most of the way down my back and put it up into a flat bun and put the wig cap (included) on top and it didn&#x27;t look bumpy which really surprised me. It even looks natural when you tuck the hair behind your ears which is a great plus! It&#x27;s synthetic hair but the quality is great, looks very realistic and it&#x27;s so short, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it tangling!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this item not worth the money!!!! Had this product for 2 days and already started shedding CHEAP!!!</li>
    <li> Decent wig for the price but I noticed the wig was shedding as I wore it. Still it looks quite nice.</li>
    <li> Was debating about getting a Bob haircut for about a year but I have had long hair for my entire life so this would be a big change.  Instead of going for it and making the cut I decided to get a Bob wig.  My husband kept telling me don&#x27;t worry just get the hair cut but once I put this wig on he said , thank god you bought that wig and that was the end of the debate.  So for my high cheek bones and oval face this did not work for me but it&#x27;s not a bad wig.  It&#x27;s made well with a good dark black colour and it had stretchy clips to tighten in the bag. It&#x27;s a good deal fit the price and cheaper than a bad hair cut.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m sorry to give you a bad rating, but the wig i bought from you a couple of months ago was not the wig in the picture at all, it fell around my shoulders. i wanted one that comes mid-neck ad curls under. not falls around the shoulders. i&#x27;m ordering it again. and i hope, this time. DT.</li>
    <li> NOT LIKE THE PIC AT ALL. BANGS WAY TO LONG! one side is curled under one side flipped!! Not cute at all nor a bob. lol.oh well. cheap waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a costume party and am very happy with the fit. It&#x27;s much better quality than what I expected for the price and has minimal shedding. The shape was perfect when it came and I just gave it a shake and popped it on.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty wig . For the price of this wig its awesome !!! Its correct length and defiantly Black. Super cute bob wig.</li>
    <li> This is the most flattering bob wig I&#x27;ve ever owned. This is a low quality wig though. When I brushed it gently the first time an inch width of track detached from the wig! And it sheds HEAVILY every time I brush it. So though this wig is flattering on me I can&#x27;t honestly recommend it. It&#x27;s a normal-looking wig for everyday wear rather than a bizarre-looking costume wig for Jap cartoon conventions, but if you wear it every day it&#x27;ll probably spontaneously disintegrate off your head like Son Goku hit it with a Kamehameha. :P</li>
    <li> Awful looking! It looks worst ghsn doll hair!</li>
    <li> I did not care for it it did not meet what I was looking for to short just not me</li>
    <li> I was upset with the timing, but very happy with the personal atention and customer service&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for that, my appologies</li>
    <li> Title says it all. It shreds a lot of hair also. You touch it it falls out. If your going for the fake costume look ...this is your wig</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with how natural this wig looks.  Though it does come more as a dark brown than a black, it is a wonderful wig.  The bangs are just a little choppy, but nothing a quick snip of the scissors can&#x27;t fix.  All in all, it is a very good wig.</li>
    <li> Used this wig to transform into Mrs. Mia Wallace (Pulp Fiction) for Halloween - It worked perfectly!  The wig was easy to comb and did not require much extra styling.  Of course wigs lose hair, but I did not feel like this one shed anymore than the usual wig.  I wore it to 2 different Halloween parties &amp; it&#x27;s still in tact/looking good!&lt;br /&gt;*I did have to trim the bangs a little bit as they were poking my eyes*</li>
    <li> I am a wig Diva. I love them and use them every chance I get when I dress up for work and parties. This wig, by far, is the best one I&#x27;ve bought. It was so very authentic and real that all night, my co workers kept asking if I had cut my hair. I had to dutifully tell them it was a wig so they wouldn&#x27;t be so jealous.  I wish all my wigs were this real and fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is such a nice wig! Everyone was asking If I had gotten my hair cut haha. Its very realistic and a nice cut! and comes with a wig cap</li>
    <li> It was a decent wig for being as cheap at it was. Only bad thing is they run pretty small!</li>
    <li> The black looks quite black to me and natural! I even got a pair of socks as a gift! sweet seller! I might purchase another but in a different style. It is so much fun!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shorter than in the picture, but it looks nice, but if you expect something longer, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I really like this wig. I got it to feel cute on Valentine&#x27;s day, and it is going to do its work :3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and easy to put on. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> but the wig don&#x27;t have natural look, and the hair falls alot, I have to throw it away. i dont recommend it at all</li>
    <li> A great wig at a great price! It was perfect for a cosplay costume, comfortable, and stood up well.</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t buy this kind of hair anymore.... Hair is cheap as price</li>
    <li> I am NOT impressed with the wigs from this seller. The quality of the hair was not great. The wig in general was way too small for my head - I couldn&#x27;t even get it on.</li>
    <li> Wig is like a Halloween horror party wig. Wig is nothing like the picture. Please note that wig was shipped from a seller in China, which I did not know this before purchasing. I thought that the seller was U.S. based, which shipping back would not be a problem. Wig is ugly, way too small and it shreds everywhere, it is definitely defective, I  bought the wig for every day wear, but it is totally useless only fit for the trash. Seller is very difficult to deal with, although I emailed him multiple times and  explained in details the multiple problems with the wig and asked for a full refund, but he refused and  demanded that I insure the wig and ship it back to China, and he warned me that it would be expensive to ship back. I think that It would cost me more to ship the back  than what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Tends to fit a bit small...but maybe i just have a big head.</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter. She&#x27;s 5 and a blonde. Wants to play dress up  as Snow White. Wanted black hair.  At 5 I don&#x27;t want her to try and color her beautiful hair.  Still waing for wig. Where is it?</li>
    <li> I love this wig. It looks super cute and doesn&#x27;t look wiggy. I wear it with a headband or a slouchy beanie. I have gotten many compliments while wearing this wig. The only thing is the cap is a little big for my head, and I have a BIG head but I use the adjustable straps to secure it in place.</li>
    <li> fun to wear this piece</li>
    <li> Nice looking wig if you want a change in look. It feels real and looks real too. Fun for dressing up.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a bad wig so much as it wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a wig in Vegas a couple of years ago. I loved it. It looked real. However, I left it in the room and was unable to find the shop again my last trip out. So, I bought this in high hopes it would be the same. I was disappointed. You can definitely tell this is a wig, it has a slight hole/opening in the hair at the very top and I couldn&#x27;t figure out where to connect the clips underneath to make it smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cute costume wig this would be great. If you have any other higher expectations I believe you will be disappointed as well.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. It has a great price, accurate product information and pictures too. I am so happy I bought this for my costume.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing!  People were asking if I had really cut and colored my hair on Halloween!  It looks and feels like REALLY HAIR! VERY impressed!</li>
    <li> this wig makes me  look great and feel pretty and feel wild and free and powerful thanks a lot lot</li>
