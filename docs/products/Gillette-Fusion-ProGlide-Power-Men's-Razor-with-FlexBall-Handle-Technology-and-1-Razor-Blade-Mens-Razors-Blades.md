<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, he wasn&#x27;t impressed and thought that the sink side caddy was too flimsy and lightweight to hold up for any length of time or use.</li>
      <li>No nicks or cuts, but a perfect trim.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product higly recomended</li>
      <li>The two things that I found best about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Perfection, on time, shaves good</li>

      <li>This is great for touching up and trimming sideburns between haircuts.  </li>

      <li>: Feels good in your hand, looks sexy  </li>
      <li>I liked that it is powered by a AA battery.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s also a razor and, quite honestly, I&#x27;ve gotten closer shaves</li>
      <li>After about two months of use the battery is still going strong too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I feel the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is a good buy.</li>
      <li>This razor works good and the each of the combs snap easily into place.</li>
      <li>These components are fairly compact and they all fit in my medicine cabinet.</li>
      <li>Once you do get everything out of the packaging, it is nice that it converts into something that holds all of the attachments, but there had to be a better way to package this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if you want and all-in-one styler and are willing to pay a premium for replacement blades, you&#x27;ve found the perfect fit.</li>
      <li>I was able give my sideburns a good edge easily with this.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been happy (or safe, LOL) with any of the personal groomers, razors, etc.,</li>
      <li>It trims my sideburns easily, and trims the hair around my ears nicely.</li>
      <li>detachable razor blade is quick and easy to install or remove and the trimming head would be perfect for beard and mustache grooming (it&#x27;s just the right size for close-in</li>
      <li>price was reasonable, the product was excellent, but more important than that was that I felt absolutely fantastic after using it.  </li>

      <li>Thicker beards might require something with more power.  </li>
      <li>Need something more than batteries to get the cut</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of trimmers over the course of 30 years, and each of the others had a more substantially constructed set of guides with them.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Not being able to plug it in when the battery slows means you need to go find a battery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just one of those things that you&#x27;re glad to have when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this trimmer.</li>
      <li>Not being able to plug it in when the battery slows means you need to go find a battery</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel completely safe using it and kept expecting to be cut every time the shaft flexed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this one much better because it trims closer than others I have used before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This makes an excellent addition to his daily regiment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great for a quick trim of sideburns, neck, stray ear hair, or a quick Unibrow cleanup</li>
      <li>The Fusion Proglide Styler is a great shaving/styler and would be ideal for men interested in keeping their facial hair neatly trimmed.  </li>
      <li>It has a clever design that would seem great for travel, but the bulky stand means the razor gets tossed in the travel bag unprotected.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use, and the handle is very comfortable to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best feature of this trimmer is the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t require oiling, and is easy to clean (you just flip the top back and rinse under the tap).</li>
      <li>Surprisingly durable and very travel-friendly, I can&#x27;t imagine using another shaver ever again.</li>
      <li>: If I had a fuller beard I think I would be more impressed at the abilities that this little guy has.</li>
      <li>battery powered trimmer is great for touching up facial hair as well as trimming hairlines and the neck.</li>
      <li>Clean-up is easy, just rinse it under a faucet.</li>
      <li>He first mentioned he liked the quietness of the razor</li>
      <li>and I love it more now than when I first got it.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast fast service!</li>
      <li>And it does hold up fine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great plan for someone like me to have a nice plastic barrier between my skin and a sharp blade!  </li>
      <li>This little kit is perfect for travel and for the home since it serves multi purposes.</li>
      <li>He believes the cost of refill cartridges would be prohibitive, but we haven&#x27;t seen them available yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
      <li>slender size of the trimmer allows it to be precise and maneuverable at the cost of versitility.  </li>
      <li>It works well and comfortably and is inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Everything else that comes with it is just a cheap marketing gimmick.</li>
      <li>,  Yup, you have to use good old fashioned batteries.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer did an acceptable job on my neck, which is very useful.</li>
      <li>The last trimmer I had, while very nice, was powered by a non-serviceable rechargeable battery.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and compact and easy to get at tight spaces with, which are good things.  </li>
      <li>--I enjoy a clean shave, but often just minimize the shadow from day to day.</li>
      <li>I really like that this product is waterproof and can be used in the shower, which also makes this very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Beard trimming works well and the razor attachment is pretty interesting as well.  </li>
      <li>The Gillette Fusion is simply the most amazing shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>Using it dry or in the shower it is very effective.</li>
      <li>Of course, it has a true razor extension for that</li>
      <li>Overall, a good choice if you want variety and convenience.</li>
      <li>Since the styler runs on regular double AA batteries, and is rather compact in size, makes me think this product is more ideal for travel/ocassional use.  </li>
      <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve found it to be a rather good trimmer even for its small size.</li>
      <li>Luckily, the battery does last fairly well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the pieces attach and detach from the edger pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>The razor feature works very well, cleanly removing hair and not getting clogged and becoming unresponsive.</li>
      <li>vibrating shave (with the blade on) makes quick work of 3-day-old beards after a weekend shaving vacation.  </li>
      <li>However, the ability to put a 4-blade razor head on top of the buzzer to be used with vibration is both clever and convenient.  </li>
      <li>The Gillette Proglide is a super versatile grooming kit.</li>
      <li>This is the first battery powered razor I have ever used and it really helps cut down on the discomfort that shaving causes and is the best shave I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver and a versatile trimmer, but I simply HAD to dock it a star for the high cost of replacement blades.  </li>
      <li>It is nice for a daily use, then I don&#x27;t need to use my full size trimmer as often.</li>
      <li>the razor blade-side-down, which is great for protection, but does not allow the blade to dry properly -- thus causing faster decay (so you have to buy more blades?).  </li>
      <li>This is a surprisingly powerful tool for its size.  </li>
      <li>Worth it for a family that needs grooming.</li>
      <li>Still, he liked that it was much smaller in size than his Panasonic (with its charger and case)--so</li>
      <li>The razor provides a nice, close shave, but I don&#x27;t know if I like it enough to give up my electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>Worth</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Maybe I am a complete idiot, but nowhere did this product say specifically that this product was for male facial hair only.  Maybe I should have realized when it was in blue and not pink or purple, but you live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;Once the package was opened I realized my problem.  OK, no big issue, my son was coming home for the holidays and I would use him as a guinea pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His insight -&lt;br /&gt;* No big deal, as a razor it has nothing special over any other five blade razor.  The handle feels weighted wrong and does not glide smoothly along the jaw and there is nicking.&lt;br /&gt;* The groomer is not heavy duty enough for military hair grooming.  Need something more than batteries to get the cut that you need.&lt;br /&gt;* If it is designed as a beard trimmer only, that would make better sense, but still a person would need more than a lightweight battery model for a real beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he wasn&#x27;t impressed and thought that the sink side caddy was too flimsy and lightweight to hold up for any length of time or use.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is excellent.  I grow facial hair very easily.  So I punished this thing regularly to see how it would hold up.  And it does hold up fine.  So that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside though, it&#x27;s just too small.  I agree with another review on here.  It&#x27;s good for small jobs, like trimming around your ears or getting a stray hair or two.  But ultimately it&#x27;s just too small in size to make much of an impact.&lt;br /&gt;The three attachments are fine, but not necessary in my humble opinion.  I used to smallest one and stuck with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ultimately I&#x27;d recommend passing on this one.</li>
    <li> We have a regular clipper with many attachment sizes, but it is large, heavy, and has a cord. It&#x27;s not something that my husband ever takes when travelling, so on longer trips he sometimes returns home looking like a mountain man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little clipper is light and surprisingly small and comes with size 1 through 3 attachments. My son has unruly hair so we give him a very close cut using the 2 and 3 attachment, so it&#x27;s even great for us to use on him.  It&#x27;s quieter, smaller, and cordless, so he doesn&#x27;t get as upset when it&#x27;s hair-cutting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a 5 blade cartridge shaver attachment.  My husband feels this part is gimmicky as he&#x27;d rather just bring a separate disposable shaver.  He believes the cost of refill cartridges would be prohibitive, but we haven&#x27;t seen them available yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, absolutely love that my husband has something he can easily fit into tight areas of a carry on and also love it that we can use this on my son with better results than the regular trimmer.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has been trimming his own beard and hair for 20+ years.  He&#x27;s a creature of habit--and is pretty loyal to his Panasonic trimmer, but he agreed to give this a try.  He thought it did a good job on his beard--equal to his Panasonic.  He wasn&#x27;t willing to try it on trimming his hair, because he&#x27;s spent 20 years figuring out which attachments work and give him the look he wants.  Still, he liked that it was much smaller in size than his Panasonic (with its charger and case)--so felt it would be great for travel or for keeping at the office or in the gym bag just in case.</li>
    <li> This razor works good and the each of the combs snap easily into place. It&#x27;s probably perfect for folks who want to cut sharp lines on a tight beard or mustache but for a full thick beard it&#x27;s a little small. I can still use it for some minor trims but it doesn&#x27;t have the power or the size to trim my whole beard. It is nice for a daily use, then I don&#x27;t need to use my full size trimmer as often.</li>
    <li> This is the handiest personal grooming device that I&#x27;ve acquired in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a busy person and maybe sometimes you go a few days too long without a haircut, you&#x27;ll find that just about anyone (including yourself) can use this trimmer to spiff your appearance up a bit. It&#x27;s fairly idiot proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a razor and, quite honestly, I&#x27;ve gotten closer shaves but it&#x27;s okay. These components are fairly compact and they all fit in my medicine cabinet. It&#x27;s just one of those things that you&#x27;re glad to have when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this trimmer. It works well and comfortably and is inexpensive. As far as I know, this is a new and very clever product category. In the past one would have had to purchase an electric trimmer for considerably more money. This is small, easy to maneuver, effective and inexpensive. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I tend to maintain a &#x27;scruffy&#x27; look, using clippers or a trimmer to &#x27;shave&#x27; my sensitive skin and only using a razor (blade or electric) when I need to dress up and go out some place special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I picked this item I expected the trimmer head to be bigger/wider and was somewhat disappointed when it arrived. The cutting area of the trimmer is just under an inch wide. Honestly I&#x27;ve found it to be a rather good trimmer even for its small size. I can do my whole face (I wear a long goatee and moustache) in the same or less time than I did with my larger, corded, hair clipper. This unit also trims much closer than a hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems to be good. I&#x27;ve had the same battery in the device for three months and have used it a dozen or more time and it still cuts through several days of beard growth easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blade attachment works (I&#x27;ve only used it once) but feels awkward and has too much flex for my tastes. I don&#x27;t feel completely safe using it and kept expecting to be cut every time the shaft flexed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler comes with three combs for beard and moustache trimming. The lengths they chose to include are very similar as well as rather short. They&#x27;re simply marked 1, 2 &amp; 3 with no actual measurements provided. I believe the longest to be about ½ inch in depth. Since I wear my goatee much longer (eight inches) I was unable to find a use for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to &#x27;shave&#x27; my face with this trimmer for as long as it lasts. It&#x27;s light, easy on the hands and does a much better and faster job on my face than my expensive hair clippers ever did. I probably won&#x27;t use the razor or the combs again but the trimmer, to me, is great.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad trimmer, but it definitely has strengths and weaknesses.  It&#x27;s nice and compact and easy to get at tight spaces with, which are good things.  The only way to adjust the length of trimming is by switching the combs; since it only comes with 3 combs, that greatly limits the degree to which you can adjust the length.  Also, there&#x27;s nothing to catch the hairs as they are trimmed off, so they just go everywhere.  And I find the trimmer rather small for doing a whole beard (it&#x27;s fine for edging, but if I&#x27;ve let my beard get a bit long it&#x27;s a chore to trim the whole thing with this small trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the vibrating razor attachment, I find that just silly and see no purpose to it at all.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a similar razor by Wahl, and I like this Gillette razor better. It&#x27;s worked perfectly for me for six months. I only use the trimmer (with comb attachments) because I go for the scruffy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the five-blade shaving attachment but if I ever do I&#x27;m unclear as to whether you&#x27;re supposed to use it with the power on or off. It seems like five vibrating blades could be dangerous! The instruction manual is not clear on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things which I don&#x27;t like about this trimmer compared to the Wahl: first, there are three different comb attachments, whereas the Wahl had a single adjustable attachment. The plastic stand does a good job of storing the attachment though. Also this trimmer seems to send hair flying all over the place so you have to clean up the whole sink area afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of this trimmer is the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof, doesn&#x27;t require oiling, and is easy to clean (you just flip the top back and rinse under the tap). The batteries last a long time; I&#x27;ve only replaced them once in six months. The razor takes AAs so I&#x27;d recommend buying rechargeable batteries to save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-designed razor and is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This Gillette styler was actually lighter than I expected, but was really extremely easy to grip and use. Since the styler runs on regular double AA batteries, and is rather compact in size, makes me think this product is more ideal for travel/ocassional use.  The only negative I can think of is that the plastic that held one of the exchangeable blades brokes after just one use, so maybe it&#x27;s not as durable as it should be.  Overall, a good choice if you want variety and convenience.</li>
    <li> GILLETTE FUSION PROGUIDE  Anybody out there need a new trimmer or new shaving kit that works out well. This may just be the thing for you because it worked out for me. This little kit is perfect for travel and for the home since it serves multi purposes. You can shave with this and also trim beards and everything else one may want to work on. It comes with a razor and three trimmer combs a charger and works on dry or wet skin.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for something new or a travel kit. Sure I have repeated myself a few times here but it really did work. I have read other reviews on this and most seem to agree with me. So try it out if you are in the market for it.</li>
    <li> very poor product!!! does this beautiful crap Worth Its Price?? NO! NO! NO! better pay for a few dollars more and get quality product. shame for this unbelievable crap.</li>
    <li> Close shave and great trimmer.</li>
    <li> -It&#x27;s a handy little device that travels well.&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with a Duracell AA battery so you can use it right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;-The 5 blades on the disposable razor make for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-The battery powered trimmer is great for touching up facial hair as well as trimming hairlines and the neck.</li>
    <li> This is great for touching up and trimming sideburns between haircuts.  I hate it when my sideburns start to stick out a bit.  I&#x27;ve never used the Fusion razor head, not sure I see the point in that.  The combs can be difficult to remove sometimes, especially if your hands are wet.  Batteries don&#x27;t last long, but once again it is not really designed for constant trimming or large areas.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast fast service!</li>
    <li> This product is a bit of a step up on the idea of the battery powered Gillette Fusion razors. It uses a single AA battery to power a shaving head which can, first, be used as a straight trimmer for your neck and anywhere else that has stray hairs poking out that you&#x27;d like to conveniently remove. Then there are a set of guides which may be attached for trimming a beard/moustache, or possibly even your hair. Here is where I dock the star, because the guides are somewhat on the flimsy side. I&#x27;ve had a couple of trimmers over the course of 30 years, and each of the others had a more substantially constructed set of guides with them. Finally, there is a shaving head which takes a Fusion razor blade for regular shaving.The two things that I found best about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I liked that it is powered by a AA battery. The last trimmer I had, while very nice, was powered by a non-serviceable rechargeable battery. When that battery failed to take a charge anymore, then entire trimmer set was immediately destined for the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shaving head pivots very nicely, making it convenient to shave around the jaw line.The trimmer did an acceptable job on my neck, which is very useful. Using my razor for that job just leaves the razor blade clogged up in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this product is a go.</li>
    <li> This system combines a manual razor and battery-operated trimmer/edger.      What&#x27;s in the box:  1 battery-operated (1 AA battery) edger, 3 plastic trimming attachments, 1 Gillette Fusion proglide razor attachment (plastic) which attaches to the edger, 1 small tube of proglide shaving gel, and some coupons.   All the pieces attach and detach from the edger pretty easily.  The edger itself is small, not bulky, and seems to perform its intended task well, better than the edger on the electric shaver that I have been using for several years.  The razor provides a nice, close shave, but I don&#x27;t know if I like it enough to give up my electric shaver.  I will continue to use the edger and trimming attachments.</li>
    <li> second one i bought the first one broke after 6 months of use but for the price you cant beat it. its awesome!</li>
    <li> This shaver is a fully functional shaver system.  I cannot say it has anything better more improved than any other shaver system on the market.  Having used Remington, Braun, and Norelco products similar in nature, this Gillette is simply cooler looking.  One huge negative is that it is not rechargeable,  Yup, you have to use good old fashioned batteries.  My suggestion, look elsewhere with a rechargeable battery pack and A/C cord.</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly powerful tool for its size.  Still, it&#x27;s no substitute for a proper set of clippers.  Beard trimming works well and the razor attachment is pretty interesting as well.  All in all, no complaints.  It is a small, compact unit but does its job well.</li>
    <li> Perfection, on time, shaves good</li>
    <li> Pros: Feels good in your hand, looks sexy  Cons: Doesn&#x27;t work how I expected.  Thoughts: If I had a fuller beard I think I would be more impressed at the abilities that this little guy has. There is no control with the razor attachment (Powered or turned off) and I had quite a bit of tugging. I tried dry shaving first then I went with a wet shave with gel. Definitely didn&#x27;t come close to a standard razor. I was able give my sideburns a good edge easily with this.  Conclusion: If you have a thin (not many hairs) but course (thick diameter) beard...this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler has a lot of power for a regular battery powered trimmer (it uses regular AA batteries).  It has both a trimmer with a few attachments and a regular razor so you can have close shaves with this too.  But by regular razor, I mean a 5 blade razor, so it will rival other razors with ease.  Overall, this is a nice product and can get a lot done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are not as durable as other trimmers and my son managed to break one of them pretty easily by playing with it.  So in a sense, this product is a step up from a disposable product, but not as durable as regular trimmers that need to be recharged with a plug.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been stuck with using a disposable razor to shave because none of those vibrating electric shavers even come close to giving me a close shave. Not anymore! The Gillette Fusion is simply the most amazing shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve used it for the past six weeks and I love it more now than when I first got it. Surprisingly durable and very travel-friendly, I can&#x27;t imagine using another shaver ever again. The electric part in conjunction with the multiple blades makes my skin baby soft. The only problem is I have to use a straight blade to shave around my mouth and around my ears. But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for an amazingly painless, close shave.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide Styler is a great shaving/styler and would be ideal for men interested in keeping their facial hair neatly trimmed.  Batteries are easily replaceable (a single size AA), which is a BIG plus--no cords and no built-in obsolescence courtesy of a built-in battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is rubberized and ergonomically designed for easy-grip comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detachable razor blade is quick and easy to install or remove and the trimming head would be perfect for beard and mustache grooming (it&#x27;s just the right size for close-in work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for a quick trim of sideburns, neck, stray ear hair, or a quick Unibrow cleanup (yes, guys, you most DEFINITELY need to do this--we notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating shave (with the blade on) makes quick work of 3-day-old beards after a weekend shaving vacation.  It&#x27;s a great shaver and a versatile trimmer, but I simply HAD to dock it a star for the high cost of replacement blades.  If you&#x27;re looking for an economical shave, this isn&#x27;t it.  But if you want and all-in-one styler and are willing to pay a premium for replacement blades, you&#x27;ve found the perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I know this product is intended for men, but girls, get one for yourself, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between being a bit clumsy AND having sensitive skin, sharp objects are not always a good idea for me, especially for use in delicate areas.  I haven&#x27;t been happy (or safe, LOL) with any of the personal groomers, razors, etc., that I&#x27;ve tried.  So my expectations were low for this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the trimmer works fantastically, and the little plastic combs that attach are just the right protection for my skin. It&#x27;s a great plan for someone like me to have a nice plastic barrier between my skin and a sharp blade!  No nicks or cuts, but a perfect trim.  BTW, I used it dry, although you can use it in the shower, too.  It was easy to use, and the handle is very comfortable to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor for my legs, and I loved that, too.  I like to have super-smooth legs after shaving them, and this razor gave me the closest shave yet.  As an extra bonus, the smoothness lasted way longer than with other razors, because the shave was so close.  Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have any cuts from it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I 86&#x27;d was the shaving gel.  It smelled yucky and I didn&#x27;t like the texture of it.  But again, it was made for men, so I&#x27;m not the target market for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was reasonable, the product was excellent, but more important than that was that I felt absolutely fantastic after using it.  (I&#x27;d have paid extra for that, too!)</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband. He has a goatee but shaves the sides of his face. He has told me the regular blade attachment with the it on vibrate does a better job of giving him a clean cut in less strokes than anything he has used before.  He also stated it is nice to just be able to pull blade off and use the base clipper part to touch-up his goatee as needed.  It does use batteries rather than being rechargeable but he has been using it for a month and we have not had to replace them, so it isn&#x27;t that big of an inconvenience.  This makes an excellent addition to his daily regiment.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how the ProGlide Styler would handle my facial and head hair. I&#x27;m very pleased to say it does a great job. It&#x27;s compact enough to be easily handled and manipulated and the cutting edge does a good close job without ever nicking or irritating my skin. In fact, the slim unit can reach areas more bulky clippers may not. It trims my sideburns easily, and trims the hair around my ears nicely. It will even cut beard stubble, though not as closely as dedicated razor. Of course, it has a true razor extension for that and I&#x27;ve used it, though I prefer my electric to blades. The one slight drawback I&#x27;ve discovered is the compact design makes it easy to accidentally press the power button during use, so I&#x27;ve turned it off on occasion in the middle of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other extensions are good at cutting hair evenly at specific length. I don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, but I&#x27;ve trimmed the side of my head with good results. I prefer to use the Styler without extensions though, and rely on a steady hand not to cut too much hair. Clean-up is easy, just rinse it under a faucet. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, but it is supposed to be able to handle such conditions and hasn&#x27;t had any problems getting wet as yet. After about two months of use the battery is still going strong too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I feel the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler is a good buy. The small size makes it great for those delicate and hard to reach areas, and also makes it ideal for travel. Yet it is powerful enough to handle most tasks with ease. It looks pretty slick too! 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> This thing rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use a similar, small trimmer without a guard to get my face as close to shaving without using a blade--I enjoy a clean shave, but often just minimize the shadow from day to day. I like this one much better because it trims closer than others I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery power is good. I have a coarse beard and this one just keeps on munching at it. I used plug-in ones before, and the recent one I used had trouble with batteries, but this trimmer really handles things well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the guard attachments--perfect for trimming sideburns, or getting a full beard down to a more manageable length for further cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t intend to use the razor attachment. Don&#x27;t like vibrating things with a sharp edge on my face no matter how in vogue they may be. I can&#x27;t evaluate that function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, it&#x27;s great. If you have a place on the counter for the little stand, it holds things together nicely. Since it&#x27;s so small and portable, it might be nicer if it came with a case that can travel--a drawstring bag or such.</li>
    <li> Excellent product higly recomended</li>
    <li> Very surprised for the terrific quality. After destroying dozens of other shavers and trimmers of other brand, I was looking to add this one to my Philips shave kit (also 5 stars, but just not handy enough for the precision stuff). This one blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working on one single triple A battery it packs power and precision. As a full grown beard man I need to just trim the stache once in a while or get rid of some &#x27;wild grow&amp;#34;. Also on other body parts this thing works like magic, doesn&#x27;t leave a rash and shaves clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tiny thing is packing. Size always matters just not the way you expect to. Only downsize is the price of those blade, but for real shaving I use old fashioned blades that can cut you. Living on the edge! ;-)</li>
    <li> My husband has had one electric razor forever, or so it seems, and he wasn&#x27;t keen on the idea of trying a new one.  So for months this sat on the bathroom sink, just waiting to be used.  And then finally, without explanation, he decided to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing I know he&#x27;s telling me how much he really like the [[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion Proglide]].  He first mentioned he liked the quietness of the razor and then he mentioned the close shave, saying his face felt very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then the old razor has been delegated to a dark corner in the under-sink cabinet and the Gillette has taken up permanent residence on the countertop. :)</li>
    <li> works great, husband loves it.</li>
    <li> The Fusion Proglide is a capable and portable little machine that makes a great knock-around tool for travel or the gym.  The stand manages to hold all of the equipment, but is bulky in a toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is cylindrical -- just larger in diameter than a AA battery, of which it takes a single one.  There&#x27;s a small power button on the front, and a lever on the back to release attachments.  It&#x27;s the smallest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and, despite the low voltage, it actually performs pretty well on a full battery.  Of course, as the battery begins to run down, it starts to perform poorly -- ripping out beard hairs here and there.  Luckily, the battery does last fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slender size of the trimmer allows it to be precise and maneuverable at the cost of versitility.  Thicker beards might require something with more power.  However, the ability to put a 4-blade razor head on top of the buzzer to be used with vibration is both clever and convenient.  It&#x27;s worth noting that some people might find a vibrating 4-bladed razor to be a little too much as far as both abrasiveness and cost of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand/carrier for the device leaves something to be desired.  It&#x27;s bulky and not suited for travel.  The razor holder portion stores the razor blade-side-down, which is great for protection, but does not allow the blade to dry properly -- thus causing faster decay (so you have to buy more blades?).  The fact that this device has such a bulky carrier leads me to think it wasn&#x27;t actually designed for travel specifically, but rather to sit somewhere in the bathroom as a primary trimmer + razor.  I&#x27;m not sure the product is particularly well suited for that task, but it is nice NOT to have another charger plugged into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end this product is a mixed bag.  It chews through blades and batteries, but also saves valuable space in the bathroom.  It has a clever design that would seem great for travel, but the bulky stand means the razor gets tossed in the travel bag unprotected.  Not being able to plug it in when the battery slows means you need to go find a battery or you&#x27;re SoL.  I would recommend this product, but there are definitely the caveats you&#x27;ll need to consider.r gets tossed in the travel bag unprotected.  Not being able to plug it in when the battery slows means you need to go find a battery or you&#x27;re SoL.  I would recommend this product, but there are definitely the caveats you&#x27;ll need to consider.</li>
    <li> After 6 months my husband still uses the Proglide to trim, edge and style his mustache and beard. He actually stopped using the other brand of razor that he&#x27;d used since his peach fuzz grew in at 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because he seems to create less mess!</li>
    <li> Before I get to the razor, I have to make a point that the packaging that it comes in is the most frustrating packaging I have ever come across.  There were times where I tried to dislodge all the parts where I thought I was going to break something while trying to get it out.  Once you do get everything out of the packaging, it is nice that it converts into something that holds all of the attachments, but there had to be a better way to package this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is listed as a 3 in 1 styler but one of the three is the extra blade on the other side of the razor that evens out your sideburns which has become pretty standard on most blades.  Another of the three is a trimmer which seems to be added on as an afterthought and does not trim very well, but does come with three attachments for your desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is worth it because of just the regular use razor.  This is the first battery powered razor I have ever used and it really helps cut down on the discomfort that shaving causes and is the best shave I have ever used.  Everything else that comes with it is just a cheap marketing gimmick.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Proglide is a super versatile grooming kit. Using it dry or in the shower it is very effective. I have used the small electric trimmer for neatening my sons and husbands hair, as well as using the guides for cutting their hair. The razor feature works very well, cleanly removing hair and not getting clogged and becoming unresponsive. Worth it for a family that needs grooming.</li>
    <li> For around $20 you can have a pretty solid grooming kit that comes with an electric styler and three attachment combs.  I also received the power blade as part of a promotion that I will review separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this to keep my playoff hockey beard groomed in between rounds and it has worked well.  I really like that this product is waterproof and can be used in the shower, which also makes this very easy to clean.  The Gillette Fusion Styler is also very appealing, my buddy was using my bathroom and when he came out he asked about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for $20 I think that you get a quality product and it has some of the features of a much more expensive styling kit.  I look forward to more great products from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I use this for trimming my 4yo son&#x27;s hair--both an all-over buzz cut with the guides and then around his neckline or sideburn areas with the guides off. It works well enough for what we need and I like that I can use it when he&#x27;s in the tub and not worry about it getting wet or being dropped in the water.</li>
