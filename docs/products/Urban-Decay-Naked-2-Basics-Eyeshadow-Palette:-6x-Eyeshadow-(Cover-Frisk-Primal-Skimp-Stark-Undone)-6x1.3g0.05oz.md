### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product!</li>
      <li>Best palette I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>My wife loved her Mothers day gift!</li>
      <li>THE SIZE OF A LG CELL PHONE GREAT EYE SHADOW</li>
      <li>I use Mac brushes to apply the shadow and my pinky finger to apply the darker color in the crease of my eye and it works great.</li>
      <li>Good quality...</li>
      <li>Got it as a Christmas gift and the girl just loved it</li>
      <li>I paid a lot for this palette and paid attention to the good reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>In good conscience and based on my own experience, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but I love it !</li>
      <li>was pretty impressed.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Colors are nice, but overpriced</li>
      <li>Yes, they are nice shadows</li>
      <li>The colors are perfect for a natural look.</li>
      <li>Authentic and awesome😊</li>
      <li>I love the colors and I love the Matte look.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>A gift for my daughter, she was extremely pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love how versatile it is.</li>
      <li>love this palette and the colors.</li>
      <li>When it was delivered, I realized I just paid $20 more than this costs at ULTA.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll get a better deal at Sephora, for sure.</li>
      <li>Someday, someone will make a nice neutral matte palette with nice pigmentation and I will be the first in line.  </li>
      <li>This is THE BEST eye shadow out there, hands down.</li>
      <li>Great product, however, only gave it 4 stars because the shipment was delayed and no applicator brush was included.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the first naked basics palette better, but this is still a great palette.</li>
      <li>Nice palette, I really like the first 2 lighter neutral shades (those are my favorite).</li>
      <li>Perfect size to keep in your purse because, it&#x27;s a small palette.</li>
      <li>Overall a nice palette!</li>
      <li>The packaging is wonderful other than I would have liked it to be described smaller than I thought!</li>
      <li>Was given as Christmas gift and my future daughter-in-law loved it.</li>
      <li>Size is great and sharp looking case.</li>
      <li>My fault for not checking around first!</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough how much I love Naked2 Basics Eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>But for not leaving the house to go out shopping just for one palette of eyeshadow might be worth it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In addition, I don&#x27;t think this palette is worth what I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>I personally would not pay more then $29.00 for it, but for that price it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give a personal review since I have not used it, but she is well pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I paid way too much!</li>
      <li>Each color is as beautiful as expected and I only have to apply the product once through out the day.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It was a gift and exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>Urban decay is my favorite makeup.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can do so many different looks with just one palette.</li>
      <li>So ya I&#x27;m pretty pissed.</li>
      <li>Exactly like the Naked1 large kit.  </li>
      <li>This is not the large palette they have in the picture.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing the Naked Palette next because I love those colors too!</li>
      <li>I like this smaller one better than the large full sized naked palettes because it&#x27;s easier to store, and it has the true necessary colors and colors</li>
      <li>You can mix it up and go darker if you want, or stick with the nudes for a natural fresh look.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shadow!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>Product was very deceptive.  </li>
      <li>Like the others have said, the description is very deceptive.</li>
      <li>Again, more than half of the shadows were shimmery</li>
      <li>quick shipping especially w the holidays.</li>
      <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
      <li>Beautiful palette did come a little bit smaller than expected</li>
      <li>the name of product is EXACTLY the same.  </li>
      <li>But as we get older, women generally look better with less makeup, especially eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a mature woman and therefore don&#x27;t use shimmer eyeshadow because it emphasizes the lines around my eye area.  </li>
      <li>Use a primer first, and it will stay on all day long!</li>
      <li>I really thought it would be much bigger than what it actually was.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Same price as larger Naked2 at Ulta so I thought it was the bigger size just like other people who bought this online! Could have gotten this size for 29.00 at Ulta! Go to Ulta!!!!</li>
    <li> I paid way too much! My fault for not checking around first!</li>
    <li> Item not as described!  This is not the item that is listed.  Do not order!!!!</li>
    <li> Colors are nice, but overpriced</li>
    <li> Horrible product, horrible price. Wouldn&#x27;t ever make a purchase.</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette did come a little bit smaller than expected but I love it ! The packaging is wonderful other than I would have liked it to be described smaller than I thought! 5stars overall</li>
    <li> Was given as Christmas gift and my future daughter-in-law loved it.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough how much I love Naked2 Basics Eyeshadow! The colors are perfect for a natural look. You can mix it up and go darker if you want, or stick with the nudes for a natural fresh look. The shadow goes on smooth and stays on all day-even without a pre-shadow base. I use Mac brushes to apply the shadow and my pinky finger to apply the darker color in the crease of my eye and it works great. I highly recommend this shadow!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Got it as a Christmas gift and the girl just loved it</li>
    <li> I prefer the shimmer tones and didn&#x27;t realize it was all matte finishes. Size is great and sharp looking case.</li>
    <li> Authentic and awesome😊</li>
    <li> Great product, however, only gave it 4 stars because the shipment was delayed and no applicator brush was included.  The latter, of course, is not the seller&#x27;s fault, but the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to palette. I use it for everything from my natural eyes to my dramatic date night. Each color is as beautiful as expected and I only have to apply the product once through out the day. This is truly an immensely versatile product. I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> My wife loved her Mothers day gift! This product was delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> Now this is the only this my daughter will wear</li>
    <li> Product was very deceptive.  I thought I was buying the larger 12 color pallets - the name of product is EXACTLY the same.  I was very disappointed to receive the smaller palette, for a large price.  I hope the company will correct this mistake!</li>
    <li> not a deal !!  Could get the same product from ulta for $29.00. I actually thought I was purchasing the bigger pallet for the price.</li>
    <li> Kinda over priced...&lt;br /&gt;I love this palette and the colors. Urban decay is my favorite makeup.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get a better deal at Sephora, for sure. But for not leaving the house to go out shopping just for one palette of eyeshadow might be worth it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very quick shipping especially w the holidays. I placed my order less than ten days before Xmas and not only did it arrive on time is was early.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty impressed.</li>
    <li> Like the others have said, the description is very deceptive. This is way overpriced for this product. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My daughter loves them! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really thought it would be much bigger than what it actually was.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Best palette I&#x27;ve ever owned. I like this smaller one better than the large full sized naked palettes because it&#x27;s easier to store, and it has the true necessary colors and colors I use daily. Thank you urban decay!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mature woman and therefore don&#x27;t use shimmer eyeshadow because it emphasizes the lines around my eye area.  Consequently, I only use matte shades.  I use nude shadows and sometimes purple/plum or green.  The colors in this palette are disappointing.  There are several shimmer shades, which I can&#x27;t use, and the other matte shades (with the exception of one) are all too dark for me.  Dark shadow (except on the outer corner and only for evening) draws attention to the circles under my eyes and are aging.  When I was in my 20s I could wear a lot of makeup and get away with it.  But as we get older, women generally look better with less makeup, especially eye makeup.  I paid a lot for this palette and paid attention to the good reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s going in my makeup drawer, where things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  I even tried the Naked 3 palette with the rosy shades.  Again, more than half of the shadows were shimmery so I returned it.  Someday, someone will make a nice neutral matte palette with nice pigmentation and I will be the first in line.  Until then, I&#x27;ll keep looking.  In addition, I don&#x27;t think this palette is worth what I paid for it.  Yes, they are nice shadows but there are other brands that are just as good and less expensive.  In good conscience and based on my own experience, I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected. It was a gift and exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This is not the large palette they have in the picture. This only has 6 eyeshadows in it, and you are being asked to pay the larger palette price. This should cost 25$, according to the Urban Decay website. NOT A DEAL!!! DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for granddaughter who likes it.  I can&#x27;t give a personal review since I have not used it, but she is well pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I thought it had a brush.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter, she was extremely pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Nice palette, I really like the first 2 lighter neutral shades (those are my favorite). I have been using this palette everyday. I prefer the first naked basics palette better, but this is still a great palette. Perfect size to keep in your purse because, it&#x27;s a small palette. I purchased mine for $29.00 @ Nordstrom, and can be purchased anywhere that sells UD for that price. I personally would not pay more then $29.00 for it, but for that price it&#x27;s worth it! Overall a nice palette!</li>
    <li> Same as others, got it for my daughter for Christmas as it was on her list. She said it should have been the one with 12, that was what she had on list. It was only the 6 and should have been $24. So ya I&#x27;m pretty pissed. Double the price it should have been!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly like the Naked1 large kit.  Good quality...</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COLOR PALATE, PRICEY AND VERY SMALL - THE SIZE OF A LG CELL PHONE GREAT EYE SHADOW</li>
    <li> At first I was a little disappointed because I thought this was the full Naked 2 palette. When it was delivered, I realized I just paid $20 more than this costs at ULTA. I didn&#x27;t reel like going through the hassle of returning it just for $20 bucks, so I kept it and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love the colors and I love the Matte look. I have the Naked one palette and I alternate between the 2 because they give you different looks. I will be purchasing the Naked Palette next because I love those colors too! This is THE BEST eye shadow out there, hands down. Use a primer first, and it will stay on all day long! I love how versatile it is. You can do so many different looks with just one palette.</li>
