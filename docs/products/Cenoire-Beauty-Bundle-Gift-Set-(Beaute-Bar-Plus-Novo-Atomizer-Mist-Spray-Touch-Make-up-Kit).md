      <li>First impressions are good.</li>

      <li>However, the vibrations are too strong for the face/facial structures for me to feel safe using.</li>

      <li>okay - so i saw this a bunch of times at a higher price and couldn&#x27;t help but think - what the heck!?  </li>
      <li>but the battery fit remains a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I chose this item because of the smooth end</li>
      <li>am thrilled to get the replacement because the Beaute Bar really does improve the firmness of my skin</li>
      <li>I used it to help my elizabethn arden time capsule to better absorb (that capsule needs 5 min massage to be absorbed) .works</li>
      <li>I enjoy using it every time.</li>
      <li>It works well and leaves my face smooth.</li>
      <li>It is also a great low vibration massager for jaw pain/muscle tensing.</li>
      <li>The product works great, soothing my skin and makes it glorify, and my face looks smaller after using it for a month.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work smoothly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Cenoire 24k Beaute Bar is attractive and nicely packaged. It gives my skin a nice glow by increasing the circulation.</li>
    <li> nice product, we like it very much</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
    <li> Poor quality. I bought 2 pcs for my friends, one pc for me.  after 3 months, two pcs are out of order, another pc only last 1 week.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife recently, She has been using the Olay Moisturizer and it is great with the conjunction of each other. It says you can use without or with moisturizer. WIth her experience, she think the product can be use much better moisturizer. She uses it on her face and help her skin feel more rejuvenated. She says all her friends also use this for their skin care.</li>
    <li> I just love this! Very relaxing. Works better with night cream. For those who had difficult time to make it to work, or had trouble with removing the battery: both parts of the Bar are removable. Sometimes a little cushion ring gets shifted inside which causes the battery to get stuck, or Bar not to work. If you unscrew both sides and get that little ring straight. Bar will work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife, she loves it very much. It seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> I used it to help my elizabethn arden time capsule to better absorb (that capsule needs 5 min massage to be absorbed) .works well now and hope to see my change on my face</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of this products, and I am VERY unhappy about it. I only used it one time, about 2 minutes, than the vibrations staring reduced, and then  it totally died! I thought it was the New battery died, (even the battery was completely new), I changed another new battery, this product staring vibration SUPER WEAK, it staring working like a failed products which is bad contact product. sometimes vibration is weak, sometimes completely stop working, not useful at all!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This item is beautifully packaged and beautiful. However, the vibrations are too strong for the face/facial structures for me to feel safe using. The entire item vibrates, not just the end, and the handle vibrates even more which bothered my hand. I chose this item because of the smooth end AND because I thought it would give micro-vibrations that were concentrated and be different from a regular vibrator, but it was none of that. There is no low or high, just one speed - either off or on. Completely twisted tight is off and turn or open the bottom slightly for on which seems to active the AA battery (a very simple design, I think). I question whether it would be waterproof because it was open some when running, but waterproof wasn&#x27;t important to me and I never tested to see. Since I tried the less expensive off-brand, I can only wonder if the &#x27;authentic&#x27; one is any better, but I am on a budget and am unwilling to buy the more expensive one to maybe end up with the same result. It looks and feels like a razor.</li>
    <li> it did not work at all after using it two times, and I returned it :(</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t seem to be working properly at all. It doesn&#x27;t vibrate although it was twisted to the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; mode, but it vibrates sometimes when I hold the bar. The vibration is not continuous that I can&#x27;t even use it at all. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to completely test it out when I first purchased it. Now I completely give up. I remember at the time of purchase that it comes with a year warranty. Does anyone know where I can send the item to for repair or replacement? I can&#x27;t believe it came defective!!!</li>
    <li> Well, it does not work at all.  It is a broken one and does not shake.  I even bought several new batteries for it.  Totally waste of money and do not buy it.  My worst buying at Amazon.  Cannot understand why people gives 4 or 5 stars for this piece of trash.</li>
    <li> It gives a great facial massage, especially if you use a bit of oil. It stopped working about 2 months after I bought it. I thought it was the battery but I put a fresh one and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem with the item is that changing the battery is almost impossible. The battery compartment is very tight and the battery has to be forcibly pushed into the compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive to last so little.</li>
    <li> I looked around and after an extensive search decided to give the Cenoire Beaute Bar a try. It came nicely packaged and the bar itself was attractive and felt like a premium product. The bar does a great job massaging and relaxing my facial muscles - definitely feel more relaxed afterwards! This would be a five-star product if not for the fact that the battery is impossible to remove, which I recently encountered for the first time. The original battery had lasted quite a while, and now that it&#x27;s finally running out, I literally can not figure out a way to get it out so I can put in a new battery. I understand the tightness is probably needed for being water tight. But it&#x27;s a bit too much as the battery literally is stuck inside the tube. I&#x27;ve tried using hairpins and other tools to try to pry it out, but all I&#x27;ve done is gave my bar scratches with the battery still firmly stuck inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, the bar would be useless once the battery completely dies. I am all ears if anyone knows the trick to get the battery out...</li>
    <li> It was a broken item! I put the battery in bar, but there is no any reaction!</li>
    <li> Very calming and soothing, nice gentle facial massage...love it!!! Would be great as a  gift for friend or family member.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me.. maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right, but nothing changed after I used this one for 1 month....</li>
    <li> I bought this 24k bar last week. I have to admit that the delivery was very fast and decent. The box looks great too just as what I read in most of the reviews. But the T bar has some scratches, seems not coated well. And it happens to be at the top bar that touches my face, that&#x27;s my only concern. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Not as goog as I thought. Do not see any difference after using a month. The power is not strong.</li>
    <li> because my friend recommended it strongly， I bought it， I just use couple days， so I can not find the effects........</li>
    <li> Only use several days and it helpe to improve the skin status. My friend told me to buy one for her. However, mine didn&#x27;t work. At first, I thought it was battery&#x27;s problem, and I changed a new battery. But it still doesn&#x27;t work!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It feels so good. It allows my sinuses to drain comfortably...well, it tickles. My morning eye puffiness goes down quickly after a face massage. I keep this tool by the tv and use it while I&#x27;m watching tv. I&#x27;m not going to say anything about making you look younger or less wrinkly...but it does feel good. Especially if you put lotion on your face first. It slides better.</li>
    <li> Obviously, 2 of 4 are used. Rusty and scratched.  Returned 1 since it&#x27;s heavily scratched and unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Far away from the picture showing in this page, not really a fine work on looking.</li>
    <li> my wife used it for 2 months no noticeable results .I do not recommend it.spend your money on something else.</li>
    <li> This bar is relaxing and feels great at the end of a long day. I like the idea of increased çirculation but haven &#x27;t noticed any visible improvements in my skin yet.</li>
    <li> It arrived a day late and the battery was hidden so I ended up putting in one of my own batteries and as soon as I locked the end, I saw where your battery was hidden in the &amp;#34; Carry &amp;#34; bag. Started using device and was disappointed when using considering all the reviews I read before I decided to go ahead and order this product. I would&#x27;ve never bought this had I known what it was all about. VERY SAD:((</li>
    <li> This is amazing product. It really works. Everyone said that my face became smaller again. I love hearing that sentence. I will introduce my friends to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a present after reading other reviews. She says best gift that I got her. Can&#x27;t put it down. I probably have to bu another one because I am afraid she is going to break it soo.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice and  my face definintely felt more energized. Time will tell if I can really SEE improvement.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly helped to open my sinus&#x27; too by using the point end of the T to  stimulate the  acupunture points for my sinus&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Baby is very good-looking, I also like,&lt;br /&gt;something very beautiful, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;The next will continue to patronize.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
    <li> Loved it, only worked a week and had to return it. Was disappointed. Go</li>
    <li> Had to return... construction not good</li>
    <li> not working, didnt vibrate. i have to return it ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy, This item can fully meet my needs, this item price is reasonable, hope more people can have it.</li>
    <li> Product looks good&lt;br /&gt;The moment has no effect, and perhaps to see results after would recommend to a friend  I like</li>
    <li> I used the Beaute Bar faithfully for about 5 or 6 weeks, sometimes twice a day and was loving the results.  When the first battery died, I was unable to replace it because it was impossible to remove the battery.  I was not a happy camper, and wrote my feelings in my initial Amazon review, giving the product a one-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company read my review and THEY contacted me and said they would replace the faulty product.  It arrived in the mail a couple of days ago and it is easy to get the battery in and out of the new one - yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to get the replacement because the Beaute Bar really does improve the firmness of my skin and I think it&#x27;s helping with the lines around the mouth, too.</li>
    <li> I can see a distinction before and after using the product. My puffy eyes are definitely improved.It really works when you just woke up and discovered your face got all swollen up by water. It feels like massaging by vibration. I enjoy using it every time. A small concern of mine is how long the battery is going to last? If I use the product on a daily basis (10~15 min per day)?</li>
    <li> Very nice beaute bar~ My face just looks smaller after I used it. Better than anything else I used before!</li>
    <li> I just used a few times,switch places had been broken and could not open, I feel very sad about this, but if not swithch problem, I quite like it, so I can only give a star.</li>
    <li> The beauty bar stops vibrating when it touches my skin. At first, I thought it would be out of battery, after I changed a brand new battery, the same problem still exists. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! It works well and leaves my face smooth. Packaging is awesome...a great gift option. I&#x27;m considering purchasing this for my sisters.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t necessarily work on my face well but feels very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift to my girlfriend,she just love it,maybe I will buy it again and again to all of my female friends!</li>
    <li> I am using on on my face after I put my cream on.  It makes the skin feel good.  If it has additional benefits - cool.</li>
    <li> For the price, I believe this is a great deal.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and can already tell a difference - it really does seem to massage the skin and the moisturizer your using deeper into the skin.  To be clear, it is simply a vibrating tip, nothing more but somehow it works, and it does feel like a mini massage on your face.</li>
    <li> I love this little tool so much.  The best purchase I made in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is such a gentle massager for the face and neck.  I especially love using it around my sinus area (nose and eyebrow) feels so good and relieves the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have good skin to begin, after just a few weeks of using I have had many compliments on my glow.  My skin feels firmer and looks even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem is made from high quality materials - very attractive and loved the packaging.  Made a great gift for myself and will make a great gift for someone in your life.  Plus AA batteries, not the &#x27;i never have them around&#x27; AAA batteries.</li>
    <li> It was more of an impulse buy haven&#x27;t used it much. It vibrates your face a ton.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Portable&lt;br /&gt;-loved the package&lt;br /&gt;-Got it fast&lt;br /&gt;-I used it for a week now and I feel more relaxed, I love using my message bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it, and recommend it.I believe it would be a great gift for any woman. Its easy to use, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Tried for 2 weeks and face feels great. The box that it came in looks great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that if using any type of serum to make sure after usage to wipe cleanly to ensure the longevity of the product.</li>
    <li> The product is really good. The service is really nice too.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing and soothing.  Easy to use and almost instant results. Use it daily almost and can&#x27;t find any faults</li>
    <li> I have had several people say my face looks slimmer so I attribute that to this 24k Beaute bar.  Very easy to use and feels great.  I don&#x27;t understand why but after using it, my face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am using this with SK II Facial Treatment Essence.  We will see how the results come after more uses.</li>
    <li> Just received this literally 15 minutes ago.  Obviously I cannot attest to longevity of unit or long term benefits of using it.  Quickly read the instructions, inserted one AA battery (not included) and turned it on.  Super vibrations from head of unit.  After using it on face and neck for a mere 3 minutes.... wow does my skin super soft and silky feeling.  There are other similar (eerily so) items online and here on Amazon, selling for 100$ plus.  For &amp;#60;35.00 this is really interesting and so far, really stimulating (the facial skin and muscles) item.  Received this item super fast and very nicely packaged.  Good instructions, small velvet pouch to store, and nice presentation box all shipped in a outer priority mail box.  So far I am super impressed by this item and will provide an update after I have used it for a loner period of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading an article on Yahoo which raved about this little gizmo. Like LeesaRN I received it on March 27th and have used it everyday with my night cream (it&#x27;s now April 1st). My mother commented on my glowing skin today and because of that, she just ordered one. It&#x27;s a beautifully made facial massager that circulates and stimulates more blood flow to your skin. It&#x27;s extremely powerful so be careful on your sensitive areas (like your forehead - the pressure from the pulsating gadget actually hurt) so be smart when you use this tool. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix (like Botox), this tool isn&#x27;t it. But if you are looking for a top notch facial massager, then BUY THIS NOW!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift from my girlfriend from her wedding shower and at first I didn&#x27;t know what it was and I thought it was one of them prank &#x27;toys&#x27;... but upon her explaining to me that it is a facial massager, I was quite surprised that it did actually work. I tried it with some facial moisturizer (Estee Lauder Nutritious Vita Mineral Moisture Creme) and works wonders. At first I did not notice anything and I thought it was just another gimmick device but if you actually use it on a consistent basis, you will actually notice a little bit of difference in the skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recommended product for any woman&#x27;s skin care.</li>
    <li> One of them is broken,It didn&#x27;t work,and the customer service can&#x27;t solve my problem.I am very angry and very disappointed about you.</li>
    <li> I just received the package today and it&#x27;s not working at all.. so disappointed. I want full refund</li>
    <li> It looks great.I love it.</li>
    <li> Recently bought it, so don&#x27;t know if really does a great job, but willing to try it. Guess it will help.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Olay Total Effects Moisturizer and to my utter surprise it works well in conjunction with each other. It says you can use with or without moisturizer but to my surprise I noticed when I used this product to help apply moisturizer to the face, it helped my skin feel more relaxed and rejuvenated afterwards. Would I recommend this to someone else? You dang skippy I would.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work smoothly. Turn off automatically.</li>
    <li> There is another review here that mentions that the battery size was confusing - they were not clear if it used AA or AAA batteries.  The problem is that the battery chamber (i.e. handle of the device) is too narrow.  I went through 5 or 6 batteries before I found some that would slide in.  It worked fine for a few days, and then the batteries needed recharging. But the battery fit is so tight, I cannot remove the battery.  So it ends up being quite useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Vendor has advised me that the tbar will also unscrew, so battery removal is possible.  but the battery fit remains a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to find something I like so I can write a nice review.</li>
    <li> got this product and like the result, to my sorrow the battery does not work all the time ,even after replacing the Battery.</li>
    <li> Great nifty little device. I received it on Saturday and tried it before bed around my eye area and it slightly helped reduce some puffiness that I occasionally have. So I decided to try it again on Monday night after dinner, but this time around, I used it around my cheek area and I noticed a slight tingly feeling which actually felt relieving. One thing I dislike about this product is the ugly carrying bag that was included, I would prefer a nicer looking one. As I use the product, I will update accordingly on here with any new findings. Overall I&#x27;m quite surprised and satisfied with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, awesome shipping by Amazon, ordered it on Friday and received it on Saturday.</li>
    <li> So I bought this on a whim - you know, one of those random purchases.  Well, fast forward to two weeks later, and I have yet to use it. However, I give this Beaute Bar FIVE stars because it works MIRACLES on my dog.  Yes, my dog.  My boyfriend and I adopted a rescue puppy about a month ago.  He is six months old, and adorable.  But you know how puppies tend to have a LOT of energy and usually want to play about 23 hours out of the day.  Well, one night, I walk out of the bathroom, and I see my boyfriend massaging our dog with the Beaute Bar. The dog was in heaven. He LOVED it.  Now, whenever he is super hyper, trying to bite our fingers, etc., we whip out the Beaute Bar and give him the spa treatment.  As SOON as that massager touches his fur, he drops whatever he&#x27;s doing, starts to collapse, rolls onto his back and his eyes begin to close.  Works like a CHARM.</li>
    <li> Absolutely disgusted by this product and the seller. This item broke after just two uses. It wasn&#x27;t that it used a lot of battery because I changed the battery more than once when it stopped working the first time. Then when I returned it with a complaint, they successfully ran the transaction through. A month or so later, they email me saying they &amp;#34;never received&amp;#34; the product and took my money once again. Don&#x27;t buy this, don&#x27;t trust the deceivingly low price. Cheap product quality and customer service.</li>
    <li> The other day, I woke up and my was i covered in hair. So I walked down by solid good hallway concieling my face with the hope diamond. When I finally arrived in my diamond bathroom. I glanced around I couldn&#x27;t find a razor. So I quickly set out to find one on the internet. I found this and had it delivered on a Egyptian cotton pillow. I shaved and then was able to go. It was amazing it had me shaved right up in fashion in the process I spent uneccasary amounts of money. :)</li>
    <li> It always suddenly stopped, then doesn&#x27;t work again</li>
    <li> It is exact same with the pictures. And I got a 7 battery for the Beaute Bar. I tried to use it while I was in bath, and it works!! 5 star!!!</li>
    <li> It is not really work</li>
    <li> I love this product. First, this massager bar has really good texture. Second, it is really powerful. I have been using it for more than a month already, and everything is great, it didnt lose it power since i bought it, and it really helps to reduce the edema.</li>
    <li> I just really couldn&#x27;t tell how this was supposed to do anything. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough but it didn&#x27;t seem worth making my routine longer. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician uses one of these to help the moisturizer penetrate deeply into my skin.  Now I can do it at home!  I love the light vibrations, very soothing as it helps moisturize - highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is by far the stupidest gimmick I&#x27;ve ever fallen for.  I could have used the dogs buzzie toy just the same. Dumb, dumb, dumb.</li>
    <li> There is no hematite stone at each ends. A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> great item, my wife love it.</li>
    <li> Also just received this yesterday.  Want to write a quick blurb for those who can&#x27;t decide. Hope this helps for now. First impressions are good. Beautiful box/packaging. Stuck a AA battery in (the instructions seems to not be able to decide if it&#x27;s a AA or AAA). Great quality...a really beautiful tool to hold!  My skin&#x27;s been dry and flaky lately, so I can&#x27;t tell if it made it \\&quot;silky\\&quot;. However, it is extremely rejuvenating and I enjoyed using it! My face feels awakened. For $35, I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like the first reviewer, some updates will be helpful to see how this works long-term.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any more!!!At first I thought it was battery&#x27;s problem. So I changed hundreds of battery, it worked at the first10 seconds and then never work again.</li>
    <li> Being blessed w/exceptional skin, I want to maintain it.  I purchased this Cenoire 24K about a week ago.  I received it promptly.  Immediately used it (double AA battery not AAA.) I love it!!!  I wash &amp; apply all my special creames.  Retire to bed &amp; lie there massaging my face &amp; neck.  Feels sooo good &amp; my smile lines are DEFINITELY disappearing or looking as if they have.  I also use DermaWand twice a week &amp; love it as well.  On my eyes I use the Sonic massager.  It is time consuming but it all seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls, this little gadget is worth the money &amp; I purchased another in fear the price would hiken due to demand &amp; for fear if it broke.  I am not easy to please, hence, for me to give this 5 stars is a very BIG deal! I shall keep you all informed, however, this is exeptional.........go for it!</li>
    <li> Love this product, help me for relax my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I also use with my serum for my face and feel less saggy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it really works as far as the claims go. But I have TMJ and my jaws/facial muscles hurt often.  I also suffer from bouts of insomnia, and get weak/tired looking skin.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this (about every other day) for a few minutes all over my face, my circulation has gotten better and I don&#x27;t look so tired.  It is also a great low vibration massager for jaw pain/muscle tensing.</li>
    <li> Only use twice and didn&#x27;t work. I thought it was battery&#x27;s problem, actually it&#x27;s product itself. Sucks, not necessary. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it.  You do notice a difference, but you have to remember to do it. The skin tends to have memory.  My 24K is having a bit of trouble though,  with the on/off part,  I have to get around to get a replacement, but it still works fine.  Although I have really good skin, there is always room for improvement;  after the applications I have received  positive comments.  But like I said, you have to do it.  I encourage others to try this product.</li>
    <li> okay - so i saw this a bunch of times at a higher price and couldn&#x27;t help but think - what the heck!?  the price dropped greatly and i bought it.  though used infrequently, i have not had any issues to date.  the first time i used it, i could not believe that i actually had that much tension in my face!  it hurt so good it did it twice.  now - after a particularly stressful day, i use while in a reclining position and really concentrate on the sensation. the odd shape lends itself to using it flat, or using the gentle contours to gently dig in.  i work on two computer monitors all day every day, which is extremely fatiguing, so maybe i am frowning all day?  who knows?  anyhow, i think this has done much to remove stress from my facial muscles, which is all i really care about.  i did not, in any way, shape or form, buy this thinking i would shave off a decade of years from my face with use so i think we should all be realistic about what we are looking for.  should that happen anyhow - wonderful, otherwise it just feels GOOD.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really handy to have it and works really well, but it&#x27;s broken on the second day. Not sure if it&#x27;s a ramdon bad luck.</li>
    <li> Usually my wife always complains I waste money to buy her stuff. Well ! not this one. She likes it a lot. According to her, she can tell her facial texture is better and another bonus is she sleeps better at night when using it before go to bed. Probably because it messages her tiring eyes (after more than 10 hours in front of monitor) and also relax her facial muscle. She wants me to buy one for her mother too. It is the first time for a long time that she likes something I buy for her and it is not even over $50. And she also commented that for a price of $35, she kind of expects the material and finish will look cheap but it is not that at all. It feels and looks like an expensive item that you have to pay more than $200. She has nothing but good things to say about this beauty bar ! Already ordered another 2 for my Mom and in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JW</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my skin.......</li>
    <li> Feels so relax and comfortable after using it. I think it will take time to get the benefit. anyway it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This thing does absolutely nothing. Just another scam product being sold on Amazon 70% off and probably marked up 75%. Trash</li>
    <li> Bad quality, only last 1 week.</li>
    <li> The product works great, soothing my skin and makes it glorify, and my face looks smaller after using it for a month.But the shipping was taking forever...</li>
    <li> This is an update review. I love it the first week I used it but it only last a week and than the vibes are inconsistent. After the 2nd week, i needed to turn it off and on several times to get it work again. I thought it was the battery so I changed it but it wasn&#x27;t. Disappointment.</li>
