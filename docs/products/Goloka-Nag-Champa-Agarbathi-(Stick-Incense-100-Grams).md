      <li>this leaves more of a lightly scented charred wood feeling.</li>
      <li>Bought it to help ripen bananas but enjoy burning it just for the lovely aroma</li>
      <li>perfect atmosphere to my pink floyd music/jimi hendrix posters.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping good price</li>

      <li>settle for less when the best is before</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> beautiful and amazing good smell worth the cost. good for kids too. i love it, so much, yay. great job</li>
    <li> if your looking for a new twist on the original nag champa this is a great find. It was cheap and definitely gets the job done...will purchase again but not 4 a while cuz i have too much incense. The smell differs from the original but i love them both the same</li>
    <li> i bought this brand based on the strength of the reviews. it&#x27;s good but not great, and certainly not on par with the other brand. i mean, i wouldn&#x27;t kick it out bed or anything (LOL), but the aroma is more woodsy and less sweet, when compared to the original satya sai baba that everyone knows and loves.     perhaps i&#x27;ll develop a greater appreciation for it over time, but at the moment i&#x27;m a little disappointed. that&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Within the noble tradition of Nag Champa incense - the choice of seasoned yogis the inner world over, this particular formulation of rare herbs equates to a nearly transcendent experience. After practicing within its  intoxicating vapors, everything becomes alluring. My partner absolutely loves the way i smell after a meditation or asana session within my Agarbathi-scented sacred space. i also use this for teaching asana; it is very light and non-smoky. hand-rolled in India and with sale percentages going to help children, hec, why not rack up the White Karma stones and get some?</li>
    <li> Nothing like what they said, the smell is too weak and burns in no more than 2 mts cheap oils ..no the real deal, I purchased tons of different incenses,  this product is not for knowledgable a custom to the good stuff</li>
    <li> Love this product! Burns well and the customer service is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Compared to the traditional Nag Champa by this company, this scent is a bit stronger (muskier, in my opinion). I burn only half at a time before I have to put it out and I normally have a window or two open or the A/C kicked on to stir the air around, helping to lighten up the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this complaint, I still buy this on a regular basis as I do enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> Out of curiosity I did a Google search of the Goloka brand nag champa and found this info on their website:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Goloka is a popular brand name of incense and dhoop manufactured by a non-profit organization, Goloka Seva Trust, located in Bangalore which aids charitable activities like :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Akshaya Patra Foundation (mid day meals for under privileged children).&lt;br /&gt;Education and vocational training for widows of Vrindavan in making incense and dhoop.&lt;br /&gt;Aiding poor students with scholarship.&lt;br /&gt;The speciality of Goloka Seva Trust is that 100% of the proceeds go for charitable activities while you enjoy quality fragrance from Goloka.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m sure the proceeds for this sale of this specific box I purchased (I received the orange box which is manufactured by The Goloka Seva Trust) from the seller OJ Commerce isn&#x27;t all going to charity, I still like the idea that the original manufacturing benefits a non-profit in India.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the incense itself. Truth be told I am still partial to the blue (Shrinivas Sugandhalaya) box of nag champa, partly for the scent and partly because I get a headache from this one if my room isn&#x27;t all that ventilated. It helps if I burn the stick a little at a time, which is doable because in my experience they burn a while. I wouldn&#x27;t  hesitate to purchase again and will definitely try other scents as well. I purchased using prime and got package in 2 days. All in all a great experience. I have one lit right now, smells great and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This nag champa is the sweetest aroma of all that I have tried.  It enhances a sense of meditative equalibrium in the spaces it is used.</li>
    <li> This is our first try of Goloka but like the other Nag Champa products ... it &#x27;s excellent and we love it!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent of Goloka way more than original nag champa. This box lasts me a couple of years, because I burn on average 2-5 sticks a month. (I&#x27;m not covering any smells with this stuff. Just creating.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quip is the mild allergies I get when I haven&#x27;t burned a stick in awhile. I&#x27;ll buy another box in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds perfect atmosphere to my pink floyd music/jimi hendrix posters.</li>
    <li> These are one of the smoothest smelling incenses I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of burning. These are of superior quality and smell absolutely wonderful. This incense has a rich velvety quality to it. They are all natural, hand rolled with no added chemicals. They are a bit on the short side, and each stick lasts approximately 35 min. Incense is  well packaged in individual boxes of 10 each. Do not hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> I love Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa incense. This Goloka incense may carry the same name, but lacks the warm undertones I associate with the Satya brand. All in all, it was a purchase I regretted, and I ended up giving the sticks away after I tried it. Obviously, incense preference is as personal and subjective as buying perfume, but, I truly wonder how many of the people who gave this brand a high rating did so without ever trying the Satya Nag Champa? To me, there is no comparison, and the Goloka Nag Champa comes in a distant second when pitted against the favorite in the blue box. By all means, try this incense if you never have, but, give yourself and your environment a gift by trying the Satya brand, also. You will be very happy you did! I promise!    [[ASIN:B0000ZUGS6 Sai Baba Nag Champa Incense 250 Grams]]</li>
    <li> Very good price and exactly as described.  Fast shipping too.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I prefer Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s version of Nag Champa over this one most of the time, but there are times when Goloka is better. The Goloka burns off a little quicker, and the scent has less of a tendency to turn cloying after a while. It&#x27;s a bit woodsier, not quite as sweet. I prefer the Goloka for less well-ventilated spaces for all of those reasons. In an open space, however, I still prefer the classic sandalwood-heavy scent of blue box nag champa. Mileage will surely vary on this one.</li>
    <li> This  product was still good but, the smell was off and plus all the products were opened? I still counted all my sticks and it came out 100.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m more of a candle person than an incense person. Due to family religious beliefs, I&#x27;ve always associated \\&quot;incense burning\\&quot; with some kind of worshiping ritual until I came to the States.  My friend had a spare incense burner thingy long time ago, and my apartment sometimes smelled funky kuz my roommate seems hygiene-challenged... I needed something to \\&quot;change\\&quot; the scent of the apt, but candles cost more than incense.  Plus, incense stops burning after a certain time, and you have to remember to blow out the candle - fire hazard risk.  So after reading the previous reviews, I decided to give this incense a try (the price played a major part too).  When I first opened the box, I was slightly nauseated, because it smelled overly \\&quot;sweet\\&quot;.  But as I&#x27;m burning the first stick right now, the scent is not overpowering, and you do get this sort of \\&quot;spiritual\\&quot; feeling with the scent although not overtly religious worship kinda feel (I&#x27;m more familiar with the Chinese incense sticks and those always remind me of temples.)  My room is not huge so it doesn&#x27;t take long to \\&quot;fill the room\\&quot; with this scent. So far it&#x27;s pleasant, I&#x27;ll have to see if it sticks to my clothing and then if I get funny looks in the public... but I personally don&#x27;t mind the scent at all, it&#x27;s quite soothing and light.</li>
    <li> i really like this nag.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Bought it to help ripen bananas but enjoy burning it just for the lovely aroma</li>
    <li> These sticks really smell nice and do an amazing job where we would prefer not to have aerosols being sprayed. A few minutes of one of these sticks in front of our central air unit makes our entire lab smell wonderful, and the chemical smells are nicely masked. As long as the fragrance is not overused, it makes for a wonderful addition to the air, using too much tends to make the smell a bit strange.</li>
    <li> The last couple of times I have purchased this it has been a counterfeit brand, with red sticks not the yellow/gold of the &#x27;real&#x27; ones.  Very disappointing when I specifically buy this incense for it&#x27;s purity.</li>
    <li> This is a WOW!  What can I say.  It is like the old Nag Champa and even better.  When I opened the package it didn&#x27;t smell very good.  Didn&#x27;t even smell like Nag Champa.  When lit, my room was filled with Bliss.  Thank you so much to those that make it and provide it.  Nakeeshwa</li>
    <li> Since most people are familiar with perennial favorite &#x27;Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa&#x27; made by Shrinivas Sugandhalaya, I will use it as a comparison. I have to say I like this Nag a little more than Sai Baba. In the box Sai Baba smells a little nicer, but where it counts, burning, Goloka edges out the Sai Baba. It is less smoky, not as sweet. Just a cleaner smelling burn. It does burn a little faster than the Sai Baba which is it&#x27;s only short coming. And it certainly has Sai Baba beat on price. My next order of Goloka will probably be the 500g box.</li>
    <li> Good product, first time with gold nag. I like the smell, burns decently.  I may purchase from another seller in the future. package looks very different from advertised photo.</li>
    <li> Great powerful incense.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Deep and clean burning. Sets the mood for an interesting night. My faves are this, midnight and superhit.</li>
    <li> I first came across this blend of incense a few years ago and to me this blend in a yellow box called Goloka is very nice if you like the other Nag Champ varities you will love this one try it you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Oh my Godess, I love it! Amazing scent. Very rich and full. Nag Champa is my favorite incense so this won&#x27;t last me too long, so, I Will Be Back!</li>
    <li> Ordered an 8-pk to try and I wish I bought a 100 gram box.  Fantastic.  Right along the same lines as Super Hit and Nag Champa by Satya Sai Baba.  I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be almost as good as the blue box Nag Champa, but I was wrong.  When I burned it, the incense seemed to put off a distinctly bitter, burning wood type smell that you get from inferior incenses.  I was very surprised.  To be fair, I can smell the good, classic Nag Champa smell as well when you burn it, but that is faint and overpowered by the burning wood smell.  Blue box Nag Champa is much better and better still is the Red Nag Champa.  If you like Nag Champa I would buy them instead, especially since Red Nag Champa helps women who are victimized simply because they are not men.</li>
    <li> I like the sandalwood/floral undertones that this has, not overpowering, but a good bit different from other nag champas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer Satya Super Hit (&amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; nag champa) to the Goloka &amp;#34;Yellow&amp;#34; nag champa, and although the Blue version will always have a great spot on my list, I burn both of the aforementioned more often than the original Blue Satya Sai Baba Nag. They&#x27;re different enough to keep around and rotate for a bit of a change of pace.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what one might expect in a Nag Champa.  More floral than the usual Satya Sai Baba product.  Perhaps sweeter?  Different, difficult to describe.  I suppose I like it, but I&#x27;m going to buy a box of Satya Sai Baba just to keep it familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* update, two weeks later *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product to be more consistently rolled than the usual from Satya Sai Baba.  The bamboo is very consistent as well, and just the right thickness.  Lights quickly and burns very nicely and evenly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is on par with red nag champa...nothing particularly exciting about this incense..&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely holds drier golden notes...the box is very Appro.&lt;br /&gt;Not particularly heavy on sandalwood, aloeswood, or halmaddi.&lt;br /&gt;A very good champa for outdoor atmosphere..if you were looking for background scent..not a meditative product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burns pretty clean, average burn time.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived very fresh!</li>
    <li> It does smell delicious and after burning about half it smelt more like nag champa def. good smelling!!! I love it, just not what i remeberd totally</li>
    <li> These are definitely not the real deal I&#x27;ve been burning Goloka nag champa for years and these are not that.The packaging isn&#x27;t the same smell isn&#x27;t the same definite disappointment</li>
    <li> Have always loved Nag Champa.  This is good quality incense!</li>
    <li> I buy these Stick Incense often. I love the aroma. So pleasant and it makes the room smell really nice.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells SO good before ya burn it. when i opened the box, i knew it would be a winner! then i burned a couple of sticks and what a let-down. i didn&#x27;t get much of a scent from it while it was burning. the smoke coming off of it was unreal. so i gave it a few more chances over the next week. i tried burning just 1 stick, then multiple sticks but i was left disappointed every time. i had to stop burning this stuff when my whole house got smokey and it wasn&#x27;t even a good smelling smoke, just a burnt smelling smoke (and was starting to make my eyes irritated). i&#x27;ve got some other incense that absolutely puts this stuff to shame and burns cleaner so either i got a bad batch or my nose just doesn&#x27;t pick up on this fragrance through the smoke. hate to give out a 1-star review :(</li>
    <li> I never have anything to complain about.  These smell fantastic and nowhere close by sells this particular scent anymore. The price is FANTASTIC for the quantity and the package arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered five or six varieties of nag champa from Amazon, just for fun.  Goloka is my favorite so far.  I just received it this week and have been burning it every day, and find myself breathing deeply just to enjoy the sweetness of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Goloka sticks I received have a nice grey color whereas most of the others are tan or brown, indicating that they are old. The Goloka incense I received was in an intact plastic wrapping, then in a box, then in a wrapper inside the box, and it burns beautifully with little of the smokiness that the other brands have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m partial to the Satya Sai Baba nag champa because it&#x27;s commonly burned in Ashtanga Yoga shalas, but I haven&#x27;t had a ton of luck getting that fresh.  I think I will go back and forth between these two varieties - I actually like the Goloka more, but have a sentimental attachment to the blue box.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected. This smell is great and lingers for hours after burning. Very strong so if you are sensitive to odors this is not for you</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best in the world.  So excuse my long review.  It is on the lower pricing end, but the highest quality.  I have tried Nag from over 50 companies.  There is an expensive red nag that I like on rare occasions.  But my bread and butter incense is Goloka Nag Champa.  I love the box too.    Much prettier than it looks in the picture.  But I actually have a large wooden cigar box now to hold it all.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for many, many, many(okay 20)years.  The larger the box, the better the deal.  I actually buy the 1000 stick (1 kg) boxes.  I burn 3-10 a day.  Golaka is also considered to be in the top 3 by expert noses.  Mine is not expert, I just know I like it best.  It has the best, smoothest blend of a complex scent.  And it just smells fresh.  Like it just got rolled yesterday from plants out back.    I buy these 100g boxes for thank you gifts.  If someone is really special, buy the 1000g from the company itself.  You get thanked again and again for years.  If they are Nag Champa fans, they will literally jump up and down.</li>
    <li> these are very good smelling incense. very close to the nag champa i&#x27;m used to. will be getting more:&amp;#62;))))) get you some!</li>
    <li> Personally, I like the smell of this nag better than the NAG that comes in the blue box. It seems a little less acrid than the other stuff. Will definitely be ordering more. Very intense floral, Yet mildly happy calming smell.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, but not my favorite scent compared with either the red or the blue nag champa, which I use a lot for my home as a way it relax, meditate or room cleansing.  Too light and sweet for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite incense. I have used other nag champa incense and we also recently tried Indian Temple and Forest, both of which were suffocatingly strong. This incense has a mild scent that I don&#x27;t know how to describe. Every time I&#x27;ve had this incense and someone has come over, even strangers, they comment on how nice the house smells (and that&#x27;s with a dog and cat).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what attracted me to this, but, it is on my reorder list now. Enlivening, not too heavy, refreshing scent ... every time. thank you!!</li>
    <li> not sure if it is the same came in a different box</li>
    <li> I was a fan of the blue nag champa for the longest time until i tried this, I love the scent and it really does stick in the room after regular burning for a week or so.  My only complaint is that they do burn fast, other than that though I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new find.</li>
    <li> Ok! Hadn&#x27;t tried this one....it is now my favorite.  Great price, arrived on time and in good condition.  My house smells great!</li>
    <li> A favorite nag champa. A sweeter smell than the blue box. The two burning together is great. Good quality, stays lit and one stick burns for about 45 minutes or more.</li>
    <li> This smells really good. Burns slow and the scent lasts a long time.  I like it.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This nag champa incense is the best ever, I doubt if I I will  ever purchase any other brand of nag champa other than Goloka.&lt;br /&gt;Why settle for less when the best is before you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to Goloka is that it does not burn as long as say Shanthimalal, or Sai Baba,  (but at least Goloka burns) but other than Goloka not burning as long as the others  ( that go out all the damn time !!! )  ...  for me, Goloka is the king of all the nag champa&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite incense. It has such a warm, sweet smell that makes everything feel cozy.For the price, I don&#x27;t think there is anything better.</li>
    <li> This is not great... We bought it because we were completely out. It&#x27;s good if you want your incense to have an extremely mild aroma but still make the regular amount of smoke. It smells good but you can barely smell it at all so I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for an unbelievably low price.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite incenses . it is always impressive with its sweet smell . it is one of India&#x27;s best .</li>
    <li> this incense along with its &#x27;sister&#x27; nag champa is one of my favorites..i light a stick everyday for my morning meditation..tis more floral than spicy.</li>
    <li> Great scent, very potent. :)&lt;br /&gt;Burns great.</li>
    <li> Better than then Blue Champa (cant explain why, but so much better), and absolutely staple gourmet inscense, Ive tried them all, and Love them all (Blue pearl, Auroshika, HEM,) but these are the BOMB!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this Nag Champa, they came on time, this scent will surround you in peace and calmness,grew for meditation.</li>
    <li> Kind of a muffled smell...looking back, been a few weeks  since I purchased it, not the best I have used</li>
    <li> ive been burning golaka nag for years, this is not as sweet as a smell the real nag im used to puts out, disappointed its not the real stuff</li>
    <li> Product is as pictured and as described. They smell delightful and I would definitely purchase again. They burn for a long time and are vegan as well.</li>
    <li> Great incense. I would even go so far as to say they smell better than Satya Saibaba Nag Champa. Also a bit less expensive. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The other brand is better in my opinion, but I do like it.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this one too! almost as good as the red nag!</li>
    <li> My favorite incense.  I&#x27;ve been using this scent for over 15 years.  Came online to get it when our local downtown hippie store was forced to close down due to the building was being remodeled.  Great price, plan on buying on here until they open back up.  (have to support some local businesses still)</li>
    <li> Smell is pretty good but When I open the box, some of incence sticks was broken and bloom of incence was all over the box Do not buy for the present, but for your home!</li>
    <li> I bought this from the seller, OJ Commerce, based on good product reviews. When opening the shipment package, I noticed the incense powder was leaked all over. And, a lot more powder dust was found in the Goloka incense box. After I tried one stick, I found the scent was weak and disappointing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good price</li>
    <li> Normally I do not leave reviews on Amazon unless it is a bad experience, well this was one. Product was not as pictured for starters, and I really doubt this is real Goloka. It smells nothing like it should. The unopened box had a chemical smell of citronella and the burn isn&#x27;t much better, there is an acrid smell to it I just cannot agree with...Something the Goloka I usually buy does not have. I usually wouldn&#x27;t attempt to ask for a refund for something as petty as $7 but this stuff literally gives me a headache. Overall I am very well versed with Nag Champa incense and these barely smell like Nag, let alone the real Goloka I am used to.</li>
    <li> Got these based on reviews.nusually get the other nag in the blue box. Thought we&#x27;d give these a shot. Glad we did. Burn great, awesome scent, and smell lingers for hours! My wife is picky and it is now one of her favorites!</li>
    <li> Best nag champ company ever! the smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelming but still makes your whole house smell great</li>
    <li> AH.....what can I say about this incense? I smelled this back in the late 90&#x27;s while I was camping with some friends....I didn&#x27;t know what it was at the time, but I always longed to smell that fragrance again. Just recently, my son was burning some incense, and the distinctive odor reached my nostrils, and I was immediately taken back in time. I just ordered my own supply, and have been burning it almost daily these past few days. The bouquet is strong, and lingers throughout the house long after burning. I LOVE this incense. If you like a good strong Indian incense, this is it. If you like cheap flowery smelling chemicals, go to Target and check out their incense selection. (LOL) Treat yourself to an original.</li>
    <li> The product came to me with alot of incense powder leaking from the package.  This may not be the problem of the producer, or the shipper, but maybe the handling of the shipment itself.  In any case, I was a bit disapointed in the scent of this incense, and although I will use it, I probably will not order this brand again.  It seems to be very smokey, too, with a burning smell as the end of the incense comes to the stick..</li>
    <li> Item received not as pictured, different packaging ..COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.&lt;br /&gt;Weaker smell, not nearly as clingy as the original that leave&#x27;s the room dripping with warmth... this leaves more of a lightly scented charred wood feeling. Not the real item. I burned one of the original and one of these to make sure, and they are definitely not the same.</li>
    <li> I took a chance, being a sensitive nose I tend to have a problem with many smells becoming overwhelming. This was a pleasant surprise; it turns out I prefer it to all the other incenses I have(many including a # of Satya). It has a slight smokiness to balance the sweet that makes it tolerable for long periods without &#x27;nose&#x27; fatigue or cloying headache inducing residuals. This will become our staple smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, superb service.  Thanks!</li>
