### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But as a lip conditioner before applying lip color, it is excellent.  </li>
      <li>As a primer for lip color, it does a very good job.</li>
      <li>Great product, great seller.  </li>
      <li>Thought Dr Perricone would make a good product.</li>
      <li>It tastes good and works....</li>
      <li>Great price here, same great results!</li>
      <li>This is the best product for the lips by far.</li>
      <li>Love it, it works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lip product, lip balm, lip plumper, lip exfoliate, and so on.</li>
      <li>but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I love Dr Perricone</li>
      <li>I find this lip plumper is more of a lip conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I felt that this product is just ok.  </li>
      <li>Huge dissapointment.</li>
      <li>The product keeps lips moist and healthy, which alone makes it worth buying.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately there was a thirty-day guarantee</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the store&#x27;s fault - it&#x27;s the manufacturer&#x27;s and their never-ending quest to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; a formula that was infinitely better the first time around.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased my first tube many years ago and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>What I also missed most was an additional benefit never advertised - it used to do an amazing job of giving my very pale lips</li>
      <li>but, you feel the hydration since the first day you start the treatment.</li>
      <li>I purchased it at a retail store first.</li>
      <li>The tube constantly leaks and most of the cream ends up all over the place rather than on my lips....</li>
      <li>but I just don&#x27;t see any positive results from using this product.</li>
      <li>The one I bought a long time ago had a formula that was much more paste like - it stayed on my lips.</li>
      <li>It keeps my lips soft and full without being greasy, or making my lips sting.</li>
      <li>Smart move to buy.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I have fairly decent lips but would have liked a little plumping...nada.</li>
      <li>a healthy pink glow the entire time I used it.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not careful too much will come out and it will all be gone before you have a chance to use it.  </li>
      <li>it gives my lips a natural pink color when I use it and a little clear gloss goes on nicely afterward.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive lips so</li>
      <li>I used it and felt just wet and runny, very runny when applying.</li>
      <li>Get better results from a pharmacy bought product, they still dry out the lips but at least you had plumb lips to begin with when you used it.</li>

<li> Get better results from a pharmacy bought product, they still dry out the lips but at least you had plumb lips to begin with when you used it.</li>
<li> but you just become aware not to squeeze it hard.</li>
<li> one thing I noticed is it does work but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> and then my lips would be terribly dry later in the day from using it once!</li>
<li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> , almost all brands of lipsticks makes my lips dry and flaky.</li>
<li> Used it for 1 week - all it did was dry out and chap my lips.  </li>
<li> Hint: When you wear it under your lipstick, use it on your lip line too, I mean on your lips around the lips, let it absorb first which takes less than a minute, then put your lipstick on.</li>
<li> my lips looks fuller and with color again, the key is that you need to use it  everyday 2 times a day</li>
<li> Would never have spent the money on this had I known.</li>
<li> My lips feel fuller and smoother - and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> This product is not worth the money.  </li>
<li> It slightly plumps, I don&#x27;t find it to be overly moisturizing or drying.  </li>
<li> This did not do all what it says...and not sure what the other reviewers where claiming unless they had no lips to begin with.</li>
<li> It is a little bit pricy</li>
<li> Threw it out, waste of money.</li>
<li> Actually it dried my lips out everytime</li>
<li> It feels like a plain lotion and doesn&#x27;t plump your lips.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this time around, it was extremely runny and I saw no difference.</li>
<li> Yes, it is thin</li>
<li> The substance is very thin and watery and dries somewhat sticky.  </li>
<li> Those wanting a plumping effect will be disappointed I think.  </li>
<li> Worst crap ever.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product keeps lips moist and healthy, which alone makes it worth buying.  As for plump, well, you won&#x27;t look like Mick Jaggar.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it promises to do.  My lips feel fuller and smoother - and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I felt that this product is just ok.  It slightly plumps, I don&#x27;t find it to be overly moisturizing or drying.  The tube constantly leaks and most of the cream ends up all over the place rather than on my lips....</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all! Thought Dr Perricone would make a good product. NOT! Will not buy any of his products again.</li>
    <li> Huge dissapointment. This did not do all what it says...and not sure what the other reviewers where claiming unless they had no lips to begin with. I have fairly decent lips but would have liked a little plumping...nada. Actually it dried my lips out everytime I used it and felt just wet and runny, very runny when applying. No tingling, no sensation at all except that it was too runny and then my lips would be terribly dry later in the day from using it once! Would never have spent the money on this had I known. Get better results from a pharmacy bought product, they still dry out the lips but at least you had plumb lips to begin with when you used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this b/c my lipline is fading and my lipstick tends to bleed. I think this product has helped improve both issues.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, nothing has ever come close to working as well as this product.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Item does not plump the lips, but does appear to  condition them.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lip product, lip balm, lip plumper, lip exfoliate, and so on. This is the best product for the lips by far. I wear it before I go to bed and in the morning.  It keeps my lips soft and full without being greasy, or making my lips sting. I have sensitive lips so, almost all brands of lipsticks makes my lips dry and flaky. But when I wear this lip plumper under my lipstick, I have no problem; I can wear any lipstick I want. It also keeps my lipstick in place, not feathering. Hint: When you wear it under your lipstick, use it on your lip line too, I mean on your lips around the lips, let it absorb first which takes less than a minute, then put your lipstick on. It is a little bit pricy but it&#x27;s worth the price and it lasts a long time. Also you can get it cheaper at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I DONT THINK IT WORKED WELL</li>
    <li> It tastes good and works....although never used one of these types of products before....one thing I noticed is it does work but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I find this lip plumper is more of a lip conditioner.  Those wanting a plumping effect will be disappointed I think.  It really doesn&#x27;t do much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34;.  But as a lip conditioner before applying lip color, it is excellent.  I like that it gives my lips a natural pink color when I use it and a little clear gloss goes on nicely afterward.  As a primer for lip color, it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> It is pricy but I am satisfied with the product. It is not a miracle in a tube but does what it says it will do.Yes, it is thin but you just become aware not to squeeze it hard.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not careful too much will come out and it will all be gone before you have a chance to use it.  The substance is very thin and watery and dries somewhat sticky.  I cannot see any visible difference after morning and night use for thirty days.  Fortunately there was a thirty-day guarantee and I will be returning for a refund.  I love Dr Perricone but I just don&#x27;t see any positive results from using this product.</li>
    <li> My lips were loosing color and I had some lines but since I start using The Lip Plumper my lips looks fuller and with color again, the key is that you need to use it  everyday 2 times a day and you will see the results after probably 1 month but, you feel the hydration since the first day you start the treatment.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased my first tube many years ago and thought I&#x27;d give it another try. Unfortunately, this time around, it was extremely runny and I saw no difference. The one I bought a long time ago had a formula that was much more paste like - it stayed on my lips.

    <li> This product is not worth the money.  It doesn&#x27;t do as it says it does.  It feels like a plain lotion and doesn&#x27;t plump your lips.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> I purchased it at a retail store first. Love it, it works. Great price here, same great results! Smart move to buy.</li>
    <li> Worst crap ever.  Used it for 1 week - all it did was dry out and chap my lips.  Threw it out, waste of money.</li>
