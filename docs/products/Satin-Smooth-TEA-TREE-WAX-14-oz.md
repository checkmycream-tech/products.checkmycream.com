      <li>Good product very smooth.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice too</li>
      <li>The Satin Smooth line is amazing though, they never disappoint me!</li>
      <li>But once I tried the Smooth Deluxe Cream I was in love.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it with a wax warmer to avoid messiness.</li>
      <li>this product worked really well with regards to hair removal, my skin also felt great.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite at-home wax.  </li>
      <li>It has a mild, pleasant smell, not too strong of a tea tree odor, and it is so soothing.</li>
      <li>There is something about the tea tree that is more soothing than some wax.</li>
      <li>I love this wax.</li>
      <li>Love this wax.</li>
      <li>overall this one works great too, you just have to try it and judge for yourself and keep trying until you find one that works for you!</li>
      <li>I never have to shave any part of myself any more.</li>
      <li>Best wax ever, no red bumps</li>
      <li>But I keep coming back to it for its wonderful pain-numbing, skin-smoothing properties.</li>
      <li>I love using this leg wax, it is very good on my coarse hairy legs.</li>
      <li>I will buy again, it was so easy to try on</li>
      <li>it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>B001P4XDCM Clean + Easy</li>
      <li>It is CHEAP.</li>
      <li>(in case that link doesn&#x27;t work, it is supposed to be: Clean + Easy Original Epilating Pot Wax).</li>
      <li>Does not hurt as much as your regular wax, it feels like you&#x27;re ripping a band-aid off, which is super great!</li>
      <li>Original Epilating Pot Wax 14oz</li>
      <li>One tin gets make about 1 and 1/2 full leg waxes.</li>
      <li>its not bad for your skin or hair</li>
      <li>There was a spa I completely loved in a California town I lived in a while back, and when I got waxed there, it barely hurt at all; it was actually kind of relaxing.</li>
      <li>This wax was very nice to apply and even better to remove when you get it in a place you didn&#x27;t mean to wax.</li>
      <li>But anyways, Smooth Deluxe is the perfect one for me, I have very coarse hair and after only one use, I noticed that my hair was growing back much thinner and also slower!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional and love this wax for all body waxing, especially bikini, it works best on low temps and cotton strips, not muslin</li>
      <li>My favorite soft wax.  </li>
      <li>It smells terrific &amp; you&#x27;ll love how smoothly it goes on.</li>
      <li>So I invested in my own waxing supplies and this wax and have been doing it myself (and occasionally on some friends/family) ever since.</li>
      <li>Thought this would be a nice change from my regular wax.  </li>
      <li>i liked that it carried that extra additive of tea tree.</li>
      <li>So one day when I was in my old town I scheduled a wax, and asked what kind of wax they used on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>, so just be careful when you drop it, clean it right away while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
      <li>This wax not only removes unwanted hair, it leaves your skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>so I always like to try new wax brands to find one that I definitely like and feel comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I tried a few and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Hair grew back right away.  </li>
      <li>It depends on your skin, but also on the climate you live in, humidity, etc.</li>
      <li>I have a red hairy upper lip just in time for a huge family gathering in two days...</li>
      <li>and I just really like it how it turns liquidy without being hot on your skin for a much easier spreading, and the best part is that it removed the hair on my hands (pcos :/) in just one try, which was usually incredibly frustrating with other waxes I have tried...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for nearly 10 years.  </li>
      <li>My pale skin never even gets red dots for more than an hour after using.</li>
      <li>One thing, it is stickier than other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, and it takes some practice to know when it is the right consistency and won&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>I have very light skin and thick dark hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Satin Smooth Tea Tree wax ensures very good waxing with almost no discomfort. It is sticky enough to remove hair, yet not that sticky to cause pain. I can understand why it is used by professionals.</li>
    <li> Love this wax. I tried a few and this one is my favorite. I have very light skin and thick dark hair, I was bout 60% less red than the other waxes ive tried. One tin gets make about 1 and 1/2 full leg waxes.</li>

    <li> But it didn&#x27;t work at all for me and I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for nearly 10 years.  Thought this would be a nice change from my regular wax.  Unfortunately, all it did was irritate my skin while leaving all the hairs in place on my upper lip! Cannot recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a red hairy upper lip just in time for a huge family gathering in two days...</li>
    <li> I love using this leg wax, it is very good on my coarse hairy legs. I use this with my gigi wax warmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still a novice when it comes to waxing at home so I always like to try new wax brands to find one that I definitely like and feel comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Tea Tree Wax one and I just really like it how it turns liquidy without being hot on your skin for a much easier spreading, and the best part is that it removed the hair on my hands (pcos :/) in just one try, which was usually incredibly frustrating with other waxes I have tried... so that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER because it turns into a semi-liquid, it can get kinda messy (it doesn&#x27;t get stringy at all btw). I&#x27;m still not that of a pro when it comes to waxing so maybe I need practice. It didn&#x27;t bother me though, I am actually really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this wax with &amp;#34;JMT Beauty Non-woven Waxing Strips, 250 Count&amp;#34; and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> Stringy and left residual hairies.  Hair grew back right away.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product very smooth.</li>
    <li> Best wax ever, no red bumps no rashes.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice too</li>
    <li> My favorite soft wax.  Leaves little residue and not overly sticky but gets all my course Italian hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional and love this wax for all body waxing, especially bikini, it works best on low temps and cotton strips, not muslin</li>
    <li> This blue-green tea tree wax was very gummy and stringy and messy. I do agree with some people who say that the tea tree formula is easier on the skin.  There is something about the tea tree that is more soothing than some wax. But overall I stopped using this because it was lumpy and thick and hard to work with. Choosing a wax for home use is very personal, though. It depends on your skin, but also on the climate you live in, humidity, etc. What I use now is [[ASIN:B001P4XDCM Clean + Easy Original Epilating Pot Wax 14oz Can]] (in case that link doesn&#x27;t work, it is supposed to be: Clean + Easy Original Epilating Pot Wax).</li>
    <li> Yeah it works, damn if its not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look into sugar waxing. It is CHEAP. And all natural.&lt;br /&gt;and its not bad for your skin or hair folicals.&lt;br /&gt;Check it out on youtube and blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS! sugar wax doesn&#x27;t GET STUCK ON EVERYTHING FOREVER.</li>
    <li> This wax was very nice to apply and even better to remove when you get it in a place you didn&#x27;t mean to wax. Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> this product worked really well with regards to hair removal, my skin also felt great. i liked that it carried that extra additive of tea tree.</li>
