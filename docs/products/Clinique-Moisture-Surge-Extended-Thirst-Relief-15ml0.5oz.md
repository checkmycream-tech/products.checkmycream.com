      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be good or not</li>

      <li>I believe it was expired that is the reason why it is so cheap.</li>
      <li>I chose this size to get over the free shipping bar.  </li>
      <li>Moisture surge is fantastic description for it.  </li>
      <li>and I would not get the full  use of it before it was gone.  </li>

      <li>your skin is very dry, exfoliate first with a scrub (I like St. Ives Apricot Scrub) and then use this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty pink in the&lt;br /&gt;jar and velvety on your face.</li>
      <li>It is a light enough cream that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky, and deeply hydrating without causing irritation.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin, but it is very dry in the winter - after four days of using this (once in the morning, once in the night), my skin was no longer red, scaly and itchy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It looked like someone had been used a lot when I got it.</li>
    <li> Clinique makes a superior product. It&#x27;s a pretty pink in the&lt;br /&gt;jar and velvety on your face. Cannot predict long-term&lt;br /&gt;results but day-to-day very pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed I ordered two and one of them was half empty when I got it. I don&#x27;t know if it was open or spilled but the other one was fine. I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back bcz of the price but I won&#x27;t order from this person/company again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. Heard a lot of good things about this product. For me it did nothing. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in years, after using this for only a few days I had multiple. My face was more flaky and dry than ever :(</li>
    <li> This goes on so smooth and makes your face feel so hydrated and silky all day I love this stuff .I definitely recommend to anyone with very dry skin you Will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> this is really a great product. I apply it right after a shower - it absorbs right into my skin making it very smooth. On dry days when skin can feel dry and tight, this is the time to apply liberally to your skin.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast. These are everything they said.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter - she loved it and will order again - Thank you</li>
    <li> She loved it!  This is the best price you get for a trial size. It lasts a while.  She swears by this moisturizer as others do not seem to work as well. I would buy a bigger one but I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be good or not, so I got a small sample first. You may want to do the same.</li>
    <li> Best product for my face!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Good product.  I&#x27;ve used it before at full price.  It&#x27;s great for a light summer moisture barrier.  Product was as described.</li>
    <li> I am using this under my eyes. It is a light enough cream that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky, and deeply hydrating without causing irritation. My eyes are sensitive, so I am impressed that this does not cause them discomfort.</li>
    <li> Mine did not come in a box. I believe it was expired that is the reason why it is so cheap. Did not do anything for my skin. Was very disappointed considering that it had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
    <li> This cream has SAVED my dry skin. I have normal skin, but it is very dry in the winter - after four days of using this (once in the morning, once in the night), my skin was no longer red, scaly and itchy. A TINY bit of this goes a long way! I use a dollop about half the size of a grain of rice, and it is more than enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-If your skin is very dry, exfoliate first with a scrub (I like St. Ives Apricot Scrub) and then use this.&lt;br /&gt;-If your skin is irritated or burnt, put this in the fridge for an hour or two before - it will soothe while it moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, ABSOLUTELY buy this product, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Great price, awesome product for dry skin.  Leaves my skin feeling great.  Moisture surge is fantastic description for it.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> Will be ordering a bigger size.  This moisturizer feels amazing.  I&#x27;m pretty simple with my face routine and I sleep with a cpap.  This product moisturizes with out feeling heavy and oily.  My skin LOVES THIS!</li>
    <li> My skin has been so dry and I previously really loved clinique moisture surge, so I decided to try this moisturizer to see if it would provide even more moisture. It unfortunately didn&#x27;t soak completely into my skin. It left my skin feeling quite tacky for the next couple hour. By the end of the day, I could still feel it on my skin. I hate the feeling of a lotion, eww! I know I couldn&#x27;t put makeup over it because the makeup would have gotten stuck in the weird texture and stickiness of the residue. It didn&#x27;t help my dry, peeling skin at all either. I gave up on it after a couple days.</li>
    <li> The heading says it all.  It is not sticky or greasy but feels great on your skin.  Love it and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I think this small product may be  fake. I hate it . I usually bought this Clinique moisture surge extended thirst relief 1.7oz in the mall and I like this moisture product very much.&lt;br /&gt;This time I bought this small Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief at amazon, and I used for a week. It cause bad reation and my skin become red. I think amazon should be responsible for this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years.  I chose this size to get over the free shipping bar.  This is the same product I have always used.  It does not feel or seem different in any way.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this from a major department store in the large size but it would start to evaporate somewhat and I would not get the full  use of it before it was gone.  I really like this small size/small size price.  Since I use a little I only need to purchase a little.  I&#x27;m glad this is available in this small size.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great price.</li>
