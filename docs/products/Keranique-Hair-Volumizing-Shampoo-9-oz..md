      <li>why exactly is SLS</li>
      <li>Fast order!</li>
      <li>Check the label on many shampoos and any one of the following may be listed:</li>
      <li>One or more animal studies show sense organ effects at very low doses, especially when used around the mouth, eyes and lips, and one or more in vitro tests on mammalian cells show positive mutation results.</li>

    <li> This is the worst hair products I ever purchashed made my hair fall and the scent stinks. They really fooled many consumers by the expensive price. Amazon...... do yourself a favor and do not carry their brands I wouldn&#x27;t buy them even if they end up selling it in the dollar store.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell if it is working but I like it OK</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this shampoo was gonna work. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks and yes I can see hair growth. I&#x27;m very impressed. I love and yes I will buy again. I didn&#x27;t purchase the conditioner yet but I am. I did think the price was a little high but it does work...</li>
    <li> Hair grows now - its been a long time....</li>
    <li> Great for my hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and it is no thicker and it is now dried out badly.  I have very long naturally curly hair and it is so dried out I am going to have to get several inches cut off to attempt to get it back to normal.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is stronger:)</li>
    <li> Love Keranique, I have thin fine hair. Using the keranique have made my hair look fuller, an thicker its the best..</li>
    <li> I liked this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase this product if I went by any of the reviews, but I did purchase this shampoo and conditioner. It works great, it feels great and my hair loss is substanionally less. It smells good and makes my frizzy, want to be half curley/frizzy, long mop gorgeous (so my husband says :) ) I love it- Try it!</li>
    <li> I prefer the scalp stimulator shampoo better.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the other one I bought now.</li>
    <li> Very expensive,and it doesn&#x27;t give as volumizing effect as Keranique Conditioner does. These 2 products combined together don&#x27;t make much of difference-- it&#x27;s pretty much similar product to any other regular conditioner on the market,so I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Makes my hair feel so clean and looking forward to a really good time with less hair strands on my shoulders.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for two weeks and it seems to be really working and growing hair where it had been getting thin.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Fast order!</li>
    <li> Keranique has helped my thinning hair. Doesn&#x27;t make my head itch like some other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has grown back and I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> BE AWARE!!!!!!!!! READ THE INGREDIENTS on Keranique Products&lt;br /&gt;I used the product as directed and it caused severe  breakage of my hair and scalp irritation and inflammation of the follicles. Developed a bad case of foliculitis that sent me to the dermatologist and caused scalp alopecia.  Surprised by it  since the only different product I used on my hair was Keranique decided to do some research on the ingredients.... still ongoing but so far have found:&lt;br /&gt;KERANIQUE SHAMPOO contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate which has been Classified as a \\&quot; HARSH DETERGENT\\&quot; by the Cancer Prevention Coalition. THE BOTTLE SAYS SULFATE FREE....????&lt;br /&gt;98% of over the counter shampoos contain DEA/MEA and/or Sodium or Aluminum Laureth Sulfate (SLS) derivatives. These where designed as Engine Degreasers,the do a great job or striping dirt and almost all your natural oils your hair needs.DEA(diethanolamine) &amp; SLS (Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate) cause irritation of  the hair follicles. :&lt;br /&gt;The KERANIQUE FORTIFYING LEAVE IN MOUSSE contains TEA-Lauryl keratin Aminoacids; it seems  this combination is used in  Hair straighteners formulas (protein based relaxer???) TEA, a PH Balancer, also known as Triethanolamine.&lt;br /&gt;A typical shampoo contains about 50% sodium laurel sulfate, some sodium sterate and about 40% water. In addition to this brew, manufactures may add a baffling array of ingredients that read like a chemistry book. Check the label on many shampoos and any one of the following may be listed: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, MEA, DEA, TEA Laurel Sulfate, Cocomide or coconut oil. All of these compounds are commonly used surfactants related to SLS and have the same potential health dangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEA and MEA are often \\&quot;neutralized\\&quot; in the manufacturing process. Consumers can tell if they are being exposed to these harmful compounds when names like Cocamide DEA or MEA( monethanolamine) or Lauramide DEA are listed on the label. These chemicals are capable of disrupting human hormones and may form cancer-causing nitrates. Dr. Samuel Epstien, Professor of Environmental Health at the University of Illinois has said, \\&quot;repeated skin applications of DEA based detergents resulted in a major increase in the incidence of two cancers-liver and kidney cancers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LETS LEARN SOME MORE FACTS ABOUT THIS CHEMICALS:&lt;br /&gt;So why exactly is SLS so bad?&lt;br /&gt;Here are what tests show about Sodium Lauryl Sulfate:&lt;br /&gt;(1) SLS PENETRATES EYES AND TISSUES. Tests show that SLS can penetrate into the eyes as well as systemic tissues (brain, heart, liver, etc.) and shows long-term retention in those tissues. Especially when used in soaps and shampoos, there is an immediate concern relating to the penetration of SLS into the eyes and other tissues. This is especially important in infants, where considerable growth is occurring, because a much greater uptake occurs by tissues of younger eyes, and SLS changes the amounts of some proteins in cells from eye tissues. Tissues of young eyes may be more susceptible to alterations by SLS.[1]&lt;br /&gt;(2) SLS FORMS NITRATES. When SLS is used in shampoos and cleansers containing nitrogen-based ingredients, it can form carcinogenic nitrates that can enter the blood stream in large numbers. They can cause eye irritations, skin rashes, hair loss, scalp scurf similar to dandruff, and allergic reactions. [2]&lt;br /&gt;(3) SLS PRODUCES NITROSAMINES. (potent carcinogens that cause the body to absorb nitrates at higher levels than eating nitrate-contaminated food like hot dogs or lunch meat): Dr. David H. Fine, the chemist who uncovered NDELA contamination in cosmetics, estimates that a person would be applying 50 to 100 micrograms of nitrosamine to the skin each time he or she used a nitrosamine-contaminated cosmetic. By comparison, a person consuming sodium nitrate-preserved bacon is exposed to less than one microgram of nitrosamine. [3]&lt;br /&gt;(4) SLS STRIPS MOISTURE AND OIL FROM THE SKIN. According to the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, SLS produced skin and hair damage, including cracking and severe inflammation of the derma-epidermal tissue. Skin layers may separate and inflame due to its protein-denaturing properties. [4]&lt;br /&gt;(5) SLS IRRITATES SCALP AND MAY PROMOTE HAIR LOSS [5]&lt;br /&gt;(6) SLS CAN DAMAGE DNA IN CELLS - according to Japanese studies. [6]&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;SLS and all its cousins are very harsh detergents that strip the skin&#x27;s moisture barrior (which is linked to immunity and skin health) and causes serious health problems during testing on animals. It is linked to harming children&#x27;s eyes, denaturing protein (thereby possibly contributing to hair loss or thinning), and combines with DEA, MEA and TEA (often found in the same shampoo) to form nitrosamines, a potent carcinogen. Since it is only included in products because of its potent foaming action, the question you must consider is:&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more important: the foam or your health?&lt;br /&gt; What is DEA?&lt;br /&gt; DEA is diethanolamine, a chemical that is used as a wetting agent in shampoos, lotions, creams and other cosmetics. DEA is used widely because it provides a rich lather in shampoos and keeps a favorable consistency in lotions and creams. DEA by itself is not harmful but while sitting on the stores shelves or in your cabinet at home, DEA can react with other ingredients in the cosmetic formula to form an extremely potent carcinogen called nitrosodiethanolamine (NDEA). NDEA is readily absorbed through the skin and has been linked with stomach, esophagus, liver and bladder cancers.&lt;br /&gt;According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), \\&quot;There is sufficient evidence of a carcinogenic effect of N-nitrosodiethanolamine -- .\\&quot; (1) IARC recommends that NDEA should be treated as if it were a carcinogen in humans. The National Toxicology Program similarly concluded: \\&quot;There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of N-nitrosodiethanolamine in experimental animals.\\&quot;(2) Of over 44 different species in which N-nitroso compounds have been tested, all have been susceptible.(3) Humans are most unlikely to be the only exception to this trend.&lt;br /&gt; Why isn&#x27;t this chemical regulated by the FDA?&lt;br /&gt;. The cosmetics industry is the least regulated industry under the jurisdiction of the FDA. The FDA can make recommendations but it has very little power to enforce them. In 1979 the FDA ordered industry to eliminate NDEA from their products. In 1992, the FDA tested 12 products for NDEA contamination and found that 8 of them still contained this potent carcinogen. While levels have been reduced, there is still an avoidable risk of cancer when nitrosamine contaminated products are used. Even small amounts of this potent carcinogen can increase the risk of cancer.&lt;br /&gt; Which products should I avoid to eliminate exposure to NDEA?&lt;br /&gt; This is perhaps the biggest concern with the cosmetics industry. Consumers have a right to know about the dangers of products they purchase. To date, there is no way of knowing whether a particular cosmetic has been contaminated with NDEA. The best approximation is determining whether the cosmetic contains DEA. The following cosmetic ingredients are among those contaminated with DEA:&lt;br /&gt;Cocamide DEA or Cocamide Diethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;DEA Lauryl Sulfate or Diethanolamine Lauryl Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;Lauramide DEA or Lauramide Diethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Linoleamide DEA or Linoleamide Diethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Oleamide DEA or Oleamide Diethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Any product containing TEA or Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIETHANOLAMINE  Also known as TEA&lt;br /&gt;Functions:&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine is an amine produced by reacting ethylene oxide (considered highly toxic) with ammonia (another known toxin). It is used as a buffering  agent, masking and fragrance ingredient, and surfactant, in addition to its primary use as a pH adjuster. Treithanolamine is used in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, including eyeliners, mascara, eye shadows, blushers, make-up bases and foundations, as well as in fragrances, hair care products, hair dyes, wave sets, shaving products, sunscreens, and skin care and skin cleansing products (Wikipedia and CosmeticsInfo.org). Triethanolamine is also  used with in conjunction with fatty acids to convert acid to salt, which in turn becomes the base for a cleanser, according to OrganicConsumers.org. Additionally, it may assist in emulsion formation by reducing surface tension of the substances, enabling water and oil-soluble ingredients to mix.Triethanolamine is FDA approved as an indirect food additive (aka it can be used&lt;br /&gt;in packaging) and CIR approved with concentration limits. The CIR determined that Triethanolamine was \\&quot;safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with the skin, the concentration of Triethanolamine should not exceed 5%.\\&quot;Safety Measures/Side effects:Triethanolamine is considered a moderate hazard ingredient by the Cosmetics Database, which notes as concerns. According to Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics, and the U.S. National Library of Medicine, there is strong evidence that Triethanolamine is a human skin, immune system and respiratory toxicant. One or more animal studies show sense organ effects at very low doses, especially when used around the mouth, eyes and lips, and one or more in vitro tests on mammalian cells show positive mutation results. It has been shown to cause bladder and liver cancer, as well as changes in testicles.According to OrganicConsumers.org, Triethanolamine can cause allergic reactions including eye problems, dryness of hair and skin, and could be toxic if absorbed into the body over a long period of time. It can cause itching, burning, scaling, hives, and blistering of skin, all symptoms which may increase with higher concentrations (The Green Beauty Guide).Triethanolamine \\&quot;should not be used in products containing N-nitrosating agents to prevent the formation of possibly carcinogenic nitrosamines.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;SPREAD THE WORD.........\\&quot;which N-nitroso compounds have been tested, all have been susceptible.(3) Humans are most unlikely to be the only exception to this trend.&lt;br /&gt; Why isn&#x27;t this chemical regulated by the FDA?&lt;br /&gt;.

    <li> Did not met expectations, especially considering the high cost of the product. I would not purchase again. Very unsatisfied with quality.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of thinning hair that is fairly fine, and this product is working better than I expected for fuller, very manageable hair.  I found that it makes my hair fuller after a shampoo and I can let it dry and put off curling it right away, which is a plus I never expected.  It sometimes looks like I just had a body perm, after 2 sudsings.  I won&#x27;t know until I have used this shampoo for awhile whether my hair fills in or not.  Perhaps the volumizing is the best it gets.  I think it is great for my fine hair so far.  I have used it exclusively since I received it.</li>
    <li> Good job cleaning my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner left my hair dry &amp; frizzy and still falling out. AND there&#x27;s no money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It actually does add volume to my very fine hair.  I am so happy that I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair a little bit frizzy, but is still a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. It does not dry out fine hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> so far so good, need to purchase the rest of the products</li>
    <li> This shampoo is expensive and no difference that other products out there.  It had a balmy feeling on my scalp after using it.  I used it for 30-days and not difference as they claim. You are better of using Nioxin--the price is reasonable and you can get it from the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertisement on this product is full of gimmicks and tricks.  Beware.</li>
    <li> My hair has starting growing back in! It is about an inch or two long and coming in all over my head . the very first hair product for thinning hair that has worked for me and i have tried everything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for approximately 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after washing my hair feels thicker.  Only&lt;br /&gt;problem is that it&#x27;s not permanent.  By the next day the&lt;br /&gt;volume is already gone.</li>
    <li> Just love the Keranique products.. I have been using them for about 6 months now and combine them with taking &amp;#34;Hair and Nails&amp;#34; vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been thinning for many years... and now it is thick and healthy.  I now purchase the products I need through Amazon.. this way I can keep on top of the expenses and just purchase what I need when I need it...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but cheaper shampoos are just as good.  I would not discourage anyone from buying this product but wouldn&#x27;t promote it either.</li>
    <li> I am at the end of my first bottle of this product, Keranique Hair volumizing shampoo.  Not only have I seen a difference in my hair but my beautician has seen the difference as well.  The difference was apparent after one shampoo.  My hair was extremely fine and delicate.  It is now heavier in texture and grown in enough for me to be happy with it. I keep it really short, but if I want to curl it I can.  It didn&#x27;t take a curling iron before, it does now, so I can do things with it.  The product is expensive but I am going to rebuy it as long as it works for me.</li>
