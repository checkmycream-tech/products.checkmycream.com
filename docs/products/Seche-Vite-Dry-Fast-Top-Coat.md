      <li>(if you have ridges in your nails they really aren&#x27;t noticeable after applying the top coat.</li>

      <li>This stuff works - really, really well.</li>
      <li>It dries fast and no smudges.</li>
      <li>Dries fast but pulls polish from edges and corners of nails.</li>
      <li>But it does chip within the first couple of days - just normal activities</li>
      <li>but it dries up fast</li>
      <li>I now prefer this quick dry top coat over Out-the-Door brand because I feel that it sets harder.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of shiny topcoats, quick dry topcoats and quick dry items you put on after topcoats</li>
      <li>The first time I used, it started chipping after the third day.</li>
      <li>Not only does it make your nails shine as if they were done professionally</li>
      <li>It really does dry your nail polish in an instant.</li>
      <li>Its also very inexpensive, other drug stores would sell them for like $10.</li>
      <li>just have never had much luck with any other fast dry topcoat - no matter how long I&#x27;m careful afterwards.</li>

    <li> There was not anything extra special about this top coat nail polish. Its not better than other nail coats out there.</li>
    <li> Hallelujah! I&#x27;ve tried dozens of shiny topcoats, quick dry topcoats and quick dry items you put on after topcoats and I have finally found the best product out there! (This is it.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apply right after your manicure, doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge the polish. It actually does a great job filling in and concealing any minor flaws in the manicure as well. Dries nearly instantly to the touch, dries solid in minutes. Shiny, shiny, shiny! I cannot stop raving about this product and I am definitely trying their other nail products.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just have never had much luck with any other fast dry topcoat - no matter how long I&#x27;m careful afterwards. I&#x27;m a perfectionist and this stuff has finally made my manicure perfect. I&#x27;ll have to update this as to how long my manicure lasted with it.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this top coat a couple years ago and haven&#x27;t gotten to buy it for myself until now. FREAKING LOVE IT. Smells like a nail salon (which I personally don&#x27;t hate) and dries fast. Love when things do what they are supposed to do :) Will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is the fastest drying top coat I have used thus far. The only thing that I do not like about it, is the smell of it. It smells worse than nail polish.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.

    <li> I purchased this because I was looking for a topcoat that would dry quickly and not cause my polish to chip as easily.  This top coat certainly dried fast, but it peeled terribly!  When using this I could peel the entire nail of polish off in one strip.</li>
    <li> Dries fast but pulls polish from edges and corners of nails.</li>
    <li> Some people have mentioned it has a strong odor, I don&#x27;t notice it myself.  I like the way it goes on and the way my nails look after.  It gives a smooth finish  to your polish and nails (if you have ridges in your nails they really aren&#x27;t noticeable after applying the top coat. It dries quickly.</li>
    <li> love this fast drying top coat.  I do my nails before I go to bed.  It dries fast and no smudges.</li>
    <li> After reading some great reviews for this top coat I decided to buy it and try it.  It works okay - it does dry super fast and goes on really well.  But it does chip within the first couple of days - just normal activities and it does chip.  But it arrived very quickly and Amazon always does a good job with returns.  But I will keep it and continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works - really, really well. Dries fast, hard, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, it smells like it&#x27;s trying to kill you. I think it&#x27;s the toluene, probably a lot of it. I stopped using it because I feared for my brain cells. I almost suspect the formula they&#x27;re using isn&#x27;t legal. Maybe the FDA should take a look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a plethora of top coats, none comes even a tiny bit close to Seche. You&#x27;ll literally go from wet nail enamel to rock hard shiny nails in minutes. It acts more like a shell if anything. Awesome product. Recommend this product times one million!!!</li>
    <li> Not only does it make your nails shine as if they were done professionally but, it also dries your nails in minutes. Best top coat ever!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m pretty happy with this product, i will be buying this again for sure. it dries very fast like it promises.</li>
    <li> This is like my life savoir! It really does dry your nail polish in an instant. It makes your nail polish look amazing! Its also very inexpensive, other drug stores would sell them for like $10. I really recommend this.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing to make my polish dry faster or stay on longer. Disappointed</li>
    <li> I love this fast dry top coat.  It gives a lot of durability to my polish.  I take it to the nail salon to make the manicure last.</li>
    <li> Dries hard and fast. I now prefer this quick dry top coat over Out-the-Door brand because I feel that it sets harder. Get&#x27;s thick and gummy fast, buy some Seche Restore to thin it out and make it feel like new. All QDTC&#x27;s get gummy.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a top coat, but this one was amazing. It does have a weird scent to it but it dries up fast and it gives a really nice finish.</li>
    <li> The first time I used, it started chipping after the third day. I have to scrape it all off. That&#x27;s how bad it looked. I will not used again.</li>
