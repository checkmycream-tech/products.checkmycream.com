      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love the ease of using it.</li>

      <li>Great quality and decent prices.</li>
      <li>but I noticed I sleep much more soundly...</li>
      <li>Easy to use,</li>
      <li>This oil has been very helpful for sore areas of my body and also a great way to help bring calm to my body and therefore fall asleep easier.  </li>
      <li>However, on my back and shoulders, it gave a warm feeling and it felt that it allowed good blood circulation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absorbed through the skin very effectively, and is very relaxing when applied before bedtime.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great and was the only thing that helped my sciatica.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, use it daily for Fibromyalgia.  </li>
      <li>since magnesium is better absorbed transdermally.  </li>
      <li>Works great, leaves a saltwater film where you apply it, but not a big deal at all.</li>
      <li>Great for muscle spasms!&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium gets into the skin without irritating your stomach the way tablets do.&lt;br /&gt;Also, good for bone density.</li>
      <li>is effective yet natural without all the toxins of store bought deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top was kind of loose and some of the oil was all over the bottle and the shipping box.</li>
      <li>This is a great way to get extra magnesium if taking too much orally gives your stomach a problem.  </li>
      <li>its a good consistency, non oily, leaves minimal residue that is anything but oily, in fact it&#x27;s almost like sea wter after it dries on your skin</li>
      <li>And is the only effective way to treat muscle spasms.</li>
      <li>I heard about this magnesium oil and gave it a try for my leg cramps last year and have been using it ever since as I get nice relief from the pain.</li>
      <li>But its worth a try.</li>
      <li>It makes the skin there peel, but it&#x27;s worth it, because I haven&#x27;t had foot and leg cramps in months.</li>
      <li>Back to the drawing board , however the product itself is fine - exactly what it says it is :)</li>
      <li>I guess she was right.  </li>
      <li>I just mixed it with some witch hazel and essential oils, and it is the perfect natural deodorant!</li>
      <li>Knowing that it was likely one of the leading cause and trigger to my minor yet numerous health issues (i.e. joint and muscle spasms, TMJ, mild depression, hormonal/adrenal issues), I knew I  had to find ways to manage it as best as I could,  which also lead me to this stuff.</li>
      <li>FAST SHIP PRODUCT SEEMS TO WORK!</li>
      <li>At first this spray burned my skin, now it does not.</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>Since using this product, my husband has experienced considerable less pain.  </li>
      <li>This item is very good if you put a few drops in your regular location.  </li>
      <li>Has really helped me feel better in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>However, when first sprayed in the skin, it really itches.</li>
      <li>I think this may help relax muscles a bit; it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>and if you use too much too often it will sting and burn.</li>
      <li>Reduces pain very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this magnesium oil</li>
      <li>I really like Life Flo products.</li>
      <li>I spray this on my feet and legs, it really helps with sleepless nights.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>it really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has given me much needed relief from pain</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much,  or really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it&#x27;s helped keep muscle spasms and my mood under control.</li>
      <li>We actually laughed the first few days because things that would normally set us off didn&#x27;t faze us near as much.</li>
      <li>It helped to spray a good amount in lotion and apply it during that time--at least when I could be bothered to.</li>
      <li>This has been great since exercise usually triggered a host of problems, making it hard to get in better shape .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to find a product that helps me manage the daily pain I experience with herniated discs plus the insomnia I am encountering with menopause.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rarely sore after workout when I normally would be, and it&#x27;s barely noticeable when I do feel anything.</li>
      <li>,its been about two months now and still having same result,so.happy to find this by accident,as for the restless legs it does help,it doesnt go away altogether but definitely makes it more manageable.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I will purchase again and highly recommend to others.</li>
      <li>A little more watery than oily</li>
      <li>I have been encountering so many people with the same complaint and have always recommended this fine product.</li>
      <li>I have rarely experience the tingling some folks mention, and have yet to get a salty or white residue on my skin after it dries.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW</li>
      <li>Really nothing major compared to how my legs felt before I started using magnesium.</li>
      <li>I still have moments due to situations out of my control, but it&#x27;s much more manageable (also helped with deep breathing, exercise,  meditation/yoga to work with cortisol/adrenaline overload).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but I also take small amounts magnesium citrate at night to combat insomnia and try get most of it from food (i.e. pumpkin seeds, nuts, etc.).</li>
      <li>It does sting/itch the first few times you use it, especially on irritated skin, but is fine once it dries or you can wash it off after it&#x27;s had time to absorb.</li>
      <li>I dont remember the last time my underarms have felt so clear and normal!!</li>
      <li>I get a fair amount of lower back spasms, in addition to the typical pulls due to working out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Has really helped me feel better in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> I spray it on my body daily, whether I have ailments or not everything about it is beneficial!!</li>
    <li> Great for muscle spasms!&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium gets into the skin without irritating your stomach the way tablets do.&lt;br /&gt;Also, good for bone density.As far as I know,magnesium not calcium rebuilds bone mass. And is the only effective way to treat muscle spasms. I have a myotonia condition,and this really helps.just spray it on,and it will tingle and sometimes even burn a little, but it works! If you don&#x27;t like taking muscle relaxers and bone density tablets this is the one to try.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia and someone suggested this for some of my pain and it works great.</li>
    <li> At first this spray burned my skin, now it does not. Burning means you&#x27;re deficient in Magnesium so keep using it until the burning stops. I spray this on my feet and legs, it really helps with sleepless nights. It is very sticky and can leave a white patch on your skin where you sprayed it. But its worth a try. You can also make your own if you dont want to deal with any of these symptoms, just look up on You tube how to make Magnesium oil spray. Basically its Vodka, Magnesium flakes in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I was getting cramps in my feet and legs in the early morning before getting up....really, really bad cramps. I read somewhere about this oil and started rubbing it on the soles of my feet in the evening. My skin is sensitive, so yes it is irritating to me,  except on the soles of my feet. It makes the skin there peel, but it&#x27;s worth it, because I haven&#x27;t had foot and leg cramps in months. I will use this forever if need be.....it really works.</li>
    <li> great for preventing leg cramps.  don&#x27;t like the feel on my skin, but love not getting cramps at night.</li>
    <li> Reduces pain very well. Helped improve my sleep too. However, when first sprayed in the skin, it really itches. I was told to dilute with water to combat thr itchiness.</li>
    <li> Worked well for backache caused by muscle tightness</li>
    <li> Great for aches and pains!</li>
    <li> Everyone believes that their muscle cramps are the worst.  Since I started using Magnesium oil, the cramps are not so bad, not so bad at all.  Product works wonderfully for me.  Only con is it leaves my hands a little greasy but that is a small price to pay for relief.</li>
    <li> This really works!  When I have muscle soreness I just spray it on.  It tingles for a little while, but the muscle soreness just disappears!  Works as good as ibuprofen for muscles soreness for me.</li>
    <li> The top was kind of loose and some of the oil was all over the bottle and the shipping box.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, use it daily for Fibromyalgia.  Hot shower, wipe dry then spray. I prefer this for areas that get sweaty, and the lotion for areas that don&#x27;t. This does seem to cause a bit of irritation which I don&#x27;t get from using the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some current studies using a topical magnesium for Fibro if you look online.  Application is three times per day.</li>
    <li> This is the only Magnesium oil I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s fine. My skin is slightly tacky after application, but I just try to put it on somewhere that I don&#x27;t touch. It does make my skin tingle a little after application, too, but I have sensitive skin. It helps to put on lotion with it. I haven&#x27;t used it consistently long enough to see if it&#x27;s changed anything physiologically.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HELPS WITH LEG CRAMPS AND INSOMNIA -CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT NOW</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and was the only thing that helped my sciatica.  I also find that I can stand for longer periods of time without my back hurting.  I&#x27;ve also given some to sufferers of eczema and psoriasis which helped clear up their conditions.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;trigger thumb&amp;#34; and this has been a miracle product.  Sometimes it will leave a white chalky film on my skin. One family member has used it for wrist problems and another has used for knee problems.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on a spot of melanoma but have been using it as a deodorant and I love it.</li>
    <li> The actual oil does help with the muscle cramping however, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work at all, so I have to pour a little in my hand and then apply to my skin.  I just ordered roll on bottles that I can use to apply the oil.</li>
    <li> A little more watery than oily</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from chronic stress for years and without really realizing it until  recently, when I was so stressed my back muscles burned and locked up, causing numerous issues, and I found it really hard to calm down, which is not like me at all. Knowing that it was likely one of the leading cause and trigger to my minor yet numerous health issues (i.e. joint and muscle spasms, TMJ, mild depression, hormonal/adrenal issues), I knew I  had to find ways to manage it as best as I could,  which also lead me to this stuff. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much,  or really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it&#x27;s helped keep muscle spasms and my mood under control. I&#x27;ve even started spraying my partner, who has some serious depression, among other things, and have even noticed a drastic change in his mood, not to mention highs and lows. We actually laughed the first few days because things that would normally set us off didn&#x27;t faze us near as much. I still have moments due to situations out of my control, but it&#x27;s much more manageable (also helped with deep breathing, exercise,  meditation/yoga to work with cortisol/adrenaline overload).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take this stuff primarily for therapy reasons and spot treatment, and in small doses throughout the day,  but I also take small amounts magnesium citrate at night to combat insomnia and try get most of it from food (i.e. pumpkin seeds, nuts, etc.). The oil is particularly helpful for spasms, giving me near instant relief, and I also use it after I&#x27;ve worked my muscles during a workout or already have muscle soreness from something else, since exercise can deplete magnesium. I will also do a few short sprays when I feel I&#x27;m getting worked up,  but only 5 sprays or so since I don&#x27;t want to go overboard. I&#x27;m rarely sore after workout when I normally would be, and it&#x27;s barely noticeable when I do feel anything. This has been great since exercise usually triggered a host of problems, making it hard to get in better shape . I&#x27;ve noticeda lot more flexibility with yoga as well, which I&#x27;m a beginner on and have been struggling with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are very basic, which I like--just water and magnesium chloride that seems to be from the same source as the blue label brand that costs twice as much,  but I&#x27;ve not tried theirs yet. I admit it really burned and caused minor rashes in some areas the first few weeks,  probably from deficiency, but now it merely tingles or I don&#x27;t feel anything. It helped to spray a good amount in lotion and apply it during that time--at least when I could be bothered to. I also like putting some in a small bottle to take on the go, along with some wipes since it can get greasy and I prefer to rub it into the skin.</li>
    <li> I just started trying this since I have a magnesium deficiency, even with taking oral supplements.  Thought I&#x27;d give this a try. since magnesium is better absorbed transdermally.  So I will see if it helps.  Otherwise, this leaves a weird feeling film on my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t stung at all.  I just apply about an hour before I take my evening shower.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIP PRODUCT SEEMS TO WORK!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after watching a podcast on how to naturally helped herniated discs.  The recommendation was to spray magnesium on the part of the spine where you have the problem.  My area is the lumbar so I the product on my spine and massage it into the skin.  After a week of using this product, I have stopped using my Voltaren gel for pain but the biggest change for me is that I am falling asleep much faster and not waking in the middle in the night.  My husband unfortunately had an allergic reaction to the spray, his skin turned red immediately and was burning so he had to wash it off.  However, he suffers from allergies to many things.  I&#x27;m excited to find a product that helps me manage the daily pain I experience with herniated discs plus the insomnia I am encountering with menopause.</li>
    <li> Using this form of magnesium is the only way I get results as pills just don&#x27;t work for me. I can tell the difference if I stop for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I use this on my lower back and for some reason it helps minimize my chronic back pain. I have recommend this to many friends and co-workers and the response is always amazing.</li>
    <li> Item leaked in the package because the top was not screwed on.  I was told to take a picture and send it per email.  #1 I have to BUY a camera.  #2 THEN I have to pay to get the pics developed.  THEN, they are assuming I have a scanner!  #3 I was told I could not talk to a manager.  They have to leave him a message.  This is customer service?  I have to go out of my way because of their faulty packaging?</li>
    <li> This oil has been very helpful for sore areas of my body and also a great way to help bring calm to my body and therefore fall asleep easier.  I will purchase again and highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I told about this product which is good for pain.  After using this product, I found it to help with the reduction of pain.</li>
    <li> One of the best ways to get this vital mineral. It cuts down on inflammation.</li>
    <li> I am using this as a non-irritating anti-perspirant. I works surprising well.</li>
    <li> I keep this with me all the time love it!</li>
    <li> the bottle was open, it was on everything in the box.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It great for spraying on aches and muscle cramps.  When my hand joints get sore, I just spray this on and it usually goes right away.  This remedy is under-appreciated.</li>
    <li> Works great alone as a deodorant!!! In this Houston, TX heat and humidity, I had no &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; all day!!! I use it twice a day: morning and evening. It leaves no residue or icky film lIke over the couter deodorants, which also darkens my skin. Since I stopped using over the counter deodorant, my underarm skin is no longer dark: it&#x27;s almost back to even skin tone under there!!! Can&#x27;t wait to add some essential oils to make it an even better deodorant!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this spray works for minor back pain. I spray four sprays and rub it in and in less than 5 minutes the pain is gone. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Did not seem to work well for me. Could be my body</li>
    <li> I bought this same magnesium oil at the vitamin store for my restless legs. when I researched the product it mentioned it could be used as deoderant as well so I used it for both. I was surprised after a week or two of use as deodorant that the cysts under my arms are almost non existent. I dont remember the last time my underarms have felt so clear and normal!! I wasn&#x27;t even taking it for that reason ,its been about two months now and still having same result,so.happy to find this by accident,as for the restless legs it does help,it doesnt go away altogether but definitely makes it more manageable. I recommended it to my mom for her rls and she sprays it on her legs daily and finds its helping her as well. I will continue to purchase this product for as long as I continue to have these results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff helps or not. Very messy. However, what did help me is potassium pills</li>
    <li> I ordered this magnesium oil to help with pain and stiffness due to sudden tendon issues that i am attributing to being on Cipro. While I&#x27;m not happy I had a bad reaction to this drug, I am happy that this oil has definitely helped! I use it twice daily along with magnesium supplements and my legs have gone back to almost-normal!  As for skin irritation, I try not to douse myself in the stuff but I have only noticed very minor itching only every so often. Really nothing major compared to how my legs felt before I started using magnesium.</li>
    <li> its a good consistency, non oily, leaves minimal residue that is anything but oily, in fact it&#x27;s almost like sea wter after it dries on your skin - that&#x27;s neither here nor there.  i also noticed i itch for a bit after application.  as my skin isnt especially reactive or sensitive, i didnt expect this and am quite surprised...i thought it might be a good massage oil, but cant toelrate it on my skin</li>
    <li> The spray bottle works great, no problems in that regard. Mag oil is a salt so it can be irritating on your skin, if it stings, use some aloe along with it. It bothers my skin a great deal..  Feels itchy/stings.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it hoping it would help with leg cramps. It helps when I have one, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent them. Back to the drawing board , however the product itself is fine - exactly what it says it is :)&lt;br /&gt;Rubbing coconut oil on your skin helps prevent the stinging,  too.&lt;br /&gt;Edited - after a lot of research,  I&#x27;ve found that magnesium glycinate or Malate help with the cramping without causing gastric distress.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for some relief from leg cramps at night. It seems to help but I noticed I sleep much more soundly...go figure.</li>
    <li> I get a fair amount of lower back spasms, in addition to the typical pulls due to working out. I think this may help relax muscles a bit; it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt. I have rarely experience the tingling some folks mention, and have yet to get a salty or white residue on my skin after it dries. it is not oily or greasy at all, and once it dries, leaves nothing behind. At the price, it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to try for any tired, stiff, or injured muscles.</li>
    <li> I have chronic pain due to fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathy. I suffer from painful leg cramps and extremely sensitive and horrible nerve pain that makes my feet clench up, like stabbing shots of electricity as well as numbness.  I take magnesium and malic acid as I heard it helps with the pain.  But the help is not enough even though I take pain meds.  I heard about this magnesium oil and gave it a try for my leg cramps last year and have been using it ever since as I get nice relief from the pain. This brand works great! What I didn&#x27;t know but heard recently was that it could also be used on my feet. So I started massaging some oil on my feet every time the pain got unbearable and it works! I get immediate relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some people with sensitive skin the salt in the oil can burn you a little. The bottle label says you can wipe it off after use. This has not been a problem for me. And secondly, the oil can be very messy if sprayed directly on your skin. It can drip on the floor. To solve this issue, I spray the container of oil into my hands over a sink and then rub it into the skin. Sometimes I even lay a towel on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this oil for deodorant as well and it is nice to have something to use that is effective yet natural without all the toxins of store bought deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has given me much needed relief from pain and I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this magnesium oil, I put it on my feet every night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> This came in a timely manner. Just started using.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Do your research on the benefits. I immediately felt a tingle when I applied.</li>
    <li> Since using this product, my husband has experienced considerable less pain.  He suffers from chronic neck pain due to an automobile accident 18 years ago.  Easy to use, no mess, and one bottle will go a long way.  You can use up to two times a day.  For those of you that hate taking pain meds, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is working great for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to get extra magnesium if taking too much orally gives your stomach a problem.  The sprayer gets a little clogged but just rinse with water and it&#x27;s good to go.  I am very magnesium deficient and feel so much better when I take a lot of it, but I like to supplement with this oil.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly as deodorant. As in, NOTHING I have tried in years (natural or conventional) has worked for me, and this did. I did however have a very strong reaction to it and ended up having to dilute it for use because my armpits got irritated. If your body is deficient in magnesium (which most peoples&#x27; is) then it will sting for a bit when you put it on, and in some cases (like mine) the sting can progress into a rash. I just mixed it with some witch hazel and essential oils, and it is the perfect natural deodorant!</li>
    <li> Cap was loose and product leaked out of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;What a mess!!</li>
    <li> I have issues with magnesium deficiency and get very painful muscle spasms. Daily use of this product stops the spasms completely and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the nasty side effects of a oral magnesium supplements. Couldn&#x27;t live without it. I have been encountering so many people with the same complaint and have always recommended this fine product.</li>
    <li> This is good, potent magnesium oil.  It&#x27;s absorbed through the skin very effectively, and is very relaxing when applied before bedtime. I use it on my sore joints (knees, lower back) to reduce inflammation and pain--works very well.  It&#x27;s also effective as an underarm deodorant.  I recommend mixing it with aloe vera gel to avoid dry or stinging skin (due to the heavy concentration of mineral salts).</li>
    <li> I often struggle with neck and shoulder pain and Magnesium Oil has been a lifesaver for me. I gave some to my MIL who had knee surgery and was struggling with some hip pain and it helped her also. I always carry a bottle with me.</li>
    <li> This was my second order.  Use this when I can&#x27;t take my salt baths.</li>
    <li> I honesty do now know what all the good reviews about this product came from, never made me sleep better or help my aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of  Money.</li>
    <li> good product great service</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves a saltwater film where you apply it, but not a big deal at all. Using it for myself (PMS, cramps) and my daughter (eczema). It does sting/itch the first few times you use it, especially on irritated skin, but is fine once it dries or you can wash it off after it&#x27;s had time to absorb.I really like Life Flo products. Great quality and decent prices.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product everyday but when I do it seems like I sleep a lot better. I use it on my hips and legs and I think it helps with my hip pain. I had surgery back in Feb. The only draw backs are that it makes my legs feel like they sweat all night long and if you use too much too often it will sting and burn. Might be better to dilute it somewhat in another bottle. And I agree with some other posts that the spray nozzel sticks sometimes. Over all I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> We keep this oil in all the bathrooms and in the bedroom.  Love the ease of using it.</li>
    <li> This item is very good if you put a few drops in your regular location.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, great service.  This has been a life changing purchase for my husband.</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived 7 days late. Shipping problem,not product problem. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It leaves a horrible oily film wherever you put it. My feet were oily after 3 baths</li>
    <li> For the longest Time I&#x27;ve had muscle spasms in my shoulder.  My therapist advised me to soak in Epson salt or spray this Magnesium on my back.  Her advice was that when muscles spasm, they are calling for magnesium.  I guess she was right.  This spray worked wonders.  Warning though, as this is salt with oil, it will burn in open sores or dry skin.  However, on my back and shoulders, it gave a warm feeling and it felt that it allowed good blood circulation.</li>
