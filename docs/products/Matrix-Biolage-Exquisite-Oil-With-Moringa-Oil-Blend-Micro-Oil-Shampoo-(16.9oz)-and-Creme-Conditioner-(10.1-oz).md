      <li>Love it and absolutely recommend it!</li>
      <li>Originally my hairdresser used this on my hair.</li>
      <li>great product for those who have dry hair.</li>
      <li>Biolage has a clean scent in all its products.  </li>
      <li>shampoo is nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I had recently used the matrix biolage shampoo for color treated hair and really loved the quality.</li>
      <li>My hair is always soft, manageable, and smells really nice.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo, smoothed, added moisture, plus a head full of life to my hair.</li>
      <li>and I really like the conditioner, which is more of a reconstructive product.</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells so nice!</li>
      <li>Regardless of that, I love this particular shampoo &amp; condition from Biolage &amp; hope they keep this one around for quite a while.  </li>
      <li>Exquisite oils shampoo, conditioner and oil are first products which make a significant difference to my hair - soft, smooth, shiny and noticeably less brittle.</li>
      <li>recently had to go onto the Biolage website to figure out which one of their latest lines would work best for my hair because they do have a few to choose from.  </li>
      <li>I have long fine hair that easily dries out and becomes easily greasy.</li>
      <li>I love the product and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>Since going to a more natural approach without all the chemicals, I will not purchase again.</li>
      <li>I knew right away</li>
      <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner you can comb your hair very easilly right out of the shower, no tangles!</li>
      <li>For years people have bragged about this brand, and 2014 was my first try.</li>
      <li>This conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat and unmanageable like most conditioners do.  </li>
      <li>I have long naturally curly hair and most mornings I get out of the shower and the brush goes right through my hair!  </li>
      <li>It really softens the hair.  </li>
      <li>Also, you don&#x27;t have to use much of the product.</li>
      <li>its shiny, clean smelling and really nice to tough...</li>
      <li>When I saw that this new shampoo had come out I was ecstatic!</li>
      <li>I notice less breakage and more strength in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The conditioner smells very nice, and does a decent job of smoothing my thick, coarse hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never in 20 years had build up in my hair and let me tell you, I have to use some serious hair product sometimes because my hair is really fine, but full.  </li>
      <li>My hair is typically, dry, full of oil, and frizzy.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I usually purchase these at the salon but the price here was so much better.</li>
      <li>Tended to leave my fine long hair flat and the conditioner did not seem to do the trick.</li>
      <li>Makes it really manageable, even though mine is short..</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to all that want soft hair.</li>
      <li>They leave my hair shiny, soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product  before and was not able to get from JCPenny where I bought originally.</li>
      <li>This product has immensely helped restore some natural moisture.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, thin and wavy.  </li>

    <li> I love this Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair was dull and dry and now it is shiny and full of life.</li>
    <li> Tended to leave my fine long hair flat and the conditioner did not seem to do the trick. Since going to a more natural approach without all the chemicals, I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had recently used the matrix biolage shampoo for color treated hair and really loved the quality. When I saw that this new shampoo had come out I was ecstatic! I have long fine hair that easily dries out and becomes easily greasy. This shampoo and conditioner has greatly improved my hair-- its so much silkier now and a lot healthier. I notice less breakage and more strength in it.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that because there were added oils my hair would be greasy, but no such thing happened. This be a repeat purchase no doubt!</li>
    <li> have been using for months now and like it so much I gave it for Christmas this year ! ! !</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells very nice, and does a decent job of smoothing my thick, coarse hair.  I may buy the conditioner again just for the scent.  Pantene conditioners work better on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is nothing special.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of cleaning the product build up in the hair, and also doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair.  Based on my personal experience, there is no difference between this shampoo and a generic supermarket cheapo shampoo.  Safe to skip out on this shampoo, but you may want to check out the conditioner to see if you like the scent.</li>
    <li> great product for those who have dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner set. I use a couple times a week when I need a break from Pureology.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Leaves my hair shiny and smooth without being oily. I have thick, coarse hair that i straighten daily. This product has immensely helped restore some natural moisture.</li>
    <li> I would recomended to all my friends. It&#x27;s the best hair product that I have try in my entire life. Leave your hair so smooth, silky and easy to mannage that you will love it too. The process of shipping was excellent and fast. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is fine, thin and wavy.  These products make my hair feel soft and conditioned without being over conditioned and limp!  A little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t need to use much so the large size is a great value.</li>

    <li> My Hair was dry from coloring it and using the flat iron everyday. I could feel the difference after just one use. After I used it and blow dried my hair I noticed my hair did not look as frizzy as it did in the past which meant using the flat iron less. I use it with the oil. After using the shampoo and conditioner you can comb your hair very easilly right out of the shower, no tangles! Also smells great, but all Matrix products smell great. It was a great deal and with free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> So impressed with this shampoo and conditioner! I have fine curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells so nice!</li>
    <li> Smells good and gets a good lather.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It did not weigh my hair down or make it greasy but it definitely took care of the frizzies that I get after blow drying my hair!</li>
    <li> Great product at a fabulous price.</li>
    <li> Th Exquisite Oil is the best in Shampoo / conditioner since sliced bread!  They leave my hair shiny, soft and manageable.

    <li> Wonderful buy I usually purchase these at the salon but the price here was so much better. I love the product and it makes my hair so soft. Would recommend this to all that want soft hair.</li>

    <li> Biolage delivers.  No matter which of the line of products you choose, they are all just outstanding.  My hair is always soft, manageable, and smells really nice.  Biolage has a clean scent in all its products.  This is by far one of the best i have ever used.  Don&#x27;t let the name Exquisite Oil fool you.  It is neither oily or sticky.  It really softens the hair.  Makes it really manageable, even though mine is short..its shiny, clean smelling and really nice to tough...</li>
    <li> i like that it is available in prime an di like this product a lot</li>
    <li> I have used this product  before and was not able to get from JCPenny where I bought originally. Ulta was more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo only takes a small amount and I really like the conditioner, which is more of a reconstructive product. Both are great. i will order from this company again. I kept their business card that came with my order. The order was fast and products less expensive for the same product elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shampoo and conditioner ever.  Smells great, works great.  Leaves your hair very easy to manage.  This conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat and unmanageable like most conditioners do.  Lots of body and very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Very nice smoothens my hair!! its a great product , works well and worth the money . It actually works for all hair types</li>
    <li> Originally my hairdresser used this on my hair. I knew right away I loved this. My hair was very dry and straw like. These products made all the difference. Do not have those issues anymore. Made my hair shine  and much more manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biolage for years.  And by years, I mean at least the last 20 years.  What I can say about the company is that they have great products that work for essentially all hair types, they clean well and they don&#x27;t build up on your hair.  I&#x27;ve never in 20 years had build up in my hair and let me tell you, I have to use some serious hair product sometimes because my hair is really fine, but full.  Basically, it will just hang lifeless if I don&#x27;t do something with it involving &amp;#34;product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had to go onto the Biolage website to figure out which one of their latest lines would work best for my hair because they do have a few to choose from.  I think any of them could work, but I was getting a little confused about which one to use.  Do I use the one for limp hair, colored hair, heat treated hair, or all three?  ugh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went on the site and found the Exquisite Oil line, which is their &amp;#34;all hair types&amp;#34; selection &amp; decided to give that one a try.  Wow!  I don&#x27;t think my hair has ever felt so smooth and non-fly away-ish... if that is a word or combo of words that makes sense.  The only down side is that my hair is fine (like I mentioned before), so I do have to dirty it up to get it to stick with a style or hold a curl.  Regardless of that, I love this particular shampoo &amp; condition from Biolage &amp; hope they keep this one around for quite a while.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
