<li> Wrong.</li>
<li> I was however, quite disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was a lot better than I though.  My 60 yr. old skin responded well, soft and moisturized yet clean.  I was impressed as I have been using expensive Kinerase products for years and this was just as good.  However, the line is not that inexpensive, beware it can add up when u purchase other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Using this for several weeks now and very happy with it. Light scent, creamy low foam with a great texture.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Juara products.  They leave my skin clean, rejuvenated and never irritate my sensitive skin.  Give the line a try!</li>
    <li> So far I really like this. It is gentle and great to use.</li>
    <li> After reading the previous reviews about this facial cleanser, I was excited to try it.  I was however, quite disappointed.  For me, the fragrance is nothing special.  It is not offensive, but neither did I find it soothing nor refreshing.  More importantly, after washing my face with this product, my face felt tight and dry.  It did not feel soft.  It felt no different than washing my face with a regular bar of soap.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. My skin actually got worse after using it. If you naturally have good skin, then I can see it being beneficial. However, if you have oily skin this product does not work very well. I bought it because I saw a lot of good reviews, but it did not work the same for me. I have stopped using it and am looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money that I spent on it. Every time I use this product, it has left my face feeling soft and clean, and it smells good. I use this during my busy schedule throughout the week. I have seen improvements on the overall health of my skin(I have normal to oily skin). One drop of this stuff goes a long way; it has lasted me for several months now. Afterwards, I feel a little bit dry, but not too much. I would suggest using a light moisturizer with it. I&#x27;m not one to use a lot of moisturizer, so this cleanser is the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; for me. Usually, I can get away with using only this product and still feel moisturized at the end of my work day, depending on if it was sunny all day.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that you don&#x27;t need much when you use it. It smells very nice and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I tend to prefer natural products or items that are good for the environment. It&#x27;s maybe not 100 % pure but I would definately buy this product again. I think I received it the very next day!</li>
    <li> I had seen it on a website, so figured to purchase and see what the good news was about. Wrong. This product is horrid. I would have better success washing my face with dish soap. It dried me and was not easy to lather, use, rinse. Just yuck &amp; it will be getting returned.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I refrain from becoming overjoyed when I tried a new product because I am usually disappointed in a day or two. This cleanser has been helping my skin to improve in color and texture since the first use. I have had it three days now and I wash my face morning and night. I use the Juara Rice Cleanser with my Mia2 face cleanser tool. I have black heads that have been there for years starting to disappear after only 3 days. I started using the two products the Juara and the Mia2 at the same time, so I can not attribute it to one product. I have had to use very thick heavy creams because of eczema which causes the black heads. This cleanser smells only very lightly like rice pudding, just a sweet rice scent, which is very very light. It is creamy and goes on well. The only down side is the pump. It only moves about 1/4 of an inch so I get a pea size amount out with each pump. I use 4 pumps to wash my face. I would prefer a pump that dispenses more. My perpetual redness is almost completely gone, even after just washing I am barely flushed. My husband has noticed my skin is not red and had said it feel soft. I used to avoid wearing makeup because it looks so bad on dry cracked and flaking skin. The combination of this cleanser and the Mia2 have worked for me. Just mentioning that I use both of these because I do not know if its just the right combination for my skin or if one is doing all the work but to finally have a non prescription product that is fairly priced that works is a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for dry skin</li>
    <li> This cleanser is non-drying to the skin, yet removes very last trace of makeup. The amount needed for each use is minimal, so the bottle is well worth the price. Most importantly, this cleanser has not agitated my acne in anyway and I have saw an overall improvement in the condition of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I had recently purchased an exfoliant from another company which began to give me pimples (take it I don&#x27;t get pimples) purchased this product and my face went back to normal. It even gets rid of blackheads. Love it</li>
    <li> Love it makes your skin feel silky and smooth</li>
    <li> Second time re-purchasing this cleanser. it&#x27;s amazing in removing all your make-up like waterproof mascara, leaves your face feeling very clean and soft. I highly recommend this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 weeks, and I love it. I have sensitive skin and did not break out at all.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it for about a month and I really love it. I have extremely sensitive skin and am prone to break outs but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It smells lovely and help keep my face and neck feeling clean and moisturized. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it, face feels like it been moisturized after cleansing. Good value for the money commpared to other products. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it, my face feels so clean everytime i use it</li>
