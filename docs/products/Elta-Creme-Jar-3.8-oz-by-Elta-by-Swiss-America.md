      <li>Have found better pricing from local outlets.  </li>
      <li>great for my extremely dry skin, especially in the winter season.</li>
      <li>We live in a very dry climate, but this cream just sat on top of my skin!  </li>
      <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t sting and is not as greasy as pure petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>This is cream is very silky.</li>
      <li>This creme has really helped with this problem.  </li>
      <li>DID NOT HELP MUCH.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazone  for offering all Elta&#x27;s creams.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t sting and is not as greasy as pure petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> Best cream for very dry skin, I love Elta products. Thanks Amazone  for offering all Elta&#x27;s creams.</li>
    <li> I use it for my face and neck. It literally melts in your skin and keeps it supple. So glad that a M.D. recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> I discovered this cream many years ago and I have been using it ever since.  I have dry, sensitive skin.  (Or had.). I could not use commerical face creams because they burned and/or caused me to have a terrible rash.  Elta is perfect for me though.  It makes my skin glow and feel soft, and I have never had any irritation.  It is very difficult to find in stores, so I am grateful it sells on Amazon.  I always have two jars, though each jar lasts a long time.  This way I never run out.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft! Fyi, it only takes a tiny bit. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great Quality.  Makes Great Gift for special friends.  This can&#x27;t be purchased just everywhere.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom who is a diabetic... and have found it to be GREAT for usage during the dry winter months in Texas when skin needs a little extra help.  And with this particular creme... a little goes a long long way.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> this is the real stuff you need when u have dry skin problems...this is melting conditione,and results are superb results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used elta body moisturizer for several years and I love it! It glides on and melts into your skin. Then it continues to moisturize for hours! At first it feels a little like melted butter but it makes your skin so soft in a hurry!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I orginally was given a sample that sat at my office desk for 6 months, it was my lotion backup when I run out.  I used it and was floored at the results.  I put too much on at first not reading directions (it&#x27;s lotion), and scrounged to save the last little bit till I could get more.  It was heavenly.  Middle of winter 10 degrees out, rough on skin and I immediately searched where to buy.  I put a dab on my nose and then under my eyes, I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t irritate it at all.  Too much leaves it a greasy feel, but excess wipes off easily and still protects.</li>
    <li> i love the price and the crème it self is great and I immediately felt a relief I love the price too I had to pay almost double the price at the hospital pharmacy</li>
    <li> It works very well, but when applied, feels like oil. Best applied when you have time to allow it to absorb well or before going to bed where I won&#x27;t be disturbed.</li>
    <li> A Swiss skin cream that I have used for probably 25 years. A dermatologist gave me some samples years ago to try because my skin was so sensitive and needed the extra moisturizing. It works great and also for sunburn on the face. Only one pharmacy where I used to live carries it after I mentioned that I needed to buy it. It is nice to know that you can buy it on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience.</li>
    <li> It is greasy for a while but it works.</li>
    <li> Great creme for dry skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would! The only draw back is that if you are used to putting on a good \\&quot;dalap\\&quot; of lotion, with Elta, you ONLY need less than a dime sized amount on wheatever you are going to moisturise. I have even used this on my face, and I usually do not use hand/body care products on my face, Elta felt great!</li>
    <li> Our dr suggest this cream for my son&#x27;s eczema. which at the moment was ok but elta was cheaper than pure shea butter(the only thing he can use) so we tried it.... BIG MISTAKE!!!... my son broke in a horrible rash all over. It may work for some but not it is not for my son.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of the Elta MD intense moisturizer which I prefer over this one.  I bought this jar thinking it&#x27;d be about the same and it&#x27;s very &amp;#34;oozy&amp;#34;.  It looks like melty shortening you cook with.  You should not use too much initially.  It feels like rubbing salad or olive oil on your hands but eventually the skin absorbs the slick sensation.  It&#x27;s kinda gross when you initially try it.  It&#x27;s good to use at night or after you&#x27;ve showered to replenish the hydration but I&#x27;d be somewhat hesitant to use it in the daytime before going to work as it leaves a sheen on your face, like an oily film until it&#x27;s absorbed.  Some people might like that shiny face look, as if you&#x27;ve put on sun tanning lotion on at the beach.</li>
    <li> Elta Creme is very effective.  It was recommended to me years ago by a podiastrist.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;d wash my legs and feet then rub in some Elta before wrapping them up in the compression bandages. I&#x27;d been bothered for YEARS with dry, scaly feet and ankles. This stuff softened up the &amp;#34;barnacles&amp;#34; and made my lower legs look (and feel) great again. This rough winter has been hard on my feet, so I got into the little jar I had left from therapy. I&#x27;m glad this is available for purchase w/o having to go through the PT clinic. Rubbing it into my legs also helps out my winter-dried hands, too. A little bit goes far.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff ROCKS!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend who works outside on a daily basis and has extremely dry skin to begin with,  that by the end of the day his facial skin would be peeling and so dry it would crack.  he has been using this crème for 2weeks and what a difference it has made in how his skin looks not to mention how he says it feels.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this and that it works so well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (or its equivalent - petrolatum\Vaseline) for 50 years - morning and night, and it works!  I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my skin. Now that I&#x27;m almost 70, I&#x27;m told I have the skin of a 40-something year old. I&#x27;m convinced that petrolatum works like saran wrap - trapping moisture in the skin, preventing evaporation.  About 10 years ago I discovered this elta product, which I use for the morning application of petrolatum because it&#x27;s lighter.&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS.  Here&#x27;s how I use it in the morning.  I rub a little dab of elta between my palms and pat the &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; elta onto my face and neck, let it air dry for 2 minutes (good time to blow dry hair), use a towel to gently blot closed eyelids (I wear eye makeup), apply concealer, foundation, powder.&lt;br /&gt;CAVEAT.  Beautiful skin requires more than any one product can provide.  It helps to have good nutrition, adequate sleep, lots of liquids, sun protection, and a happy heart.  Still, good products - like this one - DO help.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It helps keep my scar tissue down.  Received the product very fast.  Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Elta Creme was recommended by my husband&#x27;s Wound Nurses so I bought the Pound jar. It works well on dry skin and I bought the elta Swiss Skin Creme for myself and use it daily. It has a different texture than I am used to since it&#x27;s not a lotion but a compressed compound that is oily to the touch which I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like but it absorbs into dry skin fairly quickly and is keeping my skin soft. Recommended to all those who have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin &amp; a friend said her dr. recommended this after a procedure.  I accidentally ordered a larger size too, so I&#x27;ve used as a body crème - just have to be a little careful about sitting on furniture until it absorbs, but that doesn&#x27;t take long. One of the few things I can use &amp; not wake up with my face feeling dry &amp; tight.</li>
    <li> Feels just like vaseline.  Doesn&#x27;t absorb or  seem to work at all.  I put it on at night, and in the am my hands feel dry.</li>
    <li> I have had serious wounds on my legs requiring medical attention.  After using several product to help keep my legs moist, elta is the onlt one I now use and am very thankful.</li>
    <li> This was the greasiest stuff I have ever encountered.  It was like vaseline mixed with mineral oil, and it did nothing for my skin except make a mess.  Was not worth the hassle to mail it back, so I threw it out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful. The nurse at foot care uses it so I ordered some and love it!!! I will order it again</li>
    <li> Love it.  It does what it says - melts into your skin, moisturizing skin anywhere on the body.  Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smooth, melty and fragrance free.  My dermatologist recommended this to me and it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have eczema, and while this doesn&#x27;t treat it, it does feel a lot better than regular name-brand lotions.</li>
    <li> This does just as it says, melts into skin and you do not need very much at all.  I use a round container of tru blue shea butter from bath and body and love that too.  This is less expensive and equal in use.</li>
    <li> This is cream is very silky. It stays will you all day. It worked well with my sensitive  skin, but the container is small wish their was more.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well for my husband&#x27;s flaky skin - it&#x27;s awesome.  It had been recommended to us initially by our home health care nurse who was treating diabetic wounds on my husband&#x27;s legs/feet.  And we won&#x27;t be without it now.  Using it every other day keeps his legs scale free.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years as a face cleanser and moisturizer, I have several allergies including fragrance so there are numerous products that I am unable to use. This is by far the best!</li>
    <li> My wife is 75 and she loves that it gives her the skin she remembers from when she was in her 30&#x27;s.  Why is not everyone using it?  She thanked me for it and she normally doesn&#x27;t approve of anything from the computer.</li>
    <li> This cream was prescribed by the wound clinic.  The problem was dry skin as well as open blisters caused by poor circulation. There was noticeable improvement after the very first application.  The cream melts on applying, and a little goes a long way.  It is fragrance free and does not appear to stain fabric. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> great for my extremely dry skin, especially in the winter season. it was recommended by my dermatologist and i like it a lot</li>
    <li> This cream had been recommended to my husband for his dry feet.  I started using it and love it, provides so much  moisture.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several months and find it is a great buy.  Have found better pricing from local outlets.  Great product; however, it is oily.</li>
    <li> My Doctor gave me a sample of this product to treat a persistent problem with dry skin on my feet.  ELTA applications have solved the problem where ordinary lotions did not.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very good item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Elta cream for at least ten years and love it.  The only thing about my recent purchase which I hope was a fluke, was the consistency of the cream.  While the cream is advertised as a &amp;#34;melting moisturizer&amp;#34;, the consistency of my recent purchase was watery.  Usually it is more solid, but melts on contact.  I&#x27;m still using this jar and plan to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be my new go-to moisturizer bit it really is very petroleum-like (one of the ingredients) and too oily for me but I&#x27;ll use it and see, I have an open mind.</li>
    <li> Great for severe wounds !!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mother would has problems with extremely dry, irritated skin around her ankles. She reported that she loves the product. She applies it in the evening and lets it absorb while she watches television. It glides on easily and a little bit goes a long way. I have every intention of buying a larger size when she starts to run low.</li>
    <li> The elta Swiss Skin Creme is the best moisturizer I have found.  It has no fragrance, and is amazingly hydrating.  It&#x27;s also amazingly hard to find.  Maybe because it&#x27;s a little pricy no local retail outlets carry it regularly.  I found it at a local drug store two times in over 5 years.  I&#x27;m happy to have found a place to purchase it on line.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It is creamy and smooth, but seems to just be like other petroleum jellies otherwise.  Pretty container is attractive to leave on the counter.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having used a sample from a doctor&#x27;s office. As someone who works  with small children, I am constantly washing my hands. I use the cream once a day and no matter how many times I wash my hands, they remain soft. Most creams and lotions disappear after the first washing. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> We live in a very dry climate, but this cream just sat on top of my skin!  It did not melt or soak in, and my skin felt even drier when I finally wiped the grease off.  What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Elta cream is the best for helping to releive my dry skin problems</li>
    <li> Petrolatum, Paraffin, &amp; PVP/Eicosene Copolymer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum &#x3D; Vaseline&lt;br /&gt;Paraffin &#x3D; candles (makes it melt)&lt;br /&gt;PVP/Eicosene Copolymer &#x3D; good for skin, etc.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Elta by my dermatologist and am now hooked for life!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have an autoimmune disease which causes very dry skin and in addition live in a very dry area of the U.S.  This creme has really helped with this problem.  It is a bit greasy when applied, but melts right into the skin.</li>
    <li> It has helprd a lot, without it I would not have come this far in my recovery. Thanks fro having it on your site, it is real hard to find where I live.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ahhh-mazing!</li>
    <li> Love the cream, not oily, my skin really absorbs it. Received it promptly.  Will buy again and keep a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED IT FOR MY DRY SKIN. MY ARMS ARE EXPOSED TO WIND AND SUN WHILE WORKING IN MY GARDEN. DID NOT HELP MUCH. BUT FOR  REMOVING MAKEUP -IT IS WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> Very good creme recommended by podiatry clinic</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I had some from my motherinlaw several years ago and thought it was great. Refound the brand and had a heck of a time finding anyone who sold the product. Found it on Amazon with the price being not to bad. I love it for my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> My wife bought a container of this from the doctor and loved it. So I had to find more. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician recommmended this for our kids with dry skin. (A dermatologist had recommended it to her)  This goes on slick and easy....like a solid oil.  Wonderful glow for little faces.  We LOVE this and put it all over our skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a physician after suffering with cellulitis that left my leg rough, scaly and very itchy. After 1 month of using it twice a day, my skin is smooth and soft once again. It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Large dry skin patches, blood red in color, both hands.  After using for about 3 weeks twice daily patches cleared up. The melting action keeps the mostiure from leaving the skin, Where other treatments add mostiure or cream. Those products had no results</li>
    <li> A[[ASIN:B0011E2RTQ Elta Creme Tube 2.8 oz by Elta]]nyone with touchy hands - will love this product. I can not use dish detergents and most hand soaps - this keeps my hands from itching and breaking out. Wash your hands and use just a dab while your hands are still slightly wet. It will dry with the cream and your hands will feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love it. Was introduced to it 4 years ago and have been looking for it since.  I purchased it at Walgreens and when I went to purchase it last year,  they said it was no longer available.</li>
    <li> This creme is great. I could tell a difference in my skin after one use. A little on the greasy side but if you rub in extra well it is much better. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic with extremely dry feet and legs. It is crucial for me to keep them lubricated so the skin does not break down which has happened to me before.  This is the only creme that really lubricates and keeps them from cracking.</li>
    <li> Excellent for over night use.  This is more like an ointment than a crème.  It really dose melt!  This process, in my opinion makes this product way too greasy to use during the day, but overnight with or without gloves does a great job of rehydrating the skin.</li>
    <li> Miracle creme!!! I have used this for many years on my children&#x27;s diaper rash. Our pediatrician suggested it, long with some other things, to protect their little bottoms when they got horrible diaper rash. The rash was so bad that the skin was actually gone and when using this product to seal odd the skin and protect it the diaper rash improved literally over night!! I will not be caught without at least one jar of Elta Creme, miracle creme, at my house!!</li>
    <li> It is so different than all the other &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; products that I have tried, that I was amazed at its effectiveness.  It puts all the other lotions and creams to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it on the recommendation of the vascular surgeon providing wound care for skin problems on my lower legs. I am diabetic with poor circulation in my legs leading to dry, weakened skin that easily blisters and forms sores, so moisturizing and healing my skin is critical.  Elta is the one product that does it and it is light and clean feeling and with the least amount of product used! It takes very little and twice a day is more than adequate to make a noticeable difference in the texture and strength of my skin.  Multiple applications of extra strength Lubriderm, Vaseline, Cocoa Butter, etc lotions don&#x27;t give near the results, and are &#x27;sticky&#x27; with short term effects at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only places I have found to buy it are the hospital pharmacy and online, but it is so worth making the effort!</li>
