      <li>This is okay, but I wonder if they changed the formula because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it used to.</li>

      <li>Its ok</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>lovely scent and</li>

      <li>I was glad i bought this for her</li>
      <li>I have made it through two bottles and believe I see a difference, so I&#x27;m sure its working.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than before</li>
      <li>Wish it smelled more like cocoa butter</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>it expect better results over time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping to find this in a after shower gel :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just want to say how glad we as a family about palmers cocoa better eventone, the right product for our skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over an year and it has become my primary body lotion.</li>
      <li>Uneven skin tone is probably the best use for this product, the skin on my back,stomach, arms, and legs has evened dramatically.</li>
      <li>This cream is a light consistency.</li>
      <li>Thanks Palmers!!!.</li>
      <li>The original scent ...&lt;</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the first application and it keeps getting better.</li>
      <li>considering I did opt for amazon&#x27;s free super saving shipping</li>
      <li>and this one is actually quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>This may be a special situation</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy so many bottles or so much of an order ro receive, I contemplated buying them from, yuck,</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say this however: I use a generous amount and do it full body.</li>
      <li>I have come full circle with this purchase because I used to always feel cocoa butter</li>
      <li>MOIST ALL DAY AND KEEPS ME SMELLING CLEAN AND FRESH.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and helps with my hyperpigmented areas of my skin.</li>
      <li>I have it on subscribe and save because I go through it so quickly.</li>
      <li>I think it will be more time for a satisfied review on the marks, but this product does what it says it will do, and is only 6.00 and some change at Walmart per bottle.</li>
      <li>It is very cheap and uses natural ingredients to even out your skin tone.</li>
      <li>good lotion if you want a smooth skin with a little glow.</li>
      <li>I used this in addition to Palmers \\&quot;Skin Success</li>
      <li>Still early days but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Saw results right away, which I figured I would because I&#x27;ve always had success with Palmer&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
      <li>especially new marks will lighten up to disappear into almost nothing.</li>
      <li>I wish it smelled more like regular cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>Another plus for the Eventone is the ingredients are mostly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;; soy protein, various fruit extract, citric acid, etc,.</li>
      <li>This product requires continous use for you to be able to see proper results.</li>
      <li>She applies the Palmer Eventone Body Milk first, massages for 10min.</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>Being darker or more tanned doesn&#x27;t bother me, but age spots are coming more common.</li>
      <li>I certainly would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
      <li>I want to go through the whole bottle &amp; then maybe update.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I am very picky</li>
      <li>E blend together very well.</li>
      <li>Fast</li>
      <li>It has really improved the texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>It will take longer than 3 months I feel, to see real results.&lt;br /&gt;Bought 3. will update</li>
      <li>I like it very nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another fact is that this product doesnt have Hydroquinone like most other products.</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks,  my skin is looking much better and the dark marks are fading.</li>
      <li>It may be too soon to tell, but so far it seems to be working pretty well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Generally a good experience with the purchase and the cream was good for my skin. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Evens skin tone as indicated.</li>
    <li> Nice scent,keeps my skin silky all day and I see I slight glow</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, smells okay..results okay. Nothing to write home about. Results vary depends on skin type.  Product  is a little sticky doesn&#x27;t totally absorb without residue..</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. I pair it with Palmers fade soap bar &amp; Palmers fade cream for my face elbows knees etc. Saw improvement in like 4 days.</li>
    <li> Wish it smelled more like cocoa butter but it&#x27;s still a good lotion.</li>
    <li> Ordered..items were delivered on time..items were as expected..good lotion if you want a smooth skin with a little glow.</li>
    <li> Works very well. My face is starting to get even. I used to have a two tone, light on the inside of the face, around the nose, between the eyebrows and chin and dark around the forehead and outer cheeks. i love what it is doing to my face now. The best part is that it does not lighten!!</li>
    <li> I have made it through two bottles and believe I see a difference, so I&#x27;m sure its working. But I&#x27;ll know for sure once I get through 3 and 4 lol....and much cheaper than in the stores. Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy so many bottles or so much of an order ro receive, I contemplated buying them from, yuck, Walmart Online just bc I don&#x27;t hv to order 4 for them to ship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle.  Without getting too wordy, that should say it all :).</li>
    <li> Nice on my wife smells good and affordable. I like it very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Palmers do good products and never dissapoint.</li>
    <li> I do like this lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t fade dark spots as much as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> Lightening the black spot on face though not completely but it&#x27;s better than before</li>
    <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would. It is easily the best (therapeutic) lotion or skin treatment I have ever used. I am sure the results vary according to the reason for the discoloration. I have an agonizing inflammatory condition that affects my skin as well as my joints and it is wildly  reactive to environmental factors. It is much worse when I garden or work outdoors. I noticed a difference after the first application and it keeps getting better. The results have been quite dramatic. I still have some areas of inflammation; however my skin is much smoother and has actually begun to glow. My skin has NEVER glowed before. Not once. I hope they never change this formula.</li>
    <li> good product but Has no sunscreen protection thus does not protect against sun damages. smooth on the skin and good mosturizer</li>
    <li> I did not really notice a difference, and I use other Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> great buy, love it, my skin look nice</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Absorbs quickly and helps with my hyperpigmented areas of my skin. Too bad the pump doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll just have to transfer it to a jar.</li>
    <li> Its ok but I dont care for the smell. I wish it smelled more like regular cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> Im seeing some improvements, I got a bottle at walmart a month ago and I was seeing a little bit of a diffrence , but its to soon to tell, I have a lot of issues with scarring , sun spots ( from not wearing sun screen when I was in the sun) and acne markings and I thought this would be a good product to get. I&#x27;ve been trying to succesfuly treat these problems for about 3 years now , the marking had faded, but, i want them completely gone. Ill update and take photos of the probem areas and take some more pic in about 5 months you can see the results.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and scent of this product. I alternate between this and Lactic acid body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft and appears healthier but I am not sure of a real change in eveness.&lt;br /&gt;My elbows and knees are still the same. It will take longer than 3 months I feel, to see real results.&lt;br /&gt;Bought 3. will update</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just want to say how glad we as a family about palmers cocoa better eventone, the right product for our skin.</li>
    <li> Just a breeze of this lotion around makes the room smell good. I was glad i bought this for her</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, lived up to it&#x27;s description. I absolutely recommend this lotion to anyone with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I am starting to see improvement in my skin tone so I hope it continues.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my skin from being dry, but did not do anything to make skin tone even so i will not buy again</li>
    <li> This cream is a light consistency. Its not ideal for the winter months but its definitely nice for summer. I give it a 3 star because I like all purpose creams as silly as that might sound.</li>
    <li> I saw results on my 2nd bottle of Palmers body milk. Marks old, and new, but especially new marks will lighten up to disappear into almost nothing. Uneven skin tone is probably the best use for this product, the skin on my back,stomach, arms, and legs has evened dramatically. I think it will be more time for a satisfied review on the marks, but this product does what it says it will do, and is only 6.00 and some change at Walmart per bottle. My knees are also about 3 shades lighter almost blending in with my natural skin tone. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying, but if you do plan to go through at least 2 bottles, maybe even 3 before you truly see some results and be consistent. Use day and night.</li>
    <li> I have hyperpigmentation and have struggled to find a good product to gradually fade discolorations. I have come full circle with this purchase because I used to always feel cocoa butter just did not work. Well, this is a great product and it keeps my skin moisturized as it evens my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing.  I am not sure if it has even my toned or helped with my stretch marks, but I have been using it since I was pregnant (my son will be 2 in Dec) and my skin looks and feels like velvet.  It smells nice and is thick but not oily at all.  I am very picky (esp. post baby) about smells and this one is actually quite pleasant.  The Amazon price for this stuff is great!  I have it on subscribe and save because I go through it so quickly.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice daily for over 6 weeks and saw no visible improvement to my discolored areas, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the issue with the Palmer&#x27;s company over the last few years or so but I&#x27;m not impressed with any of the products they have to offer even their staple Cocoa butter lotion does nothing to lighten the appearance of old scars and such! Save yourself the time and money and look into something else. I still haven&#x27;t found my &#x27;go to&#x27; product yet but I&#x27;m still searching.</li>
    <li> No difference between this and any other lotion. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> it really made my skin so soft and lightened my sun spots! Thank you for such a great product! My sister loves it as well and we cannot find this in any store, so i make sure to order her a bottle as well.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOTION.IT KEEPS MY BODY MOIST ALL DAY AND KEEPS ME SMELLING CLEAN AND FRESH. NICE I WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about weeks I have notice a brightness  (Vitamin c) and softness to my skin Palmers has always met my expectations and came through with Eventone it may be a lil heavy during the summer months It was a lil early yay!! considering I did opt for amazon&#x27;s free super saving shipping and it was well packaged I love it expect better results over time I would not recommend this for deep scaring tho....I&#x27;m hoping to find this in a after shower gel :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is doing a great job of fading the skin discoloration issue I&#x27;ve been dealing with.  After a couple of weeks,  my skin is looking much better and the dark marks are fading.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me. It has really improved the texture of my skin. I have been using this product for over an year and it has become my primary body lotion.</li>
    <li> Evenly tones and brightens skin. Great price!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> just started using it . i like the smell . its ok.</li>
    <li> I love the light smell! It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and makes your skin very soft. The only thing I do not like is the packaging. The pump bottle doesn&#x27;t allow for you to get all the lotion out. I have to tip it upside down with the cover off like a ketchup bottle to get it all out.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the smell. Not the typical palmer&#x27;s coco butter smell. Almost like Jergen&#x27;s? The original scent ...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;- Saw results right away, which I figured I would because I&#x27;ve always had success with Palmer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this particular one in stores at all, so i&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from this company again especially because of how fast it came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this however: I use a generous amount and do it full body. I&#x27;ve had it since Sunday (it&#x27;s now Friday) so 5 days, about 2 showers a day - 10 uses and i&#x27;m already a good way through the bottle. BUT because i&#x27;m actually seeing good results I don&#x27;t mind at all if I have to reorder every few weeks.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works really well!</li>
    <li> It may be too soon to tell, but so far it seems to be working pretty well. Being darker or more tanned doesn&#x27;t bother me, but age spots are coming more common. I want to go through the whole bottle &amp; then maybe update. Hopefully it will work great.</li>
    <li> More than meets our needs ! My wife has been using this (3) times a day on a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; surgical scar for the past 10 weeks in addition to genetic Vit. &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; oil (30,000 UI) &amp; having to wear a Silicone Scar sheet for 12 hours/day. She applies the Palmer Eventone Body Milk first, massages for 10min. then applies the Vit. E and massages it on to the scar in for another 10 minutes. The Eventone Body Milk and Vit. E blend together very well. She had try using Gold Bond Ultimate Hydrating Lotion for Diabetics&#x27; Dry Skin, which she was using regularly on her arms and legs because she does have dry skin, but the Gold Bond was too heavy, making it difficult to blend/massage the Vit. E on the scar. This may be a special situation but it works! After reading the Ingredients label on both, she has stopped using the Gold Bond &amp; continue to use the Eventone. Another plus for the Eventone is the ingredients are mostly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;; soy protein, various fruit extract, citric acid, etc,. READ the Ingredients on both products for yourself &amp; decide for yourself which you want to apply to your skin.</li>
    <li> Always great for my skin.  I love the scent too!</li>
    <li> lovely scent and it works perfect</li>
    <li> This is okay, but I wonder if they changed the formula because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it used to.</li>
    <li> Still early days but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This product requires continous use for you to be able to see proper results. It is very cheap and uses natural ingredients to even out your skin tone. I used this in addition to Palmers \\&quot;Skin Success Even body milk\\&quot; for about two months. Maybe about 2 bottles of each with some baby oil. I also used the face fade cream after I exfoliated my skin and cleanse properly. I have since continously used it for the past 4 months. And my skin is glowing. I get compliments on my skin all the time. Use day and night after a shower and apply a lot of suncreen. I used an SPF 70+.. My skin is like 3 shades lighter than it was more even more radiant. Other products that have similar ingrdients are twice or three times the price of this and are less effective or very harsh on my skin. I am an African american and this works just fine for me. I look better than I ever did. I had terrible uneven skin tone from excessive sun exposure. I do a lot of out door activities because I love physical fitness and My skin was terrible from unimaginable sun damage from not wearing sunscreen. Thanks Palmers!!!. Continue doing what you are doing. Another fact is that this product doesnt have Hydroquinone like most other products. It uses another form of skin lightening ingredient called Synovea.. All I can say about this is awesomeness. !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about 2 months and I have noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s clarity. I certainly would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for it to work.  It does not stay on your skin as most lotions do, but I will continue to use it.</li>
