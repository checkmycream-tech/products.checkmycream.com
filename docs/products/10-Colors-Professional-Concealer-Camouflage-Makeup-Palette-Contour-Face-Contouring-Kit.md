      <li>Awesome I needed my items before April 25th for a wedding as I am a Freelance Makeup Artist</li>

      <li>Works good for contouring and concealing.</li>

      <li>I look cute with it on lol</li>
      <li>I really like this palette.it fits perfect on my skin</li>
      <li>however I find that it offers the perfect amount of coverage.</li>
      <li>I love it and will order again.</li>
      <li>If you want a better quality contour kit, I suggest this: http://goo.gl/qYSwID  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love this set and will buy again.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like a creamy oily product</li>
      <li>so I was worried for my medium to light skin, but when applied correctly they blend beautifully and do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>These are extremely creamy and easy to blend which is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it came very quick</li>
      <li>its easy to blend</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light and comes with easy to follow instructions on contouring</li>
      <li>I got it pretty fast which I was happy about.</li>
      <li>Super excited to try this out though!</li>
      <li>I LIKED IT BECAUSE IT IS CREAMY AND IS DOING VERY WELL</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap and costume-like</li>
      <li>Very pigmented love it</li>
      <li>Really settled in the fine lines, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic and you don’t have to worry about being new to full contouring techniques because for the price you can try it all with this one.  </li>
      <li>Even for my own warm toned skin when contouring, these shades are very grey and very similar to one another.</li>
      <li>which is what every woman wants when she is waiting for makeup am I right?!  </li>
      <li>The colors are great but the coverage is not very good.</li>
      <li>a strong white shade to it .</li>
      <li>And is very greasy</li>
      <li>It might not work very well with oily skin.</li>
      <li>Its not worth it, you&#x27;d be better off buying a REAL concealer.</li>
      <li>I would spend a few extra dollars on better quality next time.</li>
      <li>Easy to blend and not too thick.</li>
      <li>Also, some of the colors seem dark at first glance</li>
      <li>and it offers enough colors for conturing and to even be used as a foundation all together.</li>
      <li>unfortunately I need all the camouflage I can get, this is a nice set and works well</li>
      <li>The darker brown shades are not very dark at all and have a grey undertone when used on darker skin.</li>

<li> Not for black woman makes you look ashy</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
<li> All of the darker brown colors look the same on your skin, and they are a weird, gray-brown color.  </li>
<li> not satisfied with this product.</li>
<li> Sucks !!</li>
<li> The cream is a weird consistency.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not that crazy about it at all.</li>
<li> this product isn&#x27;t so bad</li>
<li> Bad product!</li>
<li> This product is terrible.</li>

    <li> Disappointedm None matched me</li>
    <li> Awesome I needed my items before April 25th for a wedding as I am a Freelance Makeup Artist and it arrived on time product is awesome as well</li>
    <li> Bad product! I found some dust on the palates. I feel I just wast my money.</li>
    <li> Not the best coverage!</li>
    <li> Love this. Easy to blend and not too thick.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I expected it would</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PLATTE!!!, I read reviews before purchasing a lot of people spoke about the product being to greasy however I find that it offers the perfect amount of coverage. I only have to apply product once a day and it offers enough colors for conturing and to even be used as a foundation all together. I love it and will order again.</li>
    <li> Very oily ..and not much coverage :/ not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> It is good to work with</li>
    <li> I LIKED IT BECAUSE IT IS CREAMY AND IS DOING VERY WELL WITH  MY SKIN TYPE .</li>
    <li> The pallet works well</li>
    <li> I really like this palette.it fits perfect on my skin</li>
    <li> I jist hope when i receive this order today it works well.cant wait to receive it</li>
    <li> The darker brown shades are not very dark at all and have a grey undertone when used on darker skin. Even for my own warm toned skin when contouring, these shades are very grey and very similar to one another. Do not buy if you need versatile shades for darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> I Got This So i Can Start Contouring,  But Too Orange And The Pigment Of The Product Sucks !!</li>
    <li> Really settled in the fine lines, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your time. All of the darker brown colors look the same on your skin, and they are a weird, gray-brown color.  The cream is a weird consistency. It does not conceal blemishes.  I would spend a few extra dollars on better quality next time.</li>
    <li> its easy to blend but it&#x27;s more like a creamy oily product so I&#x27;m not that crazy about it at all.</li>
    <li> This would have gotten give stars if the colors were the same as the picture, it was close enough. I got it pretty fast which I was happy about. Super excited to try this out though!</li>
    <li> Not for black woman makes you look ashy don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> unfortunately I need all the camouflage I can get, this is a nice set and works well</li>
    <li> A bit oily but that works for me.  I love this set and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Color was very different from picture,concealer has a odd gray tone it it!!! And is very greasy&lt;br /&gt;but dilivery was Correct n actually came sooner then expected. ..i emailed company once n they responded in a timely matter so communication was Excellent</li>
    <li> this product isn&#x27;t so bad it&#x27;s cheap and costume-like but I guess you get what you pay for . Had to mix color to get as close to my skin tone as possible . I am a caramel complexion so pretty hard , because the colors seems to all&lt;br /&gt;Have a strong white shade to it . I uses it for correcting my eyebrows !</li>
    <li> Very pigmented love it</li>
    <li> It might not work very well with oily skin. If you want a better quality contour kit, I suggest this: http://goo.gl/qYSwID  it&#x27;s light and comes with easy to follow instructions on contouring</li>
    <li> It basically based off wax. Its not worth it, you&#x27;d be better off buying a REAL concealer.</li>
    <li> Works good just a bit oily</li>
    <li> The colors are great but the coverage is not very good. It&#x27;s quite oily. I would not buy again nor recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for contouring</li>
    <li> I like this palette because it has plenty of variety.  Plus, it came very quick which is what every woman wants when she is waiting for makeup am I right?!  These are extremely creamy and easy to blend which is wonderful.  The price is fantastic and you don’t have to worry about being new to full contouring techniques because for the price you can try it all with this one.  This is a great palette to learn how to apply and contour the face.  Also, some of the colors seem dark at first glance so I was worried for my medium to light skin, but when applied correctly they blend beautifully and do exactly what they are supposed to do.  For me it stays on the face well, but toward the end of the day I tend to fell a bit oily.  To be fair I have a tendency to get oily in my T-zone so that may just add to it.</li>
    <li> Works good for contouring and concealing.</li>
    <li> I like it but its oily and none of the colors realy actually match my skin. But I figured out how I could use it an I look cute with it on lol</li>
    <li> Must buy! Every girl need this palette!</li>
