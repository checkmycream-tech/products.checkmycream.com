    <li> I am disappointed in this.  It needs a different pump.  It takes several pumps and there still isn&#x27;t as much lather as I&#x27;d like, but wonderful clean smell. A taller pump would work much better.  Have to love the smell!</li>
    <li> Perfect for showering before using Pecksniff&#x27;s Dry Body Oil.</li>
    <li> I am a vanilla addict.  I love that sweet clean smell.  So when I ordered this I expected a nice blend of that spicy sandalwood and that sweet clean scent of vanilla - but all I got was overwhelming sandalwood. I think this would smell great on a guy and it&#x27;s nice if that&#x27;s what you like, but I was looking for more vanilla to it.  It&#x27;s a good wash, nice to my skin, but doesn&#x27;t really have the consistency I like since I have used bodywash as shave gel before, this is a bit too thin for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a good product for many out there, and I will use the entire bottle (boy you get a lot of bang for your buck with this one) but I will not be ordering myself a second bottle once this runs out.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it - the scent is wonderful, and it is non-drying.  I was having skin problems using other products, but now am happy to say am problem free.</li>
    <li> Nice earthy scent and moderate lather, we like it.</li>
    <li> The shower gel leaves your skin feeling fresh and a feeling of smooth silky skin all over. Excellent!!</li>
    <li> Super Nice!  Only a small amount needed and fragrance is outstandingly clean.  I discovered this product by using some Pecksniff Handwash that the prior owner of my home left behind.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS VERY MUCH, NICE CLEAN SMELL AND NOT TOO STRONG. MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THE PACKAGING.  WHEN IT ARRIVED THE SPOUT WAS BROKEN OFF AND THE GEL HAD STARTED TO LEAK OUT, EVERYTHING WAS A LITTLE STICKY FROM THE LEAK. I POURED IT INTO A DIFFERENT CONTAINER.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something scented, keep shopping. This doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and it smells nothing like Sandalwood or Vanilla.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and it is the second time I have purchased it.  It smells wonderful and feels great. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good. Soft and powdery.</li>
    <li> I love it !!!!! I will be ordering more!!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> THIS WAS VERY NICE! I ENJOYED THE SMELL AND IT LEFT SKIN SOFT</li>
    <li> Although the bottle is larger than I can handle in the shower I use it anyway, because of its economical and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  The gel produces is mild fragrant lather that leaves my skin feeling and smelling wonderful.  There is no need to apply lotion afterwards unless you want an extra softening agent for extra-dry skin.  BTW, the lotion is fantastic, and is great to use after daily frequent hand washing.</li>
    <li> I ADORE the smell of this shower gel!  Granted it is more expensive than I would like to pay, but with my first bottle running out, I couldn&#x27;t resist re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash!!  Great smell, moisturizes really well and rinses nicely too.</li>
    <li> more than I anticipated.  absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this gel - the second bottle I have purchased.  I love the fragrance - light but addictive.  Try it and  you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love Pecksniff&#x27;s sandalwood and vanilla bath products and I am not one who cares for the scent of vanilla alone.  Problem one: Pecksniff stop producing the sandalwood/vanilla product. Problem two: The people selling on amazon is way too expensive. I know people need to make a profit but come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret: if you venture into tjmaxx and or marshalls you can find the product for much much less. Example I spent 132.00 for three 33oz bottles of the shower gel, and the shipping was almost the cost one of those bottles of gel.&lt;br /&gt;At the maxx it was 7.99 for the 33oz bottle....you do the math lollll. So I have been hitting the maxx and marshalls and stocking up on what I can find. They also carry the fresia,linen,grapefruit,white orchid.(not all at the same time, but what they get in their various shipments) I have even seen the gel in the glass bottles as well.  So good hunting!</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this shower gel, not to strong, I wish they made a powder in the same scent.</li>
    <li> Love the hand soap, so knew the body wash would be high quality as well.  Very satisfied. Three more words required.</li>
    <li> Love this and everything Pecksniff products they make,my favourite is Sandalwood shower gel,And there Lavender . This outstanding fragrance just Love Love it.To anyone looking for  SANDALWOOD and Lavender ,Powder I find then in TJMAx.In the Spring.March n April.just 7.99 gel and 5.99 powder.</li>
    <li> had bought soap before at much cheaper price and liked it so much for scent and softness, that I bought it at over twice the price I had paid earlier.</li>
    <li> This soap just Smells delicious  and makes me feel so clean,  It lathers well and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite. I also have the hand soap and hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with all of them.</li>
