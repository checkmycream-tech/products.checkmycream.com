      <li>The very first time i used it my scalp tingled and that was a good sign it was working.</li>

      <li>Use it with a plastic cap and hooded dryer for the perfect deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have read many reviews on this product and must say do not believe the ones who grip about the \\&quot;chemicals\\</li>
      <li>, it looked healthy and nourished.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to start off saying that I Love this product.</li>
      <li>Immediately after I rinsed my hair felt stronger, softer and more resiliant.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Deep conditioning is a must for curls and transitioning hair, so this product is wonderful.</li>
      <li>And it beats my favorite Aphogee treatments</li>
      <li>i love how my hair feels after i rinse it out.</li>
      <li>I guess It&#x27;s an ok product if you don&#x27;t mind all that chemicals stuff on your hair.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>and omg, my hair after one use was a healthier texture, had shine and I fell in love.</li>
      <li>Excellent product I use it in a spray bottle mixed with water.</li>
      <li>I am sure it will work.</li>
      <li>I just love</li>
      <li>I just find out about today :)  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;</li>
      <li>Love product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>one of the best deep conditioners ive ever used !!!</li>
      <li>so glad I gave this a try.</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff i came across for very dry over prossessed n over bleached.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products from the fantastic ORS line and this is one of my favourites.</li>
      <li>A couple days afterwards when that moisture level was fully back into my hair, it has never looked more beautiful or felt healthier.</li>
      <li>Every time I use this my hair becomes incredibly soft, great for once a week use or after sun &amp; beach days.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>Follow the directions on the container, it leavess the hair feeling smooth and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>It gives my new growth curls wonderful definition and leaves my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>This is really great for deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>But anyways, this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>[...] &gt;&gt; or for inspiration for  organic --&gt; non-paraben,non-chemicals,non-preservative,non-sulfate,and non-fragrance free herbal shampoo might I recommend  </li>
      <li>I use it about every two weeks and it leaves my hair so nice and soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>The absolute best deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty darn good, almost like a lemony wheat grass scent (even though it&#x27;s a French dressing kind of color).</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, just strong.</li>
      <li>It feels strengthened, my color appears deeper and I am experiencing a significantly reduced amount of shedding and breakage.</li>
      <li>I originally got this for my girlfriend</li>
      <li>I was kind of worried at first because this is the first protein treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be surprised by how non organic alot of this  so called high end products are..if you really want to  grow your hair the best route is to start by watching what stuff you put in your hair, just like you watch what stuff you ingest or put in your mouth.</li>
      <li>Much softer than your hair will actually be when you wash it out, so be warned that even though it feels great on, it will not necessarily be that great when you wash it out.</li>
      <li>Just as expected and works great</li>
      <li>I love the whole hair line.</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad.</li>
      <li>When I straightened my hair it was sooo beautiful, a lot of shine, felt like silk, I had my bounce back,  it was soft and strong</li>
      <li>I leave it in for about an hour or so, and after it&#x27;s dry and styled, my hair feels amazing!</li>
      <li>It has a pretty strong smell, though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok i bought this product at my local CVS it was in the african american hair products. I am spanish with really damaged over bleached hair. I would first like to say i didnt mind the smell. I left it in my hair under a shower cap for 60 min. This was based on the ors web site. I do admit that after using my hair had a greasy feel but didnt leave grease on my hair. My hair felt much softer n smooth. I usually have to blow dry then straiten my hair to make it look smooth. I only had to use this product n air dry. Boom i have soft smooth hair. This is the best stuff i came across for very dry over prossessed n over bleached. No matter your hair type. So if you have over prossessed, dry, or over bleached hair give this product a try. You wont be disapointed.</li>
    <li> I absoulutely prefer this product over any other. Very Smart buy as it totally conditions my hair and scalp leaving it soft and managable.</li>
    <li> OMG i love this stuff! i am white and have platinum blonde bleach hair and this is the best deep conditioner i have ever used! Today was the first time i&#x27;ve ever used it. I left it on for about an hour and a half and when i washed it out my hair felt so soft, smooth, and hydrated. So i was already like HELL YA! When i went to blow dry my hair my brush could go all the way through root to tip. My brush wasn&#x27;t getting caught up in knots and tangles. It has been so long time since i&#x27;ve been able to blow dry my hair and have my brush actually go through my hair. I HAD NO BREAKAGE IN MY BRUSH!!!!! The ends of my hair feel just as nice and the roots of my hair. I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for about 5 years and my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good since i was 16!&lt;br /&gt;The night before i slept with the Organic Roots hair fertilizer in my hair (im also trying to grow my hair out). I have a hair appointment this week for my new growth and will def be bringing this to put in my hair after my bleach retouch. Can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair feels after (:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about buy this trust me, YOU SHOULD BUY IT! like i always say, \\&quot; if the black girls are using it you know its good!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I used this product to do a deep condition on my hard to manage hair. Works great mixed with olive oil, rosemary oil,and few other nourishing oil. Made my hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> i love this product and they have a nice price!</li>
    <li> Being natural, I am looking for product to make my hair easy to comb. I think this is one of them</li>
    <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair (about 8 months now) and I use the ORS Hair Mayo as a deep conditioning/protein treatment and my hair absolutely loves it!! It gives my new growth curls wonderful definition and leaves my hair soft.  Even though it has some ingredients, namely a few &#x27;cones&#x27;, that they recommend we stay away from but I bought it anyway and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> been using this stuff when i started transitioning back to being natural and my hair loves it. However i use it as deep conditioning/protein treatment because of the protein in it. so i only put in about every six weeks but its amazing. i love how my hair feels after i rinse it out.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i tried this, and i absolutely love t, i would not recommend it for people with greasy hair as this formula is somewhat greasy but for my normal hair ( not greasy or dry), it sucks in the nutrients and oils and leaves it very manageable, shining, love the smell, couldnt ask for more, i will definitely use this product weekly!</li>
    <li> I got a knock off version....yea..i didnt really send it back bc for me i couldnt handle that mess at that time and i needed SOMETHING so i just used it...it kinda worked the same but, eh</li>
    <li> I received this from Perfumania with some perfume samples enclosed.  I have only used this product once.  My hair was quite soft after I used it.  The other claims I cannot comment on yet.  However, I can say that my hair felt healthy after I used it.</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair and I dont get hair treatments at the salon too often. This product is better than any treatment that you can get at a salon!</li>
    <li> okey so I used too use this stuff before on my hair I guess you might say I was sold on the whole Organic name thing And yea while  I used it I noticed a significant difference in the feel of my hair, and so I decided to purchase it again not from amazon but from the local Sally&#x27;s close to my house or other times at the Local Beauty supply store..but this time I decided why not take a look at the ingredient list(as in read the whole ingredients listed!!),while doing so I noticed next to the Olive oils, Safflower Oils,Germ oils,Lanolin oils,and nettle extracts this stuff also contains harsh sulfate,fragrance,paraben,and lots of preservatives especially Methylchloroisothiazolinone/a preservative which in large amount is known to cause  chemical burns and it&#x27;s also said to be a human carcinogen..I guess It&#x27;s an ok product if you don&#x27;t mind all that chemicals stuff on your hair. but me I kind of do. So rather than spend money on this stuff I&#x27;d rather spend my money going to the health food store and making my own deep conditioning treatments , if you are not sure where to start, and would like some inspiration I would gladly recommend you to copy and past this link  I just find out about today :)  &amp;lt;&amp;lt; [...] &gt;&gt; or for inspiration for  organic --&gt; non-paraben,non-chemicals,non-preservative,non-sulfate,and non-fragrance free herbal shampoo might I recommend  you copy pasting this link &amp;lt;&amp;lt;[...]&gt;&gt; everything product this organic root stimulator company claims they make that they claim grows your hair, you can re-create it. They are recipes online for real organic essential oil or shea butter,cocoa butter natural organic safer alternatives ..Is funny because I  usually don&#x27;t do reviews like  on products on a site but I  have to tell you I was just flabbergasted at all the \\&quot;good\\&quot;  reviews people are giving this product. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name people. You&#x27;d be surprised by how non organic alot of this  so called high end products are..if you really want to  grow your hair the best route is to start by watching what stuff you put in your hair, just like you watch what stuff you ingest or put in your mouth. and  P.S  the hardly touched jar of Organic Root Stimulator Hair mayonnaise that I just did a review on  is in the cold hard garbage can right now as we speak  -__-e best route is to start by watching what stuff you put in your hair, just like you watch what stuff you ingest or put in your mouth. and  P.S  the hardly touched jar of Organic Root Stimulator Hair mayonnaise that I just did a review on  is in the cold hard garbage can right now as we speak  -__-</li>
    <li> Very nice protein treatment! I was kind of worried at first because this is the first protein treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried and I heard that some protein treatments leave your hair really hard and dry. Not this one! After I washed it out of my hair (after about 45 minutes) my hair was soft and moisturized. Just in case I deep conditioned after this but didn&#x27;t leave it as long as usual then I put some hair lotion and oils in my hair to seal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a week since I used the ORS Hair Mayo protein treatment and I can already tell a difference. My hair use to shed a lot and I use to find a lot of hair in my comb when I combed my hair out. Now my hair isn&#x27;t shedding a lot and I combed my hair out yesterday and barely had any hairs in the comb. This will deff be my protein treatment; can&#x27;t go wrong with it giving protein and moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now and i love it. The very first time i used it my scalp tingled and that was a good sign it was working. My hair has become thicker stronger and healthier. It also prevents split ends and i have seen a remarkable change in the ends of my hair since using this product. I co wash with this product once a week as well. Its a great buy, i recommend this to anyone (guys included).</li>
    <li> My mother and I adore the Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayo. We&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and it makes our hair feel like strong silk--I have a relaxer, she wears her hair natural. Detangling my hair after conditioning with this couldn&#x27;t be any easier; tangles just fall away. I hope this item is never discontinued (like too many of the good ones eventually are!) because I plan to keep buying it indefinitely. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am highy satisfeid with this product. I used it after taking my kinky twist out... When i applied it to my scalp, I felt a little tingle. That let me know that it started working right away. I slept with it in my hair. In the morning all my new growth was smoothed down... my hair was so soft and managable. thank god for this product.. This product will now be one of my staple products yay........ LIFESAVER.......</li>
    <li> This stff is really good.  I have 4b-a natural hair,thick, shoulder lenght -  After washing my hair and detangling it,   I mix a big spoon of extra virgin olive oil + one of coconut or avocado oil+ one of rosemary oil (to stimulate the sclap) with 3 big spoons of ORS Hair Mayo and comb the mix through my hair from roots to ends then I wear a heat cap for at least 30 mn.  It quenches the thirst out of my hair. I love the way my hair feels soft, bouncy after I twist it out.  I just love ORS- HOWEVER, make sure it is the original(few fakes around): the original formula mixes well with natural oils.   Excellent value for money and easily accessible.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair is so soft.</li>
    <li> Update 1/10/14&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for years. My relaxed and natural hair eats this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently they added mineral oil to the top ingredients, and one or two other little ingredients I can&#x27;t remember, to the new \\&quot;ORS\\&quot; labeled jars. The mineral oil made me nervous to try the new formulation. It still smells and looks the same overall. But I&#x27;m disappointed that ORS ruined what was once a great product. Now it is too heavy and waxy for my thick curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I can rinse it all out, and my hair feels coated and not well moisturized. This is the complete opposite reaction to this product before the ingredient change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I can no longer recommend and tossed out the new formulation after trying to use it multiple times.</li>
    <li> I have read many reviews on this product and must say do not believe the ones who grip about the \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; in this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is honestly an amazing conditioner! It is not the prettiest conditioner I have ever used on someone but it is like hair magic after you use it, talk about deep conditioning. For the price and the result I can take the lack luster look of the yellowish looking substance:)&lt;br /&gt;It is almost as good as Biolage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor a buy this amazing hair conditioner, you won&#x27;t be sorry and the nay-sayers will never have hair this shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I use it in a spray bottle mixed with water. I spray it on my scalp when I have my hair braided. It makes my hair grow, and its also healthier!</li>
    <li> I just used it twice, I think is can help my hair more soft. The smell is not bad. I will propose it to my friends</li>
    <li> This is really great for deep conditioning. I use it about every two weeks and it leaves my hair so nice and soft and healthy. It has a pretty strong smell, though. Not unpleasant, just strong. Also, it suggests keeping it in for about 30 minutes. I usually don&#x27;t have the time for this, so I&#x27;ll put it in at the beginning of my shower and rinse at the end. I&#x27;ve still had great results doing this. Deep conditioning is a must for curls and transitioning hair, so this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am a white female that has dark naturally curly hair.  I have been dying my hair for close to 20 years and straighten my hair. For 10 years. I made the mistake of chemically straighten my hair about one year ago and damaged my hair to horribly that a few differnt hair dresser urged me to cut my long hair off and just start over. I cut 8 inches off and my hair still looked awful, was dry, no shine and had an insane amount of breakage.  I had tried dozens of different products that promised results.  Some expensive and some cheap brands, I even tried home remedies. I was about to make an appointment to chop all my hair off when I saw this product. I decided I had nothing to lose so I made the puchase. I left it in my hair for about an hour and omg, my hair after one use was a healthier texture, had shine and I fell in love. I have been using it 2 times a week for a month and I regret cutting those 8 inches off. It has made such a night and day difference in my hair. I know with continued use that I will have my old hair back and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying i do not have kinky hair so it may be the reason why this product did not work for me. It made my hair heavy and made it look dead and oily. Not for me</li>
    <li> This is the only treatment Ive found that keeps my hair moisturized a full week. My niece uses it as a leave in and her curls look nicely moisturized and no frizz.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it on my curly 3C/4A hair. It makes it super soft and luscious. Very thick</li>
    <li> This stuff is the truth for my natural color treated hair! It provides amazing moisture as well as strength! I have been using this in my stash for 2 years in conjunction to the replenishing conditioner and it hasn&#x27;t steered me wrong yet! ❤️ This stuff!!</li>
    <li> The absolute best deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve purchased. I used this product once a month specifically for deep conditioning my hair. It leave my hair soft, shiny and manageable. Use it with a plastic cap and hooded dryer for the perfect deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve also used it with steam and it works great. I also like the smell, it&#x27;s not over powering like some conditioners can be.</li>
    <li> brought for  my Aunt she  liked  it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and makes my hair so soft! I have curly hair and have noticed significantly less breakage and more growth since using this product. I will definitely re order when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve recently gotten into taking better care of my 4a hair and this works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, coarse, chemically processed hair that is prone to breakage. I have tried many products from the fantastic ORS line and this is one of my favourites.Opening the jar, the smell is quite strange, almost like a faint men&#x27;s cologne, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it. The consistency is creamy like a pomade. I section off my hair into four parts for easier application. I apply it with a colour tint brush in a mixing bowl and evenly distribute it to each section of my hair. I leave mine on for about 20 minutes under my cap. Immediately after I rinsed my hair felt stronger, softer and more resiliant. I do this as a protein treatment every 4-6 weeks. It works wonders! :o)</li>
    <li> My mom saw it in a magazine. And she told me to get it b/c she read that the protein would help with my damage hair from coloring. I absolutely love it it soften my hair completely and felt so light and fluffy. Lol.I love the whole hair line. It&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
    <li> I love it. .It makes my hair really soft and moisturized. And you only have 2 use a very small amount, so it will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Looks like they have changed the formulation.  It&#x27;s watery and thin.  probably will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair so soft and my breakage was a minimal. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I am happy that this was a product I have chosen.  I originally got this for my girlfriend but I use it as well.  You can honestly feel the difference.  I strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for my hair. I have 3c/4a hair type and t am natural. This is the only thing that makes my hair so soft,the comb goes right through if. I keep getting other conditioners, but always come back to this one</li>
    <li> African American, 4c, relaxed, low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing. This is the best protein treatment I&#x27;ve used and I use the ApHogee line [I haven&#x27;t touched the 2 step, though]. This gives me more of a protein boost than the ApHogee leave ins and conditioner, and it tends to stay pretty soft.  Some people add egg to this, but even with my low porosity hair, this works without adding anything.  Still, I would always recommend doing a moisture DC after using any protein conditioner at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bad&lt;br /&gt;One unfortunate thing about this product is that when used with heat [even if it&#x27;s just body heat with a cap], it becomes extremely soft. Much softer than your hair will actually be when you wash it out, so be warned that even though it feels great on, it will not necessarily be that great when you wash it out.</li>
    <li> I can see my hair fall is less now I am sure it will work. Hair is so shiny and silky.Love product.Have been using since 2 weeks and it is great!</li>
    <li> It Let my hair so soomth. Smell very good. It is cheap with a large bottle. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> one of the best deep conditioners ive ever used !!! I am black with dry, relaxed hair and this stuff makes it so soft. has a weird but nice smell to it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start off saying that I Love this product. I applied this product to dry hair and it did have a weird feeling going on to the hair. It was very thick and had a melding effect on the hair so do not expect to be able to detangle or finger comb your hair while applying this product. But ladies, when I tell you that this product had my hair feeling like silk in the shower, that is exactly what I mean. My hair was so silky that I detangled my hair in the shower (which is something that I never do). Afterwards, I let my hair airdry and remember that this is a protein conditioner so my hair was left a little bit dry, but this is just the strengthening effect of the conditioner. It was not left unmanageable and I did not choose to apply a deep conditioner afterwards because I would rather alternate weekly between protein and moisture rather than doing it on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the moisture back to my hair just by applying my moisturizer and oil. A couple days afterwards when that moisture level was fully back into my hair, it has never looked more beautiful or felt healthier. It feels strengthened, my color appears deeper and I am experiencing a significantly reduced amount of shedding and breakage. This is an all around GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair soft. I leave it in for about an hour or so, and after it&#x27;s dry and styled, my hair feels amazing!</li>
    <li> When I placed this order I was hoping to get the product in the picture.  The origanic root stimulator hair mayo, old formula green lid.  What I got was the ORS hair mair (new packing same formula NOT) red lid.  I am an ocd label reader when it comes to the things I put in my hair and one and I try not to use products that have mineral oil in them (makes my hair feel greasy and not quite clean) that is why I appreciated the old branding so much it was a great protein conditioner with no mineral oil.  Now the new name and packinging has mineral oil which to me is not the same great formula.  Also, I take issue with that sellar of this product using the image of the old packing.  The product in the picture is what I wanted but that is not what I got.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions on the container, it leavess the hair feeling smooth and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner on my 10 yr olds hair once or twice per month. She&#x27;s got super curly hair that frizzs and tangles. After shampoo, we leave the hair mayo in for about 45-60 mins, carefully style with a wide-toothed comb and voila tangles gone. Love it! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Im so glad I gave this a try. My hair has been tortured terribly by bleach. My hair felt like straw it was rough, brittle, dry looking and just plain uglyyy! I used hair mayo, left it on for 20 min under a cap and heat. When I straightened my hair it was sooo beautiful, a lot of shine, felt like silk, I had my bounce back,  it was soft and strong, it looked healthy and nourished. I am so happy!!! Also..I dont have to cut all that length of damaged hair anymore. I will just give it treatment until I outgrow the damage. This mayo really helps. It makes hair look very healthy! And it beats my favorite Aphogee treatments</li>
    <li> Just as expected and works great</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I smells wonderful (which is what I like in a conditioner).  It leaves my natural hair extremely soft which is great for my two strand twist out hair style</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on my hair... however I must say it does STINK!  Lol But once you realize how great of a product it is you won&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I love deep conditioning my hair with this. Even at 12 weeks post relaxer, this softens my new growth almost as soon as I put it in my hair. When it&#x27;s rinsed, my hair is left feeling silky and soft. I often forget to add a moisturizer to my dry hair because it&#x27;s left feeling so great after using this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the point in using this.. I sometimes use it before a shower.. I don&#x27;t notice any difference but, I guess it works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have different hair types so I&#x27;m not sure if this is even for me but, it smells great and the hair easily absorbs it so... yeah.. it&#x27;s just hair mayo...</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner weekly on my texturized African American hair. It is perfect for adding protein and moisture to my hair</li>
    <li> like it very much. and it is so big that i can use a lot time! never thought about it smells good! i mean look at the color. lol!</li>
    <li> Only one use so far and the shedding has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! I only lost about 10 hairs during my wash/blow-dry/flat iron routine, and that&#x27;s frickin&#x27; amazing compared to before (it felt like I was losing hundreds of strands a day, to be honest). In case people are wondering, I washed my hair first, then slapped this stuff on (I let it sit with only a plastic cap for about 40 mins, then put a blow dryer to it for another five). But anyways, this stuff is fantastic. 10/10</li>
    <li> I like it, but every time when i used it, the second day, my hair will full with oil.  Didn&#x27;t see much change.</li>
    <li> This stuff is bomb! I slather it in my hair and put on a shower cap and leave it for about 20 mins before my shower, and then rinse out. My hair is so much softer and more healthy than before when it was dry and brittle! Buy some!</li>
    <li> I did not see ant difference in my hear. I tried the treatment few times. Sorry this one did not go my hear any good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize one needed to sit under a hair dryer.  But I still like it.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian with very fine 2a wavy hair that is extremely fragile &amp; breaks even if you look at it wrong, I bleach my hair with highlights quite often. I came across this stuff in the African American section of Harmon&#x27;s but decided to look up the reviews as the &amp;#34;mayonnaise&amp;#34; caught my attention. I purchased this stuff because I needed a good mask to help my hair build strength. I like that it&#x27;s enriched with olive oil &amp; egg protein, both very good for the hair. It smells pretty darn good, almost like a lemony wheat grass scent (even though it&#x27;s a French dressing kind of color). I also have combination hair, oily roots &amp; dry damaged ends. This did not weigh down my hair at all &amp; most things do! It made my hair soft, subtle, shiny, &amp; manageable. Every time I use this my hair becomes incredibly soft, great for once a week use or after sun &amp; beach days. I drench my hair in this stuff &amp; let it sit for 30 minutes. Does wonders! Better than any other expensive hair mask I have tried.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair after I bleach it and it REALLY helps to take my frizzy, fried ends and make them soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I will be the first to admit to skipping deep conditioning, I can never seem to find the time.... my hair looks fine flat ironed..ect. When I push the hair too far and it becomes brittle, dry and generally a hot mess this is the product that I turn to to bring it back. I have had relaxed hair for 5 years and I pity the me from 4 years ago who didn&#x27;t know about this awesome product. I was used to seeing it in other peoples houses but tended to overlook it for my own beauty routine until it started popping up on relaxed hair care blogs, I am so happy that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;I use it sparingly, as stated above, so I totally disregard the prescribed time limit. I do this routine on days/nights when I don&#x27;t have to be anywhere for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;After I shampoo I remove as much water as possible and cover my hair in ORS. I follow that up by parting my hair down the middle and braiding it up. I cover my hair with a shower cap and go about study, cleaning, ect and when bed time rolls around I put a sleeping cap over the shower cap and leave the ORS on for the night. When I wash the ORS out in the morning my hair has always been without fail, soft, shiny, strong and easy to comb (wet and dry). I highly recommend this product as a protein treatment for damaged dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*note of warning: If you use protein based hair products too often over long periods of time they can actually damage hair so follow the rules on the label if you are using this product more then once a month.</li>
