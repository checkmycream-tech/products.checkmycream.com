<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great toothbrush and I love the way it cleans my teeth and makes them feel fresh.</li>
    <li> i loved this brush, but the toothpaste starts to build up inside and becomes nasty&lt;br /&gt;just invest you money in the easyclean model</li>
    <li> need this to keep your teeth healthy, it just does its job better than you will with your own technique. assists with crevices and will be a partial flosser (still floss!)  and it lasts pretty long, if you can invest in it, DO, no batteries, just charge it up!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with this brush, it&#x27;s just that I miss the timer. With this one, I&#x27;m always either finished with too much time remaining (meaning I haven&#x27;t brushed well enough) or it stops before I&#x27;m finished, which means I&#x27;m wasting time. Next time, I won&#x27;t be so cheap and I&#x27;ll get one with all the necessary features.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth much better than regular brushing. I have used Sonicare for many years.  Easy to operate and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement brushes are readily available.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try this product as i heard a lot about the benefit so I finally bought it - I have to say that i am impressed by the efficiency. First the wireless feature : at first, the brush looked a bit bulky but in fact you have it good in hand and it has the right format. the brush tip looks small but it does a lot more than a regular full size brush. I also like the timer on it that make it easier for timing the right brushing time you need for your brush.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I was septical about the fact that the brush can be used for about 2 weeks in between charges so I took it for a trip in Europe and tested it - it lasted more than 2 weeks without recharging, brushing my teeth at least twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;the result is amazing - it really feels like coming out the dentist office after a ultrasound cleaning. I wonder why I waited so long to get one - it also helps the gums as oyu also brush them by giving a 45 degres angle to the brush&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My sons dentist told him to use this toothbrush after some extensive dental work and bonding.  It is an amazing brush.  Nothing else performs exactly like the sonicare.  He had his checkup this week and the dentist was very please with the care of his teeth.  The only thing different has been the use of the sonicare.  Excellent price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new toothbrush. It works well and the price was right. However, I wish the stop and go button would protrude a little more cuz sometime it is hard to feel for it to turn it off/on while brushing</li>
    <li> The Sonicare is a great toothbrush.  The product was exactly what I wanted at a great price. Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect toothbrush without all the bells and whistles.  Works fine and does the trick!  I&#x27;m sold! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent machine. It takes little getting used to. You will see the difference after about 2 weeks.   Stronger gums and cleaner teeth.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare.  For personal oral hygiene and tooth care there is no equal.      My father is a retired Dentist and gave me one of the first models when they came out in the mid to late nineties.  It finally gave out on me this year, so it lasted for 13+ years (and probably would have gone much longer if I hadn&#x27;t left it on the charger unplugged so many times).  I am a Dental Lab Technician and have a pretty thorough understanding of the \\&quot;oral environment\\&quot;.  Regular brushing with a standard tooth brush is good, but the raking or dragging motion can damage gum tissue and periodontal ligaments that actually hold the tooth in your bone, creating pockets where bacteria can accumulate leading to potential decay at the root.  Especially if you are using a hard or stiff bristle brush.  When you use a Sonicare, it may feel weird at first (it really kinda&#x27; tickles), but you aren&#x27;t dragging the brush across your teeth.  Instead you are treating your teeth, and more importantly your gum&#x27;s, to a gentle \\&quot;massage\\&quot; that stimulates tissues, encouraging them to be healthy and strong.  Also, when using a standard brush there is a lot of food particles and plaque that you will simply not be able to get at.  The bristles just graze over them.  After using a Sonicare, I feel like I&#x27;ve just gotten a professional cleaning without all the pain.   It gets into the hard to clean crevices and pockets and vibrates all the unwanted stuff out.  I am also a smoker and I have found that with regular use it reduces tarter buildup that in the past had to be removed by a Hygienist with a scaler.  Mind you - in NO way does ANY kind of brush replace a professional cleaning.    I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other powered brushes on the market, and they&#x27;re ok.  They&#x27;re more affordable, but basically do the same thing as a standard tooth brush.  I admit they are a little bit better, but they still rely on a lot of movement.  Nothing gets the job done like a Sonicare.      Regarding the model I recently purchased: The design has improved since I received my first Sonicare in the late nineties.  My old one had a tendency to \\&quot;rattle\\&quot; at times, which was often alarming and uncomfortable.  The more compact head on the new model eliminates this problem.  I saw that there were other models available that had more buttons, more lights and an optional UV cleaning unit.  None of that stuff is necessary.  I say keep it simple.  You&#x27;re more likely to use it, and used properly* a Sonicare will definitely improve your dental health and reduce costly dental bills.      I make teeth for a living, so really - every time someone buys a Sonicare, I&#x27;m looking at a career change.  And so is your Dentist.  No joke.    *Using a Sonicare \\&quot;properly\\&quot; does not mean you use it exactly as directed in the instructions.  I spend more time on each quadrant of my teeth than the timer allows for.  The important thing to me is to not abuse your teeth.  Do what feels good.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush. I have no negative comments about the toothbrush. It arrived fully charged and I have not had to recharge it yet. I have had this toothbrush about 8 days and love it so far. I have not tried any other electronic toothbrushs to make a true comparison.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this tooth brush for my daughter for Christmas. At first she was a bit surprised that I would give her a toothbrush for Christmas. But after she got it charged up (24hrs) she was amazed at how well it works!  It is just like mine and my husband&#x27;s.  Works awesome!  Would do it again!  And it was extremely reasonable in cost!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used the sonicare elite toothbrush in the past, until the battery died, and was very satisfied with it.  The essence model seems to work as well as the elite.  Both models require keeping your head up or at least level while brushing your teeth.  Otherwise, toothpaste and liquid can drain into the inside of the handle. My only complaint about the sonicare electric toothbrushes is that the batteries seem to go after a couple of years and the brushes, which are very expensive, need to be replaced more frequently than the recommended 3 months. In spite of those drawbacks, brushing with the sonicare system is superior to manual toothbrushing. It does a more thorough cleaning and is a lot easier to use than brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I like Sonicare products, and my old Sonicare toothbrush - a different model - lasted for many years.  However, this model lasted only 10 months - now it no longer holds a battery charge.  And my window to return it to Amazon has closed. Does anyone know what the guarantee is for this model?  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find any paperwork other than the order print-out from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Special care should be taken to disassemble this brush every time it is used and dry the components - the head and the body contain a plethora of inaccessable nooks and crannies where moisture can seep to and mold/bacteria can form, and you dont want to put a toothbrush full of black mold into your mouth. After this poor excuse for engineering breaks I will do my best to avoid this shoddy brand in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare.  The second one was a more expensive model with beeps every 30 seconds, etc. which, at this point, I don&#x27;t need.  The basic model does the job and costs less.</li>
    <li> ...that&#x27;s what it feels like a little robot cleaning your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Oral B Sonic something which I loved too and lasted me almost 2 years, but half the brush head fell off!  The Philips definitely feels more powerful and doesn&#x27;t have 2 segments like the Oral B so I doubt that would fall apart.  Weird feeling at 1st and 2nd use, but you adapt real quick.  Simple and effective and so far so good, plus I got a really good price at $39.99 and I don&#x27;t think there was tax added (that&#x27;s why I love Amazon), so a great buy all in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, Powerful and Effective. Thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> My husband and I ordered this toothbrush at the recommendation of our dentist.  We both have issues with pushed back gums due to rough scrubbing with a manual toothbrush.  My parents had an electronic toothbrush 20 years ago with next to no power, so I was skeptical at first.  However, these toothbrushes have come a long way since then!!  The power is excellent!!  In fact, the first time we used it, the bristles moved so quickly that we giggled the whole brushing from ticklish gums.  We were a little concerned that we wouldn&#x27;t adjust to the tickle, but that issue was completely gone within 2 brushings.  We love this toothbrush and are very happy with our purchase.  Our teeth feel fresh-from-the-dentist smooth after each brushing.  Have been using for a week now and that clean feeling after every brushing has not lessened.  Be sure to register the product on their website when you receive it.  They give you the choice of an extended warranty or a free replacement brush head.  Definitely worth your time!!</li>
    <li> I love the sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been using this type of toothbrush for at least 12 years and I could not imagine using anything else. When I first started using it I was a child and had terrible gingivitis and horrible dental hygiene. Using this brush just twice a day for the alotted time helped to cure the gingivitis and got me to start taking care of my teeth. Over the years I have gotten new brushes when old ones stopped working (this is my third in 12 years) and the first one only stopped after I dropped it in the shower multiple times. They&#x27;re very durable and the charge lasts for weeks so you&#x27;re not glued to the sink whenever you brush your teeth. Anyway, great for your gums, teeth, smile and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Sonicare brushes are great but this one the battery died after only one day of not being on the charger. We got a replacement and it seems to be working better.</li>
    <li> Product works fine, but the head design leads to a buildup of gunk and slime. The head seals leak, and unless you disassemble the unit after every use, you get a buildup of slime inside the unit. Very poor design.  I switched over to oral-b and have been very happy.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare is the best toothbrush ever invented.  I got my original one over 10 years ago and it has never let me down.  I recently noticed it not holding a charge as long and it finally died, so I&#x27;m ordering a new one.  I use it at least twice daily and I always get excellent check ups at the dentist.  I highly recommend this product, very good investment.... you only get one set of teeth!</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is amazing! In a week it toughened my gums and they went from bleeding all morning from a 99 cent toothbrush to having no pain or blood while using this sonicare brush! I recommend it 100%!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare toothbrush for nearly 10 years now and my dentist loves me for it. I love my Sonicare so much that I go through withdrawal when I have to use a regular toothbrush.    Save your money and buy the entry-level Essence model as the higher models include a bunch of useless features.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I bought one for my wife. It works great, battery lasts a couple of weeks and does not get as dirty as my old OralB. It also has a travel case.</li>
    <li> An Amazing toothbrush. I will never go back to anything else. Gives a great clean feeling. I like the 2 minute timer so I always know I am cleaning thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare model.  It appears to be the same toothbrush but with an easier to hold handle.    These are well-built and really do get your teeth cleaner than a traditional electric toothbrush.  The timer helps you make sure you brush for the right length of time.    I&#x27;m not sure what features the more expensive models add, but this one is fine for me.</li>
    <li> I am ashamed to say that I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in 5 years.  But I had been using this Sonicare the entire time.  When I went last month, the dentist told me she couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were, even though I hadn&#x27;t had a teeth cleaning in over 5 years.  I attribute this to the Sonicare.  I was so happy, I bought this one for my college freshman son.  Hopefully he&#x27;ll use this to keep the dentist away and the girls close.</li>
    <li> It works great, and keeps my teeth clean.  I don&#x27;t really have anything else to say other then that.  Good price.  :-)</li>
    <li> I\\&quot;ve used Sonicare for years and I would not be without one.  What a difference it makes!  I&#x27;ve been through 3 models since and IMHO the Essence has been the best.  IF you are trying to decide to buy the Essence over the newer Flexcare model read this review.    Six months ago I purchased a Flexcare believing that it would get my teeth cleaner and whiter. Here is what I found out:  1.  The Essence cleans better, deeper.  It has more vibration and power than my Flexcare. For this reason alone I am going back to the Essence.  It takes my twice as long to get my teeth clean with the Flexcare.  The Flexcare does NOT get my teeth cleaner.  2. The Flexcare is overpriced. It has a lot of bells and whistles most people will not use on a day to day basis. I never use the \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;, \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; or \\&quot;massage\\&quot; functions.  One reviewer said it best:  Buy the more economical Essence and with the money you save buy extra brush heads.   3. The Flexcare&#x27;s brush head are cheap, cheap, cheap and they keep coming off my handle while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.  The brush heads on the Flexcare slip over a flat post and with the slightest pressure the brush heads slips off.  I&#x27;ve yet to find out if the problem is several faulty brush heads or the pin on my handle that the brush heads slip over.  BTW, I never apply a lot of pressure when I brush my teeth either.  I&#x27;m curious if anyone else has this problem.  4. The Flexcare is handle is slimmer, lighter and aesthetically looks nicer than the plain white heavier, chunkier handle of the Essence but, I LIKE the chunkier, more solid handle.  The Flexcare is light weight and feels cheap but this is my individual preference.   5. Battery life seems to be comparable in both models.  I&#x27;ve only had the Flexcare for 6 months though and I never leave the handle on the charger except to charge.  This has allowed me to get 4 plus years from the battery.   Summary: The Essence is much more economical than the Flexcare.  The Flexcare does NOT cleanyour teeth better than the other Sonicare models.  You are paying more for the extra bells and whistles functions the average person will never use.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Essence being messy and getting \\&quot;mold\\&quot; in it like another reviewer mentioned BUT for some reason I&#x27;ve found the Flexcare messier when brushing my teeth but then when the brush head keeps falling off while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth this doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist to help me take care of a very expensive and lengthy bite reconstruction project. Never having used an electric tooth brush has caused me to have to rethink brushing my teeth.  It&#x27;s been a real learning experience but seems to be coming along ok.  My dentists says it is doing the job well.</li>
    <li> Using the Philips Sonicare, our mouths feel really healthy and clean. The motion is gentle to the gums.  Our smiles are much larger since we are using the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Very nice toothbrushes!  Unlike several other Sonicare models, these do not have the Quadpacer -- the 30-second \\&quot;lap timer\\&quot;.  The Quadpacer helps you brush quadrants of your mouth for the same amount of time, to ensure that everything gets well cleaned.  Luckily, since these are for our kids, that feature would be only somewhat useful -- they don&#x27;t have quite the discipline to restrict brushing to just a quadrant.  So overall, these do a great job, but if you want the Quadpacer, step up to a higher-end Sonicare model.</li>
    <li> Granted, the first time I used it was difficult because of the \\&quot;tickling sensation\\&quot; but after reading the instructions on keeping your mouth closed it was as bad. After more than a week, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m used to it and I&#x27;d highly recommend this as a good one.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing! It cleans your teeth without you making much effort. I have never had cleaner teeth. And it turns off automatically after two minutes. Its a must buy!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and nothing has broken or gone wrong. It is very easy to clean and maintain, and it really does make your teeth feel cleaner and healthier. Some days when I am in a really big rush I go back to my manual toothbrush for a really quick brush and the difference is night and day. The old manual brush actually hurts my teeth almost while brushing and leaves so much residue afterward. The Essence on the other hand makes my teeth smooth and clean feeling. I love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (August 31, 2013):&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is still working just fine. The charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to, but that is to be expected after using it for a long time. I bought replacement heads a while ago, but skimped and went with non-name brand ones. They work just fine, but they are much louder than the original Philips branded brush heads. I would still recommend this brand if you are in the market for an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great bush!!  I had bought a second one for traveling as I had to leave for the military.  The case is very convenient and the brush head lasts for a good month.  Just make sure that you detach the brush head from the handle so that you can clean inside so mold doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
    <li> I have owned many different electric brushes, but this one is the best by far!&lt;br /&gt;At first, it felt very strange to use, but it was just me getting used to the sonic&lt;br /&gt;technology.  Over time, I was able to remove most of the plaque and tarter I had.  At&lt;br /&gt;this point, I think it will finish off what is left, but it does take time to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I have never owned this kind of technology in terms of a tooth brush, but now am very&lt;br /&gt;glad that I do!  If you use regular brushes or electric brushes without this form of&lt;br /&gt;sonic technology, you are in for a treat here! - Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret this one!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement ,as I dropped and broke my original toothbrush. Great toothbrush. We have four in our family . Amazon&#x27;s price was great . The original bought years. ago was double the price . Really cleanses. your teeth  . Need replacement heads monthly , as you would need with a regular toothbrush . Only buy the heads from Amazon . Their price is great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for nearly 10 years and overall they are great for keeping the gums healthy and work much better than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chargers only work reliably with 110v AC current as found in the USA. In countries with 220/230v wall current the charger will usually not work with a current adapter and can even be burned out. Unfortunately you need to buy a Sonicare overseas to get the 230v charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will work for two weeks for one user without needing to be recharged but for a couple traveling that means two complete Sonicare units need to be taken, or the Sonicare will last only one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to a toothbrush using replaceable AA batteries for use when traveling overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000FEIOHW Philips Sonicare HX3351/02 Xtreme Battery Operated Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> I ordered mine the first of December.  The description says it holds charge for up to 2 weeks, but this is the middle of March and it&#x27;s still going on the INITIAL CHARGE - over 3 months!  I use it twice a day, sometimes I miss, but this is exceeding all my expectations!  I don&#x27;t store it on the charging base because it&#x27;s not convenient.  I keep the charger close by and am just waiting for the battery to run down.  Yet every time I pick it up it&#x27;s going strong.  Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I already had this item for myself and purchased for my sons. Great product but sometimes the toothbrush head gets loose due to vibrations(?). Otherwise, my dentist has commented on my beautiful mouth!</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended.  Works well, easy to clean and maintain.  Travel case is nice, but only good for 1-2 day trip, since there isn&#x27;t a case for the charging base.</li>
    <li> Works well and meets my expectations. It is quite a difference in comparison to a normal toothbrush, but mostly in a good way. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Yes Sonicare has come out with newer models with all the fancy features. Word of advice, save your money and go with this model. It does all you need and will leave your teeth clean and sparkling. I love this product and it does everything stated.</li>
    <li> This brush does a fantastic job of brushing your teeth and travels well.  I&#x27;ve used this overseas for 2+ weeks at a time without charging and it would still just keep on going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the annoying odor that will inevitably accumulate on the inside of your brush after repeated use.  Some of the crevices are almost impossible to get to and after the bacteria/sludge accumulates over time the odor becomes more and more apparent.  Pretty annoying design flaw for an otherwise great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> UGH. I was trying to figure out what the smell was that had crept up in my bathroom. It smelled like stale toothpaste mixed with mold, soap scum, dried blood, and baked flesh. I thought the drain had gone disgusting, but after a round of vinegar and hot water, the smell lingered. I cleaned the entire bathroom, but the smell remained. Finally, it was time to change my brush head, and I opened up the toohtbrush to what can only be described as Lovecraftian horror staring back. The smell blasted me in the face like a slaughterhouse baking in the August sun. I vomited everywhere, dropping the brush and weeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flawed design makes it so that toothpaste, saliva, mouth blood, and other effluvium collect inside the brush, which eventually becomes a foul-smelling, blackened goo filled with mold. DISGUSTING. It&#x27;s hard as hell to clean out, because the inside of the brush forms a nice jar where the inside is larger than the outside, and it&#x27;s nice, and deep, and has a narrow opening. It took a box of q-tips, a jar of alcohol, and a priest just to get it cleaned...all while knowing that it&#x27;s just going to happen again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my latest prurchase of a Phillips electric toothbrush. It has been a number of weeks and it has not had to be recharged yet. The key is to initially charge as per the company&#x27;s instructions which is almost a full 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I have had the original Sonicare for years and it finally gve out. I started looking and found they make many different models (don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t just leave a good product alone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea with the Sonicare is that you divide your mount into 4 quadrants and brush each section for 30 seconds. My original model ran for 2 minutes, with a beep every 30 secondes so that you knew when to move to the next section. This new model has the 2 minute timer, but there are no beeps. No indiction of the 30 second marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you want is the Sonicare with the Quadpacer function. That gives you the 30 second beeps that were in the original unit.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use a Philips sonicare for an all around teeth cleaning. I like the 2 minute timer on the Sonicare, I guess I had never thought about how long I brushed my teeth before. If you want to go a little longer than 2 minutes, just push the button again. This Sonicare tooth brush does all the work. The tooth brush literally glides your hand along and it will make a noise to let you know if you are brushing too hard. My teeth really feel clean, as if, I had just had them cleaned by my dentist. I would highly recommend the Philiips Sonicare HX5351/30 tooth brush. It is safer for your teeth and gums than a regular old tooth brush, and the prices on Amazon are unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Great product, totally satisfied!  I had my doubts about this model since it was the cheapest one, but it was my first electric toothbrush so I went with it since it had great reviews.  It turned out to be much better than expected, really easy and comfortable to use for a first timer.  It really feels your teeth are actually cleaner, it was a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it didn&#x27;t explain well about the brushes, and so I got it with the regular brushes.  I expected them to be smaller round compact brushes, and I actually thought the brushes would twist in circular motion speed while brushing.  That was my assumption, anyway it was not explained anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular brush is traditional long brush, and  it just vibrates, you have to actually emulate the circular motion around your teeth.  However, I must say it still does a very good job and I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with the results and don&#x27;t think I would ever go back to manual tooth brushing again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is our third Sonicare toothbrush. Not to exaggerate, but we can not imagine proper dental care without the Sonicare.  This product however is a grave disappointment. It is definitely the lowest end of the product line. After a week, we have yet for it to work correctly.  To make matters worse, we were so sure it would be as satisfying as the last two that we threw away the packaging right after arrival.  Now we are stuck with a mal-functioning toothbrush and just flushed $50 down the drain.  Advise?  Spend more and get a proper working product and SAVE your packaging.</li>
    <li> My first Sonicare lasted forever. The last one - with lots of goofy, Microsoft-type features - stopped after a year. So I&#x27;ve bought an Oral B.</li>
    <li> I just love the toothbrush. when you charge it you can use it for more than a week with out recharging it. You can take it anywhere with you and for short trips you do not need to even take the charger. The brush it self is a good one.</li>
    <li> Although this product does not come with all the bells and whistles ( accessories) as my first Sonicare, I would not use any other toothbrush.  Since I have owned a Sonicare, any issues I had with my gums have disappeared and no more periodontal work has been needed.</li>
    <li> Simply a poorly designed brush head.  My teeth feel and look cleaner than with a traditional brush, but I had mold under the brush head within 1 week.  My wife&#x27;s began showing mold within 2 weeks.  That is an unacceptable design flaw.  The instructions state to remove the brush head weekly for cleaning, so Philips is obviously aware of the problem.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush and get good reports from my dentist, however, it&#x27;s an expensive toothbrush that will only last a couple of years.  This is about my 4th one because of the good results I get at the dentist&#x27;s office but it seem like, for the price, it should last longer than it does.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years and I get good dental check ups and my teeth have no stains.  I like the brush on this model better because it has higher bristles at the end for getting into tight spaces.  After going to Sonicare&#x27;s website and reading the test studies, I was sold.  I know there are cheaper electric brushes out there, but the technology behind this one can&#x27;t be beat and I believe the toothbrush has paid for itself in better dental checkups.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t believe how good your teeth can look until you use a Sonic toothbrush.  Dentist highly recommend these toothbrushes.  They last for a really long time.  I think I had my last toothbrush at least 4 years before it finally would not recharge.  You can easily take it with you on a 4 day weekend without the charger.  I have not gone without charging mine for more than 4 days so I don&#x27;t know really how long a charge will last.  After I purchased mine and used it for about 3 months, I went to the dentist and they ask me immediately if I was using a Sonic.  They could tell from looking at my teeth and gums.  These toothbrushes are so much better for your gums than regular toothbrushes.  As we age, our gums are harder to take care of and Sonic is the answer.</li>
    <li> Its effect is as others have reviewed, it really works.  To me, I like the plug-less dock. It is designed for heavy humidity environment.</li>
    <li> This product is used twice daily by my spouse, and she likes it tremendously!  It was easy to order and we got a quick shipment. ( THANKS AMAZON )</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works well, as everyone has said. My only complaint, after having to replace my old Sonicare after 5 years of use, is that the batteries are not replaceable. It seems like a big waste (both financial and environmental) to spend another $50 to replace the entire toothbrush when all it needs is a new battery.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of brush for many years. Recently I ordered new replacement. When ordering I noticed another product called \\&quot;sonic seals for E-Series Sonicare toothbrushes\\&quot;. The problem was that the joints between the brush and the body of the device leaked saliva and toothpaste and water into the cavity where the movement is magnetically generated. That requires cleaning periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These soft silicone seals go over the two areas of leakage and look as though they will not allow leakage. Time will tell but I would advise getting the seals for your brushes, old or new. They fit very snug and I found very difficult to apply, but with my wife&#x27;s help we made it. One hint is to roll down the neck of the seal to get it over the bristles. From then on it&#x27;s a tugging job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sold in packs of three on Amazon in white, pink and blue. They glow in the dark, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an okay job with teeth and gum brushing but it is DIRTY! I take the top off after my twice a day use and rinse it out in hot water. I replace the two parts in their proper places each time. Weekly, I separate the parts of the brush head to clean it and inside is the slimiest black stuff...stuff I have seen inside a sink drain. I had to use another toothbrush and a q-tip to clean it. I would never recommend this brush nor would I buy it again. I am going to try to spray the insides with a weak bleach solution to see if it cuts down on the black slime. ICK!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband.  He loves it!  The traveler case is very convenient!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had a Philips Sonicare Power Toothbrush that lasted quite a long time.    It stopped working and I ordered another.  It was received in perfect working order and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Charger breaks too soon, had to order a new set since there is no charger on sale separately.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my other Sonicare toothbrush that I have had for almost 7 years, so this was a minor upgrade.    All in all it works great, though the ramp up to full power (which is a feature of this product) took some getting used to.  But after the first 12 brushes it remains at full strength, and boy howdy is it good.    Clean teeth forever!!!</li>
    <li> Six months ago my dentist warned me that my gums were in bad shape. Despite brushing and flossing twice a day, my gums were 4s and 5s all around. We determined that I was using a bad brushing technique, so I purchased and started using this Sonicare toothbrush. I use it twice a day, plus flossing and mouthwash twice a day. I used a normal toothbrush on my tongue. After six months my gums are now mostly 3s. A significant improvement! I highly recommend this brush to anyone with gum problems!</li>
    <li> I recently bought 2 Sonicare Essences, one after the other. In both of them the switch broke. The first one worked intermitantly after about a month; eventually it quit totally. I really liked the way it cleaned my teeth so I replaced it with another. Within a month number two wouldn&#x27;t turn off! Fool me twice, shame on me! I now own an Oral-B electric toothbrush; same clean teeth but with a switch that actually works.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare Toothbrush is wonderful. My mouth started to feel cleaner after the first use. I have noticed in the past few weeks that my gums are looking healthier too, no more bleeding. I had been using another brand of electric toothbrush, but from now on I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and purchase a sonicare. Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received it two days early, and am fully satisfied with the product. Works great, looks good. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. &#x3D;) What a steal!</li>
    <li> Love this brushing system.  Makes my teeth feel tingly and very clean!</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B sonic toothbrush for a few years that I was happy with that finally died.  Either that or the button broke.  Either way, it was acting possessed on a recent trip and just started going off by itself on the counter without the charging stand in the middle of the night.      I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much again, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Philips brand instead.  Well, the Oral-B is a far superior design.  This one rattles when I use it, and the silicon sleeves are necessary.      Yes, the end result of very clean teeth is the same as the Oral-B, and the price of this unit is less expensive, but I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;d rather spend more money on the Oral-B to begin with than deal with all the annoyances of this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Sonicare to replace an older model.  I was hopng to replicate the older model with an updated one, as the battery was no longer holding a charge.  Unfortunately, this model doesn&#x27;t offer the Quad Pacer timer as did the older one.  Unfortunately, there was really no way to determine whether or not the new model had the desired QuadPacer timer.  It might seem a tad high maintenance, but the feature lets the user know when 30 seconds is up and time to move on to a different area of teeth to clean.   I am frustrated by (a) the lack of the timer feature and (b) the lack of clarity and information available to me when making the decision.  Even the instruction manual states \\&quot;not all models.\\&quot;  It seems to me that the Quad Pacer timer should be a feature on all the Sonicare models.  I was going to return this model, but chose to keep it--or pass it on to my wife.  If you&#x27;ve had a Sonicare with the Quad Pacer, this isn&#x27;t the model to chose.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get used to this power toothbrush. I started using it after a dental cleaning and found my teeth felt even cleaner than the professional cleaning. The easy start feature slowly increases the speed of the brush to allow your gums to adjust. My teeth look whiter with regular toothpaste and this tool than with any over the counter whitening product I&#x27;ve tried. With manual brushing I would find tartar build up a few weeks after a dental visit. Now, after a month, I see nothing but healthy gums and white teeth. The two minute timer is very helpful. At first it does take about a week adjusting to the Sonicare Essence for several reasons. It is uncomfortable at first if the brush wand touches your teeth and the powerful action requires you to hold your mouth and head in a slightly differently position to keep from getting a wet hand or a splashed mirror. I still use a regular brush, after some meals or snacks, but use the Sonicare morning and night for that extra clean feeling and great gum care. With daily flossing and this brush you should never have gum problems again.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It does the job. No need to buy a over $100 model, as the key patented technology has been included in this model. The only drawback so far is the battery charging, as it takes about 24 hours to fully charge the batteries, which are NOT Lithium-ion one. This means, in order to preserve the battery life, it&#x27;s better to make them fully charged each time in stead of charging halfway. So you have to have a backup toothbrush, or you need have two of this model, or whatsoever. And those batteries can NOT be replaced, like the iPhone. But overall, this toothbrush is worth the money, and Philips definitely the best brand in the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about two years now. I really like the way it cleans my teeth and the timer, so I know I&#x27;m brushing long enough. However, I have to screw off the toothbrush head after every brush because water, toothpaste, etc. seeps into the crevices where the head screws on. I leave the toothbrush head on the stand, but water pools there also and causes disgusting mold to grow inside the toothbrush head. I have to clean it at least once a week with Q-tips. It&#x27;s disgusting to see the black mold coming out of the toothbrush head hidden in the crevices. DISGUSTING. I really love the way the toothbrush cleans, but the design is extremely flawed. I wish the toothbrush would die already, so I could justify buying a new one. The good thing is that it cleans well and has lasted for nearly two years now, but the mold is gross and time consuming to have to clean out and unscrew the head after EVERY single brush.  I&#x27;ll definitely be shopping for a different model in the very near future.</li>
    <li> I own the Phillips sonicare toothbrush and it is such a good buy. It costs only about $40 and it works just as well as all those expensive sonicares that cost upwards of $100-$200 dollars. I am really happy with my toothbrush, it keeps my teeth clean and it didnt cost me a bundle to buy it. I love that it has the cool carry case for easy traveling and that it keeps me teeth clean and that it seems to get in all the hard to reach places. I love the design, the brand, the cool look it has. I would never buy the crest sonicare because basically it is the same style and the same quality and the same good materials, except that the crest sonicaire costs about $150. Why should you pay about 5x more for something because it has the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; attached to it, when they are basically the same thing. I think thats totally ridiculouss. Phillips is an awesome brand, they make everything from headphones to teethbrushes and everytime they do, they make the same quality as everyone else but at a fraction of the price. I am so happy to have such a wonderful item and that i did not have to break my piggybank to be able to afford it. I am very satisfied and would never never never never buy another brand of sonicare from anyone except phillips ever ever ever again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush for the price. If your teeth do not look and feel cleaner after using this thing, then you better take your behind to the dentist for a professional cleaning.  I love the two minute feature which gives you the recommended brushing time so you can&#x27;t even mess that up  It comes apart for easy cleaning and holds a good charge for about two weeks off of the charger.  The only thing that is a bit of a bother is that it is smooth on the sides which can get slippery.   If you can swing it, get it. Your teeth will love you for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now, and have noticed a big improvement in the health of my teeth.  My gums look much healthier and the coffee stains have almost disappeared.    As someone who has a smaller mouth, I&#x27;ve had dental problems from regular manual toothbrushes being too large to properly clean my teeth (the only thing that has come close to working are children&#x27;s toothbrushes).  However, this toothbrush has been amazing - the small brush heads allow me to get every inch of my mouth.      This is a great product if you want that fresh-from-the-dentist feeling every time you brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> I think the title really says it all. I don&#x27;t have a lot to add to the other positive reviews. Just wanted to add my 5 stars.     I&#x27;m not sure when I got my first one but it was long enough ago that I got it because the dentist suggested it when I had braces. I can&#x27;t imagine going back now and I&#x27;ve subsequently converted my extended family.    Bottom line: strongly recommend</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in September 2010, around November the battery does not last for one brush session, which typically last for only 1-2 minutes. Even I left the brush to be charged at all times. I will not purchase this product again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love this toothbrush! your mouth will really feel clean after using it and it&#x27;s cheaper on here than in the stores, so i recommend buying it on amazon.     just make sure the clean it daily, toothpaste tends to build in between the brush and the battery and can start to stink if you don&#x27;t clean it all the time.    other than that good toothbrush will only use this toothbrush from now until forever!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! It took a couple of days to get used to but now I love it! It cleans my tooth better than any other toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Sonicare definitely knows the right product to ensure you get the best results. Would recommend this item to anyone. I will never to go back to a regular tooth brush in my life.</li>
    <li> I always thought a regular toothbrush was all that a person needed...until...I tried this product. I purchased one for my son and a set of multiple replacement heads so that I could use the unit as well.  The very first time we both tried this brush we were amazed at how clean our teeth felt and looked. You will notice a difference! I had been a smoker for many, many years and within the first week my teeth were whiter as well.  I can not believe the difference and am glad I started my son out with a proper toothbrush like this one instead of just a semi-adequate brush.      I have not experienced the problems that others have mentioned about gunk buildup. This may be because I change the heads multiple times a day and end up rinsing every time anyway.  It would be simple enough to avoid even if you did not change the head daily though - just don&#x27;t hold your brush upright while you brush so the paste and water does not drip down the outside of the unit and rinse the brush immediately after it stops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned one for years and when they wear out, I buy a new one. I think they&#x27;re the best!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had several of these Philips Sonicare  toothbrushes before and they are easy to use and really do a good job!</li>
    <li> We have had 2 Sonicare toothbrushes and the on/off switch stopped working on both handles over the course of 2-3 years. The company would not replace the 2nd one saying it was outside their warranty limit. We were told when the first one stopped working that it was a problem they were having, so we thought it would be covered as a faulty design or part, but no, Sonicare won&#x27;t do anything. We bought a Braun at the same time and it is still working beautifully. We will no longer buy any Philips products as we don&#x27;t feel that they stand behind their products. You&#x27;ll notice that there is another one-star review here that had the same on/off problem. It&#x27;s a good product as long as it works, and our experience is that it breaks down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to belief the brush has sonic cleaning power, but something is making my teeth feel incredibly clean after I use it. The batteries also last a really long time...long enough that I bring it with me on travel and I don&#x27;t even bring the charger. The heads are a bit pricey and they wear out fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews on this toothbrush. It absolutely harbors germs and bacteria in many places. It is difficult to keep clean and I will never buy this model again. A complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase!  Great product, fast service, great value!  I would buy from them again and recommend them to friends.</li>
    <li> After several years of eyeballing this product, I finally bought it and I love it!  It&#x27;s easy to use; as one person said, it takes a few minutes of getting used to (it&#x27;s very powerful) and my teeth feel about as clean as a dentist cleaning!  I am expecting MUCH better reviews at the next visit to the dentist; I still have to practice flossing more (and I wish it took the place of it) but...one cannot have everything!  Smile.  I plan to get replacement brushes soon but thankfully one lasts for 3 mos so I&#x27;ve got time; just got mine about a month ago.  And, they sell the replacements at Wal-mart also.  My vote is that you should try it; you&#x27;re teeth and gums will thank you for it and along with the advance listerine I use, my mouth is MUCH fresher!  Kim :)</li>
    <li> I bought a Sonicare for my son about a year ago and did not pay attention to it. Once I read some reviews, I got so intrigued that I decided to buy one. I did  not know what I was missing!!! I have been using it for about three months now and I can&#x27;t believe that now I look forward to brush my teeth. It works like no other method to clean your teeth, the high frequency vibration does the trick. Not only your teeth are as clean as when you go to the dentist, but also you will notice that your gums become healthier.  It is worth every penny. I will never go back to the old electric or manual brush.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush because I tend to brush too hard. So, if you are using this product for the first time. It takes a little getting used to. Took about a week to adjust to the power brushing of the sonic care. Now, I absolutely love this toothbrush. It gives an overall clean you just can not get with a regular tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Nice electric toothbrush. Easy to use. Only problem, location of on/off swich makes it easy to accidently turn off while using. Otherwise it works fine.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare Elite finally gave out after many years of service.  Purchased this one and was surprised to find that the handle is slightly bigger than the old Elite.    Works just the same though, and at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a really great toothbrush. I wore out my last one so this was a replacement. It takes very little effort to do a great job cleaning your teeth and gums with the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this item. The first time this tooth brush lasted me more than five years (I did change the heads, though, don&#x27;t worry). So, I though I would be safe to buy it again and it is fairly inexpensive compared to other Phillips Sonicare Brushes. I haven&#x27;t had any cavities either since I have been using this thing. It must work!</li>
    <li> I had one of the first Sonicare models and this is definitely an upgrade. It is much lighter and more powerful. It does it&#x27;s job without any fancy buttons, shapes, heads, or angles. They also give you this great, small travel cover-case which I will take advantage of</li>
    <li> These brushes work fine, but the total operating cost is high due to planned obsolescence of:    (1) expensive brush heads wear out fast, and    (2) the little rubber blue-green on/off button wears out after about two years of use, leaving a gaping hole in the device handle, which causes the device to fail if exposed to water    This is a known quality control issue that Philips chooses not to address.</li>
    <li> I saw this model for ~$40 and I figured why not, lets give this thing a try.  Every dentist I got to swears by this, they always recommend it... it was time to take the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve been using this brush for just over 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how you MUST get this... EVERYONE should have one!  Your teeth and gums will feel great after it.  I really don&#x27;t know how to describe an amazing toothbrush more than saying go and get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve historically had problems with brushing too hard, I do use a soft brush but apparently I brush too hard and I was eroding my gums, the sonicare definitely resolves this issue, you just hold the brush and it does its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things worth noting:&lt;br /&gt;- if you&#x27;ve tried another electric brush, its not the same! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands but the frequency that this operates at is a just whole new level... hence the name \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- There are other more expensive models with timers, and screens and all of those bells &amp; whistles.  If you really have money to spend then go for it, otherwise this model is perfect: it has a built-in timer so after 2 minutes it auto shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;- You don&#x27;t need to purchase batteries for this and I suppose it will last a long time before having to replace the unit.  When you first get your brush you need to charge it for at least 24 hrs, after that I place it in the charger in the morning and it&#x27;ll be fully charged by the time I get back home from work... I do this once a week.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this toothbrush! I was using a sonic toothbrush up until a year ago when mine was lost during a move to a new place. During that years time, the health of my gums declined significantly, because of going back to manual brushing. Sonic technology not only cleans your teeth so much better, it also helps gum tissue stay so much healthier. Buying a sonic toothbrush is without a doubt one of the best things you can do for your health and this one in particular is a great value. I would suggest buying this one if your looking for the best value or if money is no issue then there are some with a few more features. I am more than happy with the price and effectiveness of this brush though!</li>
    <li> We bought two Sonicare brushes for our household.  After two years, the rubber covering weakened on the power button (on both brushes) and, ultimately, tore.  Water enters and, voila, the brush fails!  I contacted Sonicare and they brusquely told me that I could buy their newest brush!  How nice of them.  Despite the fact that many consumers have had the same problem (a design flaw), Sonicare will not stand by their product and replace the brushes.  I suppose they don&#x27;t care that we buy - bought - replacement brush heads every 3 months.  Well, we won&#x27;t anymore because I immediately ordered an Oral-B electric brush.  We&#x27;ll see how that brush performs.</li>
    <li> This is the second electric Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  I bought the first one about 15 years ago, on the advice of my periodontist.  It worked great, until it stopped holding its charge for a week.  In fact, it didn&#x27;t even hold its charge for a full 2-minute brushing.  A weekly charge is nice; I can go away for a weekend or so and not take the charger along.  Also, I know my gums are getting gentle stimulation and the brushing shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m replacing an old Sonicare Elite which I have loved using for over 10 years. It&#x27;s finally too grungy to get clean. The biggest disappointment with this one, is no 30 second interval beeping, which I LOVED about my Sonicare. I can&#x27;t even find the Elite now and why do companies change a good thing? I also don&#x27;t like the handle. It&#x27;s fatter/wider circumference than my old Sonicare and uncomfortable to hold. I was excited to buy this plus the little shields that go with it, but I&#x27;m returning it and going to research others. The Elite was sleek, simple, quiet and just right, plus didn&#x27;t look like a video game or tv changer. At this point, I may go with the competition.</li>
    <li> Our family dentist recommended these.  The kids love and use them.  Beats a manual toothbrush and reaches those hard to reach places.  Offers a thorough cleaning! Your gums will thank you.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  There is a two minute time period that all people should brush their teeth, this has a timer on it!!  Product care was harder.  I tried to register and the software threw me out and I had a very negative reaction to that.  The product itself is steller.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Sonicare toothbrush with this new one and I like it very much. The smaller brush head makes brushing easier.</li>
    <li> This is definitely worth the money and probably more. Within a week I noticed an improvement in my gum&#x27;s color and feeling.  Also my teeth are definitely whiter and I still drink coffee almost everyday :) My dental hygienist even commented on the improvement without knowing I had switched to the sonicare. I should also note that I switched from a different electric toothbrush so if you are still using a regular toothbrush you will probably notice even more of a change.    The construction is very sturdy. You do need to follow the instructions and only use very light pressure while brushing because you could break the the neck of the toothbrush. This isn&#x27;t really a downside though because light pressure is more than enough to clean your teeth and is supposed to be better for gum health too. So this is more of something to be aware of :)  The battery life is really long as well which is very nice for traveling.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed that Philips decided to cut corners in the production of new models of the Sonicare. I owned one for a few years a long time ago and it worked great - I could charge it fully, take it on vacation, and not worry about having to charge it or clean it on my trip. I lost that one but was excited to receive a new one for my wedding. 8 months later, the battery barely lasts one toothbrushing session. My husband and I were sharing the base and using different heads, but now we can&#x27;t both brush our teeth without charging it in between! Also, despite removing and air-drying the heads after every use as recommended, some really gross gunk builds up inside the head that is nearly impossible to get out. Ick. When this one dies for good I&#x27;m definitely going to try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product bought it about 6 years ago same time I got dropped from my parents dental/medical insurance, a week ago I went to the dentist after 6 years, I don&#x27;t floss or anything just three minutes morning and night, I was cavity free and had very little tarter build up.  My dentist said there is more tarter buildup on people who come every 6 month.  Now (6 years later) the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, it need a 2 hour charge for 3 minutes, and if I don&#x27;t put it n the charger, it will not be good for the next use.  Not Bad!  ohh and the head&#x27;s well for me last me a good 6 months.     Ohh and I think it was my fault that I fried the battery, I never fully discharged and then fully charge the battery like your suppose to every few months.</li>
    <li> Its a great toothbrush, just make sure you keep your mouth closed around the stem of the brush, otherwise its messy.  Doese a much better job than a regular toothbrush, keeps my teeth clean longer, that dentist feeling.</li>
    <li> The Essence has been my brush for the past three years and it is still going strong. I bought the Essence for the slim head which fits my mouth well, and even though it lacks some of the silly bells and whistles that the more expensive Elite model has, it was an excellent investment for me! I would recommend the Essence over the Elite, and use the savings to buy replacemet heads, which may people neglect to do, and which has much more of an impact on your oral health than lights and buzzers!</li>
    <li> I have tried many kinds of Electric tooth brushes, but I have never found one as good as the Phillips sonicare ,and the price is very reasonable for what you get</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I didn&#x27;t want to spend over 100 on one because I didn&#x27;t know if I was going to like/use it, but I didn&#x27;t want one of those cheap battery operated \\&quot;spin brushes\\&quot; either. I am very happy with my purchase. It has a small charge base so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my counter, and the brush gets my teeth super clean. I really like the 2 minute timer on it since I am very impatient with brushing I tend to put my manual toothbrush down before I should. My only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; with it, is that it is on the loud side, but I still gave it 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t buy the toothbrush based on the noise level-as long as my teeth are clean, it has served its purpose very well. In order to avoid what others here have complained about as far as keeping it clean, I bought [[ASIN:B001S2PLNK The Sonic Seal for E-Series Sonicare Replacement Heads (3 Pack of Blue, Pink, Frost)]], and have avoided that issue all together!</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended that I purchase this product to promote heather gums. I use it every chance I get and my teeth and gum line feels as if I have just left the dentist office. This is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for Christmas last year and was so impressed that I bought two for family members this Christmas.  Your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve just had them professionally cleaned, and the brush heads last a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for the Sonicare toothbrush I had been using for many years.  I was very disappointed to find that this model does not have the 30-second quadrant timing.  This may not seem like much, but I&#x27;ve come to use and depend on that timer over the years, and I had no reason to believe that my replacement Sonicare toothbrush would not have it.  I plan to replace this brush with an Oral B as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I ordered as a replacement to the Sonicare I had for years. I love this product, my dentist visits have been only for 6 month/Basic cleanings. What can i say but, my teeth sparkle!</li>
    <li> Awesome Toothbrush!! Works great, shipped really fast as well! Super Happy! Product was described well,Is exactly what seller described. Sonicare has a newer version out there but I found this one works just as well, and the price is great.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel cleaner and look whiter, since I started using the Philips Sonicare power toothbrush.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This gets my teeth way cleaner than a regular toothbrush,and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. Only think I dont like is that a crust ends up on the bottom of the toothbrush when you sit in the cradle. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> I have wanted a sonic toothbrush for years, and decided I would finally get one with an Amazon gift card I received for Christmas.  This brand was recommended by a friend, so I got the cheapest \\&quot;entry level\\&quot; model, which doesn&#x27;t have as many bells and whistles but gets the job done.  I like feeling as if I have just been to the dentist without actually having to go.  I also like that the toothbrush gradually builds to the most powerful setting automatically, and the 2 minute timer is nice too.  Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare toothbrush and I am AGAIN thrilled to have it! The first one I had (an Advanced) lasted nearly 10 yrs and I&#x27;m looking forward to having the same success with this one.   Since using Sonicare, I have noticed (as has my dental hygenist) that my teeth are in better shape, less plaque and less discoloring.    I love the Sonic action and the thorough job this product does on my teeth. I would recommend it to anyone.  Regarding care of the toothbrush, I am vigilant about drying it after every use and separate the head from the base regularly to wipe it off too. I&#x27;m convinced that keeping it clean and free of toothpaste does alot to extend the life of the product.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare worked perfectly for a few weeks, then all of the sudden holds no charge.  I did nothing to it.  I leave it in the charger all day or night or just for an hour - whatever I do now, it will not even let me brush for a full 2-minute cycle.  I get to brush for about 45 seconds, then I finish off with my normal toothbrush now.  Terrible value considering that it has a 3-week shelf life.  I really wish it just hadn&#x27;t worked from the get-go, because then I would NOT have thrown away my 5-year old Sonicare, which sadly held a charge for longer (2 minutes) than this \\&quot;new\\&quot; one.     TERRIBLE product!!!  Save your time and money and get a real one from Bed Bath and Beyond or somewhere like that.     Maybe this is an aftermarket product with non-original OEM batteries - that&#x27;d be my best guess.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have much experience, but I&#x27;m really happy with it. Amazon got it to me quickly and the price was about $30 cheaper than what I saw in stores. I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush to anyone considering making the switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same kind of toothbrushes for the past several years, and decided to buy another one. This one started working fine but after 30 days or so completely died. Amazon said the window of opportunity closed before I could return it so now I&#x27;m stuck.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Phillips toothbrush! A little intense the first brushing. Had my mouth all tingling..can\\&quot;t imagine using a regular toothbrush now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years now and it has held up really beautifully with daily use from a family of 4.</li>
    <li> Previously we used the Oral B power toothbrush, which worked very well. When it finally gave after about 5 yrs, we decided to try the Sonicare brushes. I like the &#x27;motion&#x27; of the sonicare toothbrush and find it gentle enough, yet strong enough to clean teeth well.  The Oral B is a rotating brush which provides exceptional cleaning; I believe that brush actually provides better cleaning. My biggest problem with the Sonicare e series is the design of the brush heads, which I believe creates a very unhealthy situation. It allows water, saliva and toothpaste to get in under the brush base, which lays stagnant inside the power handle and gets moldy. Disgusting! So, basically you must clean and dry the inside of the brush every day or so to keep the mold from forming. As a solution to this serious design flaw, you can buy the Sonic Seal for an additional $18. [[ASIN:B001S2PLNK The Sonic Seal for E-Series Sonicare Replacement Heads, 3 Count (Blue, Pink, Frost)]] I am finally breaking down and buying these, because I am very concerned about the mold contamination causing illness. I feel like Sonicare should be providing these to all customers who&#x27;ve purchased this model of toothbrush. I am tired of cleaning the brush base regularly, and if left a couple days, tired of the mold smell and tast that accumulates in the base if you  neglect it more than a couple of days.  I would opt for a different model of power brush in the future, one that does NOT use this type of base.  [[ASIN:B0046AAVR2 Philips Sonicare Hx7002/30 E-series Replacement Brush Head, White]]</li>
    <li> Sonicare got this product spot-on. A high quality sonic toothbrush at a very affordable price. I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for about 2 months now and have loved it. The battery holds charge for quite a long time (good for those who go on trips and don&#x27;t feel like messing with chargers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not loud, but it definitely has a distinct noise which some people are surprised by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean, and with the removable head storage is simple. Easily worth  the money.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats Phillips Sonicare HX5351/30 Essence in its functionality AT LOW PRICE. Easy to clean, easy to recharge I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> NOTE: This review is written with long term experience - I wish more reviews were that way but I understand that&#x27;s not always possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as promised, the pulsating action is strong and really cleans teeth well.  The two minute timer, in my opinion, could be a bit more generous.  When the battery is close to needing a charge, you&#x27;ll notice the pulsation is less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, a 24hr charge would give close to two weeks worth of usage.  Only two years later, I find myself charging it every other day.  I could live with its other flaws - such as frequent cleaning - but having to charge it after three uses makes it all but unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the issue about cleaning.  This model differs from every other Sonicare model in that the magnetically driven mechanism is partially incorporated into the screw-on brush head itself (the more expensive, slimmer models use a compact head that simply clicks into a metal rod).  There are more crevices in this type of head in which fluids and old toothpaste can gather.  If you don&#x27;t make a regular habit of cleaning the head, it can get quite disgusting.  I usually clean it thoroughly with isoprophyl alcohol every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is a very nice touch and comes in handy when on a trip or spending the night with relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good brush aside from the relatively short battery life and the need to clean frequently.  My next Sonicare will be one of the slimmer models.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very very powerful electric toothbrush I have ever used. My tooth surfaces are smooth same as a dental hygienist&#x27;s cleaning. Coffee stain could be removed about 60% and more. Also, this has a long battery life(the catalog data was right). I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using sonicare for about 1 year now. Right after I got this product, I noticed it cleans so much better than manual toothbrushes. Overall it left me with cleaner and whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the 2 minute smarttimer, I&#x27;m a little confused about what it should do. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that claim their toothbrush stops for 1 sec or so or flashes every 30 seconds to remind you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth. But for my  Essence 5300, it just stops after 2 mins and I don&#x27;t always divide it evenly on all my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 1 year, the battery dead!!! At first the battery works well and can last on a 4 days trip. But now after one year use,I have to charge it on the charging dock every time I finish using it, and leave it charging for like 12 hours. Then it lasts only once and needs charging right after the next use! It&#x27;s annoying because I have to keep my charging dock plugged in all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update, contacted philips about the dead battery and they replaced the battery for me! great custom service, changed the rating to 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My husband and I had purchased Oral-B Sonic by Braun Electric Toothbrushes a few years back.  Never had a problem with them.  My husband&#x27;s brush finally wore out and I decided to get him a new one last Christmas(2011).  I went on Amazon and checked out the electric toothbrushes.  Amazon was having their Online after Thxgiving special prices and this Phillips Sonicare Essence Electric Toothbrush Model #HX5351/30 was on sale.  I guess I didnt notice that the last review was in 2005 or 2006, that should have been my first clue, that no one is buying these toothbrushes.  I read the reviews that were dated before that time, the reviewers seemed to be okay with their purchase of this toothbrush.  So, I decided to get this one for my husband instead of the Oral B Sonic by Braun.  BIG MISTAKE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design on  the Essence by Phillips Sonicare is awful.  My husband brushes his teeth 3 to 4x a day and there is black crud dripping from the inside of the toothbrush. When he screws off the top, there is this black crud, mold, whatever it is that is gross.  We never had to to take our Oral-B Sonic toothbrushes apart to clean them and when we put on a new brush head on our old Oral B Sonic, there was never any black crud/mold that had to be cleaned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the 1-800-682-7664 # and spoke with a cust rep named Josh who told us that after every brushing, the consumer is suppossed to unscrew the toothbrush and clean it out!!  I asked him if he knew how ridiculous that sounds?  I then asked for his supervisor, and a \\&quot;Drew\\&quot; came on the phone.  I repeated what I told Josh, that the tothbrush was still under warranty and I had went online to fill out the extended warranty info for an extra 6 months.  I had asked for a refund because Drew said they couldnt issue a refund just possibly send another Essence.  Why would we want another toothbrush that keeps black gook/mold inside it?  He said he couldnt help me he would have to send my complaint to \\&quot;upper mgmt\\&quot; andwe would hear back from someone with one business day.  Well, the one day has come and gone and I decided to write this review so other consumers will think twice before purchasing  this poorly constructed toothbrush.  This one should be taken off the market.  Try the Oral-B Sonic brushes by Braun.  We will never buy a Phillips Product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if there was a zero rating for this product, thats what I would rate it as it does not even deserve a rating of one.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than an Oral B.  In just a few brushings you get used to the vibration. Luv it</li>
    <li> Wow! My Teeth have never been cleaner. I put off purchasing this for a long time because I thought the price point was pretty high, even though it is rather low for quality electric brushes. I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited, this product is simply amazing on how it cleans teeth and holds a charge. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a week now (going strong on a single charge). I noticed a couple reviewers commented on the hassle of the cleanup. I wipe the inside out with a cotton ball every-time, which does not seem like a super hassle as the next price point up is more than I&#x27;m willing to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I&#x27;ve come across is that it is not an effective brush for brushing your tongue. If you like to really thoroughly brush your tongue, then save your manual toothbrush for that task. But this is a superior product for clean teeth. Every time I brush, it feels hygienist clean. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> We had the Elite but it died. This seems to be doing a good job. A bit heavier. Aligns on the charge quite well. No 30 second per quadrant timer, but who cares. I just keep going till it shuts off, ha ha. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Leaves your teeth feeling super clean after use! Battery life is amazing and it does the job for a great price!!</li>
    <li> For what you pay this brush is excellent. It has great power, almost like being in a dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning. But make sure the cap holding the brush is securely fastened or you might get lower power. This happened to me. When I removed the cap to clean it after a couple of weeks of use I realized the cap was not securely attached. After putting it fully in place, wow. It does all that it advertises.</li>
    <li> A reliable workhorse that has saved me from many a cavity.</li>
    <li> 1) Head shape is not circular like other toothbrushes, and is not as effective.  2) You must use Philips Sonicare head replacements which will ultimately cost you $40+ a year.  3) Design flaws will lead the product to get dirty easily under the head.    I would recommend the Oral B Professional toothbrushes instead :)!</li>
    <li> My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe how great my teeth looked after switching to the Sonic Care E series. Love it--brighter, whiter and no buildup so less time in the dental chair.I agree with other reviews--just keep it clean after each use and there aren&#x27;t any issues.</li>
    <li> I was using the CVS Sonic toothbrush, and needed replacement heads. I found that Phillips heads cost less, but are not interchangeable with CVS, so I also bought the Phillips power brush. What a difference! The Phillips Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush puts out a far stronger vibration that I feel is really cleaning my teeth. I intended to keep the CVS for a backup, but it now seems so feeble that I will not ever use it.[[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White]]</li>
    <li> Years ago, I had a sonicare and loved it but it eventually stopped working and my husband got me an oral-B triumph as a replacement. I never really cared for the triumph, so when it started to die, I ordered this one. I was worried about buying the base model but couldn&#x27;t rationalize spending $20 more for a few more features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this model and definitely feel sonicare is superior to other rechargeable toothbrushes. My teeth feel cleaner and the way the sonicare feels on my gums, I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re getting a better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing I noticed, though, is how the inside doesn&#x27;t get disgusting like my old electric toothbrush. I read reviews that it&#x27;s harder to clean than the more expensive sonicare models, but I was pleasantly surprised with how easy the brush head unscrews and detaches for cleaning. The instructions say to do this once a week, so it&#x27;s really not a lot of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never try another brand and this model has everything I need for a great price.</li>
    <li> I started getting them in about 1987 and have always been satisfied.  They last a long time, though not forever.  I actually got the best price this time from Amazon plus an extended warranty for registering my product on line.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for helping keep your teeth clean if used properly.  Follow the instructions closely and you will get the best results.</li>
    <li> A long time ago, I had the first generation Sonicare.  I considered getting a newer model than the e-series when my CVS sonic toothbrush gave up the ghost but decided I did not want to spend the money--especially after reading one of the reviews here that said that the e-series left his teeth cleaner than a newer model with more bells and whistles and a bigger price tag.  I am a coffee drinker--what they say about removing coffee stains is true.  After only a week and a half, I see and feel a big difference.  If you want to save money, you can&#x27;t go wrong getting the \\&quot;old tech\\&quot; e-series brush.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare line of products.  I purchased this to replace one of a set.  I was bummed to discover it does not give you the 30-second-change-position tone.  I&#x27;ve been using them for so long, I know when to shift but I do miss that beep.</li>
    <li> I have bought it with suggestion of my dentist, and I am very happy with the new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;2min Timer great.&lt;br /&gt;Vibration is great for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Charge goes up to 15 Days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> Every time I brush, my mouth feels really clean. Does a great job way better in two minutes compared to 5 minutes with a manual.  Must have it product.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare works flawlessly, a reasonable addition for anyone wanting a powerful electric toothbrush.  It does take some getting use to; I love it, husband does not and prefers his &#x27;manual&#x27; model.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush lives up to the description and reviews. Easy to use, easy to keep charged.  Leaves teeth and gums clean , feels great!  Recommend highly !</li>
    <li> Hi,  I believe this is the best value in electric toothbrushes as of December 30, 2011.  Last year I purchased my wife the high end Sonicare brush (yes, Mr. Romantic here!).  It cost $170.00.  That was a slimmer model then this one, but that is where the real difference ends.  The brush heads are almost identical in shape and makeup, the action feels the same.  This one has a few less options but still has the two minute timer and the gentle gum initial start up.  I was dissappointed in the $170 as just about the 12 month mark the battery quit.  Can&#x27;t really replace the battery yourself...they sell them but have to dismantle the brush, remove solder on old battery and then solder the new battery in....not for the average person.  Getting back to this brush.  The handle is a bit thicker then the high end Sonicare and is a bit heavier....but neither are a real factor in comfort.  It is still slim and lightweight.  It appears this battery is much better and longer lasting....and at around $40 it is a steal of a deal.  Our teeth feel just as clean and look just as white as with the high end model.    Summary.  Save yourself some time and comparison.  The small, non important increase in features of the other Sonicare models simply don&#x27;t justify the substantial cost difference.  This will clean your teeth and leave you feeling as fresh as a trip tot he dentist.  Thanks for viewing my comments.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush has a light that flashes during recharging. I put a towel over it because the flashing light drives you crazy for 1/2 an hour at night.</li>
    <li> My dentist wanted me to use a Sonicare toothbrush, but they&#x27;re generally so expensive! I got this one since it&#x27;s the least expensive, and I love it! I especially love the 2 minute timer, because it makes me brush for that long, even if I feel like I&#x27;ve brushed enough! Soft brushhead and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this believing it was identical to an older unit of similar model number that my wife has.  On hers, the brush runs for 30 seconds, beeps, runs another 30 seconds, etc for (4) intervals which makes it easy to time the brushing of each quadrant in your mouth.  On this unit, the timer runs for two minutes with no intervals and the brush stops.  You have to estimate that amount of time you are spending brushing each quadrant of your mouth.  If one reads the description carefully, this is no different than stated.  Not a huge deal, but I was disappointed that the feature is not included on the newer models.  Granted you can still get this feature if you buy a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> This product works well and I am happy I got the tooth brush.  I would recommend this product It also has a travel case</li>
    <li> I am unhappy with this product. There is only one setting and it goes WAY too fast. The toothpaste falls right off before you can truly get going! It feels way too rough on my sensitive teeth. I wish it had another setting that would go a bit slower.</li>
    <li> Love the timer on it as it lets me know i have brushed long enough, and the small brush head allows to easily to move around in the mouth. Great product, MY sister was RIGHT! she has had one for over 10 years and encouraged me to buy it. Now i am glad i did.</li>
    <li> Not at all happy with this product.  I made a big mistake purchasing it.  I cannot figure out how it can do what it purports to be able to do.  I need a sound proof booth to use it - the noise of its operation wakes up the whole house.  Please check it out before you continue to promote its sale and use any further.  I do not know what to do with it.  I have tried to think of some way that it can be of use to me.  So far I have not succeeded.    My personal rating of &#x27;buying intelligence&#x27; has taken a severe tumble.    Perhaps I should have checked it out with a retailer before considering the purchase.  I imagine buying with blind knowledge has its drawbacks.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift, in response to a specific request.  It is used often and has improved dental check ups.</li>
    <li> This was a great father&#x27;s day present. Shipping was a little frustrating, but once the shipment got here it made my parents both very happy. I was able to buy two Sonicare Toothbrushes from Amazon. They love them and I&#x27;m buying one for myself too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrush for over 10 yrs. This recent purchase is timely for me as my old one&#x27;s battery no longer works after 3 yrs or so. I particularly like the improved stem part which is smaller size than my previous model. Major improvement is the rubber seal which minimizes moisture getting through the threads of the screw lock (which holds the brush component) into the bottom part of the brush. Battery been doing well for the past few weeks. I charge the battery once a week &amp; it is more than sufficient in powering the brushing twice daily. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This was a great product at a great price!  I&#x27;m thrilled with the performance and the battery life--five stars aren&#x27;t enough!</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare, got it as one of my Christmas presents from my hubby :)  however since I started to use it I can feel that the inside of my lips are very sensitive and almost irritated, it feels like when you eat lots of popcorn... but other than that, this product is great :)</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Essence is an amazing product for the money.  Each portion of the product is easy to use and understand, and it all seems incredibly well made.  This is my second Sonicare system over 5 years and will again save me so much greif at the dentist office for years to come.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric toothbrush.  If you want a timer for each of the four quadrents - it doesn&#x27;t have it.  For the price this is a good deal if you don&#x27;t need the timer.  Too bad water gets into it and has to be cleaned weekly or you get a terrible odor in it.  The older models did not do this prior to Philips taking over the company.  Philips also now says you have to replace the heads every three months.  The old company said it had to be replaced every 6 months.  Philips makes a ton of money off the heads and it is a big rip off to replace them every 3 months.  I change them every 6 months and see no difference.</li>
    <li> The product is well priced, works as expected. It takes some practice to avoid splashing the paste while using it. It needs to be cleaned by unscrewing the handle every time, but this is no big issue. There is a stand for the handle and the brush an leave them there for next use</li>
    <li> I bought this and my teeth feel wonderful.  Better thing is my gums are just fine and my dentist is amazed at how fantastic my teeth and gums are every time I have my bi-yearly checkup...you don&#x27;t want gingivitis so get this and USE it, especially brushing your tongue too.</li>
    <li> This model has the best combination of features for the price in an electric toothbrush, and the toothbrush has immediately made a difference in my gums and teeth, after only a few days. I&#x27;ll not go without anymore!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really does the job. Need to clean and dry properly after each use. This should be emphasized more in product  instructions. Also should get two heads with initial purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this product and would like to buy another one for my wife. I should have bought this product much earlier.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my cordless brush with this Sonicare after many years of using Oral B products.  I like that the Sonicare has a bigger brush (covers more real estate); but the handle IS a little bulky in my hand.  Other than that I have NO complaints.  It works as designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/14/2013 Update:  I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 3.  I finally trashed this product and went back to Oral B.  The handle is a hollow cylinder that collects water.  Mineral deposits and probably mold form in the interior of the handle and create a nasty smell.  I will stick with Oral B products from now on.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and would highly recommend it to others.  It may not have all of the fancy bells and whistles as the more expensive models, but it still does the job.  I agree with other reviewers that you should purchase this product and use the extra money saved to buy replacement heads.  It&#x27;s a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my current Sonicare, which I love.  But this model of the Sonicare is a piece of crap. It does not have the 30-second beeper, and it is awkward in the hand, lacking the rubber grips of my prior Sonicare, it is easily dropped.  It is too late to return it, but I will toss it in the trash as soon as I get some sort of replacement.</li>
    <li> I regret not listening to other buyers&#x27; comments. I went for this cheaper model and it is disgusting because of the screw-on design. Then I had to spend $17 more for a rubber cover to fix this problem. Do yourself a favor, pay a bit more and get the flex-care design instead.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth Brush, It gets my teeth super clean.  I wake up looking forward to brushing my teeth because of the gum massage.  It&#x27;s just a fun toothbrush.  It wasn&#x27;t too harsh at all.  The two settings work beautifully if your gums are extra sensitive as well...  If you happen to see this Brush on Sale like I did... BUY IT!</li>
    <li> The design of the body impractical and unhygienic - it fills up with water and toothpaste and spit presumably, and needs to be emptied and cleaned. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is faulty and the head won&#x27;t come off (others have tried) so another waste of money after paying over $30 for the replacement brushes.Seems like it is soldered on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think I deserve a refund to be honest or a replacement product/toothbrush. Braun Oral B is so much better.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product based on information from my dentist on various electric toothbrushes.  I had a coupon from my dentist and the company offered a rebate so I determined it would be worth a try.  The company stated since I used a coupon on the purchase they wouldn&#x27;t honor their rebate.  I have not seen any better oral results then a disposable electric toothbrush.  The cost ended up being considerably more than I thought I was going to pay when I thought I was using the coupon from the dentist and the rebate offered. The cost of the replacement toothbrushes is quite expensive too.  I had intended on buying one for each of my four children but I will pass on that.</li>
    <li> Had the Phillips Sonicare Hx5351/30  a little over a year when I noticed it was not holding a charge for a week. Now after 19 months I have to charge it every other night. Do not like the handle as it is not easy to hang onto when my hand is wet. Brushes the teeth very good. Anoying when the charge goes out.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. It packs a lot more of a punch than a non-sonic electric brush. The vibration produced a tickling sensation in my gums the first few days of use, but I quickly got used to it. If you are an open mouth brusher, then make sure you use a thick toothpaste to minimize splatter. I originally had problems with mold forming on the seal of the brush head. I replaced the brush and began shaking the water out by turning the brush on and shaking it upside down until you know longer see little droplets of water flying out from the seal area. I began doing this every time I used the brush, and I haven&#x27;t had a mold problem since. It is also very effective at drying out the bristles of the brush, thus eliminating the need to flick it with your finger and bang it on the edge of the sink. You should still remove the brush head and clean it weekly as the manufacturer says to do.</li>
    <li> Purchased one of these at Target for 39.99 in Aug 2011.  Philips says battery charge will last up to two weeks. Not true. Twelve hours max. until it is completely dead then takes another 12 hours+ to charge back.  REBATE? Philips had a $10.00 rebate-refused to pay it because a \\&quot;discount\\&quot; was taken at the cash register. There was no \\&quot;instant rebate etc\\&quot; The $39.99 was a \\&quot;Target\\&quot; sale price. I resent the rebate back and received the same card from Philips-\\&quot;sorry no rebate\\&quot;  Stay away from this \\&quot;product\\&quot; Before Philips bought out the original Soniccare, made in Snoqualamie, Wa. it WAS a quality product. Not any more. Back to the store it went.  EDIT: Sonicare sent me the rebate after I complained via their  e-mail customer survey -    Replacement toothbrush (Sonicare w/nickelmetal/hydride battery is working well so far. The first brush had NiCad batteries. Nov.2011</li>
    <li> I bought this back in December and by mid-February the battery in the base wouldn&#x27;t take/hold a charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Phillips&#x27; service number and they had a new base unit sent out to me at no cost and included a pre-paid return label for me to ship the defective base unit back to them. So far, the new unit is working fine but only time will tell if it holds up better than the first one.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my teeth feel so much cleaner than ordinary tooth brushes. It is important to me to take great care of my teeth. They are the only ones I have. The Philips Sonicare makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this type of toothbrush.  I was wrong, I really like using it.  It cleans teeth much better than manually brushing.</li>
    <li> Really horrible quality. I spent over $100 on two handles and both batteries were dead in just over a year.  Used and stored exactly as instructed.  Please spare yourself a poor purchase.  Find an alternate manufacturer. Or, save your receipt for the 2 year warranty, you&#x27;ll definitely need it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this toothbrush just over two years ago. It cleans your teeth very well, as pointed out in many reviews. However, just after passing the warranty period (2 years) the rechargeable battery has died and will no longer hold a charge.  I called Philips customer service (after receiving no response to my inquiries via email) and they were completely unwilling to assist in any way because the toothbrush was out of the warranty period. I asked the customer service rep if this was a manufacturing defect or if it was unusual.  She said she receives this type of call all day long, every day, regarding battery failure. She said it generally fails before 3 years.  The price for this toothbrush (as well as replacement heads) does not justify a useful life of only 2 years.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great. I feel my teeth are really clean after every use. The timer sets off after 2 minutes which I think is adequate time for brushing.  The only problem with this brush that its not sealed really well. The manual says to clean every week but I feel the need to clean it after every use since the water and toothpaste gets inside the cover. Cleaning is easy but I&#x27;d rather avoid if I can. I heard the newer model - flexcare doesn&#x27;t have this problem but again its more than double the cost.</li>
    <li> My husband loved his Sonicare, so he decided to buy me one too.  I like the 2-minute timer, which was a surprise feature for me.  This toothbrush leaves my sensitive teeth smooth and clean, without being too harsh on my gum line. Definitely a good buy.  It gets high marks at our house.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush is above and beyond what I expected.  Am going to buy my son one too.  Great product and a great price.</li>
    <li> The inside of where the tooth brush attaches to the motor gets really gross.  Mold gross in there constantly, and we keep it clean.  The other Sonicare with the smaller toothbrush attachment is way better and doesn&#x27;t have a cesspool growing inside.</li>
    <li> I had heard others talk about this product but never really paid much attention to them.  I decided one day to order one to see what all the hype was about. All i can say is I love it. My teeth are cleaner and seems to stay fresh all day and the best thing is I bought extra heads and my son loves to brush his teeth now.</li>
    <li> I stayed up late the day before Thanksgiving trying to determine what Black Friday sales would give me the biggest bang for my buck.  After awhile I started to notice that all of the \\&quot;deals\\&quot; were really only a few dollars apart.  Did I want to hit up Target at midnight, or Sears at 4 am...?  On a whim, I looked up the object of my desire (one Sonicare toothbrush, regular price: Ridiculous) on Amazon.com.  I saw that not only was it priced comparably to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; stores, but there was also no shipping and handling because of the price (and the Black Friday marketing, but mostly the price)!  Seven seconds later, it was ordered and pending delivery.  The real kicker is that it was delivered ON Black Friday!  I&#x27;m always a little nervous when ordering on-line.  There are few things that are more of a hassle (to me) then returning something I bought online.  But this toothbrush is perfect - perfect!  It&#x27;s a different, more stream lined version then my last Sonicare, but the vibration is the same (gentle, almost relaxing).  It doesn&#x27;t have the same timer beep thing as my last one - so I could be sure I&#x27;d spent enough time on each section of my teeth.  But it does have an automatic shut off, so I know that overall I&#x27;ve spent enough time in my mouth.  I love that there was even a little charge in it, so I could use it right out of the box (yes, I did, I wanted to know it worked!).  As usual, ordering from Amazon was easy and rewarding.  That&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;ve ordered something from them almost every day last week... ;))</li>
    <li> i have problems with my gums and have soft enamel problems so i wanted to get a new brush that was better than the normal ones. after trying this i noticed better results with less time used because of the vibrating tip. the tip is smaller than i expected but it works great in small areas. the vibrating tip makes your toothpaste into a creamy solution instead of chunky like normal tooth brushes which helps it go into small areas.     i like the rechargeable base and the vibrating brush works well. it makes my gums and teeth feel smoother.    the bad things so far is that i got a phillips box instead of an amazon box which had a broken &#x27;tamper resist&#x27; sticker on it. apparently someone opened my box  before me but i still used it. another small problem is how loud this is. ON THE FIRST DAY of owning the toothbrush, a strand of the brushing material came off in my mouth. kinda strange but it was only one.</li>
    <li> Phillips advised me that this model went into production in 2005.  I am personally disappointed as it does not have the Quad-Pacer function that many others do.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised no problems and runs great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had it for about a month now and it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush.  Made my teeth feel freaky clean.  Not the best option for brushing your tongue (that&#x27;s better with a regular brush), but the vibrations from the toothbrush really massage the gum line.</li>
    <li> This is such a cute little toothbrush, and it does exactly what it says.  Very nice charger, stays charged for a LONG time.  Very happy with the product!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have had since a child, but I must say. It works wonderful, feels like I have been to the dentist. I love the feature that shuts off the unit after a while but also the beeping to move on to another section of your mouth. Throughly impressed, can&#x27;t wait for my husband to us as well, ordered additional heads so we both could enjoy the experience. Very pleased with two uses. I don&#x27;t think I will ever revert back to a regular manual toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> I got my first Sonicare tooth brush when the first generation came out. The battery finally died in that one. So I purchased this new one. It&#x27;s just as good as the first one. Hope it lasts as long!</li>
    <li> As always Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush is the best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;This is the third one I have purchased in 20 years. A good track record in my opinion.</li>
    <li> If this one lasts as long as the first Essence I will be just as impressed and will still have my pearly whites another 20 something years. Thank you.</li>
    <li> When my dentist told me to get one I thought my teeth were fine. This sonicare is great. It is well worth way more than it cost.  My teeth are a lot cleaner and you brush longer than you would with a regular tooth brush. I wish I would have bought one when they first came out.</li>
    <li> I already owned one but it was about 7 years old and was losing some of its oomph so to speak. There was no doubt in my mind about replacing it with another Sonicare. This is really great and the brush is smaller than my original one making it even easier to reach the back teeth. I hope it will last as long as the first one!&lt;br /&gt;And, my hygienist recommended this brand as well.</li>
    <li> excellent and has great features. Reliable, recommended by dentist. I will buy another when this wears out. buy, buy buy</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it a ultrasonic toothbrush for a better tartar control, since my saliva is to acid (causes tartar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the very first time I saw something removing or AT LEAST keeping control of my tarter. Made my dentist happy on the superior quality to other models she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a great combination of quality and finishing. It&#x27;s made in a very solid plastic, lasts a long time in the sort of glossy finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for about 3 weeks before needing to recharge, although by the end of the 2nd week it gets around 80% of the total power only. Something noticeable if you&#x27;re a geek like me. The flashing light warns you to recharge and the full cycle takes about 8 hours to complete, just a night charging is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a plastic solid case, good quality, for traveling. Not sure why but it uses too much space and ended up giving up using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base optional for using and holding the parts separated (brush and electric base) make a problem if you use it: Mold!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m serious, Philips should think on a new design for the toothbrush, it&#x27;s the ONLY place where mold is something you do NOT wish for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try not to detach the two parts for somedays you&#x27;ll notice the mold inside of it and every couple of weeks you MUST clean it! I use hot water and alcohol (Philips doesn&#x27;t mention it on the manual or anywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the purpose it&#x27;s a great product and it&#x27;d be perfect if there was no mold !!!</li>
    <li> Good value.  Works for what I need.  Not looking for anything too fancy, just something functional for daily use at moderate cost.</li>
    <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d like an electric toothbrush, but now uses it religiously.  She said it&#x27;s like being at the dentist.</li>
    <li> Best brush by far. I bought the model below this one twice and it broke both times. Finally I stepped up and never had any regrets.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended Sonicare to me so when my battery powered toothbrush bit the dust, I ordered the e series Sonicare. It really does great cleaning teeth. I have lots of plaque so need extra brushing to remove. This one does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for a goodly number of years and this is my third model. The first one eventually died when the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button finally gave out, and the last one was just slowly dying and not holding a charge well. This model comes with one brush head and a single charger. There&#x27;s a small plastic *stand* that is rather cheapish, but I still have a nice wall holder from one of my previous models. As with the previous ones I&#x27;ve owned, it is easy to get started and using right away after a full charge, and I&#x27;ve already noticed my teeth feel cleaner than the brushing I was getting from my aging model. There is a travel case that comes with this, nothing fancy but serviceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with the previous ones with gunk build up as other reviewers have mentioned and I plan on making a serious effort to dry this one off well after each use. As for competitor products, I did get a chance at an Oral B model last year via Amazon Vine. I really liked it a lot, and had some nice features that the Sonicare doesn&#x27;t, but there was one big problem - the Oral B had a rechargeable battery that needed replacement. And if you think getting at that battery is an easy task, let me set you straight. I spent a lot of time on the net and YouTube trying to get good instructions and still couldn&#x27;t get the casing open. Finally gave up and trashed it.</li>
    <li> After only four weeks or so, this Philips toothbrush started to randomly stop in the middle of the tooth brushing. Unusable.</li>
    <li> since I have been using Sonicare brush my dentist always reports excellent results</li>
    <li> This Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Power Toothbrush was suggested by my dentist.  This is the second one I have had.  The first one lasted more than 10 years (with new replacement heads).  I have not found this item anywhere at this low cost.  It was sent to me very quickly by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I got my Sonicare Essence 6 months ago and just went for my first cleaning since I bought it. The hygienist was thrilled at how much cleaner my teeth were. I usually get the skeptical treatment from dentists in terms of lots of \\&quot;Do you eat a lot of sugar?\\&quot; and \\&quot;Are you SURE you floss?\\&quot; I feel like this was the first time my dentist has actually thought I was doing a good job taking care of my teeth in maybe my entire life. So, yay, it&#x27;s obviously effective.    On the other hand, this is clearly the \\&quot;basic\\&quot; model because dang, it&#x27;s ridiculous to sell a product that grows scads of mold in it pretty much instantly. I don&#x27;t want to clean that gunk out of something I put in my MOUTH, you guys!     I guess it had the desired effect though because I&#x27;m totally convinced of the goodness of the Sonicare concept and when this one inevitably breaks, I&#x27;ll probably pony up for the fancier one in hopes that I won&#x27;t have to clean it out as often.</li>
    <li> This is our second Sonicare. The first one finally gave out -- maybe the on/off switch-- after at least 15+ years. We replace the brushes as recommended. The result is great dental health. My dentist actually asked if I had a Sonicare after a check up. The only downside to this basic model is lack of the 30 second timer which we had on the original.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and with two heads we share one base between my husband and I.  We love the automatic two-minute off feature which helps us rember to go the two full minutes.  The charge lasts a long time and its pretty durable as we have successfully knocked it off the counter a few times.</li>
    <li> I just had to replace my Sonicare toothbrush, the 1st one has been used everyday for 11 years.  Based on the good service from my 1st one and the good reports from my dentist, there was no question in my mind to purchase another Sonicare.  And once again Amazon came thru with the best price and very good service.</li>
    <li> I purchased three Sonicare E-series toothbrushes from Amazon. They work great, and my teeth have that cleaned-by-the-dentist clean feeling everyday! I wish they had included identifying color rings with the toothbrush (only gray ring is included by default), however I also bought [[ASIN:B002TUU5D6 The Sonic Seal for FlexCare (Pack of Blue, Frost and Pink)]] silicone covers for the brushes. They really help keep water and dirt out of the handle and the glow-in-the-dark colors are perfect for identifying each brush. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush, it is reasonably priced and with free shipping it&#x27;s hard to find better value.</li>
    <li> Santa brought me a Sonicare this past Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get around to trying it until a month later. Wish I&#x27;d got one years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Used with some clover compound (silica based toothpaste) really shined up my 50 year old choppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...But now it&#x27;s May, and the brush only holds charge for five or six brushings, then it&#x27;s dead.&lt;br /&gt;No idea what model since I didn&#x27;t save the wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;Phillips is so proud of their product they didn&#x27;t see fit to put a model number or any identification on it. It looks like the one in the Hx5351 picture but doesn&#x27;t have all the cack pictured with it, other than the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d have given it five stars a month ago. Now, with battery life that won&#x27;t even last a long weekend, I can&#x27;t see giving it any stars...</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t like it.  Noise, fit in mouth, hard to control, small brush, extra thing on shelf, hard to clean.</li>
    <li> Other than the yucky stuff accumulating inside the brush head, the toothbrush worked well while it lasted. The biggest problem is the battery life. After a little over 1 year of usage, the battery could only last for one 2-minute brush. I had to put it on the charger every time I finished brushing. The fully charged battery won&#x27;t hold power either, as it would become powerless after setting aside for just a couple of hours. For an expensive electric toothbrush, it is not acceptable for the battery to last for only over one year. I have replacement heads that are still in the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for me, this happened while the product was still under warranty. The customer support sent me a new handle. I&#x27;d like to say that the customer support was helpful. I had no receipt, but it turned out the serial number is printed inside the handle. They can tell from the serial number that my product was still under warranty.  For this reason, I gave the product a two star, instead of a one star. But I can imagine the frustration of people whose toothbrush died right after the warranty expired.</li>
    <li> I liked the specs on this toothbrush, but when I received it the handle was gigantic so I ultimately decided to purchase the philips sonicare because its handle was much slimmer. If this handle was smaller though it would be a homerun.</li>
    <li> Very good product, at a good price. This is my 3rd one, the others lasted about 3-4 years, before the battery started to give out, so it is a very good value.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist for gum line cleaning.  It has worked well so far, but hard getting used to the vibrating bristles.</li>
    <li> Bought one for each of my kids - dentist said spinbrush are not worth it and get a good Sonicare! Great price! Get replacement heads for every 6 months and take apart to dry when not using it or it will mold inside.</li>
    <li> Switching from a manual brush gave me the cleanest teeth that I&#x27;ve had in years. The battery is good, and the induction charger means there are no metal contacts to rust or corrode. The vibrating brush itself cleans really well.    A great purchase, especially at this price!</li>
    <li> I agree with the rest of the reviews that this works great. I have had it for couple of weeks now and I have been very happy so far.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been telling me over and over to get the Sonicare Toothbrush.  A bit pricey in their office, seemed too expensive at stores.  Finally saw this price and done!  After using it I now see why my dentist was so insistive.  I had been using an inexpensive Oral B rotating round brush.  It seemed to work good, certainly better than a plain toothbrush.  But once using the Sonicare I now see what all the fuss is about.  It is a DENTAL TOOL.  It does not &#x27;rotate, spin, up-and-down or back-and-forth like others.  It vibrates thousands of times....it is SONIC.  You take the brush off the handle and can see it works on some electronic/magnetic vibration.  There is no direct mechanical connection with the brush.....it is some type of magnet and oscilating electronic field in the handle.  Instructions advise you may need a few times to adapt...and I did.  It tickled.....but a few uses and you get adjusted.  Just a few seconds of using it and you know it is the best!  Think of the ultrasonic cleaning tool the dentist uses but soft with brushes and you&#x27;re driving it.  Final point: per instructions, it will hold the charge for use when traveling for at least 1 week of use. I am a convert.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this toothbrush on Amazon for about $39, I received it in the frustration free packaging about 4 days early (I picked super saver free shipping too).  I assembled the toothbrush and immediately used it, and let me say I was amazed.  My teeth felt much cleaner than anytime I have ever been to the dentist.  This brush has great reviews, and they are absolutely true.  My teeth felt like a frictionless surface and when I run my tongue over my teeth it feels amazing.  My gums, teeth, and tongue feel extremely clean and refreshing, as well as relaxed.  I have sensitive teeth, and sometimes after I would brush my teeth with a normal electric toothbrush they would feel sore or be even more sensitive.  I was also very impressed with the way the brush&#x27;s mechanics work because there are literally no exposed moving parts or metal for the charger.  This makes it MUCH easier to clean, and harder for someone like me to break accidentally!! I would strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who really wants the most absolute clean feeling in their mouth.</li>
    <li> product does just as promised by sonicare.  highly recommend for price and quality.  doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of higher priced units but who uses those extras anyway.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement of an older Sonicare toothbrush which failed to accept charge.  I like the new smaller brush which seems to get into the rear teeth areas much better than the older brush style.  The price on Amazon was great (in fact I find that the price has been raised for current purchases).</li>
    <li> This was a replacement and have always like this product</li>
    <li> I really like the Sonicare but the one I purchased on-line doesn&#x27;t have the timer function which indicates when to switch to the next quadrant of one&#x27;s mouth.  The description indicates that it should have that so I was sold a faulty product.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush also came with a case for travel. I think it is super nifty and for less than 40$ its a great deal. I defiantly can tell the difference brushing.</li>
    <li> Before I say anything about the way this is listed I do want to say the product is a good product.  This is just advertised falsely as new when it is used.      If you look at the pictures one of them says this \\&quot;Only the charger is used for a couple of times. Otherwise brand new!\\&quot;      Sorry, but if the charger was used for a couple of times, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; it&#x27;s USED.  I was ready to buy this when I saw that notation. I ended up buying this on eBay for less money than Amazon has it listed for now.    Amazon shows it&#x27;s condition as new and I let them know what the image said weeks ago and they agreed it&#x27;s not new but they still have it listed as \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;.       It&#x27;s a bit confusing if it says it&#x27;s sold by Amazon and yet it has been open and used.  This has got to be sold by some individual.    I don&#x27;t want to purchase something as personal as a toothbrush if someone has touched it and apparently they have if the charger was used.      If that picture with the notation doesn&#x27;t belong to this particular item, it should be removed as not to make people think it&#x27;s a used product.      This makes me wonder how many other items have been open and used but listed as new and as sold by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Phillips Sonicare Essence for approximately 6 months now. The toothbrush is fantastic for the way in which it cleans my teeth and makes my mouth feel like I just walked out of the dental office.  The brush is powerful and provides a pleasant massage for my gum line. The recharging last for an adequate time and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with having the toothbrush run out of electricity.      Unfortunately, there is a problem with the design of this toothbrush.  At first you won&#x27;t notice, but when you do have to replace the head don&#x27;t be surprised to find  mold on the interior of the brush head as well as in the unit.  The first time I found this problem I thought that maybe it was me.  Perhaps I got too much water in the head when I was rinsing my brush off or perhaps toothpaste seeped through the edges.  I did a web search on sonicare mold and got quite a few hits.  It seems like this is a problem with the brush design.  I decided to clean out the unit and try with a new head.  For two months I have been very careful, to not get the unit too wet (the brush does get wet when I brush my teeth ).  I always rinse the head off with water and dry it with a towel after usage.  So I was shocked to find after using the brush for a month that it again had mold on the interior.  This is quite the problem with the unit design.  I am presently in touch with Philips to try to return this product and replace it with something that has a better head to unit seal.  Will update on how responsive the company is to this problem.  I am not hopeful after our first conversation when the representative said he would investigate this issue.. and most of the time its due to improper usage... Its a toothbrush.. I used it properly,, cleaned it and wiped it off after each usage... Perhaps its a poor design... Will update later.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Timed for a two-minute cleaning of teeth.  Teeth feel cleaner than ordinary tooth brushing.  I also bought one for my daughter and she loves it.  Plan to get granddaughter one now.</li>
    <li> Cons:  The replacement brushes wear out quickly and are expensive.  Nasty stuff grows very quickly in the crevices and screw on compartment.  Hard to keep clean.    Pros:  Does get the laque better than conventional toothbrush.  Charge holds for a while so that you can easily take it for a trip without having to pack the charger.</li>
    <li> I love all of the SonicCare electric toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve used several and my teeth are noticably brighter with regular use. They also give you a deeper clean feeling. I would never switch back to a regular toothbrush.  I prefer the elite SonicCare line over the regular one, which I just purchased. It has more options (a gentle power setting), beeps at 30sec intervals, etc.  The brush here still turns off after 2 min which I think is really important if you don&#x27;t have a timer in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d def recommend this product but I&#x27;d say spend the extra $10 and get one of the more advanced ones. Also, if it&#x27;s your first time, be sure to separate the head and the body and use the stand they provide for the brush head, rather than keeping it on the charger. It allows liquid inside the brush to dry rather than mold, and even though it&#x27;s not at all possible that it can reach your mouth, the insides are rather hard to clean when this happens.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to replace my $90 Elite version whose batteries died after 3.5 years.  My old Elite had the 2-minute-30-seconds option, and the 30-second-beep option, but for the price of this model, I can live without them.  The start button on this Essence version is maybe a bit finicky in that it sometimes needs to be clicked twice, but all-in-all, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  When these batteries die, I won&#x27;t feel a little ripped.</li>
    <li> SonicCare...it is the Cadi of toothbrushes!  Best oral care product I have ever tried.  You can literally feel the difference every time you use it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a decent electric toothbrush. I especially like that it has a \\&quot;case\\&quot; so that you can tuck it in your suitcase on overnights elsewheres.</li>
    <li> Really like using it.  This one is very sturdy and does not have the bad button design of past models.</li>
    <li> The product was received in an unopened package. However their were no enclosed warranty  and no directions for use and or and assembly. Is this your responsibility or the product itself. In any case how can I correct tgis problem?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve aways liked a rechargeable toothbrush.  I especially like this one because the head of the brush is small, the unit itself is compact and has a case for traveling. Also, the price is right!</li>
    <li> I am a heatlth care professional. I know the importance of good teeth and especially the importance of good gums. The Phillips Sonicare has several excellent things going for it.  1. It stays on for two minutes.  Very few people who brush by hand do so for more than 30 seconds. It takes two minutes to loosen all the plaque and to get the gums clean.  2. It takes the brushing out of brushing.  It makes it easy because all the user has to do is guide the brush so it gets to every place.  3. Ir brushes at a rate that is gently; yet foirm on the teeth and gum tissue.   I am a convinced user.  Jim Scala</li>
    <li> This is my first \\&quot;true\\&quot; electric toothbrush. I had one of those cheaper AA battery operated disposible ones, but soon went back to manual brushing. For years I&#x27;ve been hearing great things about electric toothbrushes from family and friends, but I could never justify paying the price for one. I saw an ad for the Philips 5300 series toothbrush at a local retailer (sorry, Amazon) which my girlfriend also had a $10 off coupon for ($30 after discount). I was really excited to try it out (after the initial charging, of course). It only took one session to get me hooked! My mouth felt amazingly cleaner when compared to manual brushing. And without having to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; my teeth, I no longer have to worry about those accidental slips that lead to sore gums. My teeth showed great improvement in color and shine after only a few days. The only downside to Philips Sonicare is the cost of the replacement heads. I&#x27;m a frequent brusher and go way past the 2 minute recommended brush time (which is easier to do after getting this toothbrush). The wear and tear I put on the brushhead was visible not too long after new. I don&#x27;t see it lasting close to the 3 months (or once a season) recommended replacement time. Regardless, I&#x27;m willing to pay the dough for a healthy and happy mouth.</li>
    <li> The rechargable toothbrush handle is OK.  I wanted this older model because I still had three new brushheads and my other handle had develped a crack.  I wanted to be able to use up my brushheads.  This model does not have the side grip areas that my other one has.  The brush handle gets very slippery and I lose my grip as it slides out of my hand.  It does fit my brushheads so I will continue to use it and just push it up when it begins to slip out of my grasp.  It does hold a charge very well for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice electric toothbrush. My dentist wanted to sell me the \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; model - same brand for 4X the price of this one. It does not have all the bells &amp; whistles but I do not need a massager for my teeth! This does the same thing for my teeth and gums as my dentist&#x27;s would do and my dental hygeniest said this one was a \\&quot;very good electric toothbrush and she would recommmend it to her patients\\&quot;</li>
    <li> They finally got the electric toothbrush right! If you can afford it and don&#x27;t buy it, you are a fool. I am glad it is now Prime avilable. MY WIFE and I shared one unit,  two heads and a UV SANITIZER. For once it is nice to see a product like this that delivers. Even EVERYONE at the dentist&#x27;s office uses one. Don&#x27;t bother paying for the pricier models - They use the same head! I could explain the charger and extras but just buy it with a couple spare heads (buy them as a recurring purchase and save another 15% - even if you cancel your subscription shortly thereaftet.- and the sanitizer which gets as low as $15 if you wait. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would give more stars seeing that I&#x27;m a repeat customer but the brush head was missing and since I purchased before Thanksgiving for XMAS it was past the seller feedback period.  That&#x27;s a raw deal!    I have extra heads so it&#x27;s not a show stopper.  The Sonicare is a fantastic brush with superior cleaning and recommend it highly.  Just be careful not to go beyond 30 days prior to opening it or you luck out if anything is wrong with your order.[[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  My wife and I purchased the original model 10 years ago and loved it.  The newer model is just as good and even better with the curved toothbrush attachment that fits the mouth even better and allows for more comfortable and complete brushing.  This product gives gentle and thorough cleaning.  Definitely would recommend to a friend.  In fact, bought an extra attachment for my 8-year old son.</li>
    <li> Like many, I believed that electric toothbrushes were junk.  I believed they could never and will never replace a good old brushing.  Boy was I wrong.    My dentist recommended this toothbrush to help improve my gum health.  Now I will never go back to a standard toothbrush.  Let me tell you why.  First, the Sonicare cleans your teeth to a polish.  You will feel little or no more \\&quot;residual\\&quot; build up with your tongue after brushing.  If you&#x27;re like me, you feel around with your tongue to verify that you haven&#x27;t missed anywhere when brushing.  Secondly, it vibrates - it doesn&#x27;t rotate.  YOU control where it goes and apply pressure, and the Sonicare literally knocks crap off of your teeth and gums (and tongue!).    PROS:  - Keeps getting cheaper.  The most bang for your buck in an electric toothbrush, period.  - Dentist recommended.  Replaces manual toothbrushing.  - Waterproof.  Can use in the shower.  - Battery lasts for 2-3 days without charging.  - Charges overnight.  Charger is water-resistant.  - Virtually polishes teeth.  Massages gums.  Mouth feels great.  - 2-minute timer.    CONS:  - 2-minute timer.  - Still kind of expensive.  - Replacement heads run about $12 each.  You need to change them every 3 months.  That&#x27;s $3/month or $36/year to own this toothbrush.  - Mold builds up inside unit where head meets the body.  Requires monthly cleaning.     Bottom line:  This is one of the BEST investments you can make for your health for a marginal cost ($40).  I would simultaneously recommend the Shower Breeze ($30).  For $70, you can literally transform your mouth.  For those of you in bad shape, this is a cheap and easy way to start taking back your health and feeling better about yourself.</li>
    <li> I was leary about buying an expensive tooth brush, even after every dentist telling my I should get one of these brushes. I finaly broke done and bought this one. I love it, it does not just start at full power from the first time, it works up to full power over the first 12 brushes. I love that the handle is able to be washed in the dish washer. It holds a charge for a long time. It uses an induction charger, that is nice so you are not worried about charging when it is wet. I like the travel case, it is well built and a nice hard case. I will be buying another one for my wife. There is also a rebate on the Phillips web site.</li>
    <li> It was a gift but I am sure her teeth are much cleaner....  I have the newer version and my teeth are a hundred times  cleaner. My morning fuzz is gone. Yippee</li>
    <li> Loved the toothbrush right away - exceptional cleaning ability.  I still use it - just bought replacement heads.    However, after using it for a week it started to smell.  I rinsed it, cleaned it in alcohol, took it apart and sprayed it out - trying to rid it of this smell - it smells like dirty clothes or something foul.  I can see why this is the bottom of the Philips Sonicare line and the potential need for a UV cleaner.  I never needed that with any toothbrushes in the past though, and the smell seems to be coming from the handle of the brush where the head connects, so the UV head cleaner compartment they sell separtely wouldn&#x27;t help, I don&#x27;t think.  It&#x27;s just kind of gross.</li>
    <li> I love sonicare but unhappily am going to buy another one bc the battery lost ability to hold a charge. DO NOT TAKE it to EU even if you charge it on a converter. The battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I was rather shocked as it is a fairly new unit but something funky happens when you use a converter to charge it, so its great in the US and SA only..... sigh</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see information about whether this item had the 4x30 second timer as my previous toothbrush did... and I made the mistake of buying without checking.  That feature is really, really convenient.  Wish I&#x27;d been more diligent...</li>
    <li> This is a great basic toothbrush to have. It takes a bit to get used to, but other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this model because I have 6 brush heads. I really wanted the better model, but wanted to use my brush heads. I&#x27;m disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t have the quad timer (where it pauses every 30 seconds so you know when to switch). But I&#x27;m very happy with the price and I love how clean my teeth feel. I just have to use a seperate timer so I know when to switch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and it has been wonderful.  I really like how simple it is so that maintenance and cleaning are simple and easy. I prefer this over the $150 oral B triumph toothbrush that it has replaced.  That toothbrush required that you brush individual teeth and it also has slots on the \\&quot;neck\\&quot; portion of the brush that would leak out over the toothbrush, your hand, your shirt, and the floor if your mouth is especially wet or if you like to run the brush under water before placing it in your mouth. This was very annoying, and I am totally pleased that the sonicare has no such slots, so no dripping!      In the triumph&#x27;s defense, it held up over 5+ years of use without any other issue other than my preference changing to a more traditionally shaped brush. We shall see how long the sonicare lasts, but I hope with care that it will last just as long.    The sonicare seems to clean my teeth as good as any other toothbrush, but it is hard to say for sure. If you are a fan of electric toothbrushes, or thinking about upgrading to one but don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money, this toothbrush (in my opinion) rivals the best of them as far as cleaning goes.  It just doesn&#x27;t have the bells and whistles, but who really needs all that?</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush as a replacement for my wife. Her old one died and she is very happy with this new one.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush ever.  I feel so refreshed after I use this product compared to other electric brushes.  This is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  The product was fine until the batteries died and I found out they could not be replaced.  The warranty is only for 2 years (the product&#x27;s life), so this is a very expensive disposable toothbrush!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended I get a Sonicare at my last appointment. I have been showing signs of minor gum recession over the last several appointments. I asked for and received one for Christmas.    I expected to have healthier gums (next appointment in a few weeks), but I didn&#x27;t expect that dental appointment clean feeling and to have noticeably whiter teeth in just a few weeks. I&#x27;m also using the same whitening toothpaste that I had been using before - not sure if that is a contributing factor.     The feel takes getting used to and you have to be careful to keep the brush in your mouth and your mouth closed when it is on.  I don&#x27;t find that problematic at all.     I&#x27;m a bit of a technophile, so if I had bought this for myself, I probably would have bought the top of the line with all the bells and whistles after convincing myself that&#x27;s what I really need. After using this model though, I&#x27;m thinking the bells and whistles are unnecessary. Others users complain about the quadpacer and I largely invent my own pattern and just vary it, focusing more on different areas day to day, so the quadpacer would be annoying for that.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but finally tried the electric toothbrush.  Wow.  Worth every penny.  I wish I had switched to them 12 years ago.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office every time I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement brush after the one went out after 11+ years of use.    Still excellent brush and works great!</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Sonicare we&#x27;ve owned in the past 15+ years and have not been dissatisfied in any way whatsoever.  That is what prompted me to stick with a product of known quality and performance.    The 4-star instead of a 5-star is that this model no longer has the 30-second indicator beep.  It is not a problem since I&#x27;m going to brush until I&#x27;m done anyway but the reminder to go to another quadrant was nice.</li>
    <li> I have gingervitus and must keep my teeth free from tarter build up.The Sonicare Tooth Brush has helped me reduce dental visits by half. I replaced my original Sonicare last month after 10 years daily use. My Dental Hygentist has given me high marks since I started using the power tooth brush. Good buy, my first one cost over $90.00 and it saved me over $100.00 a year in teeth cleaning charges. I may never change vendors.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! After I&#x27;m done brushing, it&#x27;s like I was just at the dentist, with that smooth feel...amazing!</li>
    <li> The recently purchased Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush replaced an 8 year older Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush, which I was very pleased with. Great value for the price, I would highly recommend it to anyone. Since I travel overseas, it would have been nice if the charger worked on both 110V and 220V.</li>
    <li> I have the HX5352/46. It&#x27;s excellent. Plus, there&#x27;s something about it that makes you brush longer and more thoroughly - sometimes past the built-in timer. You FEEL like it&#x27;s working and my dentist confirms this. Evidently, some people have problems with the switch but mine works fine. This thing, when you take the replacement heads into account, is not all that cheap, but it cleans your teeth SO much better that a regular brush that it&#x27;s worth it for sure. I think $50 to $100 bucks per year is a small price for you health, and a clean mouth is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----update----&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for more than a year, now, and it&#x27;s still working flawlessly. I can&#x27;t be sure that this helps, but I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in. I use it for two weeks and then charge it overnight. I have this theory that this helps with battery life. Either way, it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> Wow this is a great product, I love it. It works sooo much better than a regular toothbrush or even one of those spin toothbrushes you can buy in any store. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for just over a month now and it&#x27;s great. It has a feature that makes it start on a less vigorous brushing level when you first use it. The power gradually increases over the next 11 (I think) brushings until  it reaches full power, in case you are not used to the feeling of using an electric toothbrush. This feature can be disabled if you like, or restarted. It came with a handy travel case. It kept its charge just fine when I took it on vacation with me for a week without the base. The two minute timer is great. It&#x27;s all you could want or need from a toothbrush, and at a resonable price. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as advertised, a less expensive sonicare toothbrush.  The full size sonicare was more expensive, so I decided to try this cheaper model.  It works fine.  The toothbrush is smaller and the stem of the brush is thinner, but it works.  Would be great for children.  I did like the bigger model, but just didn&#x27;t want to spend the money, so this will be fine until it stops recharging.  The bigger model worked for me for quite a while before it stopped getting a charge and I love the way my teeth and gums stay healthier with sonicare.</li>
    <li> This is the second Phillips electric toothbrush I have owned. The first was lost by movers. It is a great value for the price. Amazon delivery was prompt as usual.</li>
    <li> Workings as expected. No issues after dayly use and 1+ year</li>
    <li> Purchased for a Christmas gift.  Hoping my daughter is satisfied with it once she starts using it. Read this was the one most people are satisfied with. Hope I can agree with their reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my new brush! It turns off after 2 minutes of brushing... PERFECT for me. Inexpensive, yet top quality! I&#x27;m wondering if it comes with different brush heads though. It was a great gift!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how old our Soni-Care unit really is, possibly 15 years (used as a dental appliance only and not as a sex toy! LOL). The unit just keeps going, and when combined with our old WP-20 Water Pick, our dental expenses have dropped significantly. I&#x27;m lazy (or is it just overworked?), and just use the stuff once daily with a quick manual brushing in the evening on most days, with some carry-with flossers for noticable problems, and it seems to do the trick.I have lots of crowns, and they do just fine. We&#x27;ve used some sort of Crest \\&quot;Gel\\&quot; (Not a Paste) regularly, as the residual \\&quot;goo\\&quot; seems to be less than other brands and types. Also, we usually have filtered water in our home faucets.  Re. the complaint of \\&quot;mold\\&quot;...was it the same color as your toothpaste? Toothpaste does seem to collect at the base of the brush where it goes through a flange that screws onto the handle. A quick rinse or a few passes with one of those old toothbrushes that you don&#x27;t use anymore gets the stuff out. I&#x27;ve never seen real mold in our Soni-Care in the 15 years we&#x27;ve used one.</li>
    <li> Our original Philips Sonicare (over 7 yrs. old) stopped working so we bought a Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence rechargeable for $41.00.  Basic model and gets the job done just fine, good buy.  Out of curiosity I put our original Sonicare on the charger of the new Sonicare and...you guessed it...it now works just fine.  Guess we were meant to have two Sonicare toothbrushes.  Not too much of a good thing. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it removes alot of plaque.  I can see my gums improving because I&#x27;m using this brush.  This is definantly the #1 Dentist recomended brush.  When I brush my teeth it feels like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentists office.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sonicare Essence to replace an old Sonicare power toothbrush that was broken. (after using it for about 9 years)  I always loved the original toothbrush, except for how water and toothpaste dripped into the screw on cap which held the brush head.  This made the toothbrush messy and hard to keep clean.  As the new toothbrush has a tilted brush head, this problem is eliminated. Brushing with the Sonicare Essence leaves my teeth sparkling clean, and my mouth refreshed!  I am hoping the new toothbrush lasts as long as my okd one.</li>
    <li> Adequate for the task it was built for and the price.  I&#x27;ve owned other \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; toothbrushes &amp; this was a replacement.  I did notice that the brush heads on this new model are smaller.  Probably a cost saving measure, but I believe, a dumb move.  Also, the light flashes while charging.  This can be really anoying at night in the dark.  However, the travel case is a plus.  Overall, a strong three to weak four star rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for 3 months now and have very few complaints. It is my first electric toothbrush so I have nothing to compare it to...but I think it does its job well. My only complaint is that sometimes the space between where the body of the brush connects to the head can trap moisture. Otherwise it&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> The product, which is my second one, is fine, with the exception that, although I thought I ordered it with, it actually came without the 30 second timer which is on some of the units. So I&#x27;m stuck with a toothbrush which irritates me every time I use it! Oh well, george</li>
    <li> great product; i have used a sonic care for the last several years and my teeth stay far cleaner and healther than with a traditional toothbrush. only thing i didnt like about the new brush was my old charge base would not work with the phillips version.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this tooth brush to prevent my gums from receeding.  It&#x27;s thorough and I like the timer feature that makes me brush for a two full minutes and then shuts off automatically.</li>
    <li> Hold on with both hands!  This toothbrush is powerful and cleans my teeth quicker than ever. I love how they feel after using this electric brush.  I highly recommend it and I&#x27;m thinking of buying a couple for gifts!</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my aging Sonicare.  Works better than my first, and holds charge well.  The first resulted in GREAT dental improvement, per my hygienist.</li>
    <li> I got this tooth brush after a recommendation was made by my dentist.  I was pretty impressed with its power. I really try to be careful not to push too hard with the fear that I could damage my gums.  I only rated this a 4 out of 5 due to the fact that you cannot adjust the speed of the brush.  I even bought one for my fiance and he seems pleased as well.</li>
    <li> This is as good as any Sonicare, but I missed that this model doesn&#x27;t have the feature that prompts you to move to another quadrant of your mouth. Has a cool travel carrier though and the charge should last through most trips.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the toothbrush will all the timers and crap you don&#x27;t need on a toothbrush.  This is a great toothbrush with the auto shut off after 2 minutes.  I was worried because you can&#x27;t choose bristle strength because I hate the really soft bristles, the head it comes with is probably soft/medium (it doesn&#x27;t really specify) but its so powerful that its gentle, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery will last about 5-6 days without charge, so don&#x27;t worry about your charger on short trips.  the travel case is cheap, but it works.  Great choice!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush for the lowest price as far as Philips Sonicare goes.  Worth every penny.  Literally feels like a dental cleaning every time you brush.  Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before, but my hygenist recommended it for me.  I was amazed at how much better my teeth look and feel after using this item.  It was an odd feeling at first using this toothbrush, but you adapt quickly.  My teeth feel like I have had a cleaning after each use.  Go for it!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could say enough good things about my new toothbrush! It works great, my mouth feels super clean!</li>
    <li> I own both the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 and the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and have used both extensively.  They are very different toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips uses sonic technology that causes the brush to vibrate extremely fast without it actually moving much; this subtle quality creates a more pleasant brushing experience than the Oral-B.  It also has a longer more traditional brush that I like better for tongue cleaning, and for getting into certain spaces between teeth.  I find the brush ends too sharp and uncomfortable to use for gum massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B has a round brush that acts more like a jackhammer in that it is much more physical and vigorous than the Philips.  I can also apply more pressure with the Oral-B (important for cleaning molars).  These two qualities makes it better for deep cleaning.  The brush is also softer than the Philips, which combined with the \\&quot;vigorous\\&quot; quality makes it better for gum massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one I use depends on what I want.  I use the Oral-B about 65% of the time, the Philips about 35%.  I give the edge to Oral-B since deep cleaning is most important to me, though I&#x27;m still glad I have the Philips for light jobs.</li>
    <li> Bigger, bulkier and without the frills of more expensive models, but every bit as affective; great product!  Own a Sonicare for less.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used this brand for years and they last and last.  Just needed to replace one that I have used daily for 8 plus years!</li>
    <li> I love this sonicare Hx5351/30.  I like how easy it is on your gums compare to a manual toothbrush.  My dentist recommended this to me for my sore gums.  My mouth feels so much healthier and no more painful gums.  Plus price was great on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We had a previous Sonicare and liked it till it died.  This model however is not easy to use.  The screw on top is difficult to attach--something seems misaligned. I suspect that Sonicare has cheapened it down and will not buy another.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my hubby since his teeth always give him troubles. He loves it and feel it really works. But it take some time before he used to it (like about one week). I tried it once and felt the power is really strong, whick viberated my head like an earthquake.</li>
    <li> My other battery operated toothbrushes, around five total, were simply not in the same league as this Sonicare.  My teeth actually feel smooth and I was told by my dental hygienist that this was the one to get to help my gums.  Boy, does it ever!  The only \\&quot;squawk\\&quot; I have with it is changing the battery.  I doubt if I can do what the booklet says and that is a shame.  Other than the battery, I love my Sonicare!</li>
    <li> It would have been appropriate if the product displayed when purchasing specified that it would only work on 110 volts and that it would be necessary to buy a step down transformer to charge this device in countries that operate on 240 volts.    Quite a disappointment as I&#x27;ve owned one of these toothbrushes before and was replacing a 10 year old unit that had given up, however this previous variant was supplied with dual voltage charger that automatically operated wherever you plugged it in 110 volts or 240 volts.    Whats more if this information had been specified I would have purchased from Amazon UK    To add insult to injury both Amazon US &amp; UK will not ship step down transformers to New Zealand.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist kept recommending a SonicCare for better cleaning and gum health.  I finally purchased one a month ago and love it. I should have done this years ago.  I got the basic model,  and it works great.  It&#x27;s hard to describe how much better this cleans compared to manual brushing.  After using the SonicCare, my teeth feel like I just returned from a cleaning session!    I don&#x27;t store the handle in the charging base. Phillips says a full charge should last 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s more like 10 days. The \\&quot;recharge\\&quot; indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s time to recharge.  Also, the travel case is convenient if you travel alot and can&#x27;t live without your SonicCare (like me).  I just charge it up and am good for a long trip!    About the only feature I might consider getting (in hindsight) is the \\&quot;QuadPacer\\&quot; on the higher end models, It would make it easier to evenly clean all surfaces w/out a watch or clock.  But I&#x27;m a frugal guy and not sure if the convenience is really worth $40 (that&#x27;s 2 replacement heads!).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether there is something wrong with the particular toothbrush I received or with this series in general, but there are so many things I don&#x27;t like about it. The first and most serious problem is that the whole toothbrush vibrates like crazy when I use it! And let&#x27;s say you want to take it out while switching to the other side of the mouth (though I know you are supposed to keep your mouth shut the whole time, but how?), it will make a huge mess and splash the toothpaste all over the counter and mirror. I also notice that the top and bottom parts of my toothbrush do not align perfectly. There is a slight gap between the two, no matter how I try to carefully screw them together. The last problem, which several other users have pointed out (esp. those that gave it a one star), is that water does get into the compartment. I don&#x27;t want to wait for a few months and see nasty mold growing inside, so I&#x27;m returning it now! I will stick with my $10 Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush, which works much better!</li>
    <li> who knew a toothbrush would make me so happy! this thing rocks. i have receding gums (i&#x27;m only 26) so my dentist highly recommended this tooth brush...i found a two pack at costco for $79 - so the husband and i both got one! :) we are sold on this thing! its so awesome. makes brushing for 2 minutes no problem at all and we FEEL like we got a cleaning after every burshing!!</li>
    <li> Yhe product was and still is great.  Works well and does the job.  But AMAZON this one time of all the times I purchased products made a mistake that cost me about $50.00.  They said the products was a rebate item but gave me the wrong printed rebate form and so I lost the rebate I expected to get on the sale.  So it made the sale a bust.  I was then and am now not happy about that senario.</li>
    <li> I had been using an Oral-B brush for several years, and when it died on me, my dentist recommended I buy a Sonicare. I have been using it now for about two weeks, and find, although it takes getting used to, it&#x27;s a step up for ones teeth and gums. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> We purchased this item only a few weeks ago and it already has stopped working properly.  After a full recharge it stops numerous times in the middle of a brush and then indicates that it needs to be recharged again after only one use.  I went to the Phillips Sonicare website to try to get help and after two tries at using their live chat, gave up when no one answered.  Calling customer service was abandon after they required serial numbers, date of purchase etc. that I no longer have easily available.  The cost of this product is too high for it to have shoddy workmanship and then have no easy recourse for replacement or repair when it fails to work this quickly.  Amazon&#x27;s return policy is also too limited for this type of product as the only way to return it at this point is to pay for shipping and then only get a partial refund.  I want it replaced with a decent product, not to have to pay more.[[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White]]</li>
    <li> After having a oral b 20 dollar electric toothbrush for a while and liking it, my roommate has been telling me to get this toothbrush for some time, and i finally just caved and bought it. I&#x27;m mad at myself for waiting this long. This toothbrush is powerful and leaves you with that clean dentist feeling. It did make my gums hurt a little but after about a week you gums get used to it. My teeth has never been this clean and white. Much love for this product. If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, don&#x27;t be its worth it. Just make sure to clean the toothbrush handle before you put it on the charging station otherwise it will build up junk on the charger. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Basic Sonicare toothbrush without the bells and whistles of the pricier models.  I bought it to replace a higher-end model that died and the only feature I really miss (a little) is the 30-second time indicators.  Otherwise it is a good unit.  This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush and the most basic of the three.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again, and in fact I recently found a great sale on this model and almost bought it as a future spare but decided to wait so that when the time came I could buy a fresh unit with no battery degradation.  When the batteries fail on Sonicare toothbrushes they tend to go with little warning.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush died a couple of months ago, and I&#x27;d had such good dental checkups since I&#x27;d been using it I figured I ought to replace it with a new one.  That plus the fact that I had just purchased a six-pack of replacement brush heads!  The new one works as well as the old model, but I miss the 30-second timer that was built into the old one.  &#x27;At the beep move on to a different quadrant of your teeth.&#x27;  I have to brush while watching a clock now.  Not a big deal, but it seems like a step backwards in convenience.</li>
    <li> Christmas gifts, so don&#x27;t know yet. Reviews read good and we all need healthy teeth and gums.  So after CHRISTMAS I can write a real review...</li>
    <li> I have been using sonicare tooth brushes for quite some time and find them to be excellent products. This unit was a replacement for one that I have been using for a number of years. It is an excellent product</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have had in the last 8 years...yes they do eventually wear out...The first one lasted about 7-8 years...so I wanted to stick with the same product hoping for another 7 years.</li>
    <li> Simple old school philips soniccare tooth brush.  If your not intrested in spending $100 plus this one will keep your teeth clean and it also came with a $10 coupon plus prime member got home in two day with no shiping cost.  A win win situation all the way.</li>
    <li> I have been using a sonicare toothbrush for over  15 years and I absolutely think it is the best tooth care ever. When I have checkups and cleaning at the dentist I have very little plaque as well.  I recently purchased sonicares for 3 family members and they say that their teeth never felt cleaner.  I agree.  Sincerely,  Carol</li>
    <li> Makes kids brush longer and parents can hear it from another room (no need to be right with the little buggers). A great way to encourage good mouth care for the whole family.</li>
    <li> Performs well, but under the brushhead fills up with disgusting gunk and the entire unit yellows over time -- quite noticeable after a couple years, especially when you replace the brush head with a pristine white one.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been after me for a long time to get an electric toothbrush, and he recommends Sonicare.  I finally got one, and I like it a lot.  Like my dentist said it would, it gets my teeth much cleaner than regular brushing, and my gums seem healthier, too.  It keeps a charge for a long time, and I like the plastic travel carrying case that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a gentle start feature, where for the first few uses, it uses a gentler brushing action.  This was a plus for me, because it took me a while to get used to the vibrations caused by the motor &amp; brush action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit unwieldy, since the bottom, \\&quot;handle\\&quot; part of the brush (where the motor is located) is a bit fat, and a lot to hold onto.  This sometimes leads to a slight lack of coordination on my part while brushing, and sometimes the back of the brush will touch my teeth and cause a startling vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to give the product 5 stars, but held back to 4 ONLY because of the fat handle.  If that could be slimmed down to more closely resemble the handle of a regular manual toothbrush, then I&#x27;d easily give it 5 stars.  Still, it&#x27;s a very minor inconvenience, and the good job it does on my teeth outweighs any handle-fatness incoordination I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE SMALL WARNING:  Don&#x27;t forget to turn the brush off and on while it&#x27;s IN YOUR MOUTH!  Otherwise, toothpaste will go flying off onto your mirror, your face, your clothes, or into the wild blue yonder.</li>
    <li> Have had this for 3 weeks. It seems good enough- not fantastic, but it is OK for the price. I have had toothbrush that did a  better job( cheapo from CVS)  and cheaper but only lasted 3 weeks.   The added test will be time....</li>
    <li> Great brush, the price is very good, 2 minute timer is handy.  The only thing I would change is this:  I used to have a Sonicare about 10 years ago and it would make a slight beep every 30 seconds so you can brush in quadrants.  That was a nice feature and I wish this one did the same.  Other than that very happy.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time balking between this and other toothbrushes, looking for something affordable as well as useful.  This toothbrush meets both of my needs and has been great, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Returned - unsuitable for Australian electrical specification (240volts). To purchase power convertor was more than the value of the items. We were purchasing from an Australian Address so assumed that the goods would be suitable for use in Australia - more warning regarding purchasing electrical goods from another country.[[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White]]</li>
    <li> This arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;It does a fantastic job of cleaning the teeth. 2 minute auto shut off.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I think for the price, this toothbrush has served me well.  Although I had one of these with a battery that lasted a very long time, the battery in the replacement didn&#x27;t last long at all.  But I still think this model does a great job, it&#x27;s stood the test of time and I&#x27;m not willing to spend twice as much for the new Flex model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to mention something about cleaning the toothbrush: There are a lot of negative comments about the design of the brush and how when you unscrew the toothbrush, there is slime in the basin of the base.  People were actually hurling their toothbrushes into the trash after the horror of seeing such a thing. Good Lord!  All a person has to do is unscrew the brush top, clean out both pieces (the top and the base of the tooth brush) with a bleach solution (with water), let it sit for half a minute, rinse it well, dry it and call it a day. A paper towel or two can be useful during the cleaning process. It just takes  a minute or two and your brush will be clean as a whistle and smell like a rose.  What more could you ask for?  If it would just go jump in the charger when the battery ran down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> Always thought powered toothbrushes in general were a gimmick, but after using this for a year, I&#x27;m completely sold.  Regular brushing falls well short of the clean this offers, especially in those hard to reach places, where perhaps you can reach it with a regular toothbrush, but can&#x27;t effectively brush the area.  All the SonicCare has to do is physically make contact, and the area will be cleaned.    Are the more expensive models worth it?  I don&#x27;t see how they could be, at least not in any measurable way, since the motor simply vibrates the bristles at high freqency.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling really clean, just like I went to the dentist for a teeth cleaning! I recommend it to everyone! Really inexpensive and great for your money!</li>
    <li> I like the performance and feel of the Sonicare, I just regret buying the entry-level model.  But hey, it was Black Friday, what are you going to do?  The set is easy to assemble, although it does take a full 24 hrs to charge fully.  It was a little louder Than I anticipate but not loud to the point of being annoying.  The sonic brush head really does move!  Unlike the rotating brushes, it moves in a pulsing/vibrating motion that really feels like it&#x27;s doing some scrubbing when it touches the tooth surface.  The sensation does take a little getting used to however, as it is very ticklish at first.  Since I have the base model, my only \\&quot;feature\\&quot; is the two minute timer. The brush automatically turns off after two minutes.  I usually turn it back on because the two minutes feels like it&#x27;s just too short.  I barely brush two quadrants when the brush powers off.  I usually run through two cycles, four minutes overall. Cleaning afterward is simple.  I simply rinse off the brush head.  It&#x27;s not very messy as long as you keep your mouth closed.  If you inadvertently turn on the tooth brush with toothpaste on it before placing it into your mouth, prepare to clean a lot of thrown toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back, I now wish I bought the model with more features.  I thought this model had the 30-second quadpacer timer but it doesn&#x27;t.  Also missing are the other nice features of its more expensive siblings, features like: detailed battery meter, adjustable sensitivity, in-between teeth cleaning tools, disinfecting chamber, multiple brush heads, etc. I could really use a lot of these features, they aren&#x27;t merely fluff.  Ultimately, this might go to the kids (with different brush heads of course) and I will likely invest in as higher model. As a strictly no-frills entry-level Sonicare brush for someone with a healthy mouth and gums, this is great.  If you have additional needs (such as a focus on gums or in-between teeth), it might be better to go with one of the higher-end models.  Despite the no-frills feel, this is by far the best and most effective power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.spite the no-frills feel, this is by far the best and most effective power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for at least 5 years and bought my husband one a year after I got mine. We both love how effective it is and our dentist says he can tell a big difference in how clean our teeth are now. When I go for my cleaning, they hardly have to do a thing. For people that complain about the \\&quot;muck\\&quot; that accumulates at the bottom of the base, just give the toothbrush a quick shake into the sink when you&#x27;re done and it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. My toothbrush never has muck in the base since I&#x27;ve always done that. Just one quick shake into the sink.</li>
    <li> Need I say more than it quit holding a charge in less than 2 months? After 30 days, you have to contact Phillips directly for service or exchange. We&#x27;ll see how that goes, but for now my teeth aren&#x27;t as clean, I&#x27;m sure. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for Christmas gifts this past year.  Four months later one of them is no longer working.  It seems as if the motor has died.  I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> The battery life on this toothbrush is great.  I charge my toothbrush for 24 hrs about every three months.  I can keep it in my bathroom drawer instead of leaving it on the bathroom counter.  There&#x27;s no need to take the charger on vacation, and you could easily take the toothbrush on a camping trip without worrying that your battery will die.  About every three months or so, it will die while you&#x27;re using it.  But you can turn it right back on and use it to finish up, then charge it when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really into gadgets, but my cousin raved about her Sonicare so much the last time I was home that I decided to try one. I ordered the cheapest I could find, not really willing to invest much into this little adventure in high tech hygiene... A month later and I must say - this toothbrush is life changing. I forgot it when I left town for a few days and was miserable having to revert back to a primitive manual brush. I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my wife and when my last other brand brush broke I bought one of these for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Probably about the best price/quality ratio of all the brushes I looked at, works great, charger stand actually balances halfway well, nifty little carrying case for travel, replacement heads aren&#x27;t as expensive as some other brands, easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not a whole lot of fancy features (which if you are like me you don&#x27;t mind -- keep it simple),takes an eon to charge (if you keep it on the charger you will never notice), not as powerful as some others (powerful enough for me though), standard brushes are a little bit small (once again not small enough to cause any problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say the frustration-proof packaging is pretty nice as well as you can just pull it out of there and throw the cardboard in the recycle, no plastic to cut or rip apart.  Also both brushes I ordered arrived the next day even with standard shipping, whether that only applies to me I can&#x27;t say, but I was impressed.</li>
    <li> My last Sonicare toothbrush (e-series also) was built differently than this one. The body of this one has two separate pieces that fit together whereas the original was totally round. I have to assume that this is why the toothbrush leaks if you stand it up vertically. No matter how much I clean and dry it, it leaks water and toothpaste--even if I clean out all the insides and take it apart. It gets the charger sticky or the bathroom counter. I called Sonicare and they replaced it with a slightly different (and better) model. Great, but this one leaks too. I called back and was pretty much told that yes, this can happen. I got the feeling that I am not the only one who has this problem. They said if enough people complain, they will have to do something about it. The only thing you can do it keep it horizontal, but of course you cannot do that when charging. Other than that, I like the toothbrush very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful if you like the feature that lets you know every 30 seconds when to move to the next quadrant. It&#x27;s called quad pacer, not timer. All timer does is shut off after two minutes. I didn&#x27;t know this and wound up buying the wrong model.</li>
    <li> this is the kind of toothbrush our dentist recommended. in a matter of one week the wifes teeth were whiter.  the dentist said that it will remove the tarter, plaque, coffe stains from your teeth.  it really works.  this is the only toothbrush that we will use from now on.  after a week my teeth were getting whiter--this coming from a chewer and a IV coffee drinker</li>
    <li> If you are brushing your teeth with anything other than a sonicare then you are missing out. I have two of these, i wouldnt brush my teeth with anything else. I have also owned two oral-b electronic toothbrushes. Even the best oral-b does not leave your teeth feeling as clean as this base model sonicare, honestly. The sonicare makes you feel like you just left the dentist however it is VERY gentle on your teeth and gums, the vibration is much better for people with sensitive teeth or gums. I find the oral b leaves my gums hurting, yet this toothbrush doesnt.</li>
    <li> We have several versions of the Sonicare brush.  They all work great.  This is the most basic.  I mistakenly bought brushes for this one, so decided to get the brush to match.  It&#x27;s footprint on the counter is small.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift it works great and we love it !  This is more powerful then the battery operated ones out there.</li>
    <li> I am turning 36, and this is my first experience with a non-traditional toothbrush. After repeatedly getting bad dental checkups and having tons of dental repairs, and re-repairs, and upcoming repairs, I wanted to find a better way to cleaner teeth, between teeth too, and gums. And, on a whim, my hubby and I decided we wanted Santa to bring us both this entry-level Sonicare model toothbrush. If you have exposed nerves or existing toothache/damage, you might want to get those repairs first before using this. The vibration of the wand if you bump your teeth can send a shock to a bad tooth. I have bumped my teeth during brushing and it was just vibration for the tooth but not painful, but I could recall a time (pre dental repair) that it would have aggravated the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning, this toothbrush is just AMAZING!! It really does feel like you have just come from the dentist cleaning EVERY time you brush. The unit came with a charge, and we could each use ours straight out of the box, but we did end up fully charging it after the first couple days. The unit operates on its own built in timer. I guess this is supposed to give you adequate cleaning time. I use it the full time making sure to go over all my teeth at least once right away and then double and triple back if there are any areas that my tongue feels could use a little more detail. I use a little more toothpaste on purpose knowing that this sonicare will push the paste between my teeth for a better clean. I have noticed my tongue is cleaner too. My mouth feels healthier. The brush comes in two parts and screws together seamlessly. The top part is the part that you replace when the brush wears out. The bottom is sealed and waterproof. The way it charges is by what I refer to as osmosis. Somehow the charge passes through the handle from the charger without any exposed connection. You&#x27;ll see when you get it home. Pretty neat if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plaque removal in the short time it takes to brush is better than brushing and brushing and brushing with a manual toothbrush (and still having missed spots or tough to remove plaque). I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back and really wish I had started brushing with a sonic toothbrush as soon as my adult teeth came to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had nearly white teeth (I am just one of those lucky people), but I have noticed some reduction in what staining I did have. However, my husband always has had stains from smoking and tons of black coffee drinking, and since Christmas, I have seen some improvement in the coloration of his teeth by way of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak on the higher end models, but this would be a good model to test drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are both EXTREMELY pleased with this affordable product that can save us a bunch of money and pain in the dentist&#x27;s chair. It&#x27;s easy to use, works right away, provides very noticeable results, and our only regret is not buying these sooner!!ter than brushing and brushing and brushing with a manual toothbrush (and still having missed spots or tough to remove plaque).

    <li> It has great sonic action; assembles and disassembles quickly and easily; easy to clean and durable. Charges quickly &amp; takes up little space.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and I am very pleased with it. Prior to this I was using an OralB electric toothbrush because I couldn&#x27;t afford a Sonicare. I wasn&#x27;t aware of this model and price until I saw it in an ad for Macy&#x27;s.  It was an even better price through Amazon.  It works so much better with my teeth. I could tell immediately the difference in cleaning. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the magnetic drive Sonicares for quite a long time now, and I&#x27;ve had my current one, still going strong, for at least 10 years (it&#x27;s approximately like the current Essence 5300). My wife bought one of the flex models, with a metal drive pin that goes into the snap-on head. These things fail all the time, usually sometime during the second year. I think it&#x27;s because the metal pin moves to transduce the vibration to the head. In the purely magnetic models, only the replaceable head vibrates.  It is very true that these get rather disgusting with accumulated slime over time, and the secret is to take the head off after every use. If toothpaste gets dried on there, just rinse it off in the sink.  Both types can do a wonderful job on your teeth, and the pin-drive brushes do have a couple of extra modes that some might find useful. But the magnetic-drive E-style bases, with no moving parts, are the f****ng energizer bunny in terms of durability.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Sonicare to replace one I had used for almost 10 years ... lots of improvements over a decade.  The slim neck has a slight angle, making it really easy to get behind the back molars, and I&#x27;m very happy with the upgrade.</li>
    <li> I used a manual toothbrush until 2002 when I got my first Sonicare... what a difference!  My teeth were squeaky clean with the Sonicare.  That model of Sonicare was similar to this Essence model and about the same price, and by late 2006 the internal battery was only holding a charge for a couple days.  I do brush for 3-4 minutes twice a day, so if you brush twice a day for 2 minutes, the battery is likely to last longer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late 2006 my husband and I each got Sonicare toothbrushes that are nearly identical to the Essence (they were the e-series, but don&#x27;t know for sure) and those lasted a few years too.  Mid-year 2011, the rubber on the on-off button on mine had cracked and water got in, and my Sonicare eventually refused to turn on anymore.  The battery on my husband&#x27;s Sonicare was only holding a charge for a day or two, so it was time for us both to get new Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we both have this exact model, the Sonicare Essence.  I love it just as much as my older Sonicares.  Since I started using the older Sonicare in 2002, my dentist has been happy with how clean my teeth are, and she always tells me how white and beautiful they are.  I do believe the Sonicare makes my teeth whiter, it keeps staining at bay even though I drink 4 strong cups of tea a day.  When I had a porcelain crown put on one of my molars in 2010, the dentist had to use the whitest porcelain to match my other teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Sonicare... I&#x27;ve never bought the super fancy $100+ models, but this Essence is working great for me, like the others before it did.  I&#x27;ve been getting 4-5 years out of each Sonicare which I&#x27;m very happy with.</li>
    <li> Really great with my Invasilign braces.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush works very well and is easy to clean.  Battery life is good, too.  The bristles seem a little soft, though, if that&#x27;s a concern.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my husband and he absolutly loves it. It can be used a couple of times before needing to be charged again. Also, provides a deep clean feeling for teeth.</li>
    <li> item was well packaged and it arrived a day early. right out of box you have to let it charge up for a full 24 hours before use. the first time of se of product i was very impressed at how well ir works and the inital charge hat i did when i first got it lasted 5 days at using it twice a day product also came with one brush head i kind of figured it would but you never no sometimes and for the price of item it was very reasoable. and i went to dentist and was told there was a big improvement since last vist on plaque. i would recomend buyig this product to anyone. so far amazon.com hadcheapest price on item that i could find</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  The best thing about the Sonicare is what it does for your gums and helping to keep gingivitis from occurring.</li>
    <li> You can get more features and pay more, but this model delivers the essentials at a friendly price. Be sure you need more options before you purchase the more expensive versions of this fine product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned regular toothbrushes, as well as the $20 electric standards you can find in any walmart.  This blows them all out of the water.  Wow, my teeth have never felt so clean!  Excellent, excellent, product.  Not really sure why you would need the fancier models, but this is a great starting point for the listed price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchaced this item some time ago and it appears to work better than a regular toothbrush. Need to replace toothbrush head frequently. Good brand and available in many stores.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my special sister.  She was thrilled with it, and brushed her teeth 3 times the day she received it.  Thanks for the wonderful product and quick shipping. :)</li>
    <li> I wish this toothbrush had a softer more efficient touch to it&#x27;s brushing as I have  had more than five electric toothbrushes over the years as this one tend to be rather harsh on my teeth. I bought two more heads for it so I guess I will have to use it for a while or just give it away. I would prefer the old sonicare  toothbrushes that have a softer more efficient touch to them. My dentist sold this in his office so I thought it would be a good one.  Oh well I suppose different strokes for different folks.</li>
    <li> Have used Sonicare for many years per dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  As I have had major dental work done through the years, the Sonicare has been terrific in keeping my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a really good toothbrush.  If you&#x27;ve never used one of these before, you will be amazed at how clean it makes your mouth feel.  The battery lasts a very long time.  I recently brought it on a trip and forgot to bring the charger, and the battery lasted me an entire week without charging.  The biggest issue is that the replacement heads are VERY expensive.  Also, it needs to be cleaned out fairly often.  I would even recommend taking the head off after every use and rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> I  was not very happy with this item, it did not use the same brushes that I still had from an earlier sonicare item.  The brush wore out very quickly.  Not one of my better buys.......</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist in TWELVE years until today and you know what they said to me?  &#x27;Whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep doing it!&#x27;  Not a single cavity, no gum disease, nothing.  I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for as long as I can remember and I will never part with it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this, i have been wanting one forever.  I&#x27;m terrible at brushing my teeth for a long time but this makes it fun and they feel SO clean and healthy after brushing...It even makes me want to floss more.  Works great, got here quick and holds a charge, plus i love that you can wrap the extra cord into the base:)</li>
    <li> I really like these. I bought them because I needed a better toothbrush. The vibrations were hard in the beginning but I am used to them now. I bought one for my girlfriend because I like them so much.</li>
    <li> Product is very good.  Purchased this one as a replacement for the same thing. The first one failed after about 4 years.  Dentist recommends this unit.  Price is better than most retailers.</li>
    <li> Overall I have been very very impressed with this unit.  I had one made by another manufacturer in the past and the brush heads were pretty course and rough on my teeth. No good for me. This Sonicare has the most gentle brush heads I have used to date.  Really a very quality unit overall.  No other major issues to report. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had owned an Oral-B Sonic Complete S-320 that finally was no longer able to charge so I ended up replacing it with the Sonicare Essence. The sonic technology in both toothbrushes is similar so there was no real change in the actual functionality of the toothbrush. I much prefer the sonic vibrating toothbrushes to the Oral-B vitality types that just spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one major difference with Sonicare is that the toothbrush heads are much larger and more expensive. Even worse is the fact that the way they screw onto the base unit makes it very easy for water to seep in and for really nasty smelling gunk to build up inside the handle. I&#x27;ve gotten so frustrated with this gunk and with the toothbrush heads unscrewing themselves that I&#x27;m going back to order the discontinued Sonic Complete and hoping that it will help me to get that funky smell out of my head.</li>
    <li> Just brushed for the first time with my Sonicare Essence...and I loved it!  As an adult with braces and one that loves red wine, I found my Spinbrush didn&#x27;t fair well against red wine and food stains -- even when I brushed immediately after meals.  But after just my first brushing with the Sonicare, I can see a major difference.      I got it on sale for $60 at my local CVS -- thought it was as bargain, but see I could have gotten it for a couple dollars less on Amazon -- the regular CVS price is $91.  Anyway, I think it was well worth the money and don&#x27;t think I would have spent much more -- $60 is about the right price, IMO.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the time it&#x27;s taken to charge it.  It&#x27;s been on the base for more than four hours and still isn&#x27;t fully charged (it&#x27;s just a toothbrush!), which make me wonder if charge-ability will become problem in the future based on previous reviews.  Nevertheless, I&#x27;m satisfied and think my hygienist will be too!  She nearly tore me a new one at my last cleaning -- she complained incessantly about the red wine stains -- even suggested that I opt for white wine instead...not!</li>
    <li> Read reviews and decided this will do what is required. What i needed was something to keep my teeth clean, especially in hard to reach areas. Before this device, i had to use scrapers and floss to keep the back of my molars clean. I had tried other cheapy auto-brushes, but this one is way better. Buildup is not felt at the end of the day, this tells me that my teeth are really clean in the morning afterI use this brush. Brushing takes 2 - 3 mins now. Whereas before, it would take me 5 mins of brushing in addition to scraping and flossing to see and feel the cleanliness in back section of my mouth. I really wish i had this brush years ago. I&#x27;d prolly have had less cavities, and more confidence in knowing my whole mouth is totally clean. Buy this, its basic but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Thought the battery operated tooth brushes worked great until I got this power toothbrush. Wow, what a difference.  My dental office has been urging me to buy one.  Now that I have this, I will be buying one for everyone in the family.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush does an excellent job. All my life I had terrible brushing habits and the dentist always said I had bad gums, had to floss and brush. Now I get excellent reviews. No talus build up, very shiny white teeth. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This one is replacing one that has everyday use for over 8 years.  Just now not holding a charge.  Great reliability, product and performance.</li>
    <li> I love my Philips Sonicare Essence toothbrush.  It was my Christmas gift to myself and was definitely worth it.  My teeth feel so clean, and I know I am reducing cavities and other teeth problems.</li>
    <li> I have only recently purchased this product, but so far I am very pleased.  It was reasonably priced with no shipping charge and it has lived up to my expectations.  I especially like the two minute automatic shutoff. Using it is somewhat tricky at first, but once you have done it several times, it is very simple.  I would recommend it to anyone who has gum problems or who justs wants a better cleaning.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS \\&quot;TOOTHBRUSH\\&quot; AS A GIFT FOR THE HOLIDAY KNOWN BY SOME AS CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR OR SHOULD I SAY LAST YEAR, AS IT WAS ACTUALLY IN 2010. SO IVE BEEN USING THIS \\&quot;TOOTHBRUSH\\&quot; FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW. FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A NONSTOP HEADACHE AND VIBRATING SENSATION IN MY INNER-EAR AND BRAIN THAT HAS NOT GONE AWAY AND I CANNOT GET ANY RELIEF FROM THIS. I STOPPED USING THE TOOTHBRUSH THIS MORNING AND SO FAR IT HASNT GOTTEN ANY WORSE, BUT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THE PAIN IS CAUSED BY THE TOOTHBRUSH. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THIS \\&quot;TOOTHBRUSH\\&quot; IS ACTUALLY A TOOL USED BY THE FAT CATS AT SONICARE TO TRY TO GAIN CONTROL OVER MY MIND AND INNERMOST THOUGHTS. GUESS WHAT, SONICARE, I AM ONTO THIS SCHEME AND IM DONE! IM NOT GOING TO USE THIS TOOTHBRUSH ANYMORE AND GO BACK TO MY $4.99 CREST BRUSH (W/ TONGUE CLEANER). JUST A HEADS UP!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. This is a replacement. My other one lasted several years. Have had great dental check-ups using thos product!</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes on the market.  I work in dentistry and would recommend NO OTHER toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We really like this model of Sonic are Toothbrush. It does its job very well, and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Our previous  one was the same model, which I dropped. After using electrical tape to hold it together for over a year, it wasn&#x27;t charging well. So I found this one, and the price was much lower than our first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some bad reviews concerning mold. We always wipe ours off when done using it for the day, and have never had mold develop. I suppose if you let water pool in the top of the base that could happen, but why would you do that? It only takes a couple of seconds to wipe it off. We replace the brushes every 4-6 months as well and have never had mold grow on them. We do let them sit out to air dry and wipe off their bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dentist could tell when we started using this product. We&#x27;ll never use a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric brush. I am never going back to a normal toothbrush.  When this one breaks I might go for a more expensive one to see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush really makes my teeth feel cleaner.  it was a little weird to get used to at first since i&#x27;d never used an electric toothbroush before, but after a few days it felt fine.  i actually look forward to brushing my teeth.  and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Was a replacement.  They do quit charging after about 3 years.  But until then, this is a great product.  No need to buy the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> Shame on me, I let my original 10-year old Sonicare die.  Used heavily for 6 years, and then packed and uncharged as part of  two moves, I found its lifeless corpse in a box a couple of weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;WHY did I ever stop using it? (no excuse)&lt;br /&gt;Hey, the 4 pack of brushes I goet a couple of years ago at Costco fits this newer version.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it.  Charged it up.  Happy, happy, happy.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have this wonderful brush plus 4 more heads which can be used with it.  Whoo hoooo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  Anybody who has felt guilty about not doing the best in-between dental visit cleanings should think about getting one of these things.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, ya gotta brush at least once in a while?  So do it with one of these and get wonderful words from your dentist and hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model even ships with a plastic case you could use as a travel case if you kept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around good deal for a great health tool</li>
    <li> yes, this product let my boyfriend&#x27;s teeth get brighter, obviously. He drinks coffee w/o cream everyday so the stain remains on his teeth. I order two for us, and I see the result on him. very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great deal!  I&#x27;ve been using this model for years when mine finally died and I still had 2 brush heads left so this was the perfect replacement.  I like the upgraded model.</li>
    <li> This is our first experience with an electric toothbrush, We were not disappointed.  This shipping was quick and the Philips Sonicare was just as described.  We would purchase more Philips products in the future.</li>
    <li> MY DENTAL HYGIENIST SUGGESTED THIS PRODUCT TO ME.  I WAS BRUSHING TOO HARD AND CHANGING MY MANUAL TOOTHBRUSH EVERY TWO WEEKS.  ALTHOUGH I CAN CLEARLY FEEL AND SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY MY (MOUTH) TEETH, GUMS, AND TONGUE HAVE IMPROVED SINCE I BEGAN USING PHILIPS SONICARE I AM DISAPPOINTED IN REGARD TO HOW LONG THE CHARGE LAST.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS PRODUCT WILL MAINTAIN ITS CHARGE FOR A WEEKS VACATION WITHOUT RECHARGING.  I AM BRUSHING MY ENTIRE MOUTH LONGER BECAUSE I HAVE LESS PROBLEMS WITH SENITIVITY AND THE SONICARE FEELS GOOD.  I THINK THAT I NEED MORE TIME USING THIS PRODUCT TO GIVE IT A FAIR REVIEW.  MY UPCOMING DENTAL VISIT WILL ALSO WEIGH HEAVILY ON MY OPINION.  I WOULD NOT HESITATE RECCOMMENDING THIS ITEM TO A FRIEND.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dentist. I never had an urge to try one but read all the great reviews and I&#x27;d have to agree with them. It does take a little getting used to, it tickled me at 1st but got used to that after a few days. It has a 2 minute timer which is the recommended time to brush your teeth. Well, I now know that I was not brushing long enough all these years! I love the fresh, clean feeling of my teeth after using this. Went for a check up after using this brush for a while, definitely an improvement. The dentist spent a lot less time removing plaque this time. Worth trying out.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of this product for many years.  This is the third one that I have owned.  I checked prices and found Amazon to be the best buy.</li>
    <li> This was a great price for this toothbrush. The warehouse stores only carried twin packs, and I don&#x27;t need two! I would be afraid that the battery on the other one would lose some life by the time I was ready to use it 6-8 years from now, based on the battery life of my old one. This replaced a version I had that beeped every 30 seconds of the 2 minute cycle and showed the battery life remaining, but this one is the same, except for those minor details that have no bearing on performance. After at least 6 years of using the old one, I&#x27;m pretty good at timing the 4 mouth quadrants myself. Better hard plastic shell than the older ones, so easier to clean.</li>
    <li> I had always wanted a Sonicare toothbrush for 10+ years but never budged to buy one (because of the cost)till now, Boy am I sorry I waited so long! I ended up getting periodontal disease even thouh I manually brushed and flossed every day. I believe if I had&#x27;nt waited so long to get a Sonicare, I could have avoided Perio and saved 1000&#x27;s of dollars on treatments.&lt;br /&gt; This is not just a toothbrush like people think, do not wait like I did! Your oral care effects your over all heath, clean up your mouth and you clean your whole system.&lt;br /&gt; This tooth brush is SO good, I bought one for my husband and  ordered the kids Sonicare for my 4 year old the very same day I first used mine.&lt;br /&gt; This Sonicare is simple to use, its either on or off, no confusing multibuttons and whistles to learn...and the charger and travel case are pretty cool. One really awsome thing about this sonicare (not sure if they all do this) is it starts on a beginer mode and gradually works up to full speed with repeated use so you can get used to the sonic action. This is great for a first Sonicare, In a few years I will get a multi function Sonicare to upgrade.</li>
    <li> the Amazon site stated the Sonicare was \\&quot;new\\&quot; but when it arrived, it was not  or in any factory packing.  The Sonicare and components were simply placed loosely in the packing cardboard box.  This was not sanitary!  Not the usual quality  for Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband and I bought this to share, and the kids one for our children. So far, we have to say that it has been the most amazing brush! It is not a big deal to wash out the head after each use, literally takes less than two seconds while you are swishing out the toothpaste. We just had our teeth cleaned at the dentist and almost two months later, still have that smooth feeling like they were just polished! Definitely something worth investing in- I wish it had the cleaning option as well, but did not want to spend the $$$.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, excellent product, delivered ahead of promised date.&lt;br /&gt;If your electric toothbruch stops working or if you are looking for an electric toothbrush this is the item</li>
    <li> Five stars for the charger (works with my old sonic); 0 stars for the toothbrush because it won&#x27;t charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I just needed a charger for my old sonic toothbrush, maybe 5 years old now or perhaps older.  I bought this thinking I&#x27;ll have the charger and use the new toothbrush when my old one dies.  Wrong.  My old sonic is still working fine.  But when I tried to charge my \\&quot;new one\\&quot; I found it died just sitting in storage!  Never used.  Past warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And CW recommends completely discharging the battery as key to longer life, better performance and it&#x27;s been completely discharged in storage.  It worked on arrival (just charged and tested, never used).  It was charged a second time, by the wife, maybe a year latter, in error.  And that&#x27;s it.  It will not longer take a charge.  So, maybe the quality is no longer there.</li>
    <li> great product.  stays charged more than three weeks  gets in all the nooks and crannies  teeth feel like going to the dentist everyday</li>
    <li> You ever had a moment that you thought to yourself: I am so bored...oh I am going to brush my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;For all those tricks and threats my mom gave me when I was little, for all those guilt I felt when I skipped brushing teeth at night, for all those serious looks on the dentists&#x27; faces when they were telling me the conditions of my teeth...Sonicare glances at them and smiles...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300.  The price was right, and it does a great job.  With the dental hygenist&#x27;s recommending I get one and the ease of buying it on Amazon, I&#x27;m glad I purchased the Sonicare after thinking about it and never getting around to buying one before.</li>
    <li> I remember way back when these first came out, selling for a few hundred dollars! Amazing how people alwasy remember prices going UP, but in this case its clearly gone down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for $40 this is amazing. you get a clean feeling that just isn&#x27;t possible with a regular toothbrush. I travel a bit and still use a regular one on travel. I still get a great feeling when i first come back and use this sonicare for the first time in a while. I gave 4-stars because this is actually my second sonicare. The first lasted a few years and eventually the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement battery and figured i would be fine to just get another base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy, would recommend.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush arrived on time in perfect condition and works as advertised. If I had it to do over, I would get a model with more features.</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth brush i used ever. My teeth looks far better, way cleaner in a week after started using this brush.  I would recommend using this product to everyone to have a cleaner teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush several months ago and I still love it. It does not have any annoying vibrations and it gets my teeth spanking clean! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes used to be good products but no longer! I&#x27;ve had an awful experience of late dealing with Philips. I bought a replacement toothbrush head for my Advance toothbrush that lasted only 1 MONTH so I called Philips to complain. They said to try a new head and if it does it again I would need to buy a new toothbrush. So I did as recommended and the BRAND NEW HEAD wore out after ONE MONTH. I purchased a new Essence toothbrush in late April only to have the toothbrush head on it wear out in LESS THAN A MONTH! It&#x27;s a complete rip-off by Philips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to belief the brush has sonic cleaning power, but something is making my teeth feel incredibly clean after I use it. The batteries also last a really long time, even long enough that I bring it with me on travel and I don&#x27;t even bring the charger. The heads are a bit pricey and they wear out fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare as an excellent way to remove \\&quot;biofilm\\&quot; from my teeth without causing gum line recession.  After using Sonicare for several weeks, I could not be more pleased.  My teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing.  The bushing does not abrade the gum line.  That prevents gum line recession.  I fully endorse this wonderful system for cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> Cleans like a champ. I&#x27;ve used Braun &amp; Sonicare and although they&#x27;re bot very good, I think the Sonicare does a better job. Good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare line of electric toothbrushes are revolutionary. Made by Philips (a well-known manufacturer of electronic devices), these are unlike any other brush on the market because they use \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; or ultrasonic energy to clean teeth, gums, tongue, roof of the mouth, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This technology has been around for a long time, ultrasonic cleaners have been used to clean delicate instruments, tools, fragile or easily damaged items that couldn&#x27;t be cleaned with conventional methods (brushing, harsh solvents or chemical cleaners, abrasives, etc.). Jewelers have been using it to clean delicate jewelery for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush ulilzes it by using high frequency magnetic oscillations generated by the handle and converts them to mechanical energy through magnets attached to steel tension arms inside the screw-on brush heads. Take off the brush head and turn the handle on and you can hear the ultrasonic energy as a faint whining noise. This energy generates around 3000 oscilations per minute...so fast you can barely detect them with the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations clean teeth by scrubbing action and the ultrasonic energy, which is superior to conventional and some other electric brushes because it gets into the tiny crevices in between teeth, below the gumline, and cleans the tongue. This is good because it&#x27;s low-impact (the brush does the work so you don&#x27;t have to brush \\&quot;hard\\&quot; which is bad for your teeth and gums as any Dentist will tell you) and gentle on your gums. The small brush head is able to get into the very back of the mouth to get the hard-to-reach teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations also remove stains by breaking up and polishing away the tiny molecules that turned teeth dark and removes plague and tarter the same way, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dentist says my teeth and gums are very healthy. After a couple months of using the Sonicare, my teeth got noticably whiter, my breath freshened up, and my gums (which were already healthy) got healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit came with the handle, a charger, and a brush head assembly which is the magnetic tension system, a flexible brush stalk and small brush head which screws onto the handle. The unit has a built-in timer system that will turn the brush off to let you know to switch from the top teeth to the bottom teeth (2 minutes each. It has a rechargable NiCad battery, and when the battery is running low, it will beep during use to let you know to charge it. I got about 4 days of use before I had to charge it. I&#x27;ve gone as long as 5 before, but then it will shut itself off. Charging takes 6-8 hours (overnight) but you can use it if you need to after 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads aren&#x27;t cheap ($30 for 2), but will last a while. They say to replace them after 3, but I&#x27;ve used them for 9 months before without any problems. I used to go through 3 $4 regular brushes (and I stretched them a lot longer than normal) in same period. The handle itself will last for years and years, so it&#x27;s a great investment and your teeth will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripes are the lack of rubber grip on the handle and that the brush heads get dirty inside. I have dropped mine several times because I couldn&#x27;t hold onto it! Not really a critical one, but the battery isn&#x27;t replaceable if it wears out (it eventually will).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3000 vibrations per minute clean teeth and gums thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;Whitens teeth&lt;br /&gt;Cleans plaque and tartar deep in between teeth and below the gumline&lt;br /&gt;Rechargable with good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable preventative oral care tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle gets slippery during use&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads get dirty inside fast&lt;br /&gt;Battery can&#x27;t be replacedh the handle, a charger, and a brush head assembly which is the magnetic tension system, a flexible brush stalk and small brush head which screws onto the handle.

    <li> I used a similar Sonicare producted in the past. I was very happy with it. This one appears to work as well, but it is extremely noisy. I&#x27;m sorry that I didn&#x27;t do more research before ordering it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a sonicare toothbrush and I saw this particular Philips Essence toothbrush advertised here on Amazon for half price so I ordered it. It started out slow (so I could get use to it)and after two weeks it is now running at a higher power. I love this toothbrush and wished I would have purchased one sooner. It runs for 2 minutes and then shuts itself off. It gives a 3 warning beeps when it is close to being time to recharge the battery. At this point you have two or three brushes before running out. My teeth look and feel so much cleaner and I could never go back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Before this toothbrush, I had never had an electric toothbrush of any sort.  But I was well aware of the Sonicare brand.  I chose it because my roomie uses an OralB and we&#x27;re competitive.  I will say mine is much noisier than his, but it because his sounds like its struggling whereas this guy just hums, similar to professional teeth cleaning tools, but without the dread or the bills.  I have noticed improvements since I began using.  2 minute timer is useful, but I wish there was a way to change the default timer to 3 minutes.      I got this toothbrush specifically because I use smokeless tobacco and wanted to be a bit more proactive in protecting my teeth.  Time will tell if its doing my intended function, but it does seem to be gradually cleaning up staining.  Feels good on the gums too.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my son, and he did not like it.  I tried it myself, and found that it is noisy, vibrates too much.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model to replace a 4-year-old model.  The first one I had was a gift and was the high end model.  This low end model did not have the feature I liked most--beep to signal 30 seconds!  It also seemed to be a much stronger vibration.  No problem with product quality tho.    Product was: [...]</li>
    <li> Bought this item on the recommendation from my dental hygienist. She told me to brush for 2 minutes at a time. Thought I would have to force myself to use it. Man was I wrong. I love this thing. It has a 2 minute timer built in. I thought I would have a problem with this thing in my mouth for 2 minutes. I&#x27;ve hit the timer every time brushing now. 2 minutes is a breeze with this thing. Teeth feel extremely clean. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic I love it. Sonicare is the only one that I would buy. All the others are poor copies trying to emulate the Sonicare without much success.</li>
    <li> As a past user of a Sonicare toothbrush I was sad when my Sonicare died.  I quickly checked around and found Amazon to have what I wanted at a very competitive price.  I received it in good time and found it almost completely charged upon arrival.  I would have given it 5 stars but I did not see in the description where it did not have 30 second incremental beeps to let you know when you&#x27;re done with a quadrant like my old one did.  BTW.... My old one lasted for almost 11 Years!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my last one died.  While searching for the best price, discovered it on Amazon and purchased it from you.  It came in a timely manner and I have been enjoying it ever since.  It cleans my teeth just fine.</li>
    <li> My dentists all tell me sonic toothbrushes are the best thing for your teeth. Sure does make cleaning sessions at the dentists easier.</li>
    <li> After a not so goood check up with dentist, she recommended an electric toothbrush.  Was hesitant on spending so much for a toothbrush, but I won&#x27;t ever be able to go back to a regular toothbrush.  My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with a regular brush. Thought this was a good value, it has lasted over 2+ yrs so far and I&#x27;m able to get the refills easily online or at Costco.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! My teeth are beautiful and feel clean!</li>
    <li> Got this several years ago, it finally died. Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. Just bought a new handle on Amazon for 30 bucks. Good to go for several more years.</li>
    <li> I have a large amount of calculus that builds up between dental visits. My hygienist recommended the Philips Sonicare toothbrush....my \\&quot;spin brush\\&quot; was not effective in removal and hygiene visits were lengthy appointments.  I ordered the \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; model....there are Philips models that provide more options; however, this one was both affordable and effective.  In my opinion, hand brushing and spin brushing are not the way to go if plaque buildup is something with which you deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare toothbrushes for 15 years, and wouldn&#x27;t use any other. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth, leaving me with a \\&quot;just polished at the dentist\\&quot; feeling. I wish I would have read the fine print when buying this one - it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second timer for quadrant brushing, but that&#x27;s my fault. Will definitely purchase another.</li>
    <li> I purchased a sonicare type toothbrush,from CVS that works super. I saw this on on Amazon thinking it would be same. first one I purhased for one of my sons. this one I purchased for second son and it rattles his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
    <li> After using a sonic care for about a month now I have noticed a significant change in my dental health. It takes a little getting used to at first, but once you get your technique down its smooth sailing. My teeth feel smooth and absurdly clean after each use and the built in timer makes sure I&#x27;m brushing for the correct amount of time. There are some fancier models out there with self cleaning options but they were a little out of my price range. I&#x27;m super happy with the base model.</li>
    <li> After pouring over other reviews for both Sonicare and OralB, I decided on the E series of Sonicare.  I definitely bought the best toothbrush.  I never knew how much I wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean with a regular toothbrush.  I have had no issues with my Sonicare, I love it!</li>
    <li> Wow today was my first use of this brush and the difference from my old spin brush is amazing. And it hasn&#x27;t even reached full power yet. Effortless brushing and a clean feel that really only comes after a dentist visit.</li>
    <li> I previously had two low-end Oral-B electric toothbrushes and this time decided to try the low-end Sonicare.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months now and I prefer the Sonicare because it leaves my teeth feeling cleaner.  The battery also lasts a lot longer (about 2 weeks on a charge). After a couple of years the Oral-B needed to be charged each use.  I keep the Sonicare off of the charger until it needs recharging, so we&#x27;ll see how the battery holds up over time.  I did like the round brush head of the Oral-B better for reaching the back of my front teeth.  It&#x27;s a bit harder to angle the Sonicare just right to reach those teeth.  I also miss the alert the Oral-B brush provides after two minutes of brushing.  The Sonicare has a timer, but just shuts down after two minutes with no advance alert.  Overall the Sonicare was a good value and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Love this---my teeth have never felt to clean!  I would strongly recommend this healthy way to take care of your teeth.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush does leave your teeth feeling very clean after use. But it is SO loud and violent.  I only use it for a week and it hurt my gums in one area and I have to avoid brushing there.  I keep going back to the starters mode to have it more bearable.  I am trying to understand if I got a defective unit, or if this toothbrush is just too much for my gums. I was using ORAL-B Sonicare for 3 years without any issues.   Would be interested to hear from other customers about their experience. At this point I&#x27;m afraid that it might be just too rough and maybe dangerous too keep using it.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace one I purchashed years ago. I love this toothbrush and my mouth feels so clean. I think everyone should have one. They last too since my last one is still working. I had it close to 10 years and thought it was time for a new one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit to replace one that I had for over three years.  It works great and certainly does a better job than a regular toothbrush. Highly recommended by dentists. With this unit your are able to take it on vacation and not have to charge it for a week. It has a compact carrying case.  Overall, highly satisfied and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great.  Why anyone would buy a more expensive one is beyond me.  I purchased 2 others ones for family members.</li>
    <li> I received my new toothbrush in a prompt manner &amp; it was in good shape.  I ordered this to replace one I had had for many years that seemed to be wearing out.  I cannot stand to use a regular toothbrush anymore.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this particular brush is that it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second pause that I was accustomed to - but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the higher price for that feature at this time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 7 years. No problem so far.   Taking one star off because there is no feature to tell you if brush needs replacement and the head assembly where it meets the base can get moldy without you knowing.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, although not as helpful as the more expensive model which had signal to equalize use timing by area. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s a good choice</li>
    <li> This is an awesome toothbrush, well worth the money you pay for it.  I put the item on my wish list along with another item and am sure glad I did, when I came back to purchase the other item was reduced slightly and the toothbrush had a instant $10 rebate, what a deal! I received the same toothbrush last year for a Christmas gift and this year I bought one as a gift, I liked mine that much!! Very good product, very pleased.  I included the model # in my review so you know which one to get, ...Happy Brushing  :)</li>
    <li> This toothbrush develops mold in the cavity between the brush head and the grip. Maybe if I dried it off by hand everything after brushing it wouldn&#x27;t have developed the mold but it shouldn&#x27;t require that much effort to brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> I had other $20, or less, grocery store power toothbrushes, but this one knocks them out of the park!  I feel like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist after using this one.  BUY IT!  I highly recommend.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I feel like I get a much better clean using this toothbrush and I REALLY like the timer feature.  Sometimes I feel like I am done brushing even though the timer is not yet up, so I use those times to go over areas that have a greater tendency to build up plaque, etc.  I consistently receive positive feedback from my dentist when I go in for my cleanings every six months, so I guess it is doing its job.  The only negative thing I could possibly say is that the replacement heads are a bit pricey, however Target and Walmart both offer store-brand alternatives which are far more affordable and seem to clean just as effectively.</li>
    <li> I had another electric toothbrush, and the battery was slowly dying.  It would last an entire brushing session before I had to recharge it.  When it started to die before I finished brushing, I knew it was time to get a new one.  I like new things.  I like experimentation.  I&#x27;m the first one in the pool so I decided to get something different.  I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t actually move.  The thing just vibrates, and the vibration of the entire toothbrush moves the bristles a little.  If you press too hard, then you ruin the effect of the moving bristles.  If you press too softly, then it&#x27;s not very effective.  Plus the vibration tickles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the brush is shaped in such a way that it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver it into the corners and edges where you really need to get it.  There are two size brushes, but even the smaller one is difficult to maneuver into those deep places.  I didn&#x27;t like my old toothbrush because the head was too small and it took a long time to get complete coverage.  While this has a bigger head, the quality of the cleaning session is much less.  I can use floss to get into the deep dark places, and overall I get a decent cleaning, but it&#x27;s not that great.  It&#x27;s better than a cheap 1950s style toothbrush, but this isn&#x27;t the 50s anymore.  There are better products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t let the lower price fool you.  Pay attention now.  It&#x27;s only $44 or less if you get it at a discount, but they nail you on the replacement brushes.  A couple of replacement brushes cost more than the actual toothbrush itself.  They lure you in with the lower price, but then they suck blood out of you every time you get a replacement toothbrush.  They say that each brush head should last three months, but I find that I need to  replace it in about half that time.  So don&#x27;t get this instead of a $100 toothbrush thinking you&#x27;re saving money.</li>
    <li> It is the greatest electric toothbrush I had one befoee but after a while the battery went on it.  I ordered this new one and it is the best just as good as the last one.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is Disgusting!  Very poor design.  The handle gets filled with black gunk.  While you are brushing- water, toothpaste, and saliva can enter into the handle where the head screws into the handle.  I was so disgusted when I realized what was happening and I contacted Phillips about my issue.  They just told me to clean it with a wet cloth.  You need a small toothbrush and scalding hot water to get rid of the gunk.</li>
    <li> I owned an earlier model, purchased when they first hit the market for a much higher price. My dental appointments always go smoothly because using a Sonicare electric toothbrush helps reduce the tartar buildup. Between dental visits, using Sonicare gives me the same feeling as when my teeth have just had a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I could see in this model was the footprint on the base is a little smaller, a plus for small counter space. To my knowledge, after much research, there is no better sonic toothbrush than Sonicare. Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was a great Christmas gift to myself. I bought it on black friday so it was super cheap. It is amazing how much cleaner my teeth feel compared to manual brushing! Even though this is a cheap model, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed unless you&#x27;ve experienced a better, more expensive model. Since this is my first electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m happy with the results and feel no need to upgrade. My dentist didn&#x27;t harp on about what model I bought, she was just excited I finally bought one! If you want a good beginning electric toothbrush, or are just strapped for cash but want cleaner teeth, buy this one. It does its job! Oh and I took it on vacation with me for 5 days an the charge on this thing is excellent!</li>
    <li> this is my second sonicare in 10 years.  I am very happy with this product and as long as it is being made, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Shopped around to replace an old Sonicare. While this one did not have have the same features as the old one.  It did what we wanted and needed. We bought it from Amazon because the price could not be beat and past experiences with Amazon had always be good.</li>
    <li> For the tooth-cleaning capacity I would give this 5 stars. But I am REALLY offended by the inability to change the battery. I am now on my 4th handle in 2 years. The battery lasts no more than 6 months and then stops holding a charge. So the entire handle has to be discarded for what looks like a rechargeable AA battery inside. Phillips- what a waste of landfill! They make us throw out the whole thing for that?!? Phillips should be ashamed to have such an ecologically unfriendly package. Phooey.</li>
    <li> Will buy again and again until something better comes alone. Will last years with great service until the battery gives up. A clean the you WILL notice.</li>
    <li> I purchased 1 Philips Sonicare rechargeable power brush and 1 Oral-B professional rechargeable power brush about the same time.  The Philips toothbrush broke in 2 months.  The following are their comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;Philips pros: 2 min time stop; Cons: poor quality, traps all dirty in tooth brush, expensive replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;Oral B pros: excellent quality, replacement head a lot cheaper, easy to clean, cons: 2 min vibrate not stop&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it is worth to buy Oral B toothbrush, and saves money for long term usage with cheaper replacement head.  I will never buy any Philips power brush.</li>
    <li> I received as a gift a Sonicare Advance that lasted 14 years before it gave out, which I think is outstanding. I chose this model as a replacement since it was less expensive due to not beeping every 30 seconds, which I do not need to be cued to brush a different section of teeth; this model does stop after 2 minutes, which is a good amount of brushing. This newer model is better than the old since the charger basin is totally smooth and can be cleaned more easily. And if you go to yard sales, salvage type stores or sometimes even Ebay, you can find replacement heads that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday after it was recommended by his best friend. It was a big hit!! So much better than the manual toothbrush that he has used for years.  It almost felt like the teeth were polished right after cleaning making them feel so smooth and clean. Can&#x27;t wait to get years of use out of this product.  Now, I am thinking about getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> My Sonicare arrived in good condition and I couldn&#x27;t wait for the batteries to charge up.  It didn&#x27;t disapoint me the next day. It&#x27;s vibrations throughoout my mouth made my gums feel energized and teeth clean.  Recomended by my dentist, my decay level has dropped to zero, thanks to Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Some have complained about what this model does not have. To that, I say they should have read the features and then purchased the model with those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bare-bones unit works well. I have not had the problem others complain about regarding build up of crud under the head. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I keep the handle at a slightly elevated angle when brushing, which prevents toothpaste and water from running the other direction.</li>
    <li> I have had this thing a long while now and have even purchased some relacement heads. Once I discovered that I needed to remove the brush from the handle after every use and store both the handle and the brush head in the provided docking station my rating rose to 5 stars. This effectively alleviated any mold problems that had previously cropped up. This separating of the two pieces literally takes 1 second and is accomplished with a counterclockwise twist. Once you get the muscle memory you will not even think of it anymore. This prevents mold from growing in the base of the brush unit (in my experience). This is a mechanical and electrical item and therefore will need some maintenance. Mainly a recharge about once a month for me. The button will illuminate and beep to let you know it is time to recharge (which takes just a few hours on the recharge base). The brush will wear eventually, so about once a year I will replace the head. You can buy them in packs of three and then you are probably set for the useful life of the unit. The travel case works well and comes in handy. I have used it many times for travel. Most importantly, my teeth are very clean. In a pinch if the battery runs down, the unit can still be used as a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the best electronic toothbrush on the market for its price. Not only is it durable (I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a year now) but the charge lasts for a long time. The handle is comfortable, and the design makes everything easy. The vibration is very consistent and will polish your teeth in no time. It also does wonders for your gums, your dentist will love you!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a month, and it&#x27;s worked wonders for my teeth &amp; gums!  So much more powerful than a regular powered toothbrush!  It took a few days to get used to the intensity, but now I can&#x27;t imagine brushing with anything else.  I have always had a problem with red, swollen gums, and after my last dental check-up, I switched to this.  My teeth feel just as clean as they did after my dental visit, and my gums are starting to get a healthy pink look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using all different kind of brushes but this one beats every one of those! Never before I was able to clean those back teeth so well.</li>
    <li> This relatively inexpensive electric toothbrush works OK.  One disappointment its user reported to me:  it does not do the brief pause after each 30 seconds so that you know when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth and when the recommended 2 minutes of brushing are over.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job.  It is on a timed brushing which stops when your brushing is complete.  It is worth the money and is my second one.</li>
    <li> So this is my fourth one of these tooth brushes I&#x27;ve owned. The battery is not serviceable so once it gets to a point that it will not hold a charge you have to throw it away and buy a new one. They last about a year or so before the battery gets to the point that it won&#x27;t make it though a 2 min brush cycle. However, it cleans well and is soft on the gums.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a previous Sonicare that wore out. I naively assumed this model was the same as my old one. It does not have the \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; feature, ie. 30 second timer. ALWAYS READ THE FINE PRINT is the lesson learned. Otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> The family loves this tooth brush.  Littles brush for the full time recommended by the dentist as the brush turns off automatically!!  After every brush it feels like you just left the dentist chair for routine cleaning:)</li>
    <li> 1.  Product is totally reliable  2.  My dentist says teeth get much cleaner with electric toothbrushes and by the way he recommends Sonicare  3.  My dentist bills for my son (he was 7 when he first started to use one)  have so improved that when he left for college I got him a Sonicare to take with him  4.  Easy to use  5.  Last a very long time.  6.  Phillips backs their warranties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product except if you want to keep it really clean you need to untwist the head to rinse all the toothpaste off. Everything else [timing, pressure, battery life] is great.</li>
    <li> Everyone must own one of these by now. What a great item.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these years ago and still going strong. Since every member of the family has one, I wish they sold brushes that were distinctive in color. They have  pastel colored rings for identifying that have limited value because the colors are similar.</li>
    <li> This is a good, dependable toothbrush.  I bought this particular one for my wife after accidentally dropping hers into the bathroom trash can.  Otherwise, based on the other three units we have been using for years, I&#x27;m convinced it would still be operating today.</li>
    <li> Good price, Free shipping, great service. Needed Electric toothbrush. everything came up win win win. I love it when a plan comes together</li>
    <li> Brush but good ease of refraction of the inner part of the Iron after years of use but for the price I think it&#x27;s the best in its class</li>
    <li> The brush worked for a while, though it seemed to run down too quickly. As a scrubbing tooth brush goes, it did what it was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My favorite morning routine.  I love Sonicare.  been using them for years.  I simply just LOVE them.  Go buy it.</li>
    <li> I had a categorical aversion to electric toothbrushes until I started to borrow my ex&#x27;s. Now I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ve had this guy for a year and seems to be holding up well. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> This model of Sonicare doesn&#x27;t please me as much as previous ones I&#x27;ve had. I wish it had the feature that buzzes every 30 seconds out of its 2-minute cycle, telling you to switch quadrants of your mouth.  Although I move the brush about quite a bit, I&#x27;m not quite sure if I&#x27;ve done each section equally.  So if you have a bit more to spend, buy the Sonicare with the timer function. It will make your brushing experience more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not in love with the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; necks of the brushes. It seems to me that compared to previous versions, they seem to unscrew from the handle more frequently than the previous models I&#x27;ve had.  Further, the color ring on each head is a very pale shade. One is a grayish green, the other a gray. I had to write initials in permanent black marker to clearly distinguish my brush from my husband&#x27;s brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle holds a charge for a good amount of time. Charging time is not overly long. Sonicare does effective cleaning.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare rechargeable electric toothbrush works well, even after being dropped a few times.  It does not have an indicator that 30 seconds of brushing has elapsed to that you can move to another quadrant.  My previous Phillips had the indicator and it is worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush (or one like it ) for years. And a very good product. But I sent along a $5.00 rebate but after a long wait, I called their customer service and was told there was no rebate. I will not do business with Phillips again!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made to date - this toothbrush is incredible - wish I&#x27;d purchased one sooner.  It does an EXCELLENT job!  I wouldn&#x27;t be without one now for anything!!!</li>
    <li> This replaces our old Sonicare that would no-longer hold a charge. The older model had an automatic four times indicator that the newer one does not have, but that is really no big deal, as the toothbrush works great. Would buy this again if it is ever needed.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare toothbrush is great.  I love how smooth it runs and I love how quiet it is.  I have owned electric toothbrushes before and this one is just really pleasant to use.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t let you know when the two minute time limit is up it just stops brushing</li>
    <li> So far the rechargeable unit is working fine.  I expect it to last a long time as did the first model that I bought about eight years ago.</li>
    <li> I quit using a Sonicare toothbrush for a year and got a poor review at my dentist.  I got a new Sonicare and love it.  The head is smaller and more flexible and it makes my teeth feel VERY clean.  Won&#x27;t go without one again!</li>
    <li> love my sonicare!!!!! the only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is, it gets very dirty inside. i have to soak it in peroxide every week or so.&lt;br /&gt;but i do love the toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Cleans great. I love it. Downside: replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, and it gets nasty buildup (which you can smell if it gets bad) inside the brush head. The new Sonicare brush line eliminated this problem (the brushhead attaches differently) and I plan to upgrade when I have some spare cash.</li>
    <li> wow what a great product its the best on the market today, never go wrong with this product got a clean bill of health from the dentists office ever since I have been using this product and less dentists visits is a great thing. thank you for a wonderful product. I would have given this product 10 stars but only allowed 5 star rating. Ill be bk for another very soon in the near future. thanks sonicare.....my smile loves you!!!!!</li>
    <li> There is nothing more better then having a clean mouth. I have tried multiple electric tooth brushes but this product gave me a nice deep clean and massaged the gums nicely too, so if you care about your smile like I do then stop wasting money and buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super lazy when it comes to my teeth, so lazy in fact that I let a robot brush them for me.  This robot I call Sonicare 5300.  It seriously works great ( I haven&#x27;t had a cavity) and its super easy (just move your hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is having to buy the heads for the brush, but they are actually getting cheaper and they do last like 3 months.</li>
    <li> It cleans better than anything else I have ever used.  It is easy to be to aggressive, so be careful when using near gum line.  Very well made!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 12yr old daughter after it was recommended by her dentist. My daughter seems to like it and says her teeth feel cleaner then brushing with a regular toothbrush. I guess her 6 month check-up will be the final decider to how well it works and if it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> i replaced a 6-7 year old oral B sonic that would no longer hold a charge... and i almost bought a more expensive one than this phillips... but i&#x27;m so glad i didn&#x27;t!  this one feels like it works so much better than my old one... hard to believe it was so much cheaper!!!  my old one would signal when it was time to change brushed area... but i never paid attention to it, so i knew with this one i wouldn&#x27;t care if it didn&#x27;t have the fancy \\&quot;extras.\\&quot;   i read lots of reviews before deciding and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for myself after getting a fancier model by Philips Sonicare for my son.  I am very pleased with the operation of this toothbrush.  I have owned it for almost two years and have had no problems with it.  It has helped remove discolorations from my teeth and my gums and teeth look so much better after using this toothbrush regularly.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an older model I had.  Well i should have kept it.  On the older model, once you had a full charge the light stopped flashing and was a great nightlight for the bathroom.  No matter how many times you used it, it didn&#x27;t start flashing again until it needed to be charged.    This one starts flashing again even if you use it for 30 seconds and put it right back.  I hate it.  It&#x27;s like having an airport landing zone in my bathroom which faces right into my bedroom.    I&#x27;m going shopping this week for a new toothbrush and it won&#x27;t be a Sonicare.  I rated it a 3 just because it cleans fairly well.</li>
    <li> I priced these in several stores. This price could not be beaten. Now my grandson can take better care of his teeth at college.</li>
    <li> For an electric toothbrush, this gets the job done. I&#x27;ve used it every day for a couple of years and it&#x27;s never malfunctioned on me or exploded or anything like that. Unfortunately it&#x27;s designed horribly. I have no idea why the engineers at Philips would put tiny vents on either side of the bottom where you screw on the brush part as it&#x27;s an entry point for liquids. If you took care and washed it every day, you might not have a problem, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for in a toothbrush. If you do happen to leave it for a week or two, it starts to get moldy which is absolutely disgusting. I hate how I have to appropriate time from every week just to clean out my electric toothbrush. For how much you have to pay for replacement heads, this thing should be cleaning not just your mouth, but your entire bathroom. I strongly recommend you find a different product without the flaws this thing has, even if you have to dish out a little more money.</li>
    <li> the dentist advised me to get an electric toothbrush and this one was highly recommended by him. I have had no complaints.</li>
    <li> When my dentist suggested an electric toothbrush I thought it was kind of stupid.  I just didn&#x27;t think it would make much of a difference.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this. I tend to brush my teeth longer, given that it has an automatic timer, and my teeth really do feel cleaner than when I use my manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years, so this is my 3rd unit. I&#x27;m disappointed that this model doesn&#x27;t have the quadpacer, but the shape has improved over the years and everything else still seems great. Teeth feel so much cleaner than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> About 5 years ago my Dentist suggested the Sonicare as I have a serious plaque problem that would require surgery but after just a year there was considerable improvement in my gums to the point I did not need the surgery and the dentist cannot believe the improvement so I purchased this one for my daughter who has the had the same problem with plaque. . .We shall see but she has already thanks me and says her mouth has never felt to clean....great product.</li>
    <li> works great, but i can&#x27;t seem to keep water off the sink and mirror.  is there a  school that i might attend.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush.  It does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for ten years. I don&#x27;t believe you can beat them for gum and teeth care. My first one wore out about two years ago. I still have my 2nd one, but I wanted one for my second home so I wouldn&#x27;t need to carry it back and forth. I like this newer model better because it has a smaller brushing head and the brush arm is also smaller, so it fits in my mouth much better. It also comes with a very nice traveling case.</li>
    <li> I fully charged the toothbrush before i started to use it, it lasted 28 days on a normal use.  I brush really clean, the 2-min timer is great.  However, it needs frequent clean on the brush head, brush handle and the base(every other day).</li>
    <li> I have owned sonic care for many years.  When it needed to be replaced, I used a regular toothbrush until my new Sonic Care arrived.  The difference is night and day.  Nothing cleans your teeth like the Sonic Care.  My dental hygienist swears by them too and it makes her job much easier.   Wouldn&#x27;t own anything else!!!</li>
    <li> I have had a sonic toothbrush before.   This one cost considerably less but the only noticeable difference is that it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30seconds to tell me to move to a different quadrant.  For the money, I can figure that out by myself!</li>
    <li> Beware of Sonicare&#x27;s planned obsolescence.  I bought the Sonicare Crest i8500 IntelliClean Toothbrush in about 2006 (retail $120) but cannot find a replacement brush head.  The customer service rep told me the model was discontinued.  He then offered me a 15% discount on a new Sonicare toothbrush(!) So much for their self-touted, \\&quot;sense and simplicity\\&quot;.  I won&#x27;t get fooled again!</li>
    <li> I love Amazon!!! products that I need are available and delivery is prompt.  After I purchased this product, I found it at half the price.  I can&#x27;t remember if it was on this site or another one, but I guess I didn&#x27;t do enough \\&quot;shopping\\&quot; around.</li>
    <li> After just a year of regular use, the green power button on my handle developed a hole where water now seeps in.  Oddly it still works, but now when I brush my teeth, the water will drip out of the hole in the button and into my mouth which is DISGUSTING considering all the black mold these things grow in every nook and cranny (I think y&#x27;all know what I mean).  Nevertheless, this thing does clean my teeth spectacularly so I have to give it that...I recently went two years in between cleanings and my hygienist said my teeth hardly had any buildup at all!  My gums no longer bleed during cleanings, either--which they always did when I used a manual toothbrush.  But still...the mold thing is sick and I sure expected this toothbrush to last me more than a year!  I&#x27;m replacing it with an Oral-B which has the advantage of cheaper replacement heads.  I can&#x27;t afford to be buying a new electronic toothbrush every year AND the expensive replacement heads to go along with it.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush is great.  We just went on a 10 day trip and i used my new Essence Toothbrush without recharging it.  i had a much older Sonicare and it finally stopped charging.  The new one is better with the brush head tilted and smaller.  My teeth feel clean after use.  i recommend this product.</li>
    <li> anyone that does not have one should get one, your teeth feel cleaner as it goes between the teeth to clean them. You have fresher breath and fewer cavaties.</li>
    <li> I bought this in September of 2011, and after using it twice a day, everyday, it is still going strong in December of 2013. I love this product, it makes brushing ones teeth a pleasure. The only problem I have found (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars) is that moisture can run down the brush and enter the handle, creating a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. I keep my head slightly tilted back while brushing and, at least once a week, remove the top part, rinse out the inside very well, and allow it to air dry all day. There are condom like devices available for purchase that seal out moisture, but I have not tried these.</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome toothbrush! Could not be happier. Cleans your teeth as if it were at the dentist by hygienist. Make sure it is at least the 100$ model with pro style head. Lesser models that are cheaper have a weaker strength and they do not harmonically vibrate like this one. The higher end UV sanitation option is not necessary.</li>
    <li> If my dentist and periodontist recommend it....then it is good enough for me.  My cleanings have never bee this easy since using Sonicare!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Takes some getting use to at first. My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean without my sonicare.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush  but the  brushes are expensive and if you don&#x27;t change them often, you leave crud on you gums</li>
    <li> While this is a generally solid product the charging station is not stable enough and can be pretty easily tipped over. however, as  a toothbrush, once you get used to it ( a week or so) you&#x27;ll like and it certainly helps strengthen your gums. Just be aware, that it can get your attention and put you on your tippy toes as the feeling in your mouth is different.</li>
    <li> I find it runs out of charge quite quickly.  It is suppose to last much longer.  My initial purchase lasted at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this Sonicare to replace the one I had for ten years. It works well, except it does not pause every 30 seconds, to indicate when to change brushing areas. Now, I have to keep track of the time spent on each area myself. Goes to show that: 1) the cheapest isn&#x27;t always the best; and, 2) maybe I should have read the small print, or ascertained that if information is excluded, it means the functionality isn&#x27;t there. Still a good brush, but when it wears out, I go back to the other type.</li>
    <li> Every since I got this, my teeth have been so much smoother and polished. Wish that it had a quadrant timer to tell you when to switch, but that&#x27;s no big deal. The travel case is also great.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few months now in our house and they have definitely converted me from those old-fashioned brushes.    For a while we were purchasing the disposable Crest Spin Brushes thinking they were basically the same thing as a Sonicare brush but we couldn&#x27;t be any more wrong.  The power of the Sonicare brush is heads above disposable electronic brushes.    The Sonicare sensation is something you definitely have to get used to, but once you are it is clear sailing.    The low cost (comparitively) of these was what led us to finally make the switch but I may look into the more expensive Sonicare units in the future as the replacement heads for those seem to be cheaper in the stores.  They may come out to be cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mines for over 8 years now. I guess I&#x27;ve been lucky with the batteries with this one. This does a very good job with massaging the gum without excessive pressure on them. When I go in for teeth cleaning my dental hygienist has never commented about seeing any problems with my gum or teeth. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Once you use the sonicare toothbrush, you will be hooked.  It&#x27;s the best.  Your dentist will notice a difference.  Believe me.</li>
    <li> I ordered the one with the soft handle and got the one with a hard handle. I called about it and found out I was given one that cost $20 less then what I paid for. I would like to have the soft handle and might get it if not another one later, but for now I excepted the discount refund. I really didn&#x27;t want to go threw the issue of having to send it back and so on. So make sure if you order one, you get the right one you order.</li>
    <li> I looked at e-bay and said should I try it. But, a friend told me that Amazon has a good return policy, and reliable. So, I got it Fast, And it was exactly what was on the site. It was not used. I did not worry about how reliable when I ordered the toothbrush. Oh, This was to replace my old Sonicare that dyed after four years. This Sonicare is a little heaver then my last one. But, this is the cheepest Sonicare you can buy. You can change the battery when they fail. This is why it is heaver. And I had five toothbrushs left from my old Sonicare. I really don&#x27;t need all the bells and wissels of the newer ones. I just need clean teeth. And it does that very well!!!      The charger is different between models, so I am glad this came with one.       Great Toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works fine. Uncertain though on how to use my coupon because I don&#x27;t have a printer. Will check deeper into the matter</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for a couple of years now, and have had two different dentists comment on clean my teeth are. Can&#x27;t do better than that!</li>
    <li> You can buy more expensive power toothbrushes, but there&#x27;s no need to.  This is a solid, well made appliance that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and, judging by my experience so far, is going to hold up for a long time.  My days of spending $150 every two years on a new toothbrush are over.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement system. I had an original for 7 years. The Essence feels the same as the old one. The brush head is smaller than the original. I am disappointed it doesn&#x27;t time for 30 second intervals like my old one.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric toothbrush for my lady, and after hearing her rage about how well it worked for her, I bought another for my self. I am very happy that I bought one, as it really does the brushing job every day.</li>
    <li> When my original Sonicare Advanced gave up the ghost after seven solid years of service, I wanted another Sonicare fast! The Sonicare customer service team told me that the battery life is supposed to be five years so I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth on the first one. They offered a discount and free shipping, but Amazon of course was still cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this toothbrush won&#x27;t completely eliminate cavities (I get them between my teeth-a flossing issue), it&#x27;s definitely kept my teeth cleaner than just my regular toothbrush did. My whole family has been using Sonicare products for years and have all had excellent experiences.</li>
    <li> I had originally received a Philips Sonicare Toothbrush seven years ago as a Christmas present.  It was fabulous until it simply didn&#x27;t turn on any more.  For a full even years of daily use- it worked wonderfully.  It was time to buy another and so I chose this one, assuming it was roughly the same as my old one.  It works equally fine, except this one does not beep.  My old one would beep at 30 second intervals until the two minutes of running time was complete.  It reminded/encouraged me to move to a new quarter of my mouth.  The toothbrush works just as good, but the reminder beep really helped ensure that I was giving equal attention to all quarters of my mouth.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5-stars, which ultimately may be my fault for not researching that quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived intact and works well. Effective AFAIK.</li>
    <li> An excellant product at an affordable price.  Who doesn&#x27;t like a good deal and this was a grat deal.  Good products, affordable prices, and superb customer service keep bringing me back.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sonicare toothbrush to replace my old one.  The toothbrush is just what I expected after having one before.  It does a thorough job of cleaning the teeth and gumline.  My dentist recommended the Sonicare over the Oral B power toothbrush.  When I went to the dentist for my next checkup after using a Sonicare toothbrush, my gumline was 100% better.  I was a little bit worried about replacing my Sonicare because of how much they were, but the Amazon price was a bargain and well within my price range, as well as the great outcome on dentist visits.</li>
    <li> Brushing my teeth with the sonicare toothbrush nevers seems like a chore-  in fact I look forward to it.  Every day I get the closest thing to a professional dental cleaning feel without the waiting rooms.  Upon the first few uses your mouth may not be used to the vibrating, but after just several weeks I no longer notice.  This is a great value considering dental bills it may save you down the road!</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush and I wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other brand.  I purchased my original one well over 8 years ago and that certainly says something about the quality of this unit.</li>
    <li> My teethe feel like I have just visited the dentist every time I use this thing!  It gets into the hard to reach areas really well.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who is a retired dentist suggested I use this electric toothbrush.  It truly is great.  The batteries last two or more weeks between charging (I brush twice a day for the full two minutes).   The toothbrush turns off after 2 minutes brushing.  The brush action is sort of \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; and it works great.    My dental hygienist has said my teeth and gums are in much better shape after using this brush.   If your really serious about taking great care of your teeth, get this brush and some braided dental floss and you&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
    <li> Excellent design and features. Has relatively fast re-charge of a powerful vibrating brush. The automatic cut-off feature tells the user when \\&quot;enough is enough\\&quot;. Replacement bushes are somewhat on the expensive side.  Cliff</li>
    <li> i will never go back to manual brushing. my teeth are whiter i can feel the clean. i&#x27;m so glad i decided on buying this power toothbrush and not from a different or cheaper brand.</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised to have it arrive a day earlier than expected. Very happy with the product, great x-mas gift</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare that I had bought in 2000/2001: [[ASIN:B00008BFXJ Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush]] finally gave up the ghost.  This model [[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White]] is missing the 30 second quadrant timer and adjustable intensity setting, along with the led battery indicator.  However, since I never really used or paid any attention to these features, I just figured I&#x27;d order this one since it was less than forty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this one seems to have a stronger or faster pulse.  Also, I noticed they switched from using Ni-CAD to NiMH for the internal rechargeable battery, so that&#x27;s a nice touch. This one seems heavier but around the same size as my old one. I like that it at least comes with a travel container, but the older one had a better more compact travel container, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that I paid about 10 times the amount I paid for this one, for my old one back in the day, I&#x27;m not griping about the features.  I just want to clean my teeth and this does that very well, maybe even better than my old one :)</li>
    <li> **Pros**&lt;br /&gt;- Two minute timer that still works if you turn it off and on again temporarily to spit.&lt;br /&gt;- Really gets teeth clean (surprised my dentist)&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Cons**&lt;br /&gt;- The price really fluctuates on this thing, be careful if you&#x27;re spending over $50 for it.&lt;br /&gt;- Makes your head ring when the plastic part of the brush head touches your tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars. Really enjoy this over manual brushing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that whitens teeth and gives you that sonicare smile or supersonic smile! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants good oral hygiene and a bright smile. The shipping was timely, and the product was sent without any damage.</li>
    <li> I used to have a sonicare and then switched to the Oral-B model.  I found this on sale during the holidays and thought I would switch back.  I didn&#x27;t notice the change when I went to the Oral-B but when I switched back I could tell this model worked a lot better for me.  I am done switching and I will stick with Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I love the brush action of this product.  Works great. Recommended to me when I wore braces, and it was the easiest way to keep my teeth clean with all of the equipment.  WARNING.  You have to constantly clean under the brush head.  The replaceable heads do not seal to the battery unit.  You have to remove and rinse the inside of the unit weekly to prevent mold.  If mold does develop, you might as well give up an buy a new unit.  Not what you want from an expensive toothbrush.    I have kept replacing the brush, but it is frustrating.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife to use.  She really like the Sonicare and found it to be impressive over the Oral B brushes of the past.  The travel case is a plus.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it.  Now the sink is all lined up with our Sonic Toothbrushes..  Totally Awesome~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a week and already I can tell an improvement! My gums used to bleed every time I brushed and they no longer do. I am hoping with time it can improve my mild gingivitis. Well worth every penny I paid!</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend, who always wanted one, as a gift...  It came in wholesale like packaging, so not in a nice retail box like you may see in the store... the shipping box was the brush box.... that threw me for a loop....  so i had to get a gift bag and put the brush et all in it.  My friend loved the item and asked me if where i bought it, could i leave a review....  well here it is:  \\&quot;This brush is Great!  Feels like im getting a dentist cleaning everyday--- plus it wakes me up in the morning with its motion! i love my brush\\&quot;  nuff said.</li>
    <li> I always get positive feedback at my routine dental checkups.</li>
    <li> Working very well &amp; is very reliable.  Makes my mouth feel really clean &amp; is handy for people who have trouble brushing well--like children or people with arthritis.  Only excellent reports from my dental hygienist.  If you&#x27;ve never used one before, you should know that it gets your circulation going in your gums (helps keep them healthy), but you get used to the feeling in a few days and don&#x27;t notice it after then.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for about 2 weeks now. I really like it. The only feature it really comes with is the two minute timer, which is what my dentist wanted me to have. If you have never used an electric toothbrush before you will love this thing. My teeth feel like they were just polished by a dentist all day long.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase! I was reluctant to spend the money for an electric, but it really does clean that much better, and this particular brush isn&#x27;t over the moon expensive. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a very poor product.  No matter what I&#x27;ve tried, I cannot get it to work more than maybe 30 seconds without needing to be recharged again.  During the few seconds it runs, it&#x27;s great.  So for a mouth with about 3 teeth, it would be a wonderful product. But if you have more teeth than that, you should look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bought this item a few years ago for my fiance and he LOVES it!  He has used it daily for almost 4 years now and the toothbrush has yet to malfunction *knock on wood*.  He loves how well the product works and it leaves his teeth/mouth feeling clean.  Great price on Amazon - I&#x27;ve seen the same toothbrush being sold in retail stores for at least double this price.</li>
    <li> Fair value for the money. The noise is, at first, really weird. Almost scary, in a way. To the extent I considered returning the toothbrush for the first couple of days. Then now, after I week, I don&#x27;t even notice any more. Give it some time. It&#x27;s big also. Way bigger than I thought. BUT, definitely brushes pretty darn well. Go for it.</li>
    <li> What can I say about this product? It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve never been happier with any other product as much as I am with this one. First let me start off by saying they gave me an estimated ship date then when I placed the order it said a day before that which was a Monday &amp; I ordered on the Monday or Tuesday before &amp; my package came on that Saturday. I love when things come early. So I opened it up &amp; it was fully charged &amp; I went to town on my teeth. &amp; omg, my teeth felt like I just walked out of the dentist &amp; in just that first brush they were a lil whiter too. I&#x27;m so happy with this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve tried oral b (sucks) &amp; others but none compare to this. &amp; for those ppl that complain about mold &amp; water getting in idk what they&#x27;re doing Letting it swim in the sink? Cuz water don&#x27;t get in mine but maybe a lil. &amp; anything that close to my mouth I don&#x27;t mind cleaning every now &amp; then, lazy ass ppl. I order a SonicSeal just to be safe but I&#x27;m very happy with this product. The only thing that coulda made it better is if it was free. I highly recommend this product.!</li>
    <li> I gave the unit one less the full number of stars because it just died after several months.  I didn&#x27;t give it less because after a 15 minute middle of the night chat session with Philips they agreed to send a replacement in the next week or two.  Also, I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for several years and while I despise that the brushes now have far less life then they used to, the units do work very well and result in much better dental health for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about 1 thing; the model shown here SEEMS to be from 2007.  I have to hope that the stock isn&#x27;t that old, so I&#x27;m hoping someone from Amazon can clarify this.  Other then that, this is a perfectly servicable model at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare for about 8 years, and it finally died. The battery wore out. No big deal, I bought another. Batteries don&#x27;t last forever! The ONLY issue I&#x27;ve had with my teeth during the time I owned the Sonicare was a cavity. I got the cavity because I STOPPED using the Sonicare for a while....long enough to get a cavity. Manual brushing is just not as good as Sonicare brushing. Floss 1-2 times daily, and brush with this thing twice a day, and your teeth will thank you. After getting that cavity I learned my lesson. I always use my Sonicare, unless I&#x27;m traveling and I&#x27;ll sometimes opt to use a manual brush since it is lighter and more convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> My mouth felt cleaner than a dental cleaning procedure with this Sonicare. I have traveled with it, without charging it for several days at a time and it holds a good charge. It comes apart easily and fits in the holder provided. I knocked off 1 star because I wish the head had softer bristles and the cord wrapped up a little better, but it truly is a great product.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;d expect from an electric toothbrush. Had one before, but needed a new one because I lost it.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Sonicare almost 17 years ago.  It finally quit on me.&lt;br /&gt;I need not tell you why I bought Sonicare again.  I like the travel feature&lt;br /&gt;on this one.  My other model did not have this feature.  While most people&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t wait to get home from vacation to their own bed, I could not wait to get home to&lt;br /&gt;my Sonicare.\[[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare HX5351/30 Essence 5300 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> For years I have used simple battery powered toothbrushes so I thought I&#x27;d have a go with this toothbrush. There was a world of difference with this toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner and my gums were never healthier. My old toothbrush only had one part of the bristles that would go back and forth at slow speed. With this toothbrush, it is high speed and really does the job. Wish I had found this one sooner. In regards to the complaints of people who say the design is flawed and it gets all gunked up with toothpaste and scum, I&#x27;ve had mine for two months now and clean it weekly. But honestly, there is little to clean.  I guess some people&#x27;s manner of brushing is different than mine as practically no liquid gets down into the brush. Truly a great product!</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare is not like any other electric toothbrush you may  have tried.  Do yourself a favor and order one now.  It arrived in about 2 days, thank you Amazon Marketplace!</li>
    <li> This is a great basic sonic toothbrush.  I had the higher model for 4 years, but this one works just as well for less money.  Its use has corrected my gum problems, and even my dentist is pleased.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old sonic base was working. Wow. I just love. Feels like I&#x27;m getting a cleaning at the hygenist sp? every time I use it.All the other  model&#x27;s bells and whistles are not necessary. Save yourself some money.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush makes me drool like a baby leaving me with a minty fresh chin, but all in all it does a great job of removing the black heads from my chin...</li>
    <li> This is the third Sonicare that I have owned.....The Best as far as I am concerned...Battery life is 5 to 7 years (my experience)....I don&#x27;t like the&lt;br /&gt;twirling head brushes....</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, read other reviews and so far performing as stated.  Very happy with product.  It is powerful, smaller handle than my old one and leaves my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> We all use the sonicare product and have acheived unbelievable results.  Our gums and teeth stay white and healthy.  Took a couple of days to learn a comfortable way to use this product but the results are really astonishing.  We have already recommended this device to our family and friends. I have used Amazon on several occassions and been very satisfied with customer service and products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get another one of these for a long time, but the price was never right until now. I&#x27;ve always liked using Sonicare, and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my overall dental health. The Sonicare was as good as I remembered--I like being \\&quot;forced\\&quot; to brush my teeth for longer than I normally would. If you have chronic gum issues, it is a really good product to help control them.</li>
    <li> Things seemed pretty straightforward at first, instructions were easy... packaging perfect, and about 1/3rd the price of the models I see in stores!&lt;br /&gt;Second, yes it does an amazing job at cleaning &amp; polished teeth very nicely, though it takes getting used to... even in training mode, it&#x27;s vibe will resonate through your head!  Also, the \\&quot;training mode\\&quot; it was in when first used didn&#x27;t turn off manually as stated, though it did go to &#x27;normal&#x27; as it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From watching the wear indicator, I&#x27;d say 3 months is about all you would get from a head.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback I just discovered is that the replacement heads are harder to find than other models out there, and they are quite expensive, especially for the compact heads.  I can find multi-packs of many other heads for other brushes that average $7-9 per head; I know our economic churning has caused some inflation that I&#x27;m having trouble adjusting to, but $15 to $20 each for replacement heads is ridiculous to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given this 4 stars, or maybe 5 if wasn&#x27;t for the issue with the heads.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dental hygienist that she really recommended the Sonicare.  I now have to agree with her.  I purchased two-one for my college age daughter and one for myself.  I love how it makes my teeth feel like I have just had a professional cleaning.  I highly recommend this product.  I plan on buying each of my family members one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> While the sonicare does keep my teeth much cleaner than a non-electronic brush, it wears out after only a couple of years of usage. Mine no longer charges, and the batteries which power the toothbrush cannot be replaced. I like the simplicity of the essence, but would appreciate a model with replaceable batteries and a more efficient charging system. Moreover, the brush heads are very expensive. All together, I&#x27;m not sure that the product is worth the regular expense.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Sonicare for many many  years it finally gave up the ghost so I bought a new one. This toothbrush is a must for everyone, and awesome price.</li>
    <li> My sonicare that I had for about 10 years stopped working so I knew I had to instantly get a replacement for it, which I did.  I really can&#x27;t live without my sonicare it makes my teeth feel so good and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums.  I love the 2 minute timer on it because it forces me to brush my teeth for the time that is needed.</li>
    <li> Have owned this model for about 6 years.  I think the battery finally couldn&#x27;t be charged any more.  Very pleased with having the same product again.  Have since bought this for our adult children, both of whom like it as well as we do.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonic care.  The batteries do die out after awhile.  I think my last one lasted seven years.  I like this model because it does not have the annoying quad pacer feature.  Highly recommended.  Without the fancy box (ships in cardboard box) you save $40 buying from Amazon which is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Over the years we have had 3 of this (or similar model #) unit. My cleanings from the dental tech are short and sweet, I was so happy to finally just have a small cavity every few years... not a root canal or extraction as in the past!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a spare to take on vacation. It&#x27;s a little simpler than my usual one as it only has one speed but that didn&#x27;t affect its performance. Kept the charge for 2 weeks while travelling. It arrived in very simple packaging--a brown box, so you are not paying for the glossy cardboard store box. Excellent price and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Its is really nice and works so great so far, I think the quality is also good too. I like it.</li>
    <li> I was amazed to find this on Amazon for only $40; I found the same product in person at Target for $69.99!  I&#x27;ve used it for nearly 2 weeks now, and I feel a significant difference in my teeth.  They are a little whiter than when I used the Target brand (Up) electric toothbrush (sells for $15) with Crest Whitening with Scope Toothpaste.  The surface of my teeth feel cleaner and no, my gums did not bleed as you hear when others use this product for the first time.  The brush head is much easier to keep clean than when I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush, which developed grime build-up so easily.  The brush heads are a little expensive to replace, more so than Oral-B, but it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> When my old Soniccare toothbrush died (after many years of faithful service), I started looking around both online and in the local stores for a replacement.  I was really surprised at how expensive most of the models were that were available - guess I&#x27;d expected with new advances and competition that the prices would have gone down instead of up.  I looked at several models on amazon.com before deciding to purchase this one.  The price was better than anywhere else, so I also purchased the replacement brush headds at the same time.  So far, everything works well and I&#x27;m enjoying my new toothbrush a lot.  The only thing I kind of wish it had is the timer gizmo like my old one, that beeped every 30 seconds so you know when to move on to brushing another quadrant of your mouth.  I really liked that feature.  But I&#x27;m adapting to this brush just fine.  It&#x27;s definitely a great deal for the sale price advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  This thing is amazing!  I will never use a another brand of an electric toothbrush!  I will never use a regular toothbrush again!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Am not really pleased as I did not notice that there was no thirty second alarm to let you n&lt;br /&gt;know to change quadrants in brushing. Will have to pruchase another sonicare system.</li>
    <li> I have been using sen-sonic for long time..was so happy to find replacement when my previous one died.Great price and great service.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well w/no issues.. Good product holds a good charge and works very very very very well(1 more word)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter last Christmas,It went well but she complained the replacement brushes are VERY expensive..So I can only give 3 stars</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s used it everyday for the past 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> This toothbrush rules.  At first it felt like I was brushing my teeth with alien technology, but I got used to it after about a week.  It was a great price, it doesn&#x27;t have all those fancy features that some toothbrushes have, but it has everything I need and was in the budget.  My dental check ups have been better since using it (about 10 months)</li>
    <li> Thanks to Robert Fredericks for observing that this is the best-value model.  It really is a great deal, and has all the features that you need, none of the extras.    A friend told me how well Sonicare works, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I now feel like I&#x27;ve been inducted into a secret society!  You know when you go to the dentist for your semi-annual cleaning and polishing, how pearly smooth your teeth feel afterwards?  Sonicare leaves your teeth exactly that clean and polished.  I really don&#x27;t understand why my dentist hands out free conventional toothbrushes with every visit when he should be telling all his patients to use Sonicare.  That&#x27;s why I describe it as a \\&quot;secret society\\&quot;.  Having tried Sonicare, I can&#x27;t see myself every going back to a conventional toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Ah, the toothbrush. I was told to use a brush for sensitive teeth by my dentist (apparently I brush too hard), but I hated it. My teeth never quite felt clean even after extended scrubbing. I decided to give this electric toothbrush a try, and boy howdy, I wish I&#x27;d done it years ago! The vibration takes a bit to get used to, but Philips planned ahead for this. The first dozen times it runs, it runs at a slower speed so that you can get used to the vibrations. Brilliant. Your teeth will never feel cleaner after using this a time or two. It&#x27;s like going to the dentist every day.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she is very pleased.  She also has a similar gadget, but your&#x27;s uses sound, which i think is unique.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone who is serious about taking care of their teeth. Helps you save so much money in the long run</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this model.The first unit lasted over 10 years. Simple to operate. Rechargeable battery lasts for several brushings without recharge.</li>
    <li> the tooth brush is too small and the plastic part hits the gums  real hard while it vibrates so it is not worth the money you pay for</li>
    <li> I bought my first (and only) Sonicare several years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong and doing its duty twice a day.  After using a Sonicare, a regular toothbrush seems absolutely primitive. If I forget to pack the Sonicare on an overnight trip, a regular toothbrush is akin to stone tools and bear skins and I can&#x27;t wait to get back to my Sonicare. It&#x27;ll tickle for the first week or so, but after that you&#x27;ll kick yourself for not getting one sooner.</li>
    <li> Great product! It has a two minute timer which is great for knowing how long you should brush your teeth.</li>
    <li> So far this has been a very powerful toothbrush.  I am very happy with my purchase.  It stays charged for days at a time.</li>
    <li> I received this excellent toothbrush from Amazon today - while I love the toothbrush, I was planning on giving this as a gift, but it arrived as it was shipped from Phillips to Amazon: not in a regular retail box like the product comes packaged in the store, but in a brown commercial box with address labels all over it.  I really can&#x27;t give it as a gift this way, or if I do, I&#x27;ll have to think of some clever way to hide all the shipping labels on the box.  Disappointing!</li>
    <li> As you can see if you have checked the other Sonicare products this one does not have all the features of some of the higher priced units.  Well if what you want are clean teeth then this is the one to buy.  All you need to know is if it is charged.  This model has a light on the front that blinks when charging and is solid when charged.  That&#x27;s all you need.  Brushes are cheap and last at least 3 months.&lt;br /&gt; This unit works.</li>
    <li> Not what we expected from this product. It is average to below average.  The unit doesn&#x27;t hold its charge for long and the brush head size is smaller than a normal brush.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is exactly as expected. I have used one for the past two years, and it performs exactly as expected and is very convenient. It&#x27;s a no-frills model; therefore, it&#x27;s less likely to develop difficulties.</li>
    <li> Purchased this when it was on sale and completely worth the price. Leaves your teeth feeling clean just like how it feels after you visit a dentist. The battery lasts pretty long, about 5-6 days on a single charge with 2 brushes a day. The package also came with a travel case which comes in handy. The charge station is compact enough so that it does not require a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> Seriously gets my teeth sparkly, squeaky clean...just like the dentist but better since you don&#x27;t have to go! Haha I bought this as a replacement for my last one, which lasted a whopping 12 DANG YEARS!!!!! No joke! These suckas are built to last. Now if I could only get my hubby to use one (he gets weirded out by the vibration), he might get some more action!! Let that be a lesson to you boys: Cleanest mouth possible&#x3D;more action!! Buy one of these babies!</li>
    <li> Soniccare is the greatest toothbrush we have used to date.  We would buy them again when we need new ones well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this toothbrush and had not been to the dentist in about 2 years. It wasnt on purpose but we were pleasantly surprised to find out our teeth were in GREAT condition. My husband usually always has to get scaling done but this time a clean bill of health.</li>
    <li> My Philips Sonicare toothbrush has improved my dental health and has bee east to use as well as quite effective.</li>
    <li> Worn and old, but I&#x27;d been looking for this book for a while. It was the first adult book I read that my mother surprised me and took me to the movie of &amp;#34;a book&amp;#34;. I had to have it again to see if some of the names were remembered correctly by a then 11 year old girl.</li>
    <li> First time using an auto toothbruch and I&#x27;m embarrassed I went so long brushing my teeth the old way.  Great investment, my teeth have never felt cleaner.  We&#x27;ve also taken it on a 4 day trip and had no issues with it running out of batteries. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Teeth have never been cleaner.  This is a great product for anyone who wants their teeth to stay cavity free without using toxic flouride.</li>
    <li> Dentist said our daughter brushes to &amp;#34;vigorously&amp;#34; so she asked for this.  She thinks it is the best.  Sounds weird.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older Sonicare that wore out. My only complaint is that is does not have the 30-second timers that my old unit had. However, it does have a setting that allows you to work up to full force gradually, which is useful if you are new to using a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I gave this Sonicare as a Christmas gift.  I purchase a Healthy White Sonicare, I believe in these products.  I am one who always try to take care of teeth.  I go to the dentist twice a year, I floss and I use my Sonicare 1 to 2 times a day.  The results are evident and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My first time use Sonicare and after several months of use, I could confidently say that there is a noticeable difference between the manual toothbrush and electric one. And this toothbrush actually has a smart setting that allows you to get used to full force gradually, Only complain is you probably have to wash the inner part of this toothbrush or you won&#x27;t be able to stand it. Next time, I might choose an upgrade version of Sonicare.</li>
    <li> The Philips sonicare toothbrush is wonderful. I really think it made a difference in my teeth and my gums. Actually my dentist noticed the difference after about six months of use. But it&#x27;s been almost exactly a year since I purchased this from Amazon. Part of the plastic on the main toothbrush handle is broken. I have no idea how it happened, I just took off the old toothbrush part that was ready to be changed and noticed that piece of plastic was broken? I did nothing different than I&#x27;ve done before and  the piece just broke off. Now it makes is a Horrible sound And does not make the correct movements as it did before. I&#x27;m going to try to find some information out from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall it is an awesome toothbrush that does the job exactly as explained.</li>
    <li> I got 4 for the price of one with a rebate card I had. Of course, I waited many years to get this deal, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> After eight months from my last checkup, the person who cleaned my teeth thought that I probably was using a Sonicare toothbrush because of the way my teeth looked to her. That was a nice compliment.</li>
    <li> I got this after my dental hygienist recommended it for in between visits.  Just using it as night I notice a HUGE difference in the softness of my teeth and I feel like it&#x27;s doing a better job than normal brushing. After my last visit to the dentist my hygienist asked if I started using it because she noticed that my teeth were not as rough as usual at from other visits.</li>
    <li> This entry-level Sonicare work extremely well.  The battery last for ever.&lt;br /&gt;It is however disappointing that Philips does not offer an easy and convenient way of identifying the brush heads.  My wife and I are sharing the brush.  There is no way of telling the heads apart.  I ended-up marking them with a permanent marker.  Obviously not the most elegant option.</li>
    <li> Typical Sonicare Toothbrush with no extra features.  Basic unit without the 4 sequence timer, charge indicator, or fancy handle.  Simple stand and case.</li>
    <li> Phillips makes great electric toothbrushes. I have been using them for years. This is my second one, my first one crapping out after 5 years. For the price and quality, I&#x27;d consider it a good deal. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like I&#x27;ve done the best job possible (after flossing).  The only thing that irks me is the timer.  I have my own system of tooth cleaning and have to reset the timer once or twice while in the process.  I, personally, wish the programmers would give it a rest and let me decide how long I want to brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> Battery died (wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge) after a year of use, no return/refund/response from Phillips Sonicare. Since purchased the next level up, and have been happy with it. These are a pain to keep clean, to keep charged, etc. Not worth the money, spend a little more and get the slim head version.</li>
    <li> If only I could have someone to brush my teeth for me.</li>
    <li> I am loving this Sonicare toothbrush. Feels like I just stepped out of my dental hygenist&#x27;s chair. Love that it has a timer, so I can \\&quot;pace myself\\&quot; and clean each area thoroughly. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I wanted an electric toothbrush and this one has worked out perfectly.  No complaints.  I like that it came with a travel case and that it has a 2 minute timer.  I received it quickly.  So far. So good.</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for many years and loved it.  The battery finally gave out and I needed a new one.  Several of the new ones come with 2 handles but I just wanted the basic one with no bells and whistles.  I purchased an ordinary rechargeable toothbrush but it is much heavier than my original one and although it shuts off after 2 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 seconds like my original one.  I would take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Want really clean teeth?  Use a Sonicare toothbrush - highly recommended by many dentists and you know - they&#x27;re right.  Makes your teeth feel like you just came from the hygienist every time you brush! Our family has been using these for many, many years - we even take it camping with us.  We&#x27;ve burned through 2 sets already (nothing lasts forever but definitely worth replacing).</li>
    <li> I have owned an Crest spin brush for over 10+ years. Now that Ive used the Sonicare I will never go back to any other toothbrush! The best way to describe the feeling after you use the Sonicare is it feels as if I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist every time I brush my teeth!</li>
    <li> I love sonicaire. This is a solid product but it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second timer which I loved on my previous model. I tend to brush too fast and the timer makes me do it right.</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for an earlier model and I am very pleased with it. Top of the line.</li>
    <li> I bought this Sonicare HX5351/30 Essence 5300 toothbrush as a replacement to my original Sonicare Essence 5000 when the handle would no longer hold a charge. Just like the original, it cleans my teeth beautifully, helping my professional cleaning to last longer. I believe that this newer model is better at keeping the water out of the handle&#x27;s interior which was a problem with the original model. The cost was better at Amazon than I could find anywhere else, although, like gasoline, it seemed to be priced higher each time I looked at it. I paid $20 more for the same unit in January than I would have in December...I guess it was lower then because of Xmas....but that is the season I buy for others, not myself. Bummer. However, Amazon is always the place I go when I want to find something specific, and they usually come through.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush for my husband in Dec 2010. Just eight months later it started discharging every couple of days. By now, it only holds its charge for about 24 hours and then takes all night to charge it back.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, and all saliva and dirt collect inside the toothbrush, just like other people mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have spent more and get a better brush.</li>
    <li> Product works well.  Cleaning weekly is a hassle.  The junk that gets in the creases is gross. Otherwise I\\&quot;m pleased.</li>
    <li> When I first brushed my teeth with this I thought \\&quot;oh no I&#x27;m sending this back\\&quot; the vibration is very different from the standard electric toothbrushes out there. My friends who also use sonicare told me to just give it some time. I&#x27;m glad I did. I really enjoy it now and am totally used the sensation. I love the 2 minute timer. My dentist loves that I&#x27;m using this product. Very good basic model. Works for me.</li>
    <li> Our dentist told my husband to buy one of these. The dentist highly recommends it, plus sells it as well. However, Amazon has a better price so we bought it here. My husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> If you have gum issues you will forget about those with this toothbrush. I have had bloody gums my entire life - I don&#x27;t remember one time at any point in life where i&#x27;d bite into an apple and didn&#x27;t see pink residue where I had bitten. I tried everything - flossing, gum sensitive toothpaste, brushing more than twice a day, massaging gums, everything was useless. And flossing made them bleed and get irritated even more. This tooth brush however..:. Two weeks, and NO gum issues whatsoever, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. No buildup at the gum line, no receding gum line, no irritation and no bleeding. Nothing. My gums are pink and healthy, my teeth&#x27;s surface feels like glass - polished and clean, and it feels so good when you&#x27;re brushing, you can really feel how you&#x27;re cleaning everything out of your mouth that needs to be cleaned out. I would recommend it to anyone, and it&#x27;s absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I bought it after going to the week after week getting my gums and teeth cleaned. I have an early stage of gum disease, mainly due to not flossing, etc and I knew I had to make some changes. I bought this because my sister used it and it got off teeth stains after a few weeks of use. It&#x27;s a great product!! Afterwards your teeth feel fresh and thoroughly cleaned. The downside would be the cost upkeep and making sure you wash/clean it every so often. You have to buy the brush heads that are quite pricey also. My sister bought a cheaper version but she says the bristles just aren&#x27;t like the sonic are ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall great product!</li>
    <li> My basic sonicare brush also lasted about 15 years or more. It just stopped holding a charge (not sure if it&#x27;s related to me sticking an \\&quot;elite\\&quot; brush head on it). Even though it&#x27;s probably true \\&quot;they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used too,\\&quot; Sonicare has one more loyal customer right here. I&#x27;ll write back to report when my new \\&quot;essence\\&quot; craps out :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a month now.  The vibrating brushing experience is different but effective.  i like the feeling like you&#x27;re massaging you gums as you brush.  A great value from amazon and I hope my next check up shows an inproved cleaning performance.  I have sensative gums and this brush helps with a easy brushing tachnique.  Holds a charge well and ergonomics are good. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is due to expense of replacement brushes.  About $10-$15 each.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a fairly old e-Series Sonicare that had given me good service, but only lasted a day or two between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was good, so I didn&#x27;t worry too much about losing the half-minute bleeps that made it so easy to brush evenly with the old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope was that the switch from NiCd to Nickel Metal Hydride would give improved stamina per charge. However the opposite has proved to be the case. On one occasion, this unit failed to complete a brushing immediately after being removed from the charger (though it&#x27;s usually rather better than that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that I&#x27;ve just been unlucky, and most examples of this product are fine. But if the problems continue, I&#x27;ll be returning this one as soon as I return to the USA. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve returned to the old one.</li>
    <li> My old one wore out a few years ago and my Dentist recommended I start using one again.  The price and shipping on Amazon was less than going to Costco!  It makes my teeth feel so much cleaner than a regular toothbrush - it does really tickle on the roof of my mouth, but as I recall, that will go away after a week or so.  I recommend this to anyone that likes that \\&quot;just been to the dental hygenist\\&quot; feel!</li>
    <li> I have one of those jobs that often has me passing out on the couch before I brush my teeth.  My dentist used to get on me about flossing more... not anymore.  I get big grins from my dentist, and much shorter visits with this brush.  Beyond that I just like how clean my teeth feel, and how white they look.</li>
    <li> No problems with the product or seller!</li>
    <li> This product works great but expect to spend a lot on replacement toothbrush refills.  Less expensive aftermarket toothbrush refills are not available to work with the main unit.  You will need a bare minimum of 4 refills per year so expect to spend quite a bit more money brushing your teeth than you used to spend if you presently use traditional, manual toothbrushes.  You will have to decide if it is worth it to you.  The product does a great job in my opinion, but it is not cheap when you consider the cost of refills.</li>
    <li> This is a really good toothbrush I had problems getting it to the back of my mouth at first its a little hard to manuver at first without buzzing your teeth, but I have gotten more skilled with manuvering it as time goes by...I found it harder to manuver than a rotary battery tooth brush which is what I used before this one but its about the same as a manual tooth brush but gets much better results...I have had no problems with slime or any liquid getting into the chamber so this problem may have been fixed in the latest models...I&#x27;m not sure if its worth the price though my dentist claims that they clean better than regular rotary electric toothbrushes but I really haven&#x27;t noticed that much of a difference....if I had it to do over again I might just get a rotary battery one for less money. I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t clean any less well than a rotary brush, though, so it may be better for the message that it gives your gums, or something. It may be better at getting out food particals attached to your teeth and gums but I cannot say that for sure because I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference ...the build quality is first rate and its attractive but the added cost may or may not be worth it depending on how much you value your toothbrush and feel its worth the added cost....</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. The head moves up and down rapidly as you move it front to back. It really gets em clean! And it has an internal battery and sits in a charging port when not in use. It also comes with a plastic travel case. It&#x27;s a great bargain for the price, and came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> This was suggested to me by my Dentist. Im very glad he did. Best toothbrush I have owned.  And the price om Amazon, great !</li>
    <li> This product cleans my teeth very well by electronically moving the bristles faster against my teeth than I ever could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that pretty much sums up any electronic toothbrush.  Further, I have not used any other ones ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I give it five stars?  I guess because it does its job.  It is sturdy.  I know this because I have dropped it a number of times but it still works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaws in it are that it will automatically stop when I am brushing (maybe this is because I dropped it?  I don&#x27;t know) and the cavity and screw threads where the replacement head screws in get moldering filthy if one does not clean there pretty much every time after a use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure these are not too much considering what is a great product overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Sonicare brush for nearly a year.  I purchased it after my Oral B died.  I did a bit of research on the various Sonciare models, and I decided to go with the lowest-end Essence model.  It just seemed that all those bells and whistles were unnecessary; I don&#x27;t need extra beeping, lights, or speeds, thank you very much!  One speed with the automatic 2 minute shut-off has worked fine for me.  I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the amount of brushing I get between charges - typically 5-6 days (3 brushings per day) after a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the design of the brush head which accumulates what the reviewer of the top critical review aptly called \\&quot;slime.\\&quot;  Check out that review for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note - I tried to save a bit of money by purchasing Target/Up and Up brand replacement heads.  The packaging ensured it would work on this brush.  However, something was definitely off as these heads made an ungodly rattling noise, and they barely moved.  Fortunately, Target gave me a refund.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! It is very simple and easy to use. Mouth, Teeth, and Gums feel great after, definitely not a substitute for flossing but close. Only con is it gets this nasty black buildup under the brush head so you have to clean it real good every 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses these; we absolutely love them! Very easy to use, the charge lasts forever, and you can&#x27;t beat how much it helps your teeth! :)</li>
    <li> Once you start using a brush like this, there is no going back, so dig deep in your wallet and make the plunge.</li>
    <li> Not so great, I upgraded</li>
    <li> This is quite simply the best toothbrush I have ever owned. At first I was skeptical about buying an electric toothbrush, but after using this my mouth feels so clean, I never will go back to using regular toothbrushes. This also was highly recommended by my dentist, who tells me it is much more effective at removing plaque than traditional toothbrushes. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this Philips Sonicare HX5351/30 Essence 5300 Rechargeable Electric...&lt;br /&gt;Philips Sonicare in 2010 and still works!, very good quality, you just need to change the heads. Battery last for a long time,</li>
    <li> This toothbrush makes each morning or evening feel like you just left the dentist and he/she polished your teeth.  I would pay double the current asking price on it without thinking twice.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is powerful and always leaves my teeth feeling like I just left the dentist. I have had the product for about 6 months now and it still works great. The only problem is you water gets inside of the head and it gets pretty nasty in there if you don&#x27;t clean it often. I now just take the head off after I brush my teeth to let it dry and put it back on before I brush to prevent this.</li>
    <li> Great basic sonicare toothbrush. I bought this for my mom who just about had a heart attack when I told her how much my sonicare cost a few years back. She said she would never spend that much money on a toothbrush. So we bought her one for Christmas a few years back....needless to say she won&#x27;t use anything else now. This was a replacement because she wore the other one out. :). Sonicare is the best</li>
    <li> My third one!  My dentist recommended this toothbrush for me, and they have a price variety for all bank accounts.</li>
    <li> After my dentist warned me about the condition of my gums (just a warning, no problems yet) I went out and bought a Sonicare toothbrush. I used it religiously for the next 6 months and upon my return visit my gums had healed back to within the healthy parameters. The only difference I had made in my daily activities was the use of this toothbrush. It seemed ridiculous to me to pay this much for something I can buy at the drugstore for $2, but now it seems well worth it and much cheaper than even 1 dental procedure.</li>
    <li> bad for dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was gonna have to have gum surgery &amp; i got this baby.  within 6 months my gums had grown back b/c this brush prevents you from brushing too hard &amp; wearing away your gums.  i&#x27;ve been using them for over 12 yrs now.  this is my 3rd one.  only bummer is after a couple years the rubber button wears away.  you can still start it by pressing the hard plastic knob underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i prefer the next model up which beeps every 30 sec to have you switch quadrants.  this one you have to count.  not the end of the world but a nice feature to have</li>
    <li> We now have one each for me and my wife, they work well, and the dental assistant doesn&#x27;t have to dig and gouge to get the plaque off. Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for almost three years for now. No issues. Battery was great. Had to recharge once in 15 days. Cleans pretty well. Have recommended it friends and family.</li>
    <li> Purchased this on a suggestion from a friend who had one and am extremely satisfied. I have never had a toothbrush that leaves me feeling like I just left a dentist office - this one does!</li>
    <li> everyone should get one of these.  i initially bought this because i got braces.  it made brushing less difficult with the hardware and my dental visits improved as well.</li>
    <li> We had a Walgreen&#x27;s store brand before this. (Vibrating tooth brush.) Brushes no longer available. This is a whole lot better in cleaning and is much stronger. And very easy to change brush heads - (share w. wife).&lt;br /&gt;We both follow up using a waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is it just comes w. one brush head. Had to order 2 extras - you just can&#x27;t order 1.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on March 6th, 2012. As of today, June 12th 2012 the toothbrush will not hold a charge. Its presence in the charger goes completely unnoticed, no blinking light, nothing, it can sit there for 24 hours and nothing. I started to think maybe it was the socket so I&#x27;ve tried different ones to no avail. About two weeks ago it started dying oddly fast, whereas before it was holding to the \\&quot;2 weeks without charge\\&quot; claim it would need to be in the charger nightly to assure it would work. I&#x27;m guessing the battery inside is now fully defunct. Now I&#x27;m looking to see if I can return this obviously defective unit and thought I&#x27;d start off with a candid review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISION: I&#x27;m updating this pretty late but I was just going over my account and forgot about this review. I called Philips directly. After providing them the serial number on the toothbrush handle they sent me a replacement handle free of charge at no cost. The replacement has been working great! Very helpful service.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is good at its job; I have used one for several years and am very pleased with it. (This is a replacement.) It has worked much better for me than Braun Oral B electric toothbrushes did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibbles with the product are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The charger neither protects itself nor works when fed 220 Volts 50 Hz. For trips up to 10 days, I do not need the charger, but I took it on a longer overseas trip and fried it; I am so used to modern electronic equipment handling 110-240 Volts and 50-60 Hz that I failed to check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The battery is not replaceable. This means (a) added expense for the consumer, (b) wasted time for the consumer if he dutifully goes through the awkward process to remove the battery to recycle it safely, and (c) a poorer environmental footprint for the product, especially when consumers just toss it in the trash and the battery ends up in a landfill, which it should not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unaware of a justification for this decision; it is not like 2009-2010 MacBook Pro batteries that were an odd shape squeezed in around other components for the largest possible battery size; this battery CAN be replaced with a standard rechargeable battery (with difficulty, and a soldering iron!) if you follow instructions posted on YouTube, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISHONEST REBATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What prompted me to write this review was the fact that Amazon told me I would \\&quot;Receive $5 from Philips\\&quot; as a rebate. However, when I actually filled in the rebate form, I realized that this was untrue; I would only receive $5 off if I made a further purchase of a Philips product from a very short list. If I did not need any of those products, I would not receive the $5 that Amazon promised me. (There were also $10 and $15 rebates on more expensive/higher-profit-margin products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that Amazon would use this type of dishonest marketing, which can still be seen at the time I write this. (Go to [[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare HX5351/30 Essence 5300 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] and click the link \\&quot;Rebate Forms for Recent Purchases.\\&quot; This shows the Amazon offer of $5, but when you click the link \\&quot;Philips Rebate Form\\&quot; you see what you actually get from Philips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have complained to Amazon, and I hope they will take some action to restore my previously high opinion of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $5 rebate is not a big deal; it is the deceiving of customers that angers me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the same toothbrush when it&#x27;s battery finally died.  The price is very good, now - much lower than it cost several years ago.  My only complaint is that it lacks the quad-pacer which is a feature I really liked on the older model.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare is a great toothbrush.  I got my first one on the recommendation of my dental hygenist, and this is a replacement.  The first one lasted at least 5 years, and it holds a charge  for weeks.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift i ordered for my cousin and she loves it to this day.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush performs just like any of the other model Sonicares two issues though:&lt;br /&gt;1. The way the heads go on is very poorly designed, water gets inside of the toothbrush and begins to rot/mold/stink. This requires a lot of toothbrush maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;2. These tooth brush heads have no generic option and cost $8-$12 a pop. They have to be replaced about every 3 months too!. Adds up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend one the the higher end models or the oral B sonic. For a slight higher upfront cost, you get a much easier brush to maintain and the generic heads are like $2-$3.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone.  It was recommended to me by an orthodontist in downtown Miami.  I happened to go with my friend to her daughter&#x27;s appointment and saw they had sonicare and the version with the small round head.  I asked which she recommended and it was Sonicare because the round brush can easily hasten receding gums if improperly used.  (and how many people really truly have been taught to brush their teeth by current scientifically proven methods)</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel super clean. I have had a few of these now. And other than the price of replacement heads, which is ridiculous. They are the best.</li>
    <li> This product has been used in this household for many years. We have 2 as a matter of fact. They last a long time and are trouble free.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product at a good price.  I already had some replacement heads bought for my previous toothbrush.  They fit!  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush.  Really leaves you feeling as though you&#x27;ve just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  Well worth the cost of the toothbrush and the ongoing cost of purchasing replacement brushes (they recommend a new brush every 3 months which comes out to about $10 every 3 months).</li>
    <li> I love it - much better than the previous oral b tootbrushes i have owned. the travel case is excellent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my 4th Sonicare and was totally disappointed.  It stopped working completely after 3 weeks and since it never occurred to me to keep the packaging, I&#x27;m out my money.  Unlike all my previous Sonicares, it has no quad timer which I absolutely loved. So maybe I&#x27;m glad it died.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  My teeth feel so much cleaner after using it.  My dentist has even noticed the improvement after using it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 7 years.  I could never never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. The toothbrush has a timer so you don&#x27;t brush too much or too little. The speed of the brush really gets your teeth clean. After 2 weeks of use I really see and feel a difference in how clean my teeth are. At first the vibrating seems a little strong but by the second or third day it becomes normal. You will need to purchase another brush head if you have a significant other who wants to share.</li>
    <li> Cleans teeth as promised &amp; then some. I have used this product for 4 years, this is my replacement, as the rechargeable battery is good for about that long. Since I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush, my teeth have been whiter, and I&#x27;m a coffee drinker. My dentist has told me that there&#x27;s nothing left for him to clean at my cleaning appointments!</li>
    <li> Love the sonicare toothbrush. This is a pretty basic model. I miss the 30 sec timer, but its not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> Good $$$ I would buy this product again, it has the best price compare with others supplies. Yes, I would recommend this to a fr</li>
    <li> I bought this with 2 extra brush heads.  My teeth have never felt so clean.  Received fast and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I got another one of these and it still gets moldy even though I clean it weekly. It is totally gross to think about all of this black gunk slithering around inside something that&#x27;s going into my mouth. I don&#x27;t know what my other options are, but I&#x27;m seeing my dentist next week and will definitely ask her. It may prevent cavities, etc., but they need to do something about the infection that gets in all of the different parts.</li>
    <li> I love this! Does a great job brushing my teeth and even my dentist and hygienist have noticed the difference. Keeps me honest and insures I brush my teeth the entire two minutes of recommended brushing time.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased this toothbrush sooner. Even my dentist was blown away at how clean my teeth and gums were. I will never stop using this. Even my boyfriend purchased one after I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips customer service was great. My first toothbrush was acting strange and stopped after just a month. They immediately sent me a new handle and packaging to return the old one. I&#x27;ve had this for just over a year now with no issues. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very happy with our purchase of the Philips Sonicare Essence Electric Toothrushes which were recommended by our Dentist.  Each of our dental appointments since we started using te Sonacare Essence has been an improvement of our dental health.  We are very appy with this purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and haven&#x27;t seen any problem with it. It&#x27;s just that the replacement head are expensive. It would be perfect if the heads costed less $$</li>
    <li> It is a great price and works good! great gift- It seems to work good- I gave it as a gift- so I do not know much more than that!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for his birthday.  He likes it and uses it every day.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Would buy no other and buy for my family as well, and they all like it as much as I do</li>
    <li> Sonicares are almost  universally recommended by dentists for cleaning teeth.  I&#x27;ve used one for many years and it will save you thousands in dental bills especially if you  use it in conjunction with a water pik flosser.</li>
    <li> Once you brush your teeth with an electric toothbrush it&#x27;s very hard to go back to a regular toothbrush. It just feels so much cleaner when using an electric one. The battery last pretty long as well like around two weeks or so never really timed it but it feels long before I have to charge it again. I also like the automatic 2 minute timer it has so basically you just keep brushing your teeth until it stops.</li>
    <li> How long is the battery suppose to last? After 6 month of use, the battery barely last minute after an over night charge. This is the second one too.  The first one didn&#x27;t hold a charge; returned in 3 days.</li>
    <li> Great product - easy to use and works as advertised. Battery lasts a long time between charges and case provided makes it easy to bring with you when you travel.</li>
    <li> I bought the HX5351/30 and you guys sent me the HX5310. I didn&#x27;t bother to check because I didn&#x27;t assume this would happen but now that I&#x27;m shopping for replacement heads I looked on inside of bottom part. Not nice.</li>
    <li> I like the Sonicare. It helps me clean my teeth much better than when using a regular toothbrush.  It is very easy to operate and helps me get some of the hard to reach teeth brushed more effectively. There seems to be many quality battery and electric toothbrushes on the market.  Only shortcoming is the cost of buying replacement brushes. But, one also pays more for automatic transmission. I prefer AT to MT and EB to MB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it, like most other products reviewed, at Amazon.</li>
    <li> but am looking for another type of toothbrush. This was to replace a &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; which had a 30 second timer.  This one doesn&#x27;t have the timer and I miss it.  Otherwise it does the job.</li>
    <li> I was replacing my old Phillips Sonicare so I knew it would be of good quality.  The best part was that the packaging for the new Sonicare was easy to remove.  The old packages required scissors, a knife, brute strength and time, lots of time.  The new packaging is SO much better!!  Thank you Phillips!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price.  I could not get out to purchase this item and decided to look and see if I could purchase it here.. I could, I did, and I will do it again</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for a more expensive Sonicare model. Toothcleaning wise, it&#x27;s great, with one giant BUT: I found mold growing inside mine within a few months. Not just mildew, but jelly-like colonies. The top part unscrews from the bottom, charging part, plus the seal between the head and the body is not water tight. I cleaned it out, reassembled it, and then a few months later: more mold. I&#x27;d suggest splurging on one of the other Sonicare or similar products rather than deal with the potential grossness with this one.</li>
    <li> the first time i brushed my teeth with this - it was kinda intense. but not in a bad way.&lt;br /&gt;it was just... different.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this end of may, and have charged it 3 times in approx. 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;i am so, so happy with this product. really cleans well.</li>
    <li> I bought this version to replace one no longer manufactured by Philips and find it much improved. I like the smaller brush size and the coloration which lets you know when it&#x27;s time to change them. The handle is smaller as well and fits my hand better than the previous one. It holds a charge well and travels easily.</li>
    <li> I like the way it cleans my teeth, but the build-up of gunk and mold inside the brush is absurd; worst design ever.  If you don&#x27;t mind brushing your teeth with festering mold just an inch or two from your mouth, this is definitely the brush for you....</li>
    <li> Best tootbrush made. Cleans your teeth and gums better than any other product on the market. Give it a try</li>
    <li> lasted less than a year</li>
    <li> Although it feels like there&#x27;s a wasp in your mouth, it feels good. I thought it might be abrasive to gums, but it&#x27;s not. Does a super good cleaning job,and that&#x27;s why we buy them.  The brushes are VERY expensive, so look for multi-packs on sale.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does everything it says it does; It cleans your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a stylish case that you can use as a travel case, very nice! It has a stand that powers your toothbrush through the plastic (WHAT!!!!). It is very well designed, its very easy to set up and start scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this product 5/5 stars, would brush teeth again.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second Sonicare because I had the first one for 4 years and the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t stay charged for more than half a brushing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Super affordable, my previous version was almost 90 dollars cause I bought it several years ago when these weren&#x27;t so common yet. What a nice price difference!&lt;br /&gt;-All I have to do is hold my toothbrush in place, who doesn&#x27;t like being lazy? :)&lt;br /&gt;-The brush does a GREAT job, way better than my manual brushes used to.&lt;br /&gt;-The charger/stand is convenient&lt;br /&gt;-The travel package is great since I am constantly on the road for work&lt;br /&gt;-The battery lasts a solid week+ using it twice a day which is great for business trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The previous version I had used to do a small pause every 30 seconds to let you know your progress into the two minutes. This made it easy to evenly brush parts of my mouth. This one just has the start/stop.  I miss my 30 second blips! Bring them back!&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement heads are still the same cost (expensive), they can add up if you change them out every three months like the directions say.</li>
    <li> In the short time I&#x27;ve had this product, the stains on my teeth are gone!( using baking soda tooth paste) It was powered up when it got here, fast shipping too. I think this will last at least a few years for me. I highly recommend this product if you like to stay AWAY from the dentist office. Also fair price on this unit.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these toothbrushes. They do perform very well while the battery lasts. After about a year both batteries have gone bad.. lasting about 30 seconds after a 24 hr charge.. I was in the navy and am pretty quick about brushing my teeth.. 30 seconds just isnt enough. if the battery was replacable, I would give this product 5 stars.. as is.. 2 is best I can do... No.. I will not buy another one till they fix the propriatary battery problem!</li>
    <li> I have had a Philips sonicare electric toothbrush for a number of years and paid considerably more for the first one I bought.  This new acquisition is an excellent replacement for my worn out one, and the price was very, very reasonable.  It works to do a thorough job of cleaning teeth and I get very high marks when I visit the dental hygenist. Thank you Amazon for making this unit available at such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Russ Huff</li>
    <li> As-in factory refurbished.. This unit right out of the box didn&#x27;t perform the same as my other exact unit which was guaranteed new.. Doesn&#x27;t do the ramp-up speed nor the warning buzz/vibration when it&#x27;s time to switch between upper and lower jaws.. Just somehow screamed the word refurbished or maybe product knockoff but the product does work..</li>
    <li> Have never been disappointed in Sonicare Electric Rechargeables.  Use them all the time.  Braun makes a good one too.  They&#x27;re all out to get our money, so spending the least for quality never bothers me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare products for too many years to count.  I highly recommend these products for good toothcare.  Wish they had been around when I was young.  I would not have so many fillings!</li>
    <li> My dentist initially recommended this product and I&#x27;m still on my original sonicare some 5+ yrs later. This one was ordered to replace my wife&#x27;s unit which did die (may have been dropped). I love the performance/feel of brushing w/ this device. I would never go back to manual brushing. Even w/ some inconvenience (charger is bulky) I carry mine on trips. New brushes are necessary every 90 days or so for best cleaning. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product works very well and the price was great, it was quickly dispatched and arrived in no time. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I wore out the first one and it looks like it will happen again. good product!</li>
    <li> My toothbrush&#x27;s timer option does not work - it does not cue me at 30 seconds to change positions in mouth.  Didn&#x27;t even bother sending it back - I can do it just fine without this feature and love this toothbrush for overall oral health.</li>
    <li> Once you use a Sonicare, your teeth will never feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; when using an old fashioned tooth brush.  For the first time in years, I had a perfect dentist appointment and I owe it to the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This brush cleans my teeth better than any hand held brush had before. The only major problem it catches crud where the brush screws on, and sometimes it spins lose and needs to be retightened. I like my finances panasonic better which has a better design but is more expensive. For the money this is a really good product and the battery amazing will last for up to a month. I took it to Europe without the charger for 3 weeks, no problem.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this toothbrush. Keeps charged for at least a week. The travel case is a must have for traveling.</li>
    <li> My Hygienist and Dentist will be the real arbitrars. Hope I am not damaging my teeth with the-too often-contact of the vibrating brush head against my toothes (sic? but I like).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of electric toothbrushes it seems. I tried this one as my first one ever and much prefer the old classic I get from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush! It&#x27;s worth every penny and would but this over again. I even bought a few for family members for the holidays. (sounds weird but they loved it)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Sonicare system twice a day for over 10 years and I won&#x27;t use anything else. Leaves your teeth and gums feeling like you just had them cleaned and polished at the dentist! Just try this product and you will not go back to a hand toothbrush again; your mouth will thank you for it.[[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the vendor or the item as such.  The only downside is that it lacks the 30 second prompts that I got from my previous Sonicare.  Disappointing, but overall a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter just got braces and needed a good toothbrush, so we ordered the sonicare tooth brush and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Well most all of my friends have a sonicare, and I finally decided to make the leap in purchasing an \\&quot;expensive toothbrush.\\&quot; I did some research on the models, and finally decided on this one for combination of quality, features, and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buying experience: I just want to give Amazon a little plug here. Once i purchased my Sonicare I was really excited, and thought spending the money on a quality toothbrush was a good thing to do (even though im a college student). Anyway, I get an email saying my package has been delivered by the post office... even though I was in my house, and never heard anyone. LONG STORY SHORT: I couldn&#x27;t find any package, post office was very uncooperative, and told me to try and call amazon. So I did. Literally after explaining my story to Amazon they shipped out a new one on rush delivery, in return to send back the original one if it was found (unfortunately it never was). I got my new toothbrush in two days, and wow, Amazon customer support needs to be commended on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product. (Its been almost a year of using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other versions of sonicare that have the 30 second beep, gum massage, ect., but I actually prefer the E5300!&lt;br /&gt;The 2 minute intervals are perfect for me, and I just would never use the gum massaging speed of the other ones, so just give me the e5300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would brush pretty regularly, at least once a day when i&#x27;m busy, but i could never get satisfactory white teeth. It took no more than 2 weeks with this Sonicare to really notice how white my teeth were getting! They feel infinitely cleaner than with a regular brush, and its so nice to just put the sonicare on your teeth, and have it do all the work! yeah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing cleaning compared to brushing a regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;- Cost: The deal on here was insane, way cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen Sonicares in store.&lt;br /&gt;- The head of the Sonicare is still in great shape after almost a year of use! Im actually pretty surprised for this one&lt;br /&gt;- I have heard people talk about it getting gross in the base of the Sonicare, but after not opening it up and cleaning it a whole year, I hardly see anything!! I generally rinse, and dry my toothbrush quickly after every use, so maybe thats a key thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy! just push the button, wait for it to stop, and move to the next part of your mouth&lt;br /&gt;- Battery: I generally do leave mine on the charger, but when i go camping, so a friends, or leave it off the charger on random, it normally takes about 20-30 uses before the battery dies, thats more than enough in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-This version only came with 1 brush head, but I haven&#x27;t needed to buy a new one yet, so I guess its not too bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this brush!!!! As a University Student about to apply to dental school, this toothbrush has given me a smile that I can go into the interview and finally be proud about! Just one day without it, and using a regular toothbrush, and my mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome experience all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barrack Obama approves this review!</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Soniccare Essence 5300 because it had a good price. And I&#x27;m very happy to say it&#x27;s stood the test of time. It&#x27;s very durable, and I also saved money by signing up for the replacement heads that are shipped every few months. Nothing has happened so far, but would buy another one right away if it did.</li>
    <li> Makes your teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned. I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I understand (from my hygienist) that it&#x27;s a good idea to replace the brush head fairly often, as it can be abrasive to your teeth if you use a worn one.  Other than that, I don&#x27;t know any downside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. The price was appealing and it works great. I don&#x27;t have issues with cleanliness but then I don&#x27;t slobber all over it either. I&#x27;ve took it on a two week vacation and didn&#x27;t have to recharge it... it was like the energizer bunny, just kept on going. The brush attachment last&#x27;s about 5 or 6 months and they are a bit pricy but the job done in cleaning my teeth and mouth is superior. When the one I purchased dies, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use for it will splater water and paste all over the bathroom if not held in a closed mouth.</li>
    <li> This thing appears to do the job.  I have had good reports at the dentist since using it.  You absolutely don&#x27;t want to use target replacement heads without ear protection.  The target heads are so loud I had to stop using the brush while I ordered new replacement heads.  If you do use target heads I suggest ear plugs with them.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. It actually removes stains from teeth. I had stains from smoking that have been brushed away by my sonicare. It&#x27;s great for scrubbing my tongue too. The heads for the Sonicare last a few months and they aren&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I have ordered and haven&#x27;t had any issues. Brand new at a great price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> As mentioned, this is my third Sonicare. I got my first one about 12 years ago after a very unpleasant dental cleaning visit. My teeth were sore, my gums were bleeding, and because I tend to be an aggressive brusher, I was pushing my gums back. Six months later, I had no sensitive teeth, the gums had stopped receding and the hygienist said  my teeth were &#x27;like glass&#x27;- and she hadn&#x27;t thought that since she was in hygiene school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother was having the same issues, so I got him a Sonicare for Christmas. It was not received enthusiastically until he had his first check up post Sonicare- he had a similar result: much less tarter build up, little to no cleaning discomfort, and a fast visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never dread my dental visits any more. A cleaning typically has 45 minutes allotted, but the hygienist finishes with me in about 20- and she takes her time.</li>
    <li> Wore out one in a year?&lt;br /&gt;It was as advertised, works great!&lt;br /&gt;that is a lot of words for a SonicCare two to go</li>
    <li> Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
    <li> I had one before, and since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve had no cavities.  My last one finally stopped holding a charge, so I bought another one.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with the more expensive ones, this one does a great job and the heads are cheaper to replace as well.</li>
    <li> I have used the Philips Sonicare  for several years. I replace the brush every 3 months by buying a dual pack.</li>
    <li> I got this electric toothbrush because I had two of the same brand and used them for years.  Very dependable.  Also the price on Amazon was about one-third less than the same in a retail store.  I would recommend this product to anyone desiring to purchase an electric toothbrush.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t have the timer beep that notifies you when you&#x27;ve sufficiently brushed each quadrant of your teeth (like my other two did).  But hey, the price was right!</li>
    <li> She thought it was great--and we  have not discussed it recently.  I will ask her the next time I see her.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually like it much at first, but I have found it to be great once I got used to it.</li>
    <li> I love these toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - clean clean teeth, travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - only 120v charger (so if you travel, a 220v transformer is needed) chargers cost around $35 and a new set is with charger is not much more (I lose chargers often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be awesome if they came out with a water pick that uses the same battery and charger.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this toothbrush. Price is perfect. Gets my teeth nice and shiny with minimal effort. If you can move this device around your mouth for two minutes without harming yourself, I&#x27;d recommend it for you. I bought the kid versions for my little ones and another for my wife. Our smiles are amazing. Like a 24/7 Orbitz commercial.</li>
    <li> I must have bought this 5 years ago, maybe more. I charge it maybe every 2  weeks now, then unplug it to eliminate battery damage. Original battery, no issues at all. It has helped me with better brushing... I like that it has a 2 minute timer, which makes me brush longer than before I had bought it. I think everyone should have an electric toothbrush with a timer so you don&#x27;t stop brushing until it turns off. It also beeps and flashes a few times when the battery is getting low, a great feature!</li>
    <li> This is the best you can do to yourself first thing in the morning. I am happy with the battery life and size of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about is cleaning. You ll have to remove the brush from handle to clean it thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I must have received a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; in the last unit I bought.&lt;br /&gt;Things like the on/off switch would not work properly but the warranty had just lapsed.&lt;br /&gt;This one is great.&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
    <li> The Ni-Cads fail. Not user repairable unless you are an expert Mr. Fixit.</li>
    <li> It does a great job brushing teeth, and my last dentist appointment was less like that scene in The Shining where blood pours of out the elevator.  The timed brushing is making a better person, according to my hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to echo everyone who complains about the mess inside the brush.  They still make this model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how or why a design flaw like that got out of testing.  The cavity between the screw-on top and the handle is like a mini sewer of grey slime that had no place to go and never dries out.  On top of that, without some special implements, it&#x27;s an almost impossible space to clean out.  When it occurs to me it&#x27;s there, I have to wonder if it could ever elevate to a health issue having it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it is worth getting an electric brush, and a Sonicare.  I will get one again, but not this model, and I will heed the reviews better in the next model I get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different electric toothbrushes in the pas and I&#x27;m convinced that this one far outshines the rest. SUPER</li>
    <li> I like using it to brush my teeth, I like using it to brush my teeth, I like using it to brush my teeth</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t live without it.  It is faithful and dependable.  keeps a charge for days at a time.  will buy one again when I need it.</li>
    <li> Purch in july 2012.  Now its the beginning of may 2013.  Stopped holding a charge.  Not really worth the hassle of returning for 40 bucks</li>
    <li> The design is such that liquids get inside the unit and mold grows within a week. Gross&lt;br /&gt;You have to take it apart to clean the mechanical area which is a mess.</li>
    <li> PROS: More than 4 years later and this device is still going strong. Battery life will last for more than a month on a single charge. The Philips brand brush heads last around six months before replacing (I clean them regularly with Hydrogen Peroxide), and they had better, considering the asking price. Worth noting is that Walmart sells an Equate brand brush head that fits perfectly to this model Sonicare, though the Philips brand brush heads are superior, in my opinion. A little softer and not as noisy during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for nearly five years now and it doesn&#x27;t actually clean any better than a good quality manual brush. I&#x27;m a non-smoker but like to have 3-4 cups of coffee daily and I still need to see the dentist to get the stains off my lower teeth every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting feature is that the device will turn off after 2 minutes of use (which is the recommended brush time: spending 30 seconds in each quadrant). If you turn the brush off prior to the 2 minutes but turn it back on within a minute or so, it will remember where you left off. So if you brush for one minutes, manually turn the device off, then back on again, it will still cut off after an additional minute. No idea how long it must be off to reset completely.</li>
    <li> I can almost skip flossing because of this toothbrush. My Dentist loves it</li>
    <li> This electric Toothbrush works great. Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this brush.  My teeth have that &amp;#34;just at the dentist&amp;#34; clean feel.</li>
    <li> I never had good brushing or flossing habits, and now I&#x27;m in the midst of a very lengthy and painful mouth rehab (luckily I have good insurance now.) But we&#x27;re talking root canals, crowns, bridges, I have 11 cavities (!) that need to be filled. I bought a Colgate battery power brush and that was fine, but I figured why not spend 30 more dollars and get the best on the market? And it is. I was anxious to use it when it arrived (you have to wait 24 hours of charging time) and when I did the first time I was amazed. One of the best features is the 2minute timer. Most people don&#x27;t estimate their brushing time correctly, so they usually go for about a minute. ALSO, there are great instructions in the booklet on HOW to brush, which most people don&#x27;t know about. For instance, I never knew that going back and forth on your teeth is equivalent to \\&quot;sawing a tree,\\&quot; that you should make little circles, do all four quadrants, then the top chewing surfaces. Also, that it should be aimed 45 degrees relative to your gum. This is basically the equivalent of having a cleaning every time your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this with the WaterPik to get maximum results if you want to have healthy teeth and gums (and gum disease is the main dental problem in adults.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO IT! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Ordinary hygiene is of course extremely valuable. But Sonicare takes it to a much higher level. After getting my first one for myself many years ago, I purchased one, as a gift, for my family members. Everyone loves it! The way it cleans your teeth feels like you just went to the dentist for a cleaning. It is a superb device. I plan to own one for life.</li>
    <li> Excellent Sonicare offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little heavier than the one we replaced, but overall great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original Sonicare had a 5 led charge display, so one knew just where the charge status was.  This one only has a blinking light when it needs a charge.  Worked well the first time after 3 weeks.  Information said it would only charge for 2 weeks.  Hopefully it will decay to lasting at least 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> For the money you spend on this electric toothbrush, you will feel a cleaner mouth. Worth the money compared to other electric brushes. Also a plus because it has a small brush head. Some of the other brushes have brush heads that are too big.</li>
    <li> ii am delighted that my adult son introduced me to sonic are.  i have gotten used to it easily and i feel refreshed afterward.  thank you for your intelligent product.  bonita</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is excellent. It really does a fantastic job of getting your teeth clean. I always feel like my teeth are still dirty if I need to use a manual toothbrush for whatever reason. I love that it has a 2 minute cycle and will let you know every 30 second interval. That really helps me to properly clean my teeth on every side equally. The carry case is great, and the toothbrush will hold a long charge for a vacation. I just got back from a 17 day vacation and didn&#x27;t have to charge my toothbrush once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing though is how durable and reliable this thing is. I bought this toothbrush to replace my old one that broke. I got my old one as a gift and it only stopped working after a whole 10 years. I will gladly spend the money for a product that will last me that long. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush is an excellent product. The sonic vibrating movement of the bristles feel like they do a thorough job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year the battery refused to hold a charge for more than one two-minute session and eventually died all together. I called Philips and they sent me a replacement quickly and hassle free. Due Philip&#x27;s customer service, I can confidently recommend this product.</li>
    <li> has the two minute timer,holds the charge for the two weeks promised, makes my teeth feel like I have had them professionally cleaned, was recommended by my hygenist</li>
    <li> last time i bought one it was 5 years ago and it cost 79.99 this is just as good at 39.99 so i got a great deal and free shipping thanks</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for years to the delight of my dentist and my own dental health. I love the &#x27;hygenist cleaned&#x27; feeling I get everytime I brush.  I upgraded to this unit when I could no longer get replacement brush heads for my old unit.  FYI, the rechargeable batteries in the Sonicare are very good and will hold a charge for two weeks when traveling.  Good value and terrific product.</li>
    <li> Was very surprised by this toothbrush. I felt my manual wasn&#x27;t quite cutting it anymore and had always heard good things about Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;First experience is was amazing. I felt like I had just left the dentist for a cleaning. 5 months in and I still enjoy it. The inductive charging base is nice and clean, not dirty contacts to worry about.  I had not used an electric toothbrush in years and felt they were a waste. But, one use of this and I saw I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a different way to brush and takes a time or to to remember to place it on your teeth first then turn it on. Also to turn it off before you remove it from your mouth. Otherwise you have a small mess to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement tips can be pricey, but you can find deals on replacement tips if you shop around.</li>
    <li> Sonicare has always been a great product in my opinion. This was given as gift and the recipient is completely  satisfied.</li>
    <li> So the hardest thing about brushing is having to do it for the dentist recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this brush is that you dont have to time yourself, once you turn it on&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll automatically turn itself off after the duration recommended.  It works great and definitely&lt;br /&gt;leaves you feeling fresh in the mouth!</li>
    <li> Compared to some of the earlier models of Sonicare I have used, this one is particularly sturdy. The brush heads you put on are larger and screw in place with a large, easy to hold plastic bit, rather than snapping onto a small piece of metal that has a tendency of coming loose. Also, unlike the earlier types I referred to, there is none of the tendency of that piece of metal to get covered in layers of toothpaste that prevent the brush head from fitting properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is very effective. It vibrates enough to make brushing seriously more efficient than doing it by hand, but not so much as to cause any pain or damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I have read, the Sonicare system actually does do a decent job of periodontal plaque cleaning, although it is of course not a perfect substitute for flossing. If despite your dentist&#x27;s admonitions, you do not floss, you definitely want one of these. If you do floss, you may still want it, because it is convenient and using both Sonicare and floss is obviously going to clean things out even better than either by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a sturdy travel case. The travel case does not fit the charger, but you don&#x27;t usually need the charger for short trips, because the battery capacity is pretty good and you can usually use the thing for a week without charging with no problems. Worst come to worst, you can of course always use it as an old fashioned manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a bit sturdier, too, than earlier models of Sonicare charger I have used, and here too, Philips has addressed the problem of toothpaste and grime buildup. On the earlier model, over time the charger would grow a thick enough layer of toothpaste/grime/whatever buildup that the toothbrush would no longer fit on it properly, and you had to carefully clean it. This charger does not appear to share that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I am quite impressed with Philips personal care products, including their Norelco line of electrical razors and trimmers. And this toothbrush is no exception. It&#x27;s an excellent tool for keeping your mouth from smelling bad, your teeth from looking bad, and your dentist from having to tell you bad news.</li>
