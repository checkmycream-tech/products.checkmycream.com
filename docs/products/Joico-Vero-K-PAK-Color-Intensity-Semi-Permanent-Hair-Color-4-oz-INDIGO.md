      <li>Great color</li>
      <li>This purple makes me happy every time I pass a mirror and see my hair.</li>
      <li>and I am happy that it doesn&#x27;t fade to another color that looks dingy.</li>
      <li>Nice product!</li>
      <li>I had ordered serveral times and still loving it!</li>
      <li>The Joico is superior in every way.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>It comes out more electric than neon bright</li>
      <li>Amazing color..</li>
      <li>BEST vibrant hair color out there.</li>
      <li>The indigo gives it a very nice rich sheen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to get off around your hairline</li>
      <li>and it still has strong color staying power on bleached &amp; non-bleached hair!</li>
      <li>The indigo sticks in my hair much better than Pravana Purple does.</li>
      <li>so I just applied the Indigo on top.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love the indigo.</li>
      <li>i SoooooO love my color.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the Joico Intensity colors for my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a gel, not a liquid, and it won&#x27;t get every where.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
      <li>This was my first time coloring my hair with a bright color.  </li>
      <li>I love the bright pop of purple, and it lasts very well.</li>
      <li>this color had an excellent color payoff and has faded minimally if at all in the week I&#x27;ve had it in.</li>
      <li>However, I use this color to mix with some of the other colors and get great results!</li>
      <li>but I have seen results on other people and it always turns out gorgeous!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and it&#x27;s usual (in a good way).</li>
      <li>This was super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Color was beautiful, did not rub off on clothing or shower as reported by other reviews which is why I purchased</li>
      <li>I have been able to get them much cheaper at swap meets and hair product conventions.</li>
      <li>I was using 90% a full tube with each application, with keep up turns into a tube a month.</li>
      <li>It came out a very nice dark indigo (more blue-ish) on bleached blonde hair and with every wash it fades into a nice, lighter shade of purple.</li>
      <li>The shade is very lovely as it is more dark and bluish than the pinker purple tones I tried.</li>
      <li>It also seemed to come out clear on most things (like hands) except for your hair.</li>
      <li>I have used many types of color products and this one stays vibrant longer and does not wash out as much in the shower as others.</li>
      <li>The deep purple is still very strong.</li>
      <li>Really pretty.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
      <li>Very rich and deep in color.</li>
      <li>Such a pretty color, I love the Joico intense colors.  </li>
      <li>The color doesn&#x27;t last that long, but pretty good for one of these funky colors.</li>
      <li>With routine upkeep I expect it will stay pretty vibrant.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as the others that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping..</li>
      <li>I rec&#x27;d many compliments on my purple hair before I went back to natural.</li>
      <li>It is a must to bleach out as much of your natural pigment as you can without damaging your hair to much to get the super vibrant color that lasts.  </li>
      <li>I use the indigo, which isnt really blue but a dark bright purple color.</li>
      <li>They are bold, intense colors, and they can last for weeks.</li>
      <li>you are willing to spend the money, I definitely definitely recommend these colors.</li>
      <li>For some reason, I thought I&#x27;d try another brand (Pravana Chromasilk Vivid in Violet).</li>
      <li>a deep cool purple blue color..</li>
      <li>Stays in longer than any color I used so far</li>
      <li>Vibrant and stays very long.</li>
      <li>Only used once so far.</li>
      <li>It stays vibrant longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I typically use an argan oil set of hair products so beauty supply brands don&#x27;t adhere very well.</li>
      <li>Application is easy but a bit messy if you do not clean up properly.</li>

    <li> Beautiful color. Shipping and packaging was swift. Color last about 4 months. The best color out there if you like nontraditional colors</li>
    <li> Amazing color..a deep cool purple blue color..Fast shipping..</li>
    <li> The indigo sticks in my hair much better than Pravana Purple does.</li>
    <li> I usually use another hair color line--Adore--but they same girl that recommended that to me started using this and I trust her. This is a great product and it&#x27;s usual (in a good way). It&#x27;s more of a gel, not a liquid, and it won&#x27;t get every where. It also seemed to come out clear on most things (like hands) except for your hair. It&#x27;s very easy to get off around your hairline and it smells great! The color doesn&#x27;t last that long, but pretty good for one of these funky colors. It came out a very nice dark indigo (more blue-ish) on bleached blonde hair and with every wash it fades into a nice, lighter shade of purple. It doesn&#x27;t turn pink or orangey like other colors do. I definitely recommend this! Try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> i purchased this in the color indigo. I used this on my prelightened hair and mixed a tiny drop of color with conditioner. 1-3 ratio to get a pastel purple/ lavender color and let it process for 20 minutes...I absolutely love this color. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Thank you! I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon.  :)</li>
    <li> This was super easy to apply. Only had to stay on 20 minutes. My hair is a medium brown and I didn&#x27;t lighten it before I applied the dye. I love the color.</li>
    <li> Stays in longer than any color I used so far</li>
    <li> Color was beautiful, did not rub off on clothing or shower as reported by other reviews which is why I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;The color however doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would of expected. I was using 90% a full tube with each application, with keep up turns into a tube a month. I ended up going back to Manic Panic.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have not used yet but I have seen results on other people and it always turns out gorgeous!!! Will be doing some highlights with this color!!</li>
    <li> I went purple a few months ago and tried several different brands before I tried Joico Indigo. The shade is very lovely as it is more dark and bluish than the pinker purple tones I tried. The indigo gives it a very nice rich sheen. I rec&#x27;d many compliments on my purple hair before I went back to natural. I miss it!</li>
    <li> Such a pretty color, I love the Joico intense colors.  It is a must to bleach out as much of your natural pigment as you can without damaging your hair to much to get the super vibrant color that lasts.  I get about 3 weeks of enjoyment with this color.</li>
    <li> I have asian black hair and had to bleach a couple of times before I could achieve my color. i SoooooO love my color. I had ordered serveral times and still loving it!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this would come out as a dark purpley blue color. But it&#x27;s so dark it almost blended in with my natural dark hair. However, I use this color to mix with some of the other colors and get great results! It comes out more electric than neon bright</li>
    <li> I bought indigo after reading the comments and looking for a darker purple color. I typically use an argan oil set of hair products so beauty supply brands don&#x27;t adhere very well. After bleaching (a little unevenly) this color had an excellent color payoff and has faded minimally if at all in the week I&#x27;ve had it in. With routine upkeep I expect it will stay pretty vibrant. 4 stars because there were a few spots that didn&#x27;t fully adhere after processing over an hour and needing to double the max processing time listed on the tube. They aren&#x27;t too noticable.</li>
    <li> BEST vibrant hair color out there. I have used many types of color products and this one stays vibrant longer and does not wash out as much in the shower as others. The color does not transfer to clothing either during the day when dry and only a teeny bit if wet. My favorites are the purple and the cobalt blue mixed with titanium. Really pretty. Application is easy but a bit messy if you do not clean up properly. Wear gloves and use dark towels. The scent is very pleasant too. You do have to lighten your hair before coloring to get maximum vibrancy and color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Joico Intensity colors for my hair (I&#x27;ve been dying my hair these colors for two years). They are bold, intense colors, and they can last for weeks. Unfortunately, they are really expensive here. I have been able to get them much cheaper at swap meets and hair product conventions. (My aunt is a hairdresser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to spend the money, I definitely definitely recommend these colors.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of the Indigo color for a while now. For some reason, I thought I&#x27;d try another brand (Pravana Chromasilk Vivid in Violet). Never again. The Joico is superior in every way. I love the bright pop of purple, and it lasts very well. I get compliments everywhere I go. This purple makes me happy every time I pass a mirror and see my hair.</li>
    <li> I use the indigo, which isnt really blue but a dark bright purple color. I have been rocking a frock of purple curls since 2009. and this is the go to brand and color.</li>
    <li> Vibrant and stays very long. Washed it 4tx and it still has strong color staying power on bleached &amp; non-bleached hair!</li>
    <li> I love the indigo. It makes my hair a beautiful purple.</li>
    <li> This was my first time coloring my hair with a bright color.  My ends were already ombre so I just applied the Indigo on top. It turned out perfectly. Very rich and deep in color. 2 months later and it&#x27;s just now starting to hint at fading in the lighter tones. The deep purple is still very strong. I only wash my hair once a week and use Nexxus color care shampoo/conditioner. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Only used once so far. Great color and it doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as the others that I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t stain my pillow cases or my shower (it&#x27;s white and other brands were hard to take off of the wall). It does fade back to my haircolor and I am happy that it doesn&#x27;t fade to another color that looks dingy. Nice product!</li>
    <li> It stays vibrant longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
