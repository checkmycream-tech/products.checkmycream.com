<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just soap, shows no medicinal sign whatsoever</li>
    <li> Leaves my hands feeling clean without drying themout</li>
    <li> A health food store owner told me that metals are not good for the skin.</li>
    <li> The soap lathers well and is great for dry scalp.  However, it does leave fine hair rather flat.</li>
    <li> I have a chronic skin condition and am using this along with other products to clear it up. My skin is better. I like this soap because it suds up nicely and the bar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Lathers up nice on a nylon sponge and kills the germies with the silver. I use it with every shower!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this soap did anything for my skin.  It works okay as a shampoo bar and soap for washing the dog.  Nothing special for the price.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> this is a great for any skin type . a must buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the soap to use in the shower, but what I got was the gel with a tiny label printed over it that referred to the gel as a soap. This is inexcusable.</li>
    <li> This great soap for getting the chlorine off the skin so you don&#x27;t smell like chlorine</li>
    <li> Colloidal silver is something that everyone should own in my opinion. I could find anything but soap from London that washed clean from my skin but this stuff is great and good for you.</li>
    <li> Great soap for troubled skin and lathers nicely, rinses clean</li>
    <li> A total rip off for a bar of soap with silver in it. Its sad how companies are ok with screwing people over.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have used on my adult cystic acne, which is mainly hormonal, that works wonders on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also been great in eliminating a blackhead that I&#x27;ve had for over 20 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be without this soap!  Also, there&#x27;s a big difference in the effectiveness in the extra strength versus the regular strength soap for me. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very good soap. I have very dry skin and this soap helped. Not drying at all.</li>
    <li> Sure beats expensive pharmaceutical creams!  I rarely write reviews, but  had to with this soap. My entire adult life I have had terrible skin, especially redness and flakes on my face.  Several years ago I went to my doctor who prescribed Ketocanzonal.  It helped, but was never a cure.  Then a few months ago, I decided to go to a dermatologist.  She prescribed Elidel which is SUPER expensive, over $800 a tube!!!  Fortunately my insurance paid most of it, but that is flat out robbery from something that is only 1% active ingredient.  I used it about two weeks with very little effect.  Worried about side affects of these prescriptions, I quit using them.  My wife read about this soap and bought a bar to try.  I was apprehensive because most soaps just dry my face out even more, but not this stuff!  My skin has been in the best condition it has been since was a kid.  No more flakes around my eyebrows and nose, and not nearly as red as it used to be.  I like how it really lathers up too.  I have an appointment to see my dermatologist in a week and I am going to tell her about it.  Doubtful she will care as I firmly believe all doctors are in bed with the pharmaceutical companies.  Sad, but true.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that keeps my dermatitis from flaring up. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I love this soap ! It is healing up a multiple of my skin issues and moisturizes too.&lt;br /&gt;It is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I got this primarily to experiment with it with regards to large-plaque seborrhea psoriasis dandruff that I&#x27;ve had longer than I care to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a metal wire dog-coat brush to brush my scalp every day &amp; it would produce these large perforated but intact doilie -type of flakes about 1/2&amp;#34; in circumference size!!.(NO, NOT DOLLIES or DOLLY&#x27;s, but the old style cloth/paper doilies that one would use underneath something placed on fine furniture??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this type of issue is due to not only an over-growth of a certain fungus on the scalp but also a compromised (By genetics) immune system.&lt;br /&gt;(read more here:[...]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Apple Cider (Supposed to treat the PH Balance of the skin) &amp; also Sodium-Bicarbonate in solution (Same thing: PH).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Tea-tree Oil, Tar Shampoo &amp; all sorts of commercial crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried H2O2 infused with Vitamin C Powder (Ascorbic Acid) + Boric Acid...again as an attempt to destabilise the Fungal infection by PH management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the internal supplements too like Zinc &amp; Coconut oil (Still use Coconut oil &amp; Coconut Creme for my coffee creamer every morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colloidal silver is supposed to be the very best treatment for Burns and indeed is used by hospitals in burn creams for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to be antiseptic, ani-fungal, &amp; anti-biotic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this review it&#x27;s been a bit under a months time of using this product on my head/scalp strictly in lieu of any shampoo on an every other day basis and as I wire-brush my scalp I see barely any little what I would term &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; dandruff and no large plaque like flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am THOROUGHLY Satisfied with this Soap and have started to use it strictly without any other Bath Gels or commercial soaping bathing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Silver Miracles for making such a product!!

    <li> Great soap.  Lathers up really nice and feels great on the skin. Trying to keep acne break outs down with the colloidal Silver soap so far so good.  I will buying another bar.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this natural colloidal silver soap.  It is not to drying and has helped in clearing up some dermatitis issues.</li>
    <li> good item - can be purchased for less in most retail stores at full price</li>
    <li> I bought two and gave one to a friend who is having light pimple problem. I have a few of them too but it did not help at all. I also tried on dried itchy skin but that didn&#x27;t help either. My friend did not see any changes to her pimples or other parts of her skin. To me and my friend it was just a waste of money. Not only that but also they sent one soap that had a large broken piece about 15 to 20 % was missing and I don&#x27;t understand how someone can think of sending such a defected  itme.</li>
    <li> I use this daily.  Great for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> NICE LARGE BAR, BY FAR- THE BEST SILVER SOAP I&#x27;VE FOUND. BUY THIS AND YOU WILL AGREE.</li>
    <li> This really helped my husbands back with breakouts.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday thank you have ordered more.</li>
    <li> like this one very much</li>
    <li> We love this soap.  It last us quite a while and it helps with cuts, bumps, scrapes and all that. Leaves your skin very soft.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Clean feeling. I can even use it on my face</li>
    <li> I have a dermatitis on my body called nummular dermatitis.  I get red spots that itch and scar.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of soaps&lt;br /&gt;and found that this one really helps prevent breakouts.  I&#x27;m ordering 2 more bars.  I after reading the previous reviews here&lt;br /&gt;I cut the bar in half, easy for  travel and also it lasts for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice for pimples. Keeps skin from break outs and oiliness.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this product! Skin rashes, reactions (poison ivy, etc), fungal infections(yeast...jock itch, athlete&#x27;s foot, etc), diaper rash, I&#x27;ve used this soap on it all these and more and highly recommend it as part of your health/hygiene routine. It is gentle enough to use every day, it does not dry the skin.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Not scented which I like.  Will order again.  Obviously a handcrafted soap.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It works wonders. My primary care physician uses this soap at home and in his office.  Everyone in my.family uses this soap.  GREAT SOAP.</li>
    <li> Really like the soap and it was delivered on time. As far as any health benefits, it is to early to give any review.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected, especially for rather stinky body odor. Have even used it as deodorant, post-shower. No odor for up to 48 hours (as long as I&#x27;ve attempted it). This week I&#x27;ve been also using it as shampoo. Worked well for about three days, then had to shower once with the regular stuff.</li>
    <li> Great soap for just about anything you want to wash. Lathers nicely and smells clean. And...very gentle on the skin!</li>
    <li> I tried using this to help control my psoriasis.  It did not make a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my dog&#x27;s extremely sensitive skin that is infected (with the pimple-y bacteria bumps).  No more antibiotics - I&#x27;m going to use this a few times a week &amp; hope for the best.  This bar is very smooth &amp; creamy - I just ran it up &amp; down his back (he has short bull terrier hair) &amp; it was easy to lather &amp; apply like this.  Left it on/ massaged it in for 10 mins &amp; then rinsed - not drying, &amp; it cleaned the crusty crap off of him beautifully.  He already looks 50% better after just one use.  Nice, very light scent - didn&#x27;t dry my hands (or his already beat up fur/ skin) at all.  Really lovely feel - I hope it kills the bacteria attacking his skin!  I just may switch to this as his &#x27;shampoo&#x27; going forward.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap to clear my skin.  I suffer from eczema, back acne and brown spots.  I noticed my skin is a lot smoother and the acne on my back is disappearing before my eyes.  I can finally see my beautiful skin peaking through.  I will continue to use because it is working for me.  Just purchased 3 more bars.</li>
    <li> Great for lesions and sores on the hands. This helps keep them away</li>
    <li> I had two pressure sores--went to a nurse practitioner, then a family physician, and finally a dermatologist, all of whom prescribed different cortisone creams--none of which worked.  Finally, after using this soap for a week, the sores were gone.  Well worth the price, considering what I paid for three, ineffective doctor&#x27;s visits.</li>
    <li> I use  Extra Strenghth, was losing my hair. I message the soap into my hair. Rinse it and apply my Shampoo and Conditioner.  I also  drink the Colloidal Silver 10ppm and make my own. In the last 9 months. All due to Pancreatitus.......</li>
    <li> I could be wrong but it seems to last a long time. I cut it up into several motel size bars and I like it no odors, just cleans.</li>
    <li> I use it for bathing the whole body during a shower and notice it helps remove unwanted body pimples, rashes, and other skin issues.</li>
    <li> This soap works great! I try to keep it in stock and freak out when anyone trys to use it. It removes the grease and grime left behind by gojo pumice hand cleaners. It cleans my skin without making me soft like a baby. Im a man i dont need to smell like flowers or be baby soft.  This has a slight smell of olive oil. It also rinses down the drain cleanly leaves zero residue or soap scum. As far as all the other reviews of it works on skin conditions. Well yeah colloidal silver kills fungus bacteria and more. The nasty psoriasis (skin fungus) it kills it. Eczema (skin fungus) kills it again. The meds the doctors prescribe are bandaids for the symptoms. They actually keep the fungus warm and moist what it loves and lives for. They do not want you to be cured!!! Use this soap kill your fungus or have clean skin. I am exposed to many germs at work so i feel this stuff not only washes off the industrial grime of the day but it also washes off the germs i am in contact with. Natural antibacterial soap no harsh chemicals no flower girly stink just clean skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have skin issues, anywhere, on your body. Followed by colloidal silver water. If you have experienced M.R.S.A. then you might want to check this out.</li>
    <li> I used this soap with the silver gel also and they worked miracles.  My legs feel so much better and all abrasions have now healed and my legs look normal.</li>
    <li> Somehow this soap made me itchy. I don&#x27;t know why because I&#x27;m not allergic to any ingriedients .</li>
    <li> This soap is the real deal ...</li>
    <li> No big improvement. Does make hands and body feel clean.</li>
    <li> Very good product This soap has extra silver in it making it a good buy</li>
    <li> This does work good, but as some have said it does dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this bar.Right size for this big guy.</li>
    <li> I have to start off by saying that I liked the soap enough to give it 5 stars, but the misleading photo of the product is just downright dishonest.  If one looks closely at the top of the Photo of the soap, one will notice that the top of the soap is a little ragged,  The truth of the matter is that the soap one gets will have a large portion of the soap missing at the top.  In reality the soap one receives will look like the Jolly Green Giant took a huge bite out of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above being said, I do like the soap, but I hate the dishonesty, and that is why I am giving the soap only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Ehhh it&#x27;s ok. Helped clear up a breakout on my face. One of the bars I ordered had a big long black hair inside. Pretty gross.</li>
    <li> love this soap. Takes care of all of the mysterious bumps from Summer heat. Rinses clean, great smell</li>
    <li> this product did not help my eczaman on my hand. When did oral chelation, organ detox, vitamin b-12, b-6, vitamin c, zinc, whole food vitamins it help flush out the toxins.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim to see if it would relieve a minor itchy skin condition i have in the winter, not only did it sting like crazy the first time I used it-it actually made my skin drier! I was also concerned that the soap bars themselves had no ingredients listed on the label and no place of origin of manufacture. I threw all the soap away and would advise you to be cautious and do a test-wash on a small part of skin before you shower with it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I had a sudden skin rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I tried this soap and I even bought the gel.  My rash is gone and my face looks great.  Complexion better than ever.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> used it for seborrheic dermatitis when prescriptions failed and it cleared it up in days...I was using the ketoconazole for a year with little results..the soap worked like a miracle and have been clear of the seborrhea since I started the soap...highly recommend it for all sorts of skin problems</li>
    <li> I have had a seriously painful skin condition  that I am unable to get rid of, all over my body.  This time I have had it for 1 1/2 years, is helping my skin to heal alot!  I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Nice Soap.  And I think it does have anti-bacterial properties with the colloidal silver.  I think it helps eliminate pimples from the skin.  And the bars are pretty large compared to most soap bars.</li>
    <li> Helps even out my skin tone and get rid of redness.</li>
    <li> This soap is an amazing product as well - I would recommend it highly!!!</li>
    <li> For the tough days we are working in not ideal conditions on the farm&lt;br /&gt;For poison ivy, rashes, bites, etc&lt;br /&gt;This soap cleans us up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also use Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Rich Moisturizing Soap daily</li>
    <li> I love this soap but there is one place you don&#x27;t want to use it,  But, only the one.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a miracle product but it is no better than anyone soap except it leaves your skin smooth.  Clearly this is due to the oils and not the silver.  They must not put enough silver in it, but this has done nothing for me beyond what a bar of Dove can do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and sudsy, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I bought it because i had a rash, and I did not want to put commercial cleansers on it. I use Silver Biotics products a lot and thought I would get a similar benefit, but no. I have found soaps I like better for less money.</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME Soap for ACNE and good for all types of bad skin specially for Teenagers and the size is big for the price you are paying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this soap for anyone. The bar is huge and thick. I cut it in half for use and it leave my skin clean,clear and soft!!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading all of the reviews, but I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks and skin is still dry/scaly. Oh well. Aside from that it&#x27;s a decent soap.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I use it daily.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  Some of the upscale bars of soap containing colloidal silver can cost anywhere from $40 to $120 a bar.  So this is very reasonably priced.  And in my opinion, it works as well as the over-hyped expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It smells neutral to me. It has helped my rash on my arms a lot. Sometimes during the day I just spay my arms with water and rub the bar over them and let it air dry. This soap is not sticky feeling. Here&#x27;s my one complaint. I paid I think 5.99 for the bar. Shipping was a minimum if any. It wasn&#x27;t a prime item at the time. Now it is. The price is now nearly 10.00$. What&#x27;s up with that?. Prime is supposed to be free shipping. Not nearly double the price then ship it free.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent soap that lathers well and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh without being drying. The Silver Miracle website has a list of the ingredients in the soap, but it would be useful if they put it on the label. One of the reviewers here complained about a jagged edge on the soap, but actually I think it was done deliberately to make the soap easier to hold.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything that I could see. Didn&#x27;t help my problems at all. Did not do anything for my Skin.</li>
    <li> Would not be w/out this soap.  I keep it in our bathroom and laundry room and feel confident that it helps disinfect dirty hands that handle animals, etc.  Love it!</li>
    <li> A little disappointed. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The lather on this soap is wonderful. I feel extra clean and smooth afterwards, plus no annoying fragrance! It literally smells like nothing, which is a weird compliment I&#x27;m sure. Hopefully it will improve my bad skin we&#x27;ll see...so far so good</li>
    <li> This is really a quality product.  I have noticed my facial skin seems to be more clear than previously, but I am not sure if this is more due to the properties of the coconut oil in the bar (good for your skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores) and other ingredients or whether the silver actually plays a role in that.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to use myself and wound up giving it to a friend for a problem.  His report is he isn&#x27;t using it consistantly but it is helping when he does so this is a good product.  I may have to purchase some more so I can actually give this product a review of my own.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this product.  My daughter likes it and it seems to help when she uses it.  If she used it regularly I&#x27;m sure her skin would appreciate it.</li>
    <li> its was to strong I could not use it do you want it back</li>
    <li> I have long been an advocate of silver and this is another easy preventative to skin problems. With the increase of diseases entering this country everyone should consider having this item in their health care arsenal.</li>
    <li> Sorry to leave only 2 stars as have not even used the product yet. When I received the soap the packaging was open and part of the bar is missing and is crumbling.</li>
    <li> A lot of suds and after use, your skin feels very clean.</li>
    <li> Love this soap use it for my acne that I&#x27;ve been fighting with from i was 13 now 36.</li>
    <li> Great soap but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to be helping with the itchy skin that I have been suffering with lately.  The skin condition seems to have improved and I will continue to use this soap. It has helped with tinea versicolor and itching.  I can recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> except for a delivery issue I love this soap have been using it for 3 years</li>
    <li> I like it , will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. It has helped my 70 year old husbands skin look healthier too. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This soap is great.  It lathers nicely and leave me feeling fresh and truly clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly refreshing and a nice crisp clean feeling when you&#x27;re finished with your shower, And leave your skin feeling tighter and lighter. I will definitely buy this product in the future.</li>
