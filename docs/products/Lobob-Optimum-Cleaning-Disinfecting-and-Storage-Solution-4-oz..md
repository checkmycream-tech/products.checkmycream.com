      <li>I&#x27;ve used all the products in this set (including: Lobob Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner, 2 oz.; and Lobob Optimum Wetting and Rewetting Drop, 1 oz.).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price for product</li>
    <li> Even with shipping costs, it was less costly than the same product in retail stores. I use it for rigid lenses, and it works very well. As an added bonus, my shipment arrived with a new lens carrying case, which is timely, since I need to carry another one with me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy that one of my optometrist&#x27;s patients discovered that Lobob was making this cleaning and disinfecting solution plus a wetting and rewetting product. I was really getting discouraged about finding a product that worked well when it was used along with the wetting and rewetting drops that follow it. I&#x27;m delighted with the pair. They work and I&#x27;m feeling much more comfortable with my lenses.</li>
    <li> Works fine for my scleral lens. It&#x27;s what my doctor recommended. No problems at all. Thank you for the red warning cap, very important when folks have vision problems.</li>
    <li> My contacts were starting to bother me and when I went to the eye doctor to have them cleaned and my eyes checked they gave me a trial package of Lobob.  I am SO glad they did.  This is the best contact solution I&#x27;ve ever used.  Much more comfortable than Boston Simplus which is what I have used for years.  Had been having a problem with getting my contacts out at night but somehow, with Lobob, it seems to be fine.  I highly recommend this product, even though it is hard to find in stores.  However, it was cheaper to buy online here and it came without delay.  I&#x27;m VERY happy I found it.</li>
    <li> If you rinse your lens with water this may not be necessary but nonetheless another line of defense against the allergies.</li>
    <li> After wearing hard lenses for nearly 40 years, I was suddenly suffering from red, weepy, painful eyes.  My optometrist had told me he suspected that I developed an allergy to Boston solutions and told me to try Clear Care which helped but did not give me total relief.  I discovered the Optimum line by doing some online research.  My progressive RGP lenses are once again comfortable and wearable all day for 12-16 hours.  I wish that it were more readily available at consistent prices but am thankful to Lobob because without the Optimum line, my contact lens wearing days would be over!</li>
    <li> I always use Optimum solutions for my gp contact lenses. They can be hard to find in stores and when I do see them they are now ridiculously expensive. I&#x27;m very happy to find them on Amazon at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the reviews, but I&#x27;d recommend that users switch back and forth between this solution and the standard Lobob ESC cleaner.  When I was only using this CDS solution for weeks, my eyes started to get irritated.  The preservatives can cause inflammation in some people like me. The standard ESC cleaner is best for routine use, with this CDS for occasional deep cleaning.  The other option is to get the enzyme tablets, but they are getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be a very good for hard contact wearers!!!</li>
    <li> I love being able to use the same solution for cleaning and storing and the lenses always come out clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and it is the BEST. This is a great price for it...the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen. Even WalMart charges $10.</li>
    <li> This is a really good cleaner for gas permeable contact lenses.  However, be real careful and completely rinse it off before putting your lens in your eye!!!  This solution can be extremely painful if it accidentally gets in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn rigid gas perm lenses for over 25 years, and have worn contact lenses for over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best cleaning/storing solution I have ever used.  It was recommended by my optician when I was having trouble with the Boston line of lens products...gritty feel, shorter wearing times, aware of having a lens in my eye. I attributed it to aging and the length of time I&#x27;ve worn lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so.  Since I changed to the Lobob solutions, I find that the comfort of my lenses is as good as it was when I was younger.  I wear my contacts daily and normally wear them for 15 or more hours a day. I use both the cleaning solution and the wetting solution. Yes, my eyes get tired faster, but so does the rest of me! And I have \\&quot;graduated\\&quot; to bifocal contacts.  But I can wear my lenses for the full day, which I was no longer able to do using other lens care products.  Thank you, Lobob!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping. Cleans wonderfully. Sudses up in pillowy softness to wash away the grime.</li>
    <li> I just opened the second bottle and the darn tip of the bottle falls off. So the first time I used it about half the bottle spilled out. Very irritating.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes my contacts very comfortable for a long long time.  I hardly ever wear my glasses for backup any more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find solutions for gas permeable lenses.  This is further complicated by the fact that I am allergic to most of the solutions - itching, watery eyes, as well as just plain discomfort - especially after a few days of using them.  The various Lobob solutions for cleaning, storing and wetting work well for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the savings (both $$ and environmental -- more solution per package), however the benefits are not as clear to me at this point. Why? Because I use 20 - 25% more solution than with the smaller bottle. The dropper-tip is not well constructed. When you tilt the bottle, solution drips out so fast (even when you don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle) that it&#x27;s hard to control. I try to use only 5 drops or so to clean; sometimes I get 5, sometimes 7 or 8 because it comes out so fast, and I lose another drop before I can tilt the bottle upright (it runs down the tip and side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Lobob fixes the bottle design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* UPDATE *&lt;br /&gt;I opened a second package, and the drops are now controllable, as one would hope. So upped rating to 4 stars. If I can regularly get bottles that don&#x27;t pour out solution, I&#x27;ll update this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaner.  Did not have to buy new hard contacts, as old ones were too &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34;. This took care of the problem.</li>
    <li> I started using the Lobob solution several years ago when I got some as a freebie at the doctor&#x27;s office.  The improvement over other major hard lens solutions was dramatic.  I think it may have to do with the difference in how you use it.  With others, you remove your lenses before you go to bed, wash them with a cleaning solution, rinse and then store in a solution that doubles as a wetting solution.  With the Lobob solution, I place my contacts in the cleaning/disinfecting solution at night before I go to bed, letting them cleanse all night.  In the morning, I rub the lenses, rinse, and then add a drop or two of wetting solution and put back in my eyes.  The difference is that with the Lobob cleaning/disinfecting solution, the lenses sit in a cleaning solution all night instead of a wetting solution.  This seems to make all the difference to me.  I don&#x27;t seem to get calcium deposits and other spots on my lenses anymore.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll continue to be able to buy Lobob online.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Best cleaning solution for Gas Perm lenses ever. Will not be buying any other brand again.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best solution I have ever used in my whole life on my contacts! The cleaning solution by this company is also the best</li>
    <li> Have used Lobob solutions since it seems like forever. Mucho better quality rgp lens cleaning and storage solutions than all others on the market combined.</li>
    <li> Bought these for use with RGP lenses after reading some rave reviews online. Tried it for 2 months and eye irritation and dry eyes did not go away. This is not the end all for contacts users.</li>
    <li> recommended for my hard contacts, and available only one place in my small town.  Easy and quick just to order it through Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick, with no hassles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days since I switched to Lobob products, but there is definitely a difference.  Boston products just didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as I would have liked.  I have worn hard contacts for 40 years--the last 20 or so RGP.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of cleaners, but after menopause I noticed that it was harder to keep my contacts clean.  Allergies have definitely increased problems, too, so I&#x27;m probably a difficult case.  At any rate, so far, so good with Lobob.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a couple of dollars more to have clean, unnoticeable contacts.</li>
    <li> Just got my RGP lenses fitted today.  Literally about two hours ago.  I brought my Lobob cleaning and rewetting solutions to the eye doctor with me.  After a few drops and 30 seconds of rubbing with the cleaning solution, I rinsed the lenses with sterile saline (don&#x27;t use tap water...) applied a single drop of rewetting solution and inserted the lenses.  Very comfortable.  More comfortable than I remember them fitting about 5 years ago when I used another major store branded set of solutions.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my optician as the only product that actually \\&quot;cleans\\&quot; RGP lenses overnight.  (And it IS a cleaner--don&#x27;t forget to wash off all the solution before putting lenses in).  I&#x27;ve worn contacts for over 30 years and this is the first product that really works.  Despite allergies, dust, etc. the lenses feel like new every morning.  Additionally, when I wrote the company to express my gratitude, they actually sent a personal note back--who does that any more?  Tell your friends--as a small company Lobob has some stiff competition despite being the best product out there (5 star reviews everywhere you look). Kudos to Amazon for listing it, and ask for it by name locally...</li>
    <li> I was told that I needed to switch to the Lobob Optimum system with my new RGP lenses, or I would void the warranty (ie - \\&quot;no more Boston\\&quot;). I bought both the large soaking solution &amp; the smaller heavy duty cleaner. I assumed the larger soaking solution was just like the Boston Simplicity or Original Conditioning solution, and promptly rinsed my new lenses with the stuff. What happened was excruciating pain followed by hours of tearing up. I of course had immediately popped the lens back out, rinsed with water &amp; re-rinsed w the soaking solution &amp; tried again. The AGONY!!! Took the lenses out &amp; sobbingly went to the front desk &amp; asked if I was having an allergic reaction. The clinic had given me a pamphlet, but I have Kerataconus &amp; could not read it very well in its tiny type. The clinic felt bad of course for not explaining better. They will not easily forget my red eyes &amp; sobbing reaction.  The manufacturer needs a better warning on their packaging. Lobob, I hope you are listening!! I sent them an email and have not heard back. I am writing this 6 hours after the incident and am doing so out of one eye. My right eye (first eye I tried inserting the lens into w the \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot;) is now blurred and incredibly painful. I&#x27;ve been using drops hourly to rinse my eye, and have tried a cold compress too. I am deathly afraid to try putting my lenses in again tomorrow, as one teeny spec of that soaking solution could hurt like crazy. I really wish you could tint the solution, do you knew when it was rinsed completely off! At the least, Lobob, please put better warnings on your bottles. How was I supposed to know that the red caps meant dangerous to the eye?? I am sure that I am not the first long time Boston conditioning solution user to be told to switch to Optimum. I wrote this to help others. Hopefully my cornea recovers by tomorrow. I feel like someone rubbed my eyes with sandpaper, and I am not kidding!! Very very unhappy with the product labeling.  Definitely the WORST experience I have ever had with an eye care product. I&#x27;ve been wearing RGP lenses for 16 years. I&#x27;ve never been dumb enough to put cleaner in my eye. This system needs a clear warning and maybe the heavy duty cleaner size should match the soaking/cleaning solution size. The tiny white capped rewetting drops should be the largest bottle. Usability 101, Lobob! Grr.</li>
    <li> Love  this product for my rigid lenses. It is the only product that does not cause cloudy lenses.</li>
    <li> All of the Lobob Optimum solutions are phenomenal, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this particular cleaning solutions is as good or better than having your lenses cleaned professionally, especially when used with thier other products.  I also use way more solution than the instructions call for, and that may be the reason.  Work up a nice lather and make sure the stopper on the sink is closed. :-)</li>
    <li> great solution, good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This stuff, along with the ESC solution, is as great as many of the reviewers have claimed. I noticed that my contacts were not as slippery and hydrophilic as they were when new, and they starting itching halfway through the day. I used the Boston solutions with the separate cleaning and disinfecting/conditioning solution. I was reasonably thorough cleaning them every night, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t enough. One try with the ESC and CDS solutions, and the lenses were as good as new! You just have to be careful to rinse the cleaner off, but saline solution is cheap.</li>
    <li> ONLY THING HUSBAND WILL USE.</li>
    <li> For The best service. It is  the best cleaning and soaking solution for hard contact lenses. I have usted it for more tan ten years</li>
    <li> This cleaner has been around for a long time.  Having tried all cleaners that I could find ... this is the best.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my ophthalmologist as a better cleaner than what&#x27;s available in local stores. Much stronger and a cleaner hard lens is more comfortable than when I used  inferior cleaners.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleaner ever for gas perm contact lenses.</li>
    <li> I really like this product line. It helps stretch out my wear time on my contacts and seems to make my contacts in general more comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend the Lobob Optimum line of products for the hard contact lens wearer.</li>
    <li> This works well for soaking solution, it really gets my contacts clean. I was never able to get my contacts clean enough.</li>
    <li> This review is coming from someone who has been wearing gas perms for almost 35 years and really wanted this product to work.  I agree with many of the other reviews that this product cleans very well and that having a product that cleans that well daily is a plus.  However, the fact that the lenses have to be rinsed really thoroughly and then wetted with another product before they can be put in your eyes is a big negative in my opinion.  This is a whole extra step that is time-consuming and is particularly inconvenient especially when traveling (eg. taking lenses off in airplanes).  I tried this product for a couple of weeks but in the end went back to my Boston products - being able to pop my lenses into my eyes straight from the storage container was more important to me.</li>
    <li> After using Boston products for over 30 years I started having problems with my rigid gas permeable lens fogging and clouding up all day long. The more I rewet and cleaned, the worse it got. My eyes were so red they looked like they were bleeding. My optometrist said i had dry eyes and put me on artificial tears which didn&#x27;t help. I thought I was going to have to go back to glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my problems began when Boston discontinued their solutions for sensitive eyes. Regardless, the first time I used Lobob, all problems stopped! I soak them all night in Lobob, put them in first thing in a.m., and wear them comfortably all day. My lens are crystal clear and feel professionally cleaned. I am really grateful I found Lobob!</li>
    <li> I have worn RGP lenses for nearly five years and have tried a variety of solutions.  I have naturally dry eyes so RGP lenses arent the easiest to wear.  The entire Lobob line, including this product, has worked wonders for me.  I can wear the lenses for 12+ hours with no discomfort.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Lobob is the best brand I have found for my Gas Permeable Contact Lenses.  I have had hard and gas permeable contacts for over 40 years now and have tried many other brands, and at some point the other brands just stop getting my contacts clean enough and I end up going back to Lobob.  If your having trouble with your contacts fogging up from makeup and tears, this is the best brand around!  Only have been able to find it online and Amazon has had the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> great stuff.  best rgp lens cleaner around, good price, good delivery time, repeat customer</li>
    <li> I have been using a couple of different GP solutions before, this one is the best so far. It keeps the lens really clean and the lens have less &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling when I put them on.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me with my type of contacts. Used for years now &amp; will continue to use. Reliable product!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to store contact lenses. But I also want to let others know to read the instructions, and be careful to completely rinse the storage solutions from your contacts lenses, before you use them or the storage solutions will burn your eye severely. And if that happens before you go to the emergency room try to rinse your eyes with milk, and try a couple ibuprofens. That should at least allow you to open up your eyes, and relieve some pain, because the air will cause irritation to your eyes. I hope that helps. And save your an ER bill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing rigid gas permeable contact lenses for about 20 years.  About 10 years ago I started having problems with my lenses clouding up.  My optician had no idea what the problem was and thought maybe it was an allergic reaction since the lenses would cloud up shortly after putting them in my eye. It got so bad that it was impairing my vision and I would have to clean the lenses every couple of hours during the day.  The eye doctor suggested that I try using Lobob to clean and store my lenses.  The problem immediately went away and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
    <li> I have worn gas permeable contact lenses for 40+ years and used Boston products.  Since the original wetting/soaking solution has been tinkered with, I have had a problem with the lenses clouding.  I switched to Optimum and did not realize that the storage solution needed to be rinsed before wetting and inserting (contrary to the Boston system).  Who can read the small print without contacts?  OOOWW!!.  Burns and in fact I had to keep lens out for 24 hours.  The Optimum wetting solution did the trick.  Just wanted to warn others not to make the same mistake I made.  If I can&#x27;t be a good example, let me be a terrible warning.</li>
    <li> What my optometrist recommends for my gas permeable contact lenses along with the extra strength cleaner and the wetting re-wetting solution.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Crystal clear contacts!</li>
    <li> I have the gas perm lenses and these lo bob products take fabulous care of them  I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this product since it was a cleaner and soaking solution in one. This is the worst eye product I have ever used. Only after a few hours my eyes were dryed out,became very red and I could not wait to go back to Boston solution.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the wrong product. I returned it to American Wholesale and have not received a refund or any contact with them. I reordered the right product which I did receive and was happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of my optometrist. I had a build up of crud on the outside center of my rigid gas permeable bifocal contacts. I thought I needed to replace them. But this stuff got rid of it. It took a couple of weeks, but now they feel like new again. Saved me some money. Those things are expensive!</li>
    <li> Works great for my contacts</li>
    <li> My RGP contacts stay incredibly clear using Lobob products.  I was getting build-up with another product when my ophthalmologist suggested this brand.  After using Lobob, I haven&#x27;t had any more problems with build-up.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my gas permeable contacts and it does the job great.  I don&#x27;t use it for storage.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the Lobob products. A someone who has worn contact lenses for the last 35 years, ranging from hard, to special for astigmatism, to soft and then back to hard, I have used many different products from many different companies, including local drugstore versions.  Now that I am restricted to hard contacts again, I found that it was difficult to get the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling even after using various protein cleansers.  My vision almost always felt \\&quot;cloudy\\&quot;, no matter what I tried.  After using Lobob for less than a week, I really felt a difference!! I have been able to see more clearly and have had the same pair of lenses for the past year without feeling the need to get a new pair.  I hope that Amazon continues to sell Lobob for a very long time, because it is the only place that I can find the cleanser and  wetting solution on a consistent basis.  Thank you Amazon, for great service!!</li>
    <li> Doc gave me sample with new RPG lenses because of my allergies. It wS supposed to be hypoallergenic. This caused my worst allergy ever after just a few days. After two days of dry, blurry, hazy vision with lots of gunk on lenses, my eyes turned blood red and painful minutes after my doctor put them in to check them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes started streaming and were so painful I wanted to  cry even hours after taking them out.  I couldn&#x27;t see to read and my pupils were pinpoints. I called the Doc to say I was going to the ER but he said it was an allergy and prescribed a steroid drop instead minutes before the pharmacy closed. Immediate but not total relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not put this solution in my eye! I used the resetting solution as instructed, after a lot or wasteful rinsing. This got expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on to use Ciba Clear Care (a hydrogen peroxide system that&#x27;s neutralized), hoping this solves the Optimum allergy problem and the resulting gummy, slimy lenses (AFTER lots of thorough cleaning and rinsing) and eyes so painful prescribed pain pills didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This my wife&#x27;s favorite solution system and it is easier and cheaper to buy it in bulk on Amazon. You may have to shop around some to find a seller with a good sale but this stuff is pretty expensive in the drugstore and worth the search for a better price.</li>
    <li> This is the best contact lense product I have ever used.  It was dificult to find.  Only could find it on line.  My doctor recommended and she was absolutely right.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t clean as great as the review I read. My contact had a spot from makeup and I used store brand cleaner before and neveer came off so I bought thins because I thought would do the work but nope. Its ok it says it cleans them but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best rigid contact solution there is!</li>
    <li> I have been a contact wearer for over 30 years -this is my go to solution.  I am diabetic so that tends to lead to more deposits on my contacts, thus requiring a really good cleaner.  I wear gas permerable lens (Boston lens).  I also use the cleaning solution and the rewetting drops by Lobob.  I would purchase these locally but the cost would exceed 14.00 a bottle -pricing here is much more reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is now the only cleaner I use for my hard lenses.  it is literally the only thing that gets them clean.</li>
    <li> Good Product and recommended by my optometrist.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and recommended by my contact lens specialist.  Not available in every drugstore so decided to try geting it online.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  My opthamologist recommended it.  I&#x27;d been using Boston and other products and Lobob Optimum is far superior.  In no time at all I could see a difference, including clearer vision.  I am glad I made the switch!</li>
    <li> I had read the great reviews of this for the Optimum solutions by Lobob solutions before trying them.  I love both the storage solution and the wetting solution.  My eyes are much more comfortable than they were before.  The wetting solution is thin so you have to be careful when using it or the bottle is gone before you know it.  But both are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is product for my husband. The product he used to use are not being manufactured&lt;br /&gt;any more, so he tried this one and really likes it.</li>
    <li> Only thing that really gets my scleral lenses clear.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to rinse your contacts really well after&lt;br /&gt;Taking them out of the cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for rigid contact lenses!!!</li>
    <li> These lenses allow me to see even in bright sunlight or glare, so instead of being unable to open my eyes, I can see normally.  If my doctor says use this, I will.</li>
    <li> I still wear gas perm lens and this is the best cleaning and storage solution available.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended this brand and it is keeping my hard contacts clean so my yearly visits go well</li>
    <li> This is the best gas permeable lens cleaner I hVe found. I soak the lens in it overnight and clean them with what&#x27; I the box in the morning. Then I wet them with the same manufacturer&#x27;s wetting solution. Can them wear them for 24 hours without any discomfort.</li>
    <li> I use it on my rgp lens.  It works well.  I feel that when I look at them in the morning that they are very clear and clean and ready to go for the day.  I also like their rewetting product because it provides a nice soft cushion for the len.</li>
    <li> I love storing my lenses in this solution...they stay clean and when I rinse them and re-insert them my contacts are as comfortable as they can be.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Have been wearing contact lenses for 45 years and this is the best cleaner my eye doctor ever recommended.  Great for mucous over lenses (have allergies)or a good \\&quot;squeeky\\&quot; clean lens. Absolutely the best.</li>
    <li> Although I use Boston Original wetting solution, I use the Lobob storage sollution as it seems to cut through the residue on the contacts without dailt extra strength cleaner. Kind of pricey in stores but have found on line a bit cheaper, and worth it.</li>
    <li> This product beats Boston hands down.  The extra cost is well worth the increase in comfort and longer wearing time.</li>
    <li> This is the only solution that doesn&#x27;t make my gas permeables turn cloudy.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years. A good buy!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing RGP lenses for decades.  i used to use Bausch &amp; Lomb or Boston solutions, and would regularly need to use an enzyme of some sort about every other week to keep the lenses clean enough to wear.  Even then, I would generally need to remove the lenses by about 6pm - 8pm.  I have somewhat dry eyes.  I discovered Lobob cleaning solution and it made a huge difference.  I have now switched to this disinfecting solution to go along with it, and my lenses have never felt more comfortable.  I really wish I had discovered this brand ages ago.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing RGP (rigid gas permeable) contact lenses for more than 25 years and this is, by far, the best solution I have encountered.  There was a time when my previous solution couldn&#x27;t clean my lenses, which were constantly fogged.  This cleaner took care of the fog problem.</li>
    <li> I wear Boston Lens and used the Boston Solutions for years but since I tried using these solutions I&#x27;ve never gone back.  These are the best on the market for gas permeable lens.  I can&#x27;t find Lobob Optimum Solutions anywhere but Amazon however.</li>
    <li> A far better product compared to Bausch &amp; Lomb.  Suggest the Wetting &amp; Cleaning solution as well.  Won&#x27;t use anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> My teenaged son has to wear hard lenses so our optometrist recommended these drop to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this brand because my son&#x27;s eyes are sensitive to most products but he does great with Lobob.  It&#x27;s also very easy for him to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no plans on ever switching to anything else.</li>
    <li> This solution cleans our Gas Permeable lenses better than any we have tried.  It is hard to find in our area and we are delighted that we can order it in bulk online!</li>
    <li> My wife had major issues with her contacts getting foggy.Tried different solutions and different contact lenses. Started using the Optimum CDS and contacts are clear. We buy it at Costco for $8.29.</li>
    <li> If you wear hard gas permeable contacts, I would recommend this – no grit / dirt feel on your eyeball, and you can wear them a little longer than normal and they appear to be much cleaner.  After receiving a free sample from my wife’s doctor we seem to go through this stuff like it’s going out of style – it works well for her hard contacts, and the pricing here is a little cheaper than my local store; combined with free Prime shipping and purchasing it here on Amazon is a no-brainer.  Compared to other brands of cleaning solution for her contacts, this is one of the better ones and has the fewest complaints concerning gritty feel as well as cleaning.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, easier to suds up than what can now be found in stores. Fluid comes out a little too easily - you don&#x27;t need to squeeze the bottle, at least not when new/full - just tip it and it&#x27;ll start dripping out. A couple drops per lens will suffice.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00012FJ9E Lobob Optimum Cleaning Disinfecting and Storage Solution, 4 oz.]]Keeps my gp contacts very clean, leaves no film and does not irritate my eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all the products in this set (including: Lobob Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner, 2 oz.; and Lobob Optimum Wetting and Rewetting Drop, 1 oz.). They always worked well for me with my hard CRT lenses. No allergy or reaction issues with this solution at all (it was recommended to me for sensitive eyes). They always came in cheaper on Amazon than my local drug stores and the expiration dates were always far out. This large bottle has been confiscated at the airport (LHR) before so either check it or look for the small bottle sold in the trial kit either directly from Lobob or your eye doctor. This product isn&#x27;t easy to find so you don&#x27;t want to lose it unexpectedly.</li>
    <li> Threw away all Boston and drugstore brand to use Lobob products exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;Made an immediate improvement in RGP coating problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about two days that I received and stared to use this product.  I purchased the CDS and the ReWetting solutions.  I have already seen a great improvement in my RGPs.  I, like many, have been using RGPs for over 35 years and started to get very itchy eyes.  Since I was in need of replenishing my solution decided to research other products for my contact lenses.  I was so glad to have found the optimum solutions.  I just hope these solutions will continue to be available.  Definitely recommended...</li>
    <li> I have used it for about 8 months. So far so good. But just a bit too expensive. So I give it 4 stars instead.</li>
    <li> My opthamologist recommended this to me many years ago.  It is hard to find in a retail or drug store.  It does a fantastic job of cleaning the lenses with just a tiny amount of fluid.  One bottle lasts me over a year.  My gas perm lenses have been clean for as many as 7 years, and the only reason I got a new lens is because I lost it.  When an eye doctor looks at a 7 year old contact lens and remarks that it is spotless, and this is the product you use, that pretty much says it all.  It is also exceptionally gentle for senstive eyes.  Combined with Unisol for rinsing, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> So far, works very well. Works better that B&amp;L.I would reorder and recommend.</li>
    <li> Only cleansing stuff that works well with gas permeable lenses.  Just DO NOT get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Take note this is a soaking and cleaning solution but not to go in the eyes - it is Not a wetting solution. You will have to rinse your lenses. I have worn RGP lenses for several years and tried all kinds of brands. This product definitely cleaned the protein buildup better than any cleaner. Ever.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This does a good job of cleaning my gas perm lens and I would recommend it to anyone in need.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for cleaning hard lenses on the market.</li>
    <li> This was everything the other reviews said it was. My contacts haven&#x27;t bothered me since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I wear gas perm lenses and this product works much better than the other products I have used.  Lens stay cleaner and fog free all day.</li>
    <li> worn gas permeables for 20yrs Lobob is the best. its a little extra work but the comfort is great.&lt;br /&gt;give it a try.</li>
    <li> If you were gas perms, it&#x27;s either this or Boston these days.  Both cost way too much for what it is, but at least this stuff seems to clean my lenses.  Glad Amazon carries it so I could learn about it.  Have since found it can be had locally for about the same price as well.  Been using it for a few months now and like it still.  I just use the cleaning solution but am tempted to try the rewetting drops as well/</li>
    <li> This product and the Optikem Sereine are the best products out there. Now, every person is different, and contact lens solutions do interact with different people differently. In truth, you have to find a solution that works the best for your particular eye chemistry....and yes, every one is different. For example, I could only use the original Boston solution. The Advance and simplicity caused my eyes to &amp;#34;gunk up.&amp;#34; Optimum and Sereine are really very good, and all though more expensive than Boston on a whole.....it is your eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn contacts since I was eight years old, starting with hard lenses and moving to RGPs.  I used Boston solutions for years, always had a lot of buildup issues and the like and eventually noticed increasing problems that led to decreased wear time.  Long story shorter, after thinking contacts were no longer possible and wearing hated glasses for the last 5 years, I recently ordered some new RGPs (RGPs warp over time, so that could have been part of my problem) and have been using the Lobob Optimum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution is my favorite, as it works really well.  I rarely have to use the Extra Strength Cleaner and don&#x27;t do enzymatic cleaners at all.  I did use Clear Care to deep clean my lenses a few days ago, but didn&#x27;t notice that it worked any better than the Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve had with this system is with the Wetting/Rewetting (W/RW) Solution.  I find that, for me, the W/RW solution kind of builds up a bit in my eye and lenses, leading to blurry vision, a \\&quot;full\\&quot;/viscous feeling, and decreased wear time.  I discovered this when I was putting a drop in each eye during the day and noticing that my eyes actually felt worse than they did when I did NOT use a W/RW drop during the day.  It&#x27;s not a huge issue, as I think that if I just back off on the amount of W/RW solution I use (ie, ONE drop on each lens, as opposed to two drops, when putting them in in the mornings) I may do better.  I produce a lot of oil, so I don&#x27;t need lots of lubrication in my eyes.  Once I take the lenses out, the excess solution seems to rinse off easily with tap water and isn&#x27;t hurting my eyes at all.  It&#x27;s just a minor irritation until I can figure out how many drops and what regimen will work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in spite of that one minor issue, I still highly recommend the Lobob Optimum line.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on other solutions and keep coming back to this one.  I don&#x27;t get nearly the buildup andcrap on my lenses that I used to have with Boston solutions.  Plus, Boston puts so much preservative and--for some inexplicable reason--fragrance in their solutions that it irritates my eyes.  While I haven&#x27;t yet managed to wear my lenses as long as I used to when I was younger, I&#x27;m hopeful.  It takes an average of 6 weeks to get used to new RGPs.  I&#x27;m on 5-1/2 weeks, so it&#x27;s still an adjustment process.  The fact that I&#x27;m able to wear contacts again at all is a miracle.  If, like me, you thought your contact-wearing days were over, give the Lobob Optimum line a try.  You may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> The Lobob Optimum cleaning and storage solution totally improved my contacts.  I have worn rigid contacts for 30 years, and need to continue with them.  Two years ago, my contacts would film over every day, sometimes right after I cleaned them.  They were fairly new and had been polished fairly recently, when my doctor&#x27;s office recommended trying Lobob.  I have been using this ever since, and I love it.  I have even recommended it to friends.  The Optimum has kept my contacts clean and they are very comfortable.  I can now put my contacts in and forget them-and I totally credit Lobob Optimum.</li>
    <li> For hard lense wearers this stuff is great for dry or sensitive eyes. I am definately switching from boston or bausch.</li>
</ol>
