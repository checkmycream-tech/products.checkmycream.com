      <li>I got this product and was very happy.  </li>
      <li>And the henna was excellent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rating at a 3 as I received my product, the 6-ack, in excellent time.</li>
      <li>This product was supposed to be a good purchase for the money, but you get what you pay for!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the henna has given me some great streaks to my hair.</li>
      <li>The price is great.</li>
      <li>This product is of a great quality.</li>
      <li>Great quality, a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>The texture of this one is great, like chocolate.  </li>
      <li>I have used this Henna for a couple of years now and was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Lasted me a while and worked great.</li>
      <li>And, the color is great.</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I use it to color my hair every 6 weeks and it works great.</li>
      <li>Great hair treatment.</li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>This package of six boxes was a great buy.</li>
      <li>So, the product may work great for that, but it is not what it is sold to be, per the website description.</li>
      <li>I needed this to use on my hair and I have been told lots of great reviews on this.</li>
      <li>i am an experienced user.</li>
      <li>The texture is very nice though.  </li>
      <li>Applause to Amazon for impeccable service.</li>
      <li>Good value for a great product.</li>
      <li>so i guess its a good product</li>
      <li>This is good henna.</li>
      <li>The best, in my opinion, is Egyptian henna, but it hasn&#x27;t been available in U.S. for ages.  </li>
      <li>I got in on time, and packaged good.  </li>
      <li>All the boxes I got had \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna\\&quot; and the woman with one arm up as pictured but the powder inside is in a sealed silver plastic pouch and there is no expiration or harvest date sticker or stamp.</li>
      <li>As for Jamila Henna, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>The henna powder arrived on time and the package was in good shape.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for the Jamila with the good dye release and stain, this is not the one.</li>
      <li>Superior quality haircolor.&#x27;</li>
      <li>received 6 boxes,some say superior ,some say premium, there is not expiration date on the boxes.</li>
      <li>Good luck, everyone.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great consistency and easy to use, beautiful color for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used henna on my hair many times before, with absolutely beautiful results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used more premium brands, but this one is consistently good and a great price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair henna for 37 years and have experienced many brands.  </li>
      <li>I just started with henna art and did some research before making my own paste.  </li>
      <li>but I honestly see no difference.  </li>
      <li>but the positive benefits have been astounding!!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent conditioner for the natural hair.</li>
      <li>I find this brand the best so far considering quality and price.</li>
      <li>My hair has been feeling amazing and looking so healthy since incorporating Henna into my regimen.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ground very fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using BAQ Jamila from a different supplier for years and was happy to find it on Amazon for a really great price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It came out a beautiful auburn and made my hair much shinier.  </li>
      <li>This henna mixes well, and I do not think it&#x27;s the finely sifted kind either.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>was ok.</li>
      <li>I gave this three stars, because while I would not buy it again, it was okay.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d started to notice more and more hair in the drain after showers and one of the many things I&#x27;ve read about henna</li>
      <li>Yes, I should have known better, but I was in a rush when I ordered.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure whether this is henna, so I will not use it.</li>
      <li>I love how it smells with cloves.  </li>
      <li>They were most assuredly NOT.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and will buy it over and over and over again.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised, loved the color - it turned out a coppery color and greys looked like bright copper highlights.</li>
      <li>I love this henna.</li>
      <li>but I love this product</li>
      <li>Jamila henna is a great product and of high quality, but this wasn&#x27;t JAMILA HENNA.</li>
      <li>I used this henna today for the first time and I loved it.</li>
      <li>What this means is that is is more finely sifted and has more dye than hair henna.</li>
      <li>I had used the BAQ henna and loved it, but this..... not so much.  </li>
      <li>but i strongly believe they sent me the package that out of date.</li>
      <li>this is a good economical choice, just be sure to order more than you need in case you get some old boxes.  </li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and creamy, easy to put on and wash off.</li>
      <li>Lovely fine powder, mixes into a super smooth paste, gives a beautiful glowing red hue.  </li>
      <li>finely sifted no clogging or over stringing.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and I love using it.</li>
      <li>a fine sift and smooth application</li>
      <li>/&gt;The henna mixes (say, for auburn, light brown, etc.)</li>
      <li>used it for a few years - with excellent results; mixing it with lemon juice, let it stand for 4-6 hours, then apply to towel-dried hair; covering with shower cup; let it sit for 6-8 hours, then rinse off.</li>
      <li>THis is NOT Jamila henna for body art; it is the cheap henna powder for hennaing your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better success with applying the Aphogee 2 min reconstructor weekly and recommend that all my ladies on a hair care journey.</li>
      <li>I have since switched to the Nupur henna, also available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Until my last order, everything was great: color</li>
      <li>This henna is far superior to the Rainbow brand  </li>
      <li>The price was right because I had bought it from another source and it was more</li>
      <li>And the six pack made it much more convenient to grab a box, mix it up and use right away.</li>
      <li>It is a very distinct scent this &amp;#34;henna&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>, I took a risk, and so far, I am pretty happy with the results.</li>
      <li>no its not BAQ, but honestly unless you are using this for a henna tattoo, its not a big deal for hair ...&lt;br /&gt;I have been using henna for the last 5 years and most of the time I use jamila , with great results.</li>
      <li>However, hair had a rich shine.</li>
      <li>I have been using this henna on my hair since December 2011 and have seen a significant difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I returned to butters-n-bars for my original henna for hair and bam..</li>
      <li>That was fine with me as I did not want the super saturated color you can get from the BAQ henna and the price difference is substantial.  </li>
      <li>Ok, good... not so for the other 5 packages -</li>
      <li>I just did my second treatment on both my hair (and my daughter&#x27;s hair this time) with good results again.</li>
      <li>However, must use a good deep conditioner to restore moisture to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>my original results; which proves that this henna is poooooooor quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Immediately reduced shedding, and strengthen hair.  However, must use a good deep conditioner to restore moisture to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will turn gray hair  an orange  color (not pretty),  However, hair had a rich shine. Used a color rinse to tone down orange to a deeper reddish color.  Plan to use organic cocoa to create brownish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend using more than once every 4 weeks, b/cause will dry-out course, dry, thick 4c hair. Plus,  very time consuming  process, but worth results.</li>
    <li> I used Jamila Henna weekly for six weeks in a row. The product did loosen my curl pattern slightly but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing for me. The growth, shine, strength and density of my hair is&lt;br /&gt;A M A Z I N G!! I am a Jamila Henna head for life. I&#x27;m addicted. I Seriously need to consider only applying twice  month or monthly but the positive benefits have been astounding!! For info on \\&quot;HOW\\&quot; to apply the henna, check out Curly Nikki&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I read through the various reviews and was amused by some of the misconceptions and myths out there.  I&#x27;ve been using hair henna for 37 years and have experienced many brands.  The best, in my opinion, is Egyptian henna, but it hasn&#x27;t been available in U.S. for ages.  As for Jamila Henna, it&#x27;s good.  Best? No.  Worst?  Certainly not.    Just to clear up the confusion, skin henna is NOT hair henna and vice versa.  The former has a much higher dye concentration, and is thus pricier.  But that doesn&#x27;t make the hair henna an inferior product.  If you&#x27;d like your hair to look like a beet, go ahead and try the skin henna on it.   Also, Jamila&#x27;s skin henna is intentionally foil wrapped, and the hair henna intentionally cellophane wrapped.  No false advertising!      As for the comment about some mysterious activation process that appears days later making the color deeper, all I can say is \\&quot;HUH?????\\&quot;  If that were to happen to me, I&#x27;d throw the stuff away and never buy it again.  Whatever chemicals could cause that to happen would be beyond scarey to me.    As for the comment about leaving it in for 4 hours or longer, well, been there/done that, and it sucks.  Personally, I get great results by mixing the henna with a little vinegar (1/4 cup) to get good absorption and very hot water.   I then let it sit for a couple of hours, adding more hot water if necessary until it&#x27;s the consistency of honey.  Sometimes I add Red Zinger tea by Celestial Seasonings if I want to deepen the red highlights or coffee if I want to deepen the brown highlights.  I apply it to damp but not soaking wet hair, then wrap my head in tin foil, a shower cap over that, and then I use a heat cap (available through amazon or beauty supply shops.)  I never leave the heap cap on longer than an hour and a half.  I rinse the henna out with cool water, let my hair dry, THEN shampoo it.  The henna stays in my hair over 3 months, and that&#x27;s in spite of swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool 2 or 3 hours a week, and 4 or 5 shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used all six boxes of my henna , great color and coverage for greys , gives a orange red color to the hair then cools to a red after a few days ... no its not BAQ, but honestly unless you are using this for a henna tattoo, its not a big deal for hair ...&lt;br /&gt;I have been using henna for the last 5 years and most of the time I use jamila , with great results. a fine sift and smooth application .&lt;br /&gt;And if you want to see the color it gives my hair[...]</li>
    <li> The henna powder arrived on time and the package was in good shape. The pack of 6 is convenient for me as I use henna to color my hair frequently. Good value for a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is noted to be body art quality. What this means is that is is more finely sifted and has more dye than hair henna. However, what arrived is 6 boxes of the clear packaged hair henna. So, the product may work great for that, but it is not what it is sold to be, per the website description.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading on blogs that it could help improve the overall quality of my natural hair. At first i used this each week but now its mostly once a month (or every other month) just to maintain the slight auburn tint in my hair. If you are thinking about buying this to help your hair grow, personally it did not do that for me. No noticable difference despite using the henna mixture weekly for approximately 6 months. My routine was to mix henna with Tresemme conditioner, olive oil and apply to my hair overnight under a shower cap. Henna is a dye and any side effects such as hair growth or improved hair density might have more to do with the products (oils, moisturizing conditioners, etc.) you mix the henna with rather than the henna itself. I&#x27;ve had better success with applying the Aphogee 2 min reconstructor weekly and recommend that all my ladies on a hair care journey.</li>
    <li> I have natural jet black coily hair( 4a, 4b and 4c on different sections of my head). I used this henna today for the first time and I loved it. I needed a protein treatment and my hair feels like it did that. My scalp has been flaky (even after multiple washes) and the henna seems to have fixed that. My hair was jet black so I was not expecting a change in colour and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any but I love this product and I would definitely use it again and recommend it to other naturals who had the same problems I had ie. easy hair breakage and dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I use this for hair. I&#x27;ve tried different kinds and this henna seems to be okay. I may try it again.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this henna again.  I have been using henna to dye my hair for several years and this is the first brand that I have been disappointed with.  The dye release was very poor and it left only a very faint light reddish brown stain.  I could not really tell that I had henned my hair when I was finished.  The texture is very nice though.  If you are looking for conditioning with very little dye, it might be a great product.  I read that Jamila comes in two versions (hair and skin).  If you are looking for the Jamila with the good dye release and stain, this is not the one.</li>
    <li> THis is NOT Jamila henna for body art; it is the cheap henna powder for hennaing your hair. It does NOT work for staining skin. I believed the item description and will now be going to an event as a henna artist with no henna! Yes, I should have known better, but I was in a rush when I ordered. Amazon misrepresented this item, and I will be sending it back, even though I opened it. It comes in plastic pouches is dark brown, and will not work on skin no matter what the description says. The reviews are not all for this product, but for Jamila henna in general. If you want to henna skin, do not buy this! [[ASIN:B001G7PZ8S Jamila  Henna Powder,  3.52-Ounce Box  (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> great product.  good staining and long lasting. finely sifted no clogging or over stringing. will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BAQ Jamila from a different supplier for years and was happy to find it on Amazon for a really great price.&lt;br /&gt;I knew all about knock-offs, BAQ or Hair quality.&lt;br /&gt;This item is being advertised as BAQ Jamila, which is the one I like and used forever.&lt;br /&gt;So, since I really had nothing to lose, but a couple of $$ I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened a box of &amp;#34;Jamila&amp;#34; I knew I was had. The powder had a very odd smell. I swear it had a hint of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;It had none of the tell-tell henna scent people either love or hate. It is a very distinct scent this &amp;#34;henna&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I mixed it the way I always mix my brew, let it sit overnight. I always put a dot of the cured mixture in my wrist to test whether it is ready. It usually leaves a stain within a minute or less.&lt;br /&gt;Not this mix.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I was afraid to put it on my hair to be honest and tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have 5 boxes left, I might use to practice some henna painting.&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning to regular henna users. This is NOT the real Jamila we&#x27;re all used to. Likely a knock-off or very, very old stuff.&lt;br /&gt;That reminds me. Another tell-tell sign is that it has no production or expiration date on the box.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and check your local South Asian or Middle Eastern store for the real deal.</li>
    <li> When I first received the 6 boxes of Henna powder, I was a bit suspicious and disappointed because the boxes were faded. It looked like a old set of boxes. Then I weighted the content of a box: barely 60g when it was supposed to be 100g!! Seriously?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure whether this is henna, so I will not use it.</li>
    <li> This product is of a great quality. It gave my black African American hair a beautiful auburn sheen. It shipped quickly</li>
    <li> This is advertised as being body art quality. However, this is NOT baq henna.  This is henna for hair.  This came in a cellophane wrap, that didn&#x27;t have the crop date printed on it. BAQ Jamila Henna has a foil wrapping with a date printed on it.  Don&#x27;t be deceived! I am returning this item to Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> The Henna powder in this package was not green like all the previous Henna I&#x27;ve used, it was dark brown. It smelled almost like normal Henna but not quite. Also when I dumped it out into the bowl it looked like less than my normal 100 gram(3.5 ounce) boxes so I weighed it and it was only 2.9 ounces so I ended up needing two boxes for my shoulder length hair. I&#x27;ve used Henna 6 times previously and always had great coverage of my few gray hairs, in fact they turn bright red which I think gives amazing highlights to my dark brown hair. I decided to give it a try anyway. I mixed up this supposed Henna with warm water and a few TBSP of apple cider vinegar and let sit overnight. Mixed up it was still a dark brown color and did not change colors at all after sitting overnight. I put in on my head anyway and left it for 6 hours. It did basically nothing. The gray is still grey and the brown did not get the auburn tint it usually does. I am very disappointed in this product and WILL NOT buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have African American (type 4b) hair and tried Jamila for the first time last month. I had great results and my hair feels better so far; I love the subtle auburn color. I just did my second treatment on both my hair (and my daughter&#x27;s hair this time) with good results again. I recommend that you deep condition after any henna treatment to combat dryness.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair, which is medium brown with very few grays.  It came out a beautiful auburn and made my hair much shinier.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this last week and was very disappointed by the quality of the product. It did not stain at all. Infact it did not smell/look like henna. I have previously purchased from the same vendor and was happy with that purchase. It was in a foil pack. This came in clear packs and was of horribly poor quality.</li>
    <li> received 6 boxes,some say superior ,some say premium, there is not expiration date on the boxes.Henna should be greenish, this product is brownish.&lt;br /&gt;and i used other henna product that worked but i strongly believe they sent me the package that out of date.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it to color my hair every 6 weeks and it works great. You can not tell I have gray hair and it&#x27;s natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the deceptive description. Yes, Jamila  is one of the finest body art quality henna powders available, however, this particular batch is henna for hair. It is brown powder w/no expiration date whereas skin powder is green w/an expiration date. Luckily, I was looking to henna my hair &amp; not my skin but I&#x27;d have been pretty upset if it were the other way around.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Jamila Henna thinking it was BAQ (Body Art Quality) Henna since that is what the description of the product says. However it is not, it is actually Henna for hair and now I have to reorder. The Henna did leave a slight stain and the product arrived fairly quickly, which is why I gave it 3 stars.I would really appreciate if the seller corrects the description of the product, it&#x27;s false advertisement.</li>
    <li> I ordered Jamila &amp;#34;Superior Quality Henna&amp;#34;.  What I received does not seem to be henna. It says &amp;#34;Superior Quality Haircolor&amp;#34; . The photo is the same but no mention of henna anywhere on the package, the color is different, all brown..no green, and no foil packaging. I&#x27;ve been using henna for 5 years but afraid to put this on my hair and don&#x27;t see how to contact the company for an explanation.</li>
    <li> Lovely fine powder, mixes into a super smooth paste, gives a beautiful glowing red hue.  Great quality, a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted. red color not as vibrant or long lasting as i thought it would be but probably because of the way i mixed. I&#x27;m a henna novice so i guess its a good product</li>
    <li> I received my henna within a few days of shipping. I am a long-time user of henna and could tell which were from a fresh batch (four of them) and the other two weren&#x27;t; though, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal because they were not old by any means, just not as fresh. Lasted me a while and worked great. I would definitely order more.</li>
    <li> The inference is that this is body art quality henna, but it is actually haircolor henna.  I had used the BAQ henna and loved it, but this..... not so much.  Barely left any color on my hair.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t read the previous reviews.</li>
    <li> I purchased henna for my daughter.and now we both use it. The price is great. It&#x27;s packed differently. It&#x27;s packed in plastic not foil. I&#x27;ll see how my daughter feels about the plastic packaging. She&#x27;s the henna buff and prefers foil packaging. It shipped quickly, too.</li>
    <li> This is fake henna. What I received is brown color, and it&#x27;s less than 50 grams in the package, even though it says 100 g on the box.  I&#x27;ve been using henna for over 16 years, this is not how henna looks/smells. Has a chemical smell to it, and my hand covered in red spots just from touching it. This product is a health hazard. Amazon shouldn&#x27;t really be allowing this company to sell.</li>
    <li> When I have ordered Jamila elsewhere, there is always an expiration date printed on the package.  This packaging looks old and faded and there is not a date.  I did not see any dye release after allowing the product to sit for 12 hours mixed with lemon juice.  It did color my hair slightly, but it had faded alot in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This henna gave my dark blond hair a great medium red color.  I mixed it with lemon juice, left it on for 4 hours, and it worked great.  I have been using henna for 2.5 years, and this product has been just wonderful.  I have nothing negative to say about this product.  This henna leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I got this product and was very happy.  There were 6 boxes of Henna with individually packaged 100g pouches (one in each box).  The henna worked beautifully in my hair (I used two boxes each time), leaving a more deep red than orange red color behind.  I have thicker, relaxed hair that hits the top of my shoulder blades and this one purchase will be enough to get me through 3 henna applications (I do one roughly every two weeks).      The only reason I took off a star is because the description states that \\&quot;Jamila is one of the finest body art quality hennas available...\\&quot; and it is.....BUT thats not what is being sold here.  This is their henna for hair line, NOT the BAQ stuff.  If you google this, there&#x27;s plenty of info on how to tell the difference between the two, from product to packaging.    All in all, my hair loves this henna, but don&#x27;t get tricked by the description wording.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of Henna to dye my hair red for almost 2 years.  Until my last order, everything was great: color I got compliments on and a consistent product.  This last order had 6 boxes.  I noticed a difference as soon as I opened the first box, it was more brown than usual (it&#x27;s generally a greenish-brown that gets greener when you mix it with lemon juice)  When I applied it to my hair, I noticed that it was gritty, and I had only a very light reddish hue over my dark blond grow out and that faded quickly.  I thought I might have done something wrong, so I used a second box a few weeks later and had the same experience.  I opened the last 4 boxes and looked at the powder, and notices that while one bag seemed a bit greener, but all of the others had the same brownish, lumpy look.  I went to a local Indian products store, and purchased some henna powder there, and it is the fine, non-lumpy, green powder that Jamila used to be.  So disappointed in the poor quality!</li>
    <li> I have used henna on my hair many times before, with absolutely beautiful results. This turned my hair ORANGE and I&#x27;m trying to return it. Number one clue: my boxes look DIFFERENT than the box pictured. I got a severely inferior product. I wish I would have read all the reviews before I purchased this. My bad. Jamila henna is a great product and of high quality, but this wasn&#x27;t JAMILA HENNA. It says &#x27;Jamila Henna: Superior quality haircolor.&#x27; Their boxes never say that. They don&#x27;t say haircolor. BAH. Now I have to buy some REAL henna and indigo powder to fix this orange hair. Good luck, everyone.</li>
    <li> I was really worried about trying henna for the first time. Scary visions of carroty hair made this seem way more risky than the chemicals in the hair dye I&#x27;ve been using for years. At least with those boxes I have a fairly good idea what the results will be. But I&#x27;d started to notice more and more hair in the drain after showers and one of the many things I&#x27;ve read about henna is it&#x27;s really good for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took a risk, and so far, I am pretty happy with the results. I&#x27;ve used henna 4x times, every other month for about six months now, and have not dyed my hair since. In that time, and I thought it was a fluke the first time but it&#x27;s been this way ever since-- less hair in the drain after showers. That alone is worth it to me. But there are other benefits too, like, my hair feels like hair again. No stiff hay-like feel after using henna, as it is with hair dye. My hair is much softer, the color is much richer, and it doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with dyed auburn/red hair and I have grays/white hair at the temples and sprinkled throughout. After using henna, and after it&#x27;s developed, most of my hair is a rich deep reddish/brown color, (and much redder in the sun) with the grays/whites being a more slightly carroty/golden color. I read that the henna that&#x27;s mixed with indigo changed your grays/whites to a pinkish color so I&#x27;ll take slightly carroty gold over that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna mixes (say, for auburn, light brown, etc.) have indigo and other additives. Jamila Henna has no additives, just henna, so no pink hair, which is why I tried this versus a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the smell issue. I do not love the smell. I don&#x27;t hate but it&#x27;s not pleasant, and over the course of waiting the three hours I leave it on, it has a tendency to give me a slight headache. I mix the henna with lemon juice and let it develop overnight or two days, then mix it with some conditioner to apply. Leave it on three hours with a bag or shower cap on my head, and shampoo it out. Then use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin I miss in the afterwards wipe down) so all those boxes of hair color I still have are going to get dusty. Wonder what I should do with them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this particular order, the package inside the box was clear, and all six boxes were sealed and dated, and the box inside was stamped \\&quot;henna for hair.\\&quot; I will definitely order again.d shampoo it out. Then use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now the benefits/pros (less hair in the drain, hair feels like hair, beautiful color) far out weigh the cons (smell, very messy, major fear of dying skin I miss in the afterwards wipe down) so all those boxes of hair color I still have are going to get dusty. Wonder what I should do with them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this particular order, the package inside the box was clear, and all six boxes were sealed and dated, and the box inside was stamped \\&quot;henna for hair.\\&quot; I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This package of six boxes was a great buy. The henna is perfect for giving my hair the body and color it has needed. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love this henna. It does everythng it is supposed to. And the six pack made it much more convenient to grab a box, mix it up and use right away.</li>
    <li> The boxes contained powder that was the wrong color and scent and does not appear to be henna at all. The powder was packaged in boxes that contained plastic bags, but Jamila usually packages their henna in foil. Also, the inside of the boxes says &amp;#34;henna for hair&amp;#34; which is not what Jamila Henna is usually marketed as.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural dye that I have found, and is exceedingly convenient to use. Only downside is that it takes so many hours, but you never have to worry about the evenness of the dye.</li>
    <li> I think it is awesome. I think it is pure without any chemicals. I had a friend who gave me pure henna from leaves!! This is the only henna so far I have found close the pure one.</li>
    <li> Got to me one week after ordering. I wasted a whole Saturday...i am an experienced user. No dye deposit period. 2 years hennaing and this never happened to me. Old crumpled packages with no dates on them...should have known!</li>
    <li> I use the product as a hair dye. It is listed as BODY ART QUALITY, which it wasn&#x27;t. But it did work well as a dye without a reaction. I would reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> used it for a few years - with excellent results; mixing it with lemon juice, let it stand for 4-6 hours, then apply to towel-dried hair; covering with shower cup; let it sit for 6-8 hours, then rinse off.</li>
    <li> This item does not say &amp;#34;for hair only&amp;#34;, but it comes brown, unsealed, and crappy. There is no silver bag, and no indication it&#x27;s even a real Jamila product. My other Jamila boxes have a crop on the bottom, and come in nice, sealed packaging. It&#x27;s NOT BODY QUALITY, so do not use it for this purpose. I wouldn&#x27;t trust it for your hair either because the bags are all punctured.</li>
    <li> I have been using this henna on my hair since December 2011 and have seen a significant difference in my hair.  I started using the henna after I made the decision to go natural and cut my hair to an inch long November 12, 2011.  I have 3a, 4c hair.  The henna has made my hair softer, has strengthened it, has eliminated shedding and I love the deep reddish brown color that results on my silver gray hair.  Although some people have said that henna loosened their natural curl, I have found that it did not affect my corkscrew curl pattern at all.  If it did, it only lengthened the corkscrew but I honestly see no difference.  The henna comes in six boxes of 100g and is wrapped in cellophane.  The results have exceed my hopes and I will use henna once a month for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My hair has been feeling amazing and looking so healthy since incorporating Henna into my regimen.  Not only does my hair feel amazing but I get compliments on the color all the time, definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I think we may have been ripped off.  I am used to this henna being in a clear wrap and green.  This product has no crop date, in a silver cellophane wrapper, and is brown.  I am afraid to use this stuff on my hair.  I may have to stop ordering henna online if deception is going to be the game being played with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It is being returned. UPS will be picking it up soon.  I will not reorder from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I saw a few reviews that said it, but I now see what they are talking about. What arrived is brown powder that says &amp;#34;Superior Quality HAIRCOLOR&amp;#34; on the box and not HENNA like it should. I have no idea what is in this and I&#x27;m honestly a bit afraid to use it. Probably sending it back since I didn&#x27;t receive what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I just started with henna art and did some research before making my own paste.  Everyone recommended Jamila, so it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it&#x27;s ground very fine.  However, I can&#x27;t compare to other henna powders because I haven&#x27;t used any others. BUT... the stain it leaves (at least the way I make it) is a dark brown and last about two weeks.  I understand there are several ways of making it, though, so it may last more or less depending.</li>
    <li> This product was supposed to be a good purchase for the money, but you get what you pay for! Henna for hair gives the same benefits of henna baq without the color when you purchase quality henna for hair. This product is not quality! I used three of the six before I becam frustrated with getting the same results- no big beautiful hair, no strengthening, no shine. I returned to butters-n-bars for my original henna for hair and bam..my original results; which proves that this henna is poooooooor quality. In addition, the box coloring is different and this product does not come with a sticker in the box like the BnB henna. For all those who have researched Jamila you know that packaging tells you what you are getting. I did not know the difference until I went back to BnB. Now, I am not paid by BnB in any way; I am simply a woman in love with her hair and I would like to save other women from putting this crap in their hair. Best of luck!!</li>
    <li> This did wonders for my hair! It looks so natural that people could not tell what it was!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using for decades, mainly Persian henna. Since I can&#x27;t get them anymore, I searched online and ordered a few different kinds. I find this brand the best so far considering quality and price. The texture is smooth and creamy, easy to put on and wash off. And, the color is great. I have and will stick to this one for as long as the quality and price stays the same.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner.  I have used it before.  The price was right because I had bought it from another source and it was more</li>
    <li> So disappointed with Amazon for this product since I ordered from them before. I quickly returned them. The other reviewer was right about the description outside the box (superior quality henna hair color----this is FAKE). Upon mixing it, I can smell the rancid odor &amp; saw the inferior quality powder (not super fine)! I have been using Jamila henna powder for a long time to be able to distinguish fake from real.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping my fingers cross because I just ordered from another seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating at a 3 as I received my product, the 6-ack, in excellent time. I am however worried that I received a fake product. All the boxes I got had \\&quot;Superior Quality Henna\\&quot; and the woman with one arm up as pictured but the powder inside is in a sealed silver plastic pouch and there is no expiration or harvest date sticker or stamp. I will be contacting Amazon to see about this and possibly getting my money back if it is fake. I&#x27;m not about to take a chance with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Edit 02/18/13*&lt;br /&gt;I increased to 4 stars as Amazon contacted me right away and offered me a refund or replacement at no charge to me. I chose a replacement. Fingers crossed this will solve my problems. I will edit again once I get my replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;*Edit 02/20/13*&lt;br /&gt;Down to 1 star.  Unfortunately, the replacement order I placed was identical to the original.  I will be returning the lot for a refund.  I don&#x27;t absolutely know that the product is fake, but it does not have the harvest/expiration dates and I don&#x27;t want to take any chances.  Applause to Amazon for impeccable service.</li>
    <li> Great hair treatment. It gives your hair strength as well a protein. This is an excellent conditioner for the natural hair.</li>
    <li> First please note that if you order this, you will be receiving the HAIR QUALITY henna in clear, undated cellophane packages rather than the BODY ART QUALITY henna in dated, foil packets.  This is cheaper and not as finely ground and being undated, there is not a way to know how old it is or what crop it is from.  Therefore, you might get fresh henna or you might get old henna. That was fine with me as I did not want the super saturated color you can get from the BAQ henna and the price difference is substantial.  I used a 3 of my 6 boxes to do one henna dye.  2 of the 3 boxes had nice fresh green henna and 1 was obviously old as it was brown. Should probably have pitched the brown one but I used them all anyway.  I am Caucasian and my hair is fine, wavy and dry on the ends, medium to dark brown. Had to leave overnight to get dye release, mixed with chai tea.  After dye release, mixed with conditioner and left on for 4 hours.  I was pleasantly surprised, loved the color - it turned out a coppery color and greys looked like bright copper highlights. If you are looking for pure, basic henna this is a good economical choice, just be sure to order more than you need in case you get some old boxes.  I have since switched to the Nupur henna, also available on Amazon.  No quality issues and it is even less expensive, faster dye release and need to leave it on for less time.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  I&#x27;ve tried other henna products that cost less from my local store but NOTHING compares to this product.  I absolutely love it and will buy it over and over and over again.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and I love using it. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the henna has given me some great streaks to my hair.</li>
    <li> This henna is far superior to the Rainbow brand  I tried previously.  Now, I am not an expierenced henna head I just recently started.  What I can tell you though, is that this one is definetely better than the other i tried...no waiting for the dye to release its almost immediate and it does make your hair stronger.  I dont use the henna for dying just for the other benefits  I have had much less hair fall since using...will definetely purchase again</li>
    <li> I ordered a SEALED six-pack of the product, since I needed about 500g of henna powder.  When I received the package, I was initially pleased at the quick shipment, but that didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue #1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the first box, it was in a sealed foil package.  Ok, good... not so for the other 5 packages - those were clear plastic bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues #2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the individual packages was supposed to be 3.52 ounces (approx 100 grams) by weight.  They were most assuredly NOT.  Weight averaged about 65-66 grams each (65 g, 67 g, 71 g, 68 g, 65 g and 63g as the exact numbers), which gave me a total of BARELY 400g of powder; these weight were only for the (still sealed) powder packages and did NOT including the cardboard packaging, which was only about 7-8g itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll order from a different supplier; I only ordered from here this time due to needing the powder with short notice.</li>
    <li> I needed this to use on my hair and I have been told lots of great reviews on this. I will be using this shortly on my hair it came well packaged and with no damages. Recommend and will use again.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a year to dye my hair red.  I&#x27;ve used more premium brands, but this one is consistently good and a great price.  The texture of this one is great, like chocolate.  I love how it smells with cloves.  This brand also doesn&#x27;t have any of those nasty chemicals that can ruin your hair.  Pure henna here!  This is the only brand I use on my hair.  Give my hair excellent texture and color.  I feel safe enough with this product to use it on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This henna mixes well, and I do not think it&#x27;s the finely sifted kind either. I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I got in on time, and packaged good.  And the henna was excellent.  I&#x27;m AA, relaxed, and it makes my hair noticeable stronger.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for dying my hair, worked very well each time when I applied to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this Henna for a couple of years now and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Great consistency and easy to use, beautiful color for my hair.  Covers grey nicely. (leave in for longer than usual and the color deepens)</li>
    <li> Please be aware that this is HENNA FOR HAIR only. It is not body art quality (baq) as the description box says of Jamila henna. I ordered 2 packs of 6 for $11.50 a pack. I received 12 separate boxes of Jamila henna powder just thrown willy nilly in a shipping box. There was henna powder spilling from some of the packs. I opened one of the boxes and that bag of powder was punctured. I had to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt; I gave this product 3 stars because I don&#x27;t use henna for dye release but for it&#x27;s conditioning qualities and the first box I used was ok. I&#x27;ve been using henna on a regular basis for a year and this was the worst I&#x27;ve ever had. This box of henna didn&#x27;t have that grassy, earthy smell that I crave so much. I usually buy from mehandi.com or hennasooq.com but was in search of a less expensive but comparable alternative.</li>
    <li> This is good henna. does what is expected. My hair is black and it made it a little lighter and the reddish brown hue can be seen under the sun. I did not see any changes in texture or and extra conditioning. Feel like a mild hair dye. I actually dont do it on the regular becuase i dont have a wow factor with the treatment. I kinda expected a better color and was actually looking forward to the texture change since i have 4c hair. but i would suggest it for a person covering greys. Ive dyed my hair and it has fallen out. so this is pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came quick but it was all taped up in a large postal envelope and it was starting to rip. it was 6 small boxes so the corners were tearing it.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars, because while I would not buy it again, it was okay. Firstly, although the seller says this is body art quality henna, it is NOT body art quality. It took two tries to get a barely noticeable change in my hair. When you consider it takes 6-8 hours for the dye release and 3-4 for it to sit on your hair, two tries is quite a time investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used orange juice and chamomile tea, and let it sit out 6 hours, then applied it to my hair and let that set in for 5 hours. My hair was a lame, brassy orange, at best--I blamed the less acidic mix. I decided to give it another go, and the second time I used three boxes of henna and enough lemon juice to get to a paste consistency, let it sit out for well over 8 hours, and used chamomile to loosen the paste to a yogurt consistency, applied it to my head and let that sit in for 4 hours. Today I have reddish roots (they were darker to begin with) and brassy, but brighter orangey ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cellophane around the boxes of henna was yellowed and brittle, and the boxes themselves were faded and looked incredibly old, so I can only assume the henna itself was old and not very potent. If I could do it over again, I would order BAQ henna that is dated.</li>
