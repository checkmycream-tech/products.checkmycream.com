### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it is a perfect product.</li>
      <li>The trick to getting the perfect look from this product is to exfoliate your lips before application.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize is was so very bright, but that is my fault not the company&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>i bought it in \\&quot;passion\\&quot; and loved the color on my lips!</li>
      <li>The lip stain isn&#x27;t that great, but I loved the chapstick part!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say its great if you&#x27;re not hoping to use the balm.  </li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t they know better than to create a balm that sticks way up and can break off easily?!</li>
      <li>Already bought more for some friends</li>
      <li>I really love this lip stain.  </li>
      <li>It does its jobs, stains your lips, the lip balm gives them a nice smooth feel with or without the staining.    </li>
      <li>I love these shades.  </li>
      <li>It is more for girls night out than going to the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Love this product, no issue with product or delivery</li>
      <li>it instead is more of a \\&quot;wetting agent\\&quot;, for lack of a better term.  </li>
      <li>I am now going to buy two more.</li>
      <li>The lipstain didn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and the balm is awesome.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;stain\\&quot; easily comes off on napkins.</li>
      <li>It applies really easily and evenly</li>
      <li>I just scrub my lips with a damp washcloth until they are perfectly smooth, and then the color goes on evenly and easily.  </li>
      <li>love wearing bold lipcolor, so I am not bothered by the colors being realistically darker than they look on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I ordered the Revlon Just Bitten Lipstain in passion, and it is very bright pink.  </li>
      <li>and you have to reapply  from time to time to make sure the color is consistent.</li>
      <li>This is really overpriced in most stores as compared to buying on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>this color would be beautiful on pale skin.</li>
      <li>I wanted a crimson lipstick that would last a long time with a matt finish, and the Midnight color is just perfect.  </li>
      <li>Works Over it, because I love how shiny the gloss is, &amp; it makes your lips sooo soft!  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try it again tomorrow, but will put it on much lighter as my lips are way too fuchsia for my light caucasion skin.  </li>
      <li>but,  it could be because I do not put very much on.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>It is actually nice in that it goes on very light, but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will over-apply it and suddenly realize \\&quot;uh-</li>
      <li>Ok, so this product tastes like rotten oranges, the strip on the back on envelopes and ass.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve eaten potato chips and am finishing some hot tea.  </li>
      <li>You get the color, but it bleeds just enough to require multiple coats, which makes the shade you&#x27;ve chosen remarkably darker than the color displayed on the tube.</li>
      <li>First....</li>
      <li>After two hours my lips are as fluorescent as when I first put it on...</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tested the exact number of hours that it wears, but I will eventually.  </li>
      <li>The perfume (\\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;) is fairly strong and definitely an allergen for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does list the ingredients</li>
      <li>I bought 3 of these things, and only got one good use of full coverage out of it before the markers dried up.</li>
      <li>, I think it is really smooth and conditioning and sturdy enough.  </li>
      <li>I then applied the lip balm and it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is very user-friendly, imho.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I just expect too much.  </li>
      <li>The stain, as all stains are, is very drying and after it sets you must put something \\&quot;wet\\&quot; over it</li>
      <li>The color is very pink.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There was too much hype for these products.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>After a few hours the color faded and I actually liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>Supposedly the balm provides a soft shine, but I didn&#x27;t notice much shine at all.</li>
      <li>So in other words, it&#x27;s buildable and you will need to use a light hand...    </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it is long stay, and after a year from purchasing it the pen hasn&#x27;t dried yet.</li>
      <li>The balm is does not retract, and in the two times I&#x27;ve used it I can easily see that it would snap it off if you weren&#x27;t extremely careful when putting the cap back on after each use.</li>
      <li>The pen that arrived has no color stain &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; in it whatsoever, and instead has this clear liquid that comes out and smells like a combination of vinegar and chemicals.</li>
      <li>I can put this on early morning and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old, Caucasian female.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
      <li>I previously bought a Just Bitten lip-stain in &amp;#34;Victorian&amp;#34; which is a dark red and loved it.</li>
      <li>The thing that ticked me off, I purchased SEVERAL colors of the Just Bitten stain, and the balm broke off instantly the first time I used each one.</li>
      <li>Body Works CO Bigelow Magenta Mint gloss over the Revlon Passion color lip stain for a sizzling hot pink pout.  </li>
      <li>On a black or other dark skinned or tan woman, though, the fuchsia would be gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Lip gloss is usually sticky and looses its color quickly.</li>
      <li>And I, frankly, haven&#x27;t expected that particular allergen to be a threat in lipstick.</li>

<li> Lip gloss is usually sticky and looses its color quickly.</li>
<li> And I, frankly, haven&#x27;t expected that particular allergen to be a threat in lipstick.</li>
<li> These two combined seem to last for a long time, but not as long as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
<li> Not really a lip stain, although I do like the balm on the opposite side.</li>
<li> Imagine running a pink highlighter over your lips, and you&#x27;ve got the basic idea.</li>
<li> I do not want to have such PINK lips.</li>
<li> it dried up really fast - lasted less than a month</li>
<li> /&gt;It does not seem to stay on my lips very long</li>
<li> The trick, of course, is to put it on and let it dry for a couple minutes before you put the balm over it.  </li>
<li> so your lips don&#x27;t feel taught and dry.    </li>
<li> though the color might fade a bit it last me on average 8 - 10 hours.  </li>
<li> So you&#x27;ll have dark red on some parts of your lip and none on others.</li>
<li> My only problem is there is no way to tone it down.  </li>
<li> It tastes so bitter when you accidentally lick it</li>
<li> I then wanted a lighter color pink</li>
<li> Color did not come out like as if it was empty.</li>
<li> to the people that are upset by the balm on the other end:  If you are paying attention, you won&#x27;t break it off.  </li>
<li> I have tried the other lipstain&#x27;s that have a roll on applicator.  </li>
<li> I am not a big fan of lipstick, but I usually wear a lot of colored lip gloss.</li>
<li> When I opened it all I saw was a marker for your lips and lip balm attached to other end.</li>
<li> Nothing I expected!</li>
<li> The \\&quot;Balm\\&quot; is not actually a balm at all, to be rubbed hard over and over on your lips...</li>
<li> and it is build-able, so you can adjust the shade until it is as dark as you like.  </li>
<li> If I wear it again I will apply it a few hours before leaving the house to let the color fade to a softer pink.</li>
<li> The balm is crap more like a vaseline stick</li>
<li> It looks ridiculous after about an hour if you don&#x27;t re-apply, and you can then wipe it away completely with very little effort.</li>
<li> and now I&#x27;m thinking I could have bought a non-toxic higlighter for less.</li>
<li> Also, the balm end also smells heavily of chemicals.</li>
<li> It comes off in a few hours in patches.</li>
<li> Lipstick is thick and its too made up looking for anything other than a performance or a photo shoot.</li>
<li> After applying it on my lips I found it to be a ridiculous shade of magenta bubble gum pink</li>
<li> in fact I left it on my desk and my boss was in a rush and used it to higlight some paper work needless to say it worked</li>
<li> I do like the balm which I had been applying after the stain, but the cap is poorly engineered, so even though I managed not to break the little stick of balm, I have to be ultra-careful how I reinstall the cap in</li>
<li> Overall I was disappointed, and I feel this product was not worth the $10 I paid for at the drugstore.</li>
<li> This makes the cost of the tube ridiculous.  </li>
<li> i didn&#x27;t like it because as soon as you drink or eat something you will get nasty white circles on the inner part of your mouth.</li>
<li> The revlon tube is designed to look like you can see the level of color remaining, but it&#x27;s a fake out.</li>
<li> but when I applied the color I was not impressed.</li>
<li> so this, unfortunately, will be consigned to the garbage can.</li>
<li> SADLY...</li>
<li> a disappointment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Already bought more for some friends</li>
    <li> I like the stain-no problem with that, but my tube of \\&quot;forbidden\\&quot; was empty/dried out after 10 days.  This makes the cost of the tube ridiculous.  NYC has the same colors and 1/2 the price. I am trying one and will see if it lasts. The revlon tube is designed to look like you can see the level of color remaining, but it&#x27;s a fake out.</li>
    <li> There IS a list of ingredients but they are in microscopic print on the inside of a sticker that you can&#x27;t access until you&#x27;ve peeled off the protective cellophane after purchase. And I, frankly, haven&#x27;t expected that particular allergen to be a threat in lipstick. Well, I do now. The perfume (\\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;) is fairly strong and definitely an allergen for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does list the ingredients but of course I bought this at a drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shade I got is \\&quot;Lust\\&quot; and I like it - it&#x27;s a natural-looking darker rust-red - but it doesn&#x27;t stay on well. I do like the balm which I had been applying after the stain, but the cap is poorly engineered, so even though I managed not to break the little stick of balm, I have to be ultra-careful how I reinstall the cap in order to not nick the balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I realize what&#x27;s giving me the headache and scrambled brain and stuffed-up airways so this, unfortunately, will be consigned to the garbage can. Revlon, you&#x27;re losing a long-time customer.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Revlon Just Bitten Lipstain in passion, and it is very bright pink.  I didn&#x27;t realize is was so very bright, but that is my fault not the company&#x27;s.  The lipstain didn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and the balm is awesome.  My only problem is there is no way to tone it down.  It is more for girls night out than going to the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeee the color! i bought it in \\&quot;passion\\&quot; and loved the color on my lips! SADLY... about 30mins later... i started to feel my lips drying out! that same night, i could not stand the dryness and itching! WHAT BALM ARE THEY TALKIN ABOUT?!</li>
    <li> I like the pen like applicator.  I have tried the other lipstain&#x27;s that have a roll on applicator.  Those are horrible.  The color is very pink.&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem to stay on my lips very long but,  it could be because I do not put very much on.  I do not want to have such PINK lips.</li>
    <li> First....to the people that are upset by the balm on the other end:  If you are paying attention, you won&#x27;t break it off.  Open your eyes!  The \\&quot;Balm\\&quot; is not actually a balm at all, to be rubbed hard over and over on your lips...it instead is more of a \\&quot;wetting agent\\&quot;, for lack of a better term.  The stain, as all stains are, is very drying and after it sets you must put something \\&quot;wet\\&quot; over it so your lips don&#x27;t feel taught and dry.    Second....The color of passion is FUCHSIA.  It is actually nice in that it goes on very light, but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will over-apply it and suddenly realize \\&quot;uh-oh....too dark\\&quot;.  So in other words, it&#x27;s buildable and you will need to use a light hand...    After two hours my lips are as fluorescent as when I first put it on...and I&#x27;ve eaten potato chips and am finishing some hot tea.  The trick, of course, is to put it on and let it dry for a couple minutes before you put the balm over it.  It has to set up or it never will.    Can&#x27;t wait to try it again tomorrow, but will put it on much lighter as my lips are way too fuchsia for my light caucasion skin.  On a black or other dark skinned or tan woman, though, the fuchsia would be gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I love these shades.  I&#x27;m a 25 year old, Caucasian female.&lt;br /&gt;I love wearing bold lipcolor, so I am not bothered by the colors being realistically darker than they look on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I have this in 3 shades, &amp; am considering a 4th.&lt;br /&gt;I always toss the balm when I buy it.  Instead, I layer a corresponding lip gloss color of the CO Bigelow Mentha Lip Shine Lipglosses from Bath &amp; Body Works Over it, because I love how shiny the gloss is, &amp; it makes your lips sooo soft!  I layer Bath &amp; Body Works CO Bigelow Magenta Mint gloss over the Revlon Passion color lip stain for a sizzling hot pink pout.  These two combined seem to last for a long time, but not as long as I&#x27;d hoped.  Maybe I just expect too much.  I haven&#x27;t tested the exact number of hours that it wears, but I will eventually.  This is really overpriced in most stores as compared to buying on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve looked...  All-in-all I&#x27;d say its great if you&#x27;re not hoping to use the balm.  I don&#x27;t think it is very user-friendly, imho.  Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good don&#x27;t get me wrong but it bares a lot of similarities to a highlighter in fact I left it on my desk and my boss was in a rush and used it to higlight some paper work needless to say it worked and now I&#x27;m thinking I could have bought a non-toxic higlighter for less. The balm is crap more like a vaseline stick</li>
    <li> There was too much hype for these products. The lip stain isn&#x27;t that great, but I loved the chapstick part!</li>
    <li> I like the color of Forbidden. I wish it stayed on a bit longer though. The thing that ticked me off, I purchased SEVERAL colors of the Just Bitten stain, and the balm broke off instantly the first time I used each one. I thought Revlon has been around forever, wouldn&#x27;t they know better than to create a balm that sticks way up and can break off easily?! What&#x27;s up with that? Don&#x27;t they test these things before sending them off to the market?</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. Imagine running a pink highlighter over your lips, and you&#x27;ve got the basic idea. You get the color, but it bleeds just enough to require multiple coats, which makes the shade you&#x27;ve chosen remarkably darker than the color displayed on the tube. The balm is does not retract, and in the two times I&#x27;ve used it I can easily see that it would snap it off if you weren&#x27;t extremely careful when putting the cap back on after each use. The \\&quot;stain\\&quot; easily comes off on napkins. It looks ridiculous after about an hour if you don&#x27;t re-apply, and you can then wipe it away completely with very little effort.</li>
    <li> Love this product, no issue with product or delivery</li>
    <li> it dried up really fast - lasted less than a month</li>
    <li> It does its jobs, stains your lips, the lip balm gives them a nice smooth feel with or without the staining.    So why the two star rating?    I bought 3 of these things, and only got one good use of full coverage out of it before the markers dried up. And yes I sealed it back immediately after.    But for the one time I did use each of these 3 different color lip stains they did their job and stayed on all day without rubbing off. Shame thought I had to pay over 20 bucks for something to use one time though.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3PMLG9Z53EC8P]]</li>
    <li> I really love this lip stain.  I get complements on my makeup every time I wear it.  I wanted a crimson lipstick that would last a long time with a matt finish, and the Midnight color is just perfect.  It applies really easily and evenly and it is build-able, so you can adjust the shade until it is as dark as you like.  I haven&#x27;t had any issue with the balm, I think it is really smooth and conditioning and sturdy enough.  The trick to getting the perfect look from this product is to exfoliate your lips before application.  I just scrub my lips with a damp washcloth until they are perfectly smooth, and then the color goes on evenly and easily.  I can put this on early morning and though the color might fade a bit it last me on average 8 - 10 hours.  I my opinion it is a perfect product.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of lipstick, but I usually wear a lot of colored lip gloss. I saw the lipstain product and wanted to try something different. When I opened it all I saw was a marker for your lips and lip balm attached to other end. The product I chose was Just Bitten and color forbidden/interdiction, which was a brownish color.I like the color but when I applied the color I was not impressed. I was not getting enough coverage because not enough color was coming out the tube and it dried too fast. I then applied the lip balm and it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference. Supposedly the balm provides a soft shine, but I didn&#x27;t notice much shine at all. Overall I was disappointed, and I feel this product was not worth the $10 I paid for at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of lip gloss or lipstick. Lip gloss is usually sticky and looses its color quickly. Lipstick is thick and its too made up looking for anything other than a performance or a photo shoot. I previously bought a Just Bitten lip-stain in &amp;#34;Victorian&amp;#34; which is a dark red and loved it. I then wanted a lighter color pink so I bought this color. After applying it on my lips I found it to be a ridiculous shade of magenta bubble gum pink and I felt like I looked like a girl in an 1980&#x27;s video. After a few hours the color faded and I actually liked it a lot. If I wear it again I will apply it a few hours before leaving the house to let the color fade to a softer pink. Yikes!</li>
    <li> Not really a lip stain, although I do like the balm on the opposite side.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this product tastes like rotten oranges, the strip on the back on envelopes and ass. It tastes so bitter when you accidentally lick it you&#x27;ll want to gag. It comes off in a few hours in patches. So you&#x27;ll have dark red on some parts of your lip and none on others. It&#x27;s very weird.</li>
    <li> This is a SCAM. The pen that arrived has no color stain &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; in it whatsoever, and instead has this clear liquid that comes out and smells like a combination of vinegar and chemicals. Also, the balm end also smells heavily of chemicals. Save your money and avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Nothing I expected! Color did not come out like as if it was empty. Very disappointed :/</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it is long stay, and after a year from purchasing it the pen hasn&#x27;t dried yet. i didn&#x27;t like it because as soon as you drink or eat something you will get nasty white circles on the inner part of your mouth. and you have to reapply  from time to time to make sure the color is consistent. this color would be beautiful on pale skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I am now going to buy two more.</li>
