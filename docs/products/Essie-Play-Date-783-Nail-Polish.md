    <li> I bought this polish from Rite Aid the other day, applied it yesterday, and found it was absolutely breathtaking gorgeous.  You know how you see a color in a bottle and think, \\&quot;Hmm, that&#x27;s pretty.\\&quot;  or even \\&quot;Hmm, that&#x27;s okay.\\&quot; but when you paint it on and see it against your own skin - well, that&#x27;s the deciding moment.  And I have to say that Play Date is a jaw dropping color. I have tan/olive skin and this creamy, light purple with slight pinky-rosy undertones (or is it just me?) is the perfect pop of color on sun-kissed skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is among my favorites, ladies, and I can&#x27;t believe for a whole year I passed this up &#x27;til now.  Save yourself the pain of regret:  GET IT GIRL!</li>
    <li> I got this nail color and I love it when I got it I thought it might be broken but it is very well packaged and I love it I would really recommend this to you I will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> This color is SO gorgeous.  I am in love with it for spring/summer and will wear it often.  It&#x27;s bright but not overpowering and has good wear time.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this polish, it is a perfect bright purple, formula was ok, opaque in 2-3 coats.</li>
    <li> Like the color for summer and spring. Cute</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Essie color this season!  The color is just as shown in the image.  The nail polish quality is great and so is the price!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I purchased this polish, I&#x27;ve been looking for this color for so long, it looks great on toes.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical that this color was going to look like an Easter Egg, but then I put it on my nails and fell in love.  The color is beautiful, vibrant and fun.  The polish itself is very smooth.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to be a more purple color and a noticeable one at that. I  do like this color but  I don&#x27;t know if i like it $6 worth</li>
    <li> play date is much prettier than just a pastel purple. i can&#x27;t even explain how much i adore this color. everyone and their grandmother compliments me when i wear it! i love essie because i have real nails, and essie polish chips less frequently on real nails (as opposed to say opi or chanel for example). if you want to try on a funky color that&#x27;s unique- i suggest you buy it!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this color (Playdate) by a coworker. The application and finish is wonderful. So worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love love this color!&lt;br /&gt;True bottle color can get away with 1 coat or 2 love it my nails look like a easter egg. Prefect for the spring!</li>
    <li> very nice color, great price, and it&#x27;s very longlasting :D BUY THIS COLOR IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR A NICE LAVENDAR COLOR</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purple polish. I always get so many compliments on it! It is easy to apply with a very smooth formula. It also dries quickly and does not stain, so it&#x27;s easy to clean up messy spots on your cuticles. It&#x27;s a universally flattering color. Love Play Date!</li>
    <li> My favorite colors are...well, everything depending on my mood, really. But I always seem to end up going back to pink and purple. This particular purple is super fun and it just makes me happy (and no, it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m sniffing the nail polish fumes tho they are fairly unavoidable). It&#x27;s just a great, fun, happy color. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail 2 days after I ordered it! A whole week early! I was very happily surprised. I&#x27;ve worn this color before and I love it! Essie is the best nail polish in my opinion and this color is adorable and fun! The color goes on exactly as shown. And the price is way cheaper here than in stores! Saved about 3 or 4 dollars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really amazing I love the color an everything an it only take 2 coats to be fully opaque it&#x27;s great hope u buy it buy ps it dries really fast</li>
    <li> this color is a great spring color.. a lot of the clients at my school choose this color! it goes on nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> My friend had this colour on her nails and I absolutely fell in love with it, ordering it soon after. It came withing two days (!) and it went on my nails like a dream, I&#x27;ve never used a nail polish like it! I will definitely be ordering more from Essie in the future!</li>
    <li> Love Essie nail polishes and this color is very nice and I find it to be quite unique. It&#x27;s a very light purple but still quite vibrant. I always use 2 coats to get a completely opaque look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color but a bit more transparent than I had expected. Less bold pastel than it looks in bottle</li>
    <li> I love this color.  Used it on toes and on fingers.  I get many compliments.  Perfect Spring Color for me.</li>
    <li> IT IS SUCH A PRETTY COLOR. IT&amp;#34;S JUST BEAUTIFUL! THANK YOU. The color purple is one of my favorites.THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;BLESSINGS.....</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for the Spring! It&#x27;s a perfect balance of dark and light purple that makes this color perfect.  You will need two coats when you use it, but it goes on smoothly and looks great for days!</li>
    <li> Really cute color! Goes on nails very easily and evenly. The color did not chip for a while. I am very pleased with this brand.</li>
    <li> I love it sooo much it works on allllll skin tones shippng was fast and the color was superrr cute!!</li>
    <li> Classic light purple, especially cute for the tootsies!</li>
    <li> A little watery and streaky but it&#x27;s worth it for such a unique color!  I have pale skin and I would say that this would look better on darker skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and the color is beautiful, just as expected. The perfect lilac / lavender shade for spring. I have olive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a good purple that doesn&#x27;t look to gray or make me look washed out but two coats of this one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ll be wearing it non-stop for the next few months! :)</li>
    <li> Love the color, very opaque!</li>
    <li> Like the color. Very pretty. 2 or 3 coats needed.</li>
    <li> Love the color, got here in good time.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! I have a love/hate relationship with Essie because some colors are so sheer! But \\&quot;Play Date\\&quot; is opaque and so gorgeous. I used it to create a fishtail effect nail with a dark blue and Essie \\&quot;Boat House\\&quot; (which is a bit sheer--love/hate).</li>
    <li> Lilac nails are very in right now, and this polish is the perfect color. Its a great summer shade to add to your nail polish collection!!</li>
    <li> Amazingly quick shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is a must have in every girl&#x27;s collection! The most beautiful and unique neon-esque pinky lilac I have ever seen. You need it.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty, energetic, and very spring time color. You have to get it if you like experimenting w/nail polish colors. The quality is standard Essie, goes on well and stays a while.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this color but when it arrived it was everything I didn&#x27;t want! I wanted a bright cute color this is more grandma light purple. But Essie overall will always be the best</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!  A++++++</li>
    <li> I had this color and loved it. I bought it to give as a gift</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COLOR! IT IS BEAUTIFUL PERFECT FOR SUMMER. IT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED! I love it</li>
    <li> Essie products are so good! the polishes are exactly as shown the pictures, and with two coats is perfect! thanks!</li>
    <li> molto bello, lo consiglio a tutte!!!!&lt;br /&gt;velocissimi e precisi nella consegnafdasF, , , , , , , , , ,DAs ,</li>
    <li> Now my favorite spring nail color. Applies very nicely. The color is great. Definitely would recommend this product! Essie is amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this shade of lavender. It&#x27;s bright and beautiful. By far my favorite summer color in the purple family. Going to buy a back up</li>
    <li> The color is still a beautiful lilac which is very in right now, however it is not nearly as bright/vivid as I expected. It&#x27;s more dull and darker. Oh well I&#x27;ll still wear it. Fortunately it might be more work appropriate because it&#x27;s more subtle than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> I like this shade of purple, it is absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this color i have almost purchased this color twice. Easy storage and highly pigmented. Color online is pretty much the same color. Fast shipping. Now seeing these cubes in local store such as Walmart and Target. Check your local store for deals. Also, remember Walmart price matches. Nail color also does not chip even with swimming everyday. It took 2 weeks before my nail policy stared to look worn after swimming everyday and washing dishes. Pretty good considering other nail polishes chip fast. Sorry not a fan of Belisha polish, it&#x27;s too harsh for my nails and weakens my nails as well.</li>
    <li> awesome color that is great for late summer/early fall!</li>
    <li> This Color is absolutley beautiful and perfect for Spring/Summer! I would Defiantly Recommend this Product! (This is My First Essie Nail Polish and I would Defiantly Buy Another One!)</li>
    <li> While the product arrived in a timely fashion, the seller does not sell authentic essie nailpolish. Upon opening the package I realized it was a fake essie nailpolish and didnt even come in the same bottle as the other authentic essie nail polishes I have. I was extremely disappointed and would not reccomended anyone purchase from this seller again unless they are content with receiving cheap, knock off, nailpolish.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color.  Goes on smoothly, vibrant color. I really love this polish.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect. Only need two coats! And for less than I can get it in stores! Buy this nail polish!!</li>
    <li> This is a great color.  I have a dark complexion and this color is absolutely gorgeous.  The formula is standard, nothing wonderful.  It goes on smoothly and stays for about 3 days.</li>
    <li> great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> If you like purple I bet you will love this color, it screams summer time. I already used it and I like It a lot, amazing to enlarge your nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> Out of all the colors in the world pink and purple and the in between are my favorites.  This nail polish color is right there in that spectrum.  I wear this constantly on my toes, I can&#x27;t seem to change the color.  When I look down I can&#x27;t help but smile.  Here is my method (I swear by it!):  I paint with the Essie Protein for my first coat, then 1 coat of Essie Play Date.  I wait until the next morning and paint my 2nd coat of Essie Play Date and then I apply my top coat.  I am set for 2 weeks.  What girl could ask for more?</li>
    <li> This review isn&#x27;t about a specific color, but about Essie in general. This must be the worlds best nail polish, because I can&#x27;t find anything that will compare! Not only are the colors beautiful (and different, mind you!) but this polish LASTS. I&#x27;m the type of girl who likes to change up her nail color often so getting them done at a salon is out of the question. I also can&#x27;t stand the feeling of fake nails on myself, so I needed a good polish for natural nails. That being said, I was also looking for a polish that was highly pigmented with true lasting power. Essie nail polish delivers both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I hate the most in some nail polishes is when applying them it takes 5 or 6 coats to get the color that is shown through the bottle. Thats a waste of product to me. Essie&#x27;s polish looks beautiful with one coat! I always use two coats to make sure it doesn&#x27;t chip, but it still impresses me that the color still looks beautiful with one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the Essie No Chip top coat make the color last for WEEKS without chipping. I&#x27;ve never really gone more than 2 weeks without changing up the color, but it will last without chipping up until the day I change them. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love purple! This color is great. You will need to use 2-3 coats if you want a real purple color. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this color, it is so summer! And the quality is also pretty good! I think i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This color is probably my favorite out of all the Essie polishes I have. It&#x27;s beautiful! I received so many compliments wearing it. It has full coverage in 2 coats, but I always do 3 to ensure evenness. Such a pretty pastel purple. Perfect for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for spring. The quality is really good and even just one coat seemed to work just fine. It goes smooth and colors and fun, playful, flirty. One of my favorite shades. Essie doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things about Essie brand is that it dries pretty quickly. This particular color is thicker than the others, and starts to set FAST. I recommend making sure you have enough on the brush to coat the nail entirely on the first pass. Let it sit a couple minutes before the second coat. If you go back for more without waiting for it to dry a bit, you&#x27;re going to gum up the first coat. As long as you work fast with it though, it&#x27;s a really pretty purple.</li>
    <li> Love THIS COLOR!!!  Love this PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a more solid color when applying it. I tried it last night and the color is so thin, so you would need a special base coat to get the exact color as it shows in the bottle. Not a  huge fan of this color and wish it were more bold. When I applied just one coat, it was too light, so I just took it off and used a completely different color.</li>
    <li> its a more of a pastel color than a bright purple like in the picture but its still a really pretty pastel purple/blue color. love it.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful purple.  I thought it would be a little softer, but it is actually very bright and pretty.  Great formula, full coverage in 2 coats.</li>
