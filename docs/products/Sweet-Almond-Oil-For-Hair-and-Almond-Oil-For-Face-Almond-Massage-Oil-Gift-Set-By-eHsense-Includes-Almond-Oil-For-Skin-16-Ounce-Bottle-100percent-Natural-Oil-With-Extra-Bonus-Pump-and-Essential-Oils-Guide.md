<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My feet and skin are soo  soft, not greasy or sticky! I will purchase this again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It absorbs into my skin quickly with no sticky or oily feeling. Sometimes I put in my bath water but usually use it right after bathing.  I will definitely be ordering more once I go through it,</li>
    <li> Been using it on my face combined with other products. Love the way it soaks in. Time will tell if it works.</li>
    <li> An excellent product for dry skin! I am completely satisfied with the results; especially on my scalp. I have highly recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my body and hair and I love the way it absorbs in my skin and scalp. It makes my skin so silky and smooth. I especially love it cause it&#x27;s all natural. It gets a thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> Like spreading silk on your skin.  Absorbs quickly so that you don&#x27;t feel oily all day.  Nice that it has no scent.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!  I use this oil as a carrier oil for essential oils, as an ingredient in whipped butters, for oil rinses, oil pulling, and oil cleansing.  The vendor lists several uses on the box (below) and some suggestions for using this as a carrier for essential oils (also below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USES: Sensual or therapeutic massage, hair and skin conditioning, soothe skin irritation and improve chapped lips, dark circles, makeup remover, reduce the appearance of winkles, cosmetic base for sugar scrubs and soap making, and much more.  Users suffering from illness, nut allergies or pregnant, consult your physician before use.  Intended for external use only.  Keep out of the reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ESSENTIAL OILS: Lavender for skin care, relaxation, hair growth, bug repellant, eczema treatment, natural cleansing.  Peppermint for oily/acne-prone skin, lip balms, energizing, headache treatment, joint pain treatment, mosquito repellant. Tea tree for healing, dandruff treatment, oily/acne-prone skin, anti-fungal, eczema and yeast infection treatment.  Rosemary for hair care, itchy scalp treatment, oily/acne-prone skin, improved focus and memory, energizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Pure, cold-pressed almond oil.  Made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: HUGE bottle, includes a pump for precise dispensing, comes in an amber bottle, is cold-pressed (the best method for obtaining an unrefined product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying my oil, but when it arrived the pump that was included was broken.  Shipping was fast and other than the pump I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Blends well.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Works wonderful for dry skin and to use along with essential oils!</li>
    <li> I use this for making my own all natural shampoo bars.  So many benefits and is cold pressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for something more natural for my dry skin.  Most products are super thick and it ends up clogging my pores.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for hydration on my face for the last couple of days and so far it&#x27;s absolutely amazing my skin absorbs it without breaking out and the dry skin has not came back.  I  Love that it&#x27;s unscented and feels natural.  I also like the fact that you can keep rubbing it in until the skin has absorbed all of the oil.  This is a huge bottle and it comes with a little card of different oils you can add and its benefits I had no idea this is so versatile.  I also like that it comes with a pump.  This is a great product that I will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product and I could not be any happier. It makes my skin smooth and shows less wrinkles while I am using it. It doesn&#x27;t really have a strong smell, so that is a plus in my opinion. If you are looking for oil for your skin and hair, this is a good one to try.</li>
    <li> Definitely good stuff...I will be reordering this without a doubt!</li>
    <li> I use it for my baby bump stretch marks and also as a face moisturizer. I can tell you that my face looks amazing after using this product. After two days I noticed a decrease in pore size and my skin looks like it&#x27;s glowing! Very even tone and I don&#x27;t even need foundation. It&#x27;s also a great makeup remover</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I expected. It was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Ahhh now I got those summer sleek looking healthy skin legs. I have been using this on my legs to get rid of that dry alligator scaly skin on my legs since I got this. They feel so smooth and look so nourished and hydrated. They are smooth and soft. I am not embarrassed to show my legs when I wear shorts or a skirt. I use this as soon as im out of the shower. Also I have to note it didn&#x27;t leak a single drop during shipping. I didn&#x27;t use this on any other part of my body as I wanted to put it to the test per say. Well it sure has NOT let me down in anyway.&lt;br /&gt; I really love this am I&#x27;m so grateful I was able to get this for a discount for my feed back.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy for fighting off that dry winter skin and for having nice hydrated healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a face moisturizer and really like how it softens my skin.</li>
    <li> Like silk for your skin.  Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily.  Nice that it is not scented.</li>
    <li> Almond oil is so amazing for skin and hair and this oil is probably my favorite almond oil of the oils I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a fantastic quality and I was so pleasantly surprised at it came with a pump to make using it even easier! This oil has the perfect texture and consistency - not too thick or oily or anything. Overall this is just such a wonderful product that I would really reccomend!</li>
    <li> My mom loves it, says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever used, and exactly what she had been looking for. Now my sister wants to place an order after trying it. I put some on as well, i have very dry  skin and it&#x27;s the best solution i&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for moisturizing dry skin. I was given this product as a gift and I am glad to say as a facial moisturizer it works great for before you go to bed. It goes on smoothly and feels great on the skin. I have heard of all the benefits it provides, with continued use. The product is well packaged, I love the added pump, and I received great customer service. I would recommend this product for use.</li>
    <li> OK, so I bought this for my wife. I did my research and happened on this product. What helped to make things awesome was the response and interaction of the seller. She ( I am assuming it&#x27;s a she) responded the same day to my inquiries and seemed very sincere and genuine. My wife was pretty stoked to receive it and loves it! She uses it for a body lotion as well as a &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil or base oil for her essential oils. Personally, I love the attention to detail this company put into their product...marketing etc. The product works as it goes on pretty darn light; almost like water!</li>
    <li> Now this is an awesome product, I absolutely love to use this sweet almond oil for my skin and also putting it in my hair for a nice deep conditioning treatment. This is unscented, however, it really does have the illusion that it is almond oil which I absolutely love. This product comes with a cap, you can use to squeeze out the amount you&#x27;d like, or it also comes with a pump. I opted to use it with the pump. After my shower, I love to put this on and my skin glistens and looks so very radiant. I do not feel greasy at all, just very hydrated and my skin definitely appreciates it very much. The bottle is a very good size, I can imagine that this will last a good few months or maybe even longer. I am very impressed with this almond oil and would recommend this to anyone. I can definitely see this being a life saver during the winter months. I did receive this product at discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks but I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave me with that oily, greasy feeling. I use it around my eyes and my daughter uses it on her hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but love using it on my skin.  It&#x27;s not oily, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin so soft.  A great moisturizer for my very dry skin!  I plan on using it for my hair as well.  I&#x27;m sure I will be equally as satisfied.  There is no scent but that is fine with me.  Love the bonus pump.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My wife loves it. It absorbs very well and does not leave a film like other oils.Delivery was very fast. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil! My skin feels so soft and smooth. This sweet oil is like magic it stopped me from my itchness. Not only do I know glow I feel sexy silky and smooth. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product at an amazing price... Review over! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of most things containing almonds. So when I was asked to give this Almond Oil a try, it was an easy yes for me. And I am so glad I did...this stuff is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;This oil is light on the skin and has very little if any scent at all. I was hoping for more scent as I like the the way almonds smell but I don&#x27;t notice any scent in this product. And yes, when using it with essential oils as a carrier, you would want little or no scent to compete with the added oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my favorite was to use it is just as a lotion in the kitchen. Just a drop is all that is needed after washing my hands. It absorbs completely and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other ways I have used this oil do include as a carrier for my essential oils, a scalp massage and a couple of times in cooking (added it to pasta to keep from sticking). I imagine there are so many other uses for this oil and it will be one that I keep in stock from now on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I just start using this because of my dark circle :&#x27;( lemme see if it works&lt;br /&gt;Thx! I like big size tho and thanks for pump cap</li>
    <li> This is a great oil helps so much with my dry skin..but also a great carrier oil to use with my essential oil for my lotions and soaps I make..love the pump that came with it and the size was great..will order again..great product..</li>
    <li> So this is my first time purchasing sweet almond oil, so I cannot really compare it to any other brands. So far I&#x27;ve been using it straight from the bottle and it has been working. Things I liked about the product are:&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle is sealed so it does not leak during shipping , which I&#x27;ve seen is an issue with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;- The product comes with a pump add-on, which I like better than just pouring the oil onto my hand.&lt;br /&gt;- The product definitely moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;- Has very little odor. I can&#x27;t smell it unless I hold it up to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not as thrilled about is:&lt;br /&gt;- The feeling of the oil if you put it on straight dry skin feels a little strange. It&#x27;s a sort of sticky feeling. However putting the oil in after showering seems to make the oil feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;- The fact that the oil feels really oily at first when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!! Makes my skin so soft!!! I like that the pump came with it also. Very easy to dispense that way! Highly recommend purchasing!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, as described, all natural moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good for Seborrheic Dermatitis.  Excellent Almond Oil.  I have used a lot of oils, and this tops everything else I have used.  It sinks into the skin easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy and yucky.</li>
    <li> It came in perfect conditions. I use it to clean eye makeup!</li>
    <li> This product is great! Was looking for something light for my scalp &amp; hair.  The oil is very light and has no smell, which I like greatly.  I give it 5 stars and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I personally bought this for my face. I heard that almond oil is great for oily-acne prone skin. I have not tried other sweet almond oil, but when I put this on my face, it feels thick, sticky, and heavy. Compared to rosehip, grapeseed, and jojoba oil, this one is my least favorite. After two uses, I knew I couldn&#x27;t use this anymore or I&#x27;d risk breaking out even more. Now I have this big bottle of sweet almond oil I don&#x27;t know what to do with. I hear that this is great for hair, and tried it as well, but my hair came away VERY greasy when it put it in.  So my only use for this oil is as a body lotion. I feel like the oil is too thick and potent for anything else. As for scent, there is no scent whatsoever, so as a base oil for other essential oils, it is great.  EDIT: After using it as a body lotion instead, I&#x27;ve changed it from a 2 star to a 4 star. As a body lotion, I do love how it hydrates the skin without feeling overly greasy. I do caution though, that if you&#x27;re looking for a face oil, try jojoba, grape seed, or rosehip instead.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, not too heavy for use on the &amp;#34;every dry&amp;#34;  throat area and without added scent............. At 16 oz it&#x27;s a great price.   I have ordered this for a second time as a gift for a friend. It&#x27;s wonderful for dry winter skin my friend loves it too.</li>
    <li> Perfection for your complexion!</li>
    <li> I like it smells great</li>
