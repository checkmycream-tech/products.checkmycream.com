      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>this works amazing, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fantastic to</li>
      <li>Clean, shiny hair.</li>
      <li>It feels like a menthol - cool on your scalp likewise the scent.</li>

      <li>This really is scalp therapy : )  </li>
      <li>My new favorite for conditioner.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair feel silky and fresh.</li>
      <li>so I feel like something useful is happening.</li>
      <li>very moisturizing, Good for dry, super itchy, flaky scalp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make your hair soft and smooth (its ok for me as long as I&#x27;m dandruff free)</li>
      <li>Also helps with dry scalp issues as well and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Gives my scalp a nice cooling sensation when applying and helps stave off itchy, dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used tea tree for ages for its scalp-moisturizing properties and it really works!</li>
      <li>However, it will not make your hair soft and smooth</li>
      <li>This particular conditioner is the only one I like to use because it does such a good job.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t make those issues go away, but certainly is gentle and very cleansing.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to help treat my dandruff, used in conjunction with dandruff shampoos (rotating coal tar, salicylic acid, and nizoral), but I don&#x27;t think it made much difference, and it made my showers take longer since I had to let the shampoo sit for five minutes</li>
      <li>Really helps my psorasis</li>
      <li>Also I really dislike menthol in shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>So basicly, it depends on how much you are going to use it -</li>
      <li>I use Tresemme leave - in conditioner to make my hair soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  </li>
      <li>But after I blow dry it it seems very oily especially at the back of my head</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp with lots of dry skin issues.  </li>
      <li>I love the OGX series, but this particular one was disappointing.</li>
      <li>The Scalp Therapy Australian TeaTree conditioner really does condition my hair without weighing it down.</li>

    <li> This really is scalp therapy : )  Really helps my psorasis</li>
    <li> Pretty good. The only one Wal.art doesn&#x27;t carry of that brand.</li>
    <li> Made my dandruff worse.</li>
    <li> great product for my itchy scalp</li>
    <li> best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, great for my scalp</li>
    <li> Great product....we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  This one really conditions nicely, even for curly hair! :)</li>
    <li> cant go wrong with a well matched ogx product :)</li>
    <li> The Scalp Therapy Australian TeaTree conditioner really does condition my hair without weighing it down. This particular conditioner is the only one I like to use because it does such a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help treat my dandruff, used in conjunction with dandruff shampoos (rotating coal tar, salicylic acid, and nizoral), but I don&#x27;t think it made much difference, and it made my showers take longer since I had to let the shampoo sit for five minutes AND then let the conditioner sit for a few minutes. Also I really dislike menthol in shampoo/conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t have beneficial properties, it just makes my scalp tingle so I feel like something useful is happening. Spare me. Finally, this conditioner is very thick, which means I either have to use a ton for my long, thick hair (expensive) or dilute it (a nuisance).</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this Australian product would be better than others, but it is a disappointment as well. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this with the shampoo and LOVE the results! I color my hair and love that it doesn&#x27;t strip or cause problems. My hair looked great with the first use. Now, after a month I can say my hair looks shinier and healthier than it&#x27;s looked in years. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Clean, shiny hair. No sulfates or parabens</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo and conditioner.  My hair has never looked so wonderful after showering.  I use minimal hair products and using this helps to not look it.  I have a very sensitive scalp with lots of dry skin issues.  This doesn&#x27;t make those issues go away, but certainly is gentle and very cleansing.  My scalp is naturally very dry and itchy, this helps but I still have to use other lotions on my scalp to keep things moisurized, however much less in comparison to other products.  Has a nice organic light scent.  I have thick curly hair, and it really loves this stuff.  My curls have never looked better.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the scalp or leave it itchy. It doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair. We like these products, conditioner and shampoo, in our household.</li>
    <li> Best thing that helps with my dandruff!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff but get it through Walmart mail order @ 13 oz for $5.74.</li>
    <li> so it&#x27;s fantastic to me.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of my hairs don&#x27;t disappear anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Because my scalf is so healthy thanks to this item.</li>
    <li> It took me more than a month to fully review this product and it is really great for a flaky/dry and itchy scalp. I started to notice that I was having white flakes on my scalp and it is so itchy! I immediately went online to buy the best anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner, I even search for home remedies. I came across this - I bought this base on the reviews and gave it a try and this works amazing, very moisturizing. It feels like a menthol - cool on your scalp likewise the scent. However, it will not make your hair soft and smooth ok - it serves its purpose to MOISTURIZE YOUR SCALP. I use it every day after I use Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo (this works great as well) - leave for 5 minutes and rinse, btw I mix a good amount of it with 1/4 cup water  like I would always do with my other conditioner because my hair is so thick and long. I purchased it mmm, 3rd wk of november 2014 and I can tell that I only have 3-4 usage left. So basicly, it depends on how much you are going to use it - I use approximately 2 tablespoon and mix with 1/4 cup water. For almost 2 months now, I am dandruff free! My scalp is not itchy and flaky anymore! I use Tresemme leave - in conditioner to make my hair soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: very moisturizing, Good for dry, super itchy, flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Not available anywhere else but Amazon. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair soft and smooth (its ok for me as long as I&#x27;m dandruff free)</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner to help with my dry scalp. The issue seems to be that it leaves the rest of my hair feeling a bit oily. I am VERY good at making sure to rinse it all out - and then rinse it again. But after I blow dry it it seems very oily especially at the back of my head</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel silky and fresh. Also helps with dry scalp issues as well and smells amazing. I will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I had terribly dry and itchy scalp due to the brutal heat of the midwest in summer time.  I use this once or twice a week and it has relieved the itching!</li>
    <li> I love the OGX series, but this particular one was disappointing. It really dried my hair out and made it brittle. Will not purchase this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Gives my scalp a nice cooling sensation when applying and helps stave off itchy, dry scalp. It also smells amazing! My new favorite for conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells very authentic. Literally makes your eyes sting with the mentholated tingle. I love this product! It&#x27;s very refreshing!! I&#x27;ve used tea tree for ages for its scalp-moisturizing properties and it really works!</li>
