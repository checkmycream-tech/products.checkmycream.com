      <li>AMAZING ....</li>
      <li>AMAZING.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
      <li>Six years ago an enthusiastic cosmetician over plucked my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>As a matter of fact my brows haven&#x27;t looked this nice in years.  </li>
      <li>I know they are because I see the a new gray one every once in a while and as much as I am happy to have brows again, I don&#x27;t want the gray ones!</li>
      <li>i have fair skin and light eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>I thought the consistancy would be more a a gel</li>
      <li>After that it&#x27;s more of a maintenance thing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and am amazed by how much better my brows look.</li>
      <li>They seem fuller, darker -- and I look so much better.</li>
      <li>And their sister product for eyelashes does an even better job on lashes.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>Chemotherapy, menopause and age have made most of my eyebrow disappear.  </li>
      <li>so they look better</li>
      <li>took a chance on this product and glad I did.</li>
      <li>My brows started to fill in after a month and it keeps getting better.</li>
      <li>This stuff worked like magic for me.</li>
      <li>which gives her face much more expression.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did...</li>
      <li>I will continue to apply in the more sparse areas because they are still growing...</li>
      <li>My brows are full and really, I have to say - gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I am guessing that it will take the full four to six weeks for me to see full benefits from this product, but I am off to a good start.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy so far.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Product was easy to use with no side effects noted.</li>
      <li>I have used for years and with periodic use after first treatment, you can have nice full brows!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why the newer hairs seem to come in darker, but I&#x27;m fine with it.  </li>
      <li>I am amazed at how fast and effective it is.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived promptly and was securely packaged.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B009P4RQ9U Revita Brow Advanced Eyebrow Conditioner</li>
      <li>My brows have filled in since I started using the product.</li>
      <li>It would have been great if she had apologized, but instead she made up some excuse about the need to fit five sizes of eyebrows across the brow.  </li>
      <li>I will forever use this stuff because I love it so much!</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth every penny!</li>
      <li>well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Well, let me just say that for ME, this product is working amazingly well, and far beyond any expectations I had!  </li>
      <li>If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it, right?!</li>
      <li>Now I have a full eyebrow...</li>
      <li>The areas that need to grow back area still mostly patchy, but I can see steady improvement with more and more hairs in those areas.</li>
      <li>this stuff first before using Latisse because of side effects with Latisse!</li>
      <li>such an inexpensive venture with amazing results.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows were thin and patchy, now they look great!  </li>
      <li>I suffered from trich (TTM) in the past - or I guess I should be more honest ....</li>
      <li>A friend of mine who has beautiful, thick brows, suggested this product and said it worked wonders.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered my second bottle &amp; am excited about how full my brows will look this summer &amp; forward!  </li>
      <li>If you use it TWICE a day, like I did for the first 3 weeks, it works super fast.  </li>
      <li>Have acquired alopecia in my eyebrow only and found this product was successful in helping to bring back my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>A very costly accident!</li>
      <li>I used it morning and night in the first month and then once a day after that.</li>
      <li>be consistent and use it every night.</li>
      <li>I recommend to start with Sally beauty brow products first.  </li>
      <li>Be consistent each night with the application.  </li>
      <li>Would order it again in the future and buy more than one.</li>
      <li>Pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I REALLY recommend this stuff!</li>
      <li>This works for both eyebrows and eyelashes, and makes them THICKER, LONGER and DARKER, FAST!  </li>
      <li>I HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS FOR A REVIEW,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My eyebrows, which were thinning, have totally grown back and look as healthy and full as when I was 20</li>
      <li>(let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m about 30 years older than that now!)</li>
      <li>Being a brunette, it was very noticeable.  </li>
      <li>my eyebrows are much thicker and seem darker</li>
      <li>and, now, they are defined and much darker...</li>
      <li>This stuff really does make your brows fuller.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a month and can really see a difference.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,  Jean Lee</li>
      <li>It took about a month to really see the results.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not making my brows more dense.  </li>
      <li>Also the applicator on this product is superior to the tiny skinny hair brush used on the other product.</li>
      <li>Well, like so many other reviews, revitabrow really did work for me.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this project as the price was more reasonable than another product (which I had purchased previously with decent results).  </li>
      <li>Soon I&#x27;ll be back to the full eyebrows I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My eyebrows are coming back in after years of plucking!  Be patient ...it takes about 4 weeks until you see new growth appearing.  Be consistent each night with the application.  You will be pleased!</li>
    <li> My brows have always been thin, they have a great full shape, the hair is dark, but they you can always see skin through hairs meaning i needed to fill in with maker up.  A year ago, i had a bad wax job, leaving them miss shaped and thin.  I have been growing back for 9 months with very slow progress.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using  revitabrow for two weeks and my brows are already looking darker and fuller. The areas that need to grow back area still mostly patchy, but I can see steady improvement with more and more hairs in those areas. The hairs I do have seem longer or thicker, so my brows seem overall fuller. I am guessing that it will take the full four to six weeks for me to see full benefits from this product, but I am off to a good start.</li>
    <li> It works, but still pricey.  Always hold the open container upright and be sure to close tightly, it can spill.</li>
    <li> I have used anastasia brow serum and it didn&#x27;t compare to this.  The volume has literally doubled! I will continue using this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have been using product for six weeks and am starting to get growth back&lt;br /&gt;where I lost it due to eye surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Try this stuff first before using Latisse because of side effects with Latisse!</li>
    <li> This brow conditioner is so simple to use! Just swipe across the brows after cleansing. After few weeks I can tell My brows are fuller and darker, a plus for me. This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> So, I was all ready to be super skeptical about this product.  I mean, if you overpluck or have thinning eyebrows, who knew you could grow them back so easily?  Well, let me just say that for ME, this product is working amazingly well, and far beyond any expectations I had!  My eyebrows, which were thinning, have totally grown back and look as healthy and full as when I was 20 (let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m about 30 years older than that now!) ... I also cheated and put some along the lines of my eyelashes, upper and lower, and WOW, it works there too!  My eyelashes were always good, but now they are fuller, thicker, noticeably longer, and for some reason, even BLACKER than they were before.  Don&#x27;t know why the newer hairs seem to come in darker, but I&#x27;m fine with it.  I&#x27;m a brunette anyway and the sun will lighten them up in time.  My recommendation is, TRY this.  I had to use about half the tube (took maybe 3 weeks or so) to see results, but of course anything that really works takes TIME.  I&#x27;m on my second tube now and I have backed off to using it once every other day, to save money on it.  If you use it TWICE a day, like I did for the first 3 weeks, it works super fast.  After that it&#x27;s more of a maintenance thing.  Final comment:  This works for both eyebrows and eyelashes, and makes them THICKER, LONGER and DARKER, FAST!  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Have acquired alopecia in my eyebrow only and found this product was successful in helping to bring back my eyebrows. Ran out and went on line and found another product with better reviews for less money. The other product did not work for me and now I&#x27;m back to using this one trying to recoup the brows I lost from replacing Revita Brow. Hopefully I will see the results it first gave me and should not have ever left. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it, right?! Also the applicator on this product is superior to the tiny skinny hair brush used on the other product. I will come back and give it 5 stars IF I get my brows back.</li>
    <li> Six years ago an enthusiastic cosmetician over plucked my eyebrows.  It would have been great if she had apologized, but instead she made up some excuse about the need to fit five sizes of eyebrows across the brow.  I&#x27;ve never heard of this, and I know no one else has.  I&#x27;ve searched YouTube for advice on shaping your brow and they all say you use the eyes and nose as points of reference.  But enough of that...I&#x27;ve tried everything in the book, all sorts of products.  Some worked, some didn&#x27;t.  Then I tried this.  I&#x27;ve tried the Revita Lash and it worked, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this product worked on my eyebrows.  I was very happy an the new cosmetician who does my eyebrows was shocked.  Soon I&#x27;ll be back to the full eyebrows I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only thing I noticed with this product is that it turned my eyebrows black. Not good for someone with blonde to light brown eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this my eyelashes were falling out and thining even mascara did not make a differnence! I started using these and everyone thinks I am wearing fake lashes they are so long, thick and healthy. Far exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite some time and my brows look great. It will last a long time, so go for it.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for 3 weeks, but think it is working.  It is supposed to take a few months, but I can already see some improvement.</li>
    <li> Already noticing thicker brows - I was really skeptical but it seems to work.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Have only been using the product for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t notice anything happening in the eyebrow area yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for, perhaps, two weeks and, already, my brows appear darker...and seem to be extending at one end where the left one had gotten quite sparse. A dramatic difference is seen in my neighbor and friend who has been using it for a longer period...She had very pale brows and, now, they are defined and much darker...which gives her face much more expression. This product WORKS!</li>
    <li> Sorry, I was hoping for better results, but I have had no new growth of my eyebrows. I have used it everyday like the instructions state.  I wouldn&#x27;t wait your money on this product - expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work at all for me :-(&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I wish I had taken before shots.  My eyebrows were thin and patchy, now they look great!  It takes several weeks as other posts have said but it does work.  So happy I took the risk and purchased it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and was securely packaged. This excellent product should be used consistently every day for good results.  It works well!</li>
    <li> Chemotherapy, menopause and age have made most of my eyebrow disappear.  After using this product for a few weeks, I have eyebrows!  This product is an essential part of my daily routine now.  I would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product sometime last year and was amazed with its results!  Nice brown brows at 65!  But the new wand does not seem to be yielding the same results. Or any results from what I can tell after about a month of use.</li>
    <li> You will see results in approx 4-6 weeks but they last!!  I have used for years and with periodic use after first treatment, you can have nice full brows!</li>
    <li> Great stuff,  my eyebrows were REALLY thin, sparse and short.  I just had a little bunch then I had to pencil in the rest.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for several months and what a difference.  My brows are thick, filling in all the empty spots.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gave me long eyelashes in weeks. I gets tons of compliments and don&#x27;t have to wear mascara everyday. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> After used this product for a month, my eyebrow has increased the density. I&#x27;m on 2nd bottles. I had introduced this product to my friends. They loved it because they got the good result. Very satisfied and happy customers. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT. SHE HAS USED IT BEFORE WITH GREAT RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;IF I HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS FOR A REVIEW,&lt;br /&gt;I WILL PROBABLY STOP WRITING POSITIVE REVIEWS AND STICK TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS&lt;br /&gt;WHEN NEEDED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and am amazed by how much better my brows look. They seem fuller, darker -- and I look so much better. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but no more.  This stuff really does make your brows fuller.  And their sister product for eyelashes does an even better job on lashes.  Very effective products––both of them––and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> So far, I have seen no difference and I have used it as directed.  Will continue using it until product is completing used.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do a thing! It doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look darker, it doesnt make them grow, and i dont see a difference after using it for a month! I thought the consistancy would be more a a gel but when I accidently tipped the open bottle over, the contents spilled out in a clear liquid form. I payed $64.10 of my hard earned money for nothing. I do not recommend this product and will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> I continue to use this product on my eyebrows every evening, and have yet to see ANY changes - either new hair growth, or darkening of my eyebrows.  I would not recommend spending the money on this product!  I am truly disappointed in the product, especially for the amount of money I paid for it.  Save your money and don&#x27;t believe false claims!</li>
    <li> I purchased this project as the price was more reasonable than another product (which I had purchased previously with decent results).  I decided to give this product a try to save a little money.  I&#x27;m disapppointed.  After over four weeks, I see very minimal new growth.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B009P4RQ9U Revita Brow Advanced Eyebrow Conditioner 3.0ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 weeks now &amp; my brows have grown so much that I can hardly believe it! I just ordered my second bottle &amp; am excited about how full my brows will look this summer &amp; forward!  I use Revita Brow once daily at night as directed, it really</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and over plucked when I was younger and had very thin and odd shaped brows because of it. Glad to say, this works! I now have normal shaped brows but I will say the areas that had nothing are still not as full as the areas that I still had some brows left. I will continue to apply in the more sparse areas because they are still growing...I know they are because I see the a new gray one every once in a while and as much as I am happy to have brows again, I don&#x27;t want the gray ones!</li>
    <li> After about five or six weeks the sparse areas of my eyebrows began to fill in.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent results. You do need to keep on using it in order to maintain the new growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Revita Brow conditioner for about three months now...my eyebrows are much thicker and seem darker (probably d/t the increase in number of brow hairs). I have recommended this product to several women I know.&lt;br /&gt;Service was excellent!</li>
    <li> I suffered from trich (TTM) in the past - or I guess I should be more honest .... I still have issues with it - all I know is that everything that I tried before (Oils, Vitamins, Vasaline, etc..) is absolute crap compared to this!! I had no eyebrows ... and by no eyebrows I mean I looked like I was undergoing chemotherapy (I bet this would also work for that!!) - and now, after about a month, they are completely back. In fact, I believe it was 2 weeks after I started using it every night that they were growing like crazy! I will buy it over and over again... I have full brows even though I still occasionally have outbursts of TTM. AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for about three weeks.  So far I have seen no results.  I am still going to keep using it until it is finished in hopes that it will work.  I bought this product based on the reviews, but at this point, it has not worked for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this brow conditioner. After washing my face, I opened the package to find a very tiny tube..very little product in a large box. I withdrew a dry wand with no product!  This is very expensive....just wish there was some product to use. Will return this and send a complaint letter to Revita. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The results of using Revita Brow conditioner were as advertised, i.e., new eyebrow growth.  Product was easy to use with no side effects noted.</li>
    <li> I am 59 and starting losing hair from my eyebrows.  The hair loss started from the outside of the brows and over about 6 months I had almost no hair on the brow line from about the middle out. Being a brunette, it was very noticeable.  I try not to let the negative side to aging get to me, but this was very disturbing.  Well, like so many other reviews, revitabrow really did work for me.  I used it faithfully once a day at bedtime and I started noticing at about week 4 what looked like some sparse hairs growing in.  But by week 6 the change was dramatic.  At week 8, I have full, thick. dark brows again. As a matter of fact my brows haven&#x27;t looked this nice in years.  Love, love, love this product.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My brows have filled in since I started using the product. I expected that the color might have gotten darker as well.</li>
    <li> After using this product once a day for only 2 weeks the tube is dried out.&lt;br /&gt;$56.00 and there is no liquid left after such a short time. The wand and the&lt;br /&gt;tube are totally dry. Buyer beware of buying cosmetics through other places&lt;br /&gt;than the company who manufactures it.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m half Asian and had the thinnest, lightest eyebrows. I seriously had my doubts about this product because well, all my life I couldn&#x27;t imagine myself with real eyebrows. Lol boy was I wrong! This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;m like a walking advertisement for it now! I have to constantly trim and tweeze my eye brows because the hairs are thick and long! Whatever is in this stuff is like gold! I will forever use this stuff because I love it so much! It took about a month to really see the results. Each tube lasts me about 2 months. I used it morning and night in the first month and then once a day after that. I REALLY recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> i have fair skin and light eyebrows.  darkened them a little and made them much fuller.  be consistent and use it every night.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Was very pleased with the results after using it for 3 weeks. Will definatley by again and again.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product.  I was seeing my brows get thinner and thinner.  I have been using Revita Brow for about 6 weeks and my brows are back to their normal state...full and thick.  I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> I have over plucked for years.  My right eyebrow isn&#x27;t too bad, but my left is really bare.  In a week of using this product only once a day, I&#x27;m seeing fuller eyebrows.  No irritation at all.  I&#x27;m happy so far.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to find out if this product would work. I applied it once on my eyebrows and I had redness the following morning, elevated skin on my eyebrow areas.  As far as I know I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, my skin is not sensitive, unfortunately this product caused allergic reaction on me.  If you&#x27;re trying out new products for eyebrow growth serum I recommend to start with Sally beauty brow products first.  Their prices ranges from $7-$30, &amp; I&#x27;ve heard great reviews.  I&#x27;m disappointed  &amp; I can&#x27;t get a refund! Total purchase $75</li>
    <li> My eyebrows from the ends started growing and i haven&#x27;t had eyebrows in those spots for years:)&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day in the nights after washing my face.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!!!!! I had cancer and lost my brows... really grows them back. Woukd recommend this product for people who want to grow back their hair</li>
    <li> well i been using this product for 2 weeks have not seen any result for something that cost 57 dollar its not really much in bottle maybe like a half and not very affected im disappointed because i tho its will really work but dont belive what u see on tv but im still use just to see what happens</li>
    <li> I like this product and the applicator which it comes with.  Would order it again in the future and buy more than one.</li>
    <li> Not that I hate it- it just has no effect whatsoever.  It is not comparable to Latisse which actually does regrow eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It took about a month of nightly application before I saw any noticeable improvement, but just when I was on the verge of feeling like I&#x27;d been duped, - Voom! I have thick dark brows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that anything would regrow my eyebrows and I would have been satisfied with a small improvement, but the results were dramatic. The odd thing was this change happened, not gradually, but all at once within a few days. Pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier with the result. I&#x27;m 62 and my brows had thinned to the point where they were patchy and the \\&quot;tail\\&quot; was gone. Revitabrow not only filled in the thin spots, but restored the ends, color and shape. I thought my eyebrows were goners and had even considered tattooing before I found this product. It is amazing how well it has worked for me. I don&#x27;t even need pencil or gel or any sort of brow makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always took my eyebrows for granted until they began to disappear. This stuff worked like magic for me. Stick with it and don&#x27;t be discouraged if it takes a few weeks before you see the results. My brows are full and really, I have to say - gorgeous!</li>
    <li> after two weeks my brows are growing in and darker than ever!!!!!! took a chance on this product and glad I did. such an inexpensive venture with amazing results. I had an appt with a permanent cosmetic artist and cancelled it due to the results. And my patches are growing in day by day. now searching for the perfect brow waxer.</li>
    <li> I was missing hair in my eyebrows for 10 years now.  About 5 years ago I decided to tattoo my eyebrows, I really didn&#x27;t want to do that because I think it looks horrible, but I had no choice, at least that&#x27;s what I thought.... About 2 months ago, I visited a dermatologist who told me about Revitabrow.  I was very skeptical about it, but I decided to buy it anyways.... I am so glad I did... after the 2nd week, I started to notice little tiny hair in my eyebrow where I had no hair before... Now I have a full eyebrow... I am now getting ready to buy another ones just to make sure I help those little hairs that haven&#x27;t fully grown to grow fully!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING ....I didn&#x27;t think it was possible but this product really works. My brows started to fill in after a month and it keeps getting better. My makeup artist was totally impressed!</li>
    <li> Says plainly on package that it won&#x27;t make your brows grow.  I feel like maybe it conditions them a little so they look better but it&#x27;s certainly not making my brows more dense.  I tried based on other&#x27;s recommendations on amazon . . . . I&#x27;ll use until it is gone but I don&#x27;t think the benefit for me equates to the cost.</li>
    <li> I have thyroid problems and my eyebrows were falling out.  I have been using this product for about a month and can really see a difference.  I&#x27;m thrilled and will probably order more!  Thanks,  Jean Lee</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were thinning due to a hydrogen peroxide serum I was putting on my face (which got on my brows), and from various eyebrow ladies threading them too thin.  A friend of mine who has beautiful, thick brows, suggested this product and said it worked wonders.  I was skeptical but bought it, used it twice a day and after one week, saw results!  I am on week 3 now and I no longer need to pencil in my eyebrows.  I am amazed at how fast and effective it is.  It was definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product caused an allergic reaction.  The skin in the brow area got very dry and flaked and even bled in one place.  I do not have sensitive skin, so I was very surprised by the reaction.</li>
    <li> The product itself is easy to use.  However, it is very expensive and so slow to work that you can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s working. I have been using it for about a month and I think I may see a little improvement in my brows but I&#x27;m not sure.  I was shocked to find that when I accidently tipped it, while I had the wand out, about half of the fluid spilled out of the tube. It never occurred to me that the product was that thin or that there is no mechanism to keep it from spilling out.  A very costly accident!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a solid two weeks and seen absolutely no growth!!!  It actually made my brows greaser even when I didn&#x27;t have it on, which made it difficult to apple my eyebrow shadow and pencil.</li>
    <li> Due to stress or too much threading, my eyebrows had become sparse and thin.  I could completely tell the difference when I began using this stuff!  It was great.  I no longer need to fill them in with pencil!  Highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to thicken up your eyebrows.</li>
