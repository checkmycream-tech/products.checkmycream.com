      <li>Well, nice try GREEDY Mitchum.</li>
      <li>What kind of racket is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great deodorant that really works!!!</li>
      <li>Buying the six pack with membership in amazon prime (which gives free shipping) with a subscription to this item (which gives a significant discount) makes the amazon price on this item awesome.  </li>
      <li>Great product and really great in blocking perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;I tried other products but non as good as this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sport smell is fairly mild, but pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Always known about mitchum man great powerful deorderant, what i liked most is that i recieved this quick and on a Sunday</li>
      <li>There are many others on the market of that</li>
      <li>My Favorite deodorant...</li>
      <li>Otherwise, love it.</li>
      <li>Mitchum makes a great product at a reasonable price, work just as well as any of those clinical strength deodorants.</li>
      <li>I re-ordered 3 more packs.</li>
      <li>I am looking for a worthwhile alternative, if anyone can make a suggestion?  </li>
      <li>I never sweat or smell from using it, and it has a nice light scent.  </li>
      <li>Sure it prevents body odor, but if the gel comes into contact with any fabric  it&#x27;ll bleach that area where it came into contact.</li>
      <li>an added bonus the ladies tell me they love the sporty scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit harsher and more &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; than I prefer, but nothing that will scare anyone off.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have used Mitchum for many years.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I used to love this product.</li>
      <li>Always my favorite.</li>
      <li>Of course I personally think this is the best product in its class.  </li>
      <li>but you would be better off with the clinical strength anyway.</li>
      <li>works and better than going to the store</li>
      <li>The best deodorant for a teenage son who runs track and cross-country .</li>
      <li>I love amazon subscription service, I hope they dont ever stop offering it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so well I no longer have to shower more than once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, by morning the stench of b.o. coming off my hairy pits is overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Mitchum is a very good deodorant -- in fact, it&#x27;s the only my husband will use after trying many kinds.</li>
      <li>but I am sure it will be fine.</li>
      <li>Good luck telling how much you are using now.  </li>
      <li>Amazon makes it easy.</li>
      <li>If you take another shower in the morning,like I do,it is fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking huge globs of liquid deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Works better than expected, smells great.</li>
      <li>Not like the prior formula that was available in May, which was great.  </li>
      <li>Yeah its cheap</li>
      <li>But this was such a great deal, that we ordered a lot.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But, never paid this cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a few containers and am very happy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of their different &amp;#34;Gels&amp;#34; over the years, I haven&#x27;t been too picky.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference with this one.  Goes on easy, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue all over me and my shirts.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the &amp;#34;flavored&amp;#34; varieties but this version has a very faint smell.  I fail to see what difference sixteen holes makes over four slots, the stuff goes on the same.  I compared two different gel versions that I have (one with sixteen, one with four holes) and I can&#x27;t see, smell or feel a significant difference.  I have to laugh at all the people who complain the stuff is runny, leaks, leaves a sticky mess, too much comes out or is not very solid.  That is user error.  If you wanted a solid you should probably not buy a product labeled &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34;.  The cap makes a very good tight seal, something that is very useful when you throw one into an overnight bag.  When you take the cap off the suction draws out whatever is close to the surface.  You, the user, control that.  The first time you opened the applicator you had to turn the applicator screw a couple of times before anything came out, you should also have the common sense to turn the screw back a turn or two before you put the cap back on.</li>
    <li> Mitchem has always been the number one effective deodorant and antiperspirant for my family, and we sweat - not perspire. this is a man&#x27;s version with a clean sport scent. It just works. Period. The subscribe and save option brings the price down to about what I&#x27;d pay at the store, maybe less, plus there is no tax or S&amp;H that way, and we never run out. Win - win scenario.</li>
    <li> This new formula is worthless!  I had to place it in the garbage because if I had thrown it, the lousy, runny, thin product would be flung all over my bathroom.  I am looking for a worthwhile alternative, if anyone can make a suggestion?  My arm pits are wet and smelly by 10:00 AM with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, I have used this product ever since the first time I realized I needed deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Like this scent. Been using it for years. Hard to find in stores these days.</li>
    <li> This six pack of Mitchum is great!  I use it daily and it smells great.  I do not smell at all which is a plus!  Good buy!</li>
    <li> The price on amazon was MUCH cheaper than in the store, and Mitchum is the only deodorant I buy.  Everything else irritates my skin.  I am very glad I found this deal.  I&#x27;ve apparently wasted a lot of money buying it at store prices, and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for 10+ years, great product that works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is good, but I find it much more likely to get on my clothes (hence 4 stars). I preferred the roll-on style I could buy in Australia (that would be 5 stars). Still, I&#x27;m not changing.</li>
    <li> This is the worst anti-perspirant I have ever used.  I used to be a loyal Mitchum user for the past 5-6 years but since they changed to the &amp;#34;oxygen&amp;#34; based formula it is terrible.  It&#x27;s wet and sticky.  It does not keep you dry.  All around terrible product.</li>
    <li> This works good at stopping wetness and odor.But you have to do it the right way.&lt;br /&gt;1.Recommended to apply underarm after shower,on dry skin,before you sleep.If you take another shower in the morning,like I do,it is fine.It still works through out the day.In my case,I apply another &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; in the morning,just to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;2.You have to wait a few minutes for this to dry,before you put clothes on.I usually stand under the fan and give it 2-3 minutes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;3.Having no hair under arm will help you a long way,to get this thing effective as possible.I use a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;4.About residue,this does leave a white residue on you clothes after multiple uses.This is not completely invisible,like they wanna make you believe.Still way better than many other brands I used.</li>
    <li> works and better than going to the store</li>
    <li> this is a great deodorant never burn your underarm its not itchy and uncomfortable at all,i need to get more asap it always sellout of amazon all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Last long - Scent is not overwhelming. Keeps me dry for a day or two sometimes as it really holds on even after a shower or swim.</li>
    <li> The company slogan is&amp;#34; so strong you can skip a day&amp;#34;, and is simply the facts. Mitchum makes a great product at a reasonable price, work just as well as any of those clinical strength deodorants. And the 6 pack for Less than 15 bucks is a bargain.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers who say that Mitchum has taken a turn for the worse! The formula has become sticky, dries slowly, and all the little holes in the top make it impossible to use. You either get too much or too little, and pulling the top off sucks out a bunch of the product, making a gloppy mess. Don&#x27;t even think of traveling with this stuff, it&#x27;ll be all over the place. I want the old formulation/package back! I used to love this product. (I didn&#x27;t buy mine at Amazon, FYI.)</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant that really works!!! My husband works outside and we live in GA...which &#x3D; HOT &amp; SWEATY!! This product works great &amp; is a great value too!</li>
    <li> Works well and received as promised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people with the cursed combination of sweaty armpits and sensitive skin. Mitchum is the only antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s extremely effective and gentle on the skin. I&#x27;d like a sexier label, and I&#x27;ve tried others like Degree, but Mitchum just works and it works well.</li>
    <li> Been using it since I was 13 and I never looked back. I will be 29 in a week. For those who have problems with deodorants that make you itch, this won&#x27;t!  Also, the price for this is amazing. I am so happy!</li>
    <li> this new formula is awful - the PowerGel formula worked just great and I loved it.  I&#x27;m throwing away the rest of my &#x27;oxygen odor control&#x27; formula and switching brands.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected, smells great. best deodorant I have ever used.  By buying the larger pack of 6, don&#x27;t worry about running out.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant because I liked it in the past. Like the others reviewers indicated, the product has changed. Its super runny and gets everywhere just from taking off the cap. It takes a very long time to dry and you have to delay getting dressed if you don&#x27;t want a huge slimey mess. Also, by morning the stench of b.o. coming off my hairy pits is overwhelming. Definitely pass on this new formulation.</li>
    <li> Mitchum deodorant is the best non-prescription antiperspirant+deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  I never sweat or smell from using it, and it has a nice light scent.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I have found</li>
    <li> Good Price - will buy again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need my armpits to smell like flowers, or like AXE bodyspray.  I&#x27;m a man, and don&#x27;t need to smell like a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sport smell is fairly mild, but pleasant.  I like the mountain air scent a bit better, but at the time of purchase this was less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweat like a hog, and I&#x27;d have to say that Mitchum works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used (ban, etc).  Not only that, it&#x27;s pretty cheap here on amazon, probably 1/2 the price of retail.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> But i  don&#x27;t like de odor so much but some people can buy if they want because maybe they can like it</li>
    <li> I ordered it twice and both times several of the bottles were leaking goopy crap everywhere. The product itself is not super great either. Yeah its cheap but you would be better off with the clinical strength anyway.</li>
    <li> THIS THE ONLY BRAND/KIND THAT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;..FOR DAYS, LITERALLY..&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT BY SUBSCRIPTION !!</li>
    <li> Smells ok not good for sweat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it was great.&lt;br /&gt;Then it disappeared from the shelves everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this here on Amazon I ordered 18 of them.&lt;br /&gt;17 are going back, one I opened and threw away.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a different package, a different formula, a different fragrance and even though the picture is what I wanted,&lt;br /&gt; what I got was something completely different, even the label is different.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money if you&#x27;re looking for what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely misleading business practices.&lt;br /&gt;I expected a lot more from Amazon....</li>
    <li> This was not the same product pictured. The design of this deodorant applicator is not suitable for travel. Leaks everywhere.</li>
    <li> This works so well I no longer have to shower more than once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The savings in my water bill more than justify the slightly higher purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus the ladies tell me they love the sporty scent.</li>
    <li> The new formula (&amp;#34;48 hour formula&amp;#34;) doesn&#x27;t seem to protect as well as the old formula.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum for many years, a great product. Will continue using.</li>
    <li> If you sweat a lot this is better than any other non-prescription I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great scent, this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s a bit harsher and more &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; than I prefer, but nothing that will scare anyone off. I use it for day use; put something else on for a date.</li>
    <li> I had been using this marvelous deo for more than 3 yrs.unbeatable.</li>
    <li> The new packaging ie. several tiny holes versus the three slits, is clearly designed that you use way more product than necessary. Be very careful to turn the bottom knob very, and I mean VERY, little.  More than enough comes out for one use.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant. Long lasting protection. Goes on wet but dries quickly for all day protection. By far the strongest deodorant out there on commercial shelves</li>
    <li> I liked the old Mitchum gel, but this new version is terrible.  As the other reviewers have noted, the good reviews are for the previous generation of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product is so watery that it leaks all over, running down the sides of the container when you roll even a small amount out to be applied.  This gets on your hands, your bathroom counter, etc. and is hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making matters worse, while the old container actually had a cap with 3 bumps on the inside that plugged the three applicator holes through which the product is dispensed, the new container has dozens of holes and the cap does nothing to keep the watery gel inside. So forget packing it in your gym bag or suitcase--you&#x27;ll find it everywhere: a good amount stuck up in the cap and more anywhere else it can spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty sneaky to use a picture of the old product and yet deliver the new product .......  The new product is different (packaging, fragrance, and composition). Amazon should at least update the picture on show to customers or include a warning that the product is different from what previous buyers may be expecting.  Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I completely agree with all of the comments about how the product and applicator have changed.  I&#x27;ve used this for years, and was happy with it.  Now it has a clear applicator with little holes everywhere that push way too much of the product out.  Once you put it on it feels sticky and gets on everything.  With the old applicator you were able to manage the amount you put on.  Good luck telling how much you are using now.  I&#x27;ll have to look around for a different product going forward.  As someone else stated, why change a product your customers are happy with other than try and squeeze some extra money out by tricking them?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been having issues with excessive sweating and tried a few different brands and types.  I&#x27;ve landed on this.  Does the trick for sure!</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers, they have ruined this product.  The top applicator changed from a few small slots to many small holes that cover the entire surface like a sieve. It used to be possible to see the gel come out of the top so you could know how much you were going to apply, but now it is impossible to tell how much is coming out and it leaks everywhere when stored in a drawer.  I&#x27;m not convinced the formula hasn&#x27;t changed either since it now seems to irritate my skin.  Changing the design was one of the stupidest decisions they could have made and it is forcing me to choose a new brand.  Hear that Mitchum?  Probably not.  I&#x27;ve been buying from you for years and now I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant a lot. It is difficult to find in stores in Las Vegas.  They always carry Mitchum unscented but I want the scented.  After going to a couple stores I jumped on Amazon and like so many other things they have it and at a fabulous price.  Thanks for the sanity and gas saving.</li>
    <li> Faster service than I could&#x27;ve ever imagined! Great men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
    <li> Of course I personally think this is the best product in its class.  Buying the six pack with membership in amazon prime (which gives free shipping) with a subscription to this item (which gives a significant discount) makes the amazon price on this item awesome.  In addition to the great price,  I never have to worry about shopping for this item and I never run out.  I love amazon subscription service, I hope they dont ever stop offering it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with shipping along with product. I&#x27;ve been using Mitchem deodorant for years, and recently my husband started using it.  He said it works better than any other he&#x27;s tried.  Although he likes the unscented, I prefer the scented as it&#x27;s a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> My nephew used to have sweat spots in his shirt, we gave it, after three weeks in use almost every sweat spot is off, his begun to work in a lawyers firm, where he have to change twice his shirt even in the office, but now by  bye sweat spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they changed about their new formula, but if you order this now, your deodorant will be labeled &amp;#34;Men Mitchum Advanced, oxygen odor control technology, 48 hour protection&amp;#34;. The new sticks now have several tiny holes instead of three skinny ones. We have used these deodorant for years and have been fairly happy (except that it takes forever to dry). Now, however, it&#x27;s complete crap. We used two tubes and threw the other 4 away. It is a big, liquidy mess that sucks out the top as soon as you pull the top off. If you store upright, this is bad enough, but if you store on its side, it will leak everywhere. Avoid this stuff at all costs.</li>
    <li> Wow, what the hell happened?  This stuff was the best for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my subject line really covers it, but for the sake of review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Mitchum for men gel for about 8 years or more and it was excellent. The gel went on clean and dried fast and really did it&#x27;s job well. In fact I had a really hard time finally finding a deodorant/anti-perspirant that actually worked well for me and didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I just opened the new pack I had under my bathroom sink last week (I always stock ahead via Amazon) and right away something was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula is super runny and leaks right out of the container when you tip it. It makes my shirts stick to my skin. And I think it actually generates BO where there was none before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really sucks, going to be tough to find a replacement. What were they thinking?</li>
    <li> Received a different type of &amp;#34;Mitchum&amp;#34; with a totally different label. Also seems there is not as much product in each stick as it runs out far more quickly than the Mitchum I have purchased at local drug stores. Wondering if it is a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> Work great for me thanksvery muchand I will definitely order more when I need some thank you again......  thank you</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. The only that I have found that doesn&#x27;t ruin my t-shirts over time.</li>
    <li> I purchased these after purchasing another batch at an earlier date from Amazon.  These are smaller in quantity and both my husband and I (I use the womens scent) feel that we got a knock off.  Mitchum has always worked for us, now we need to shower twice a day.  This did not stop perspiration.</li>
    <li> Mitchum is an excellent anti-perspirant/deodorant.  Especially the anti-perspirant part.  The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because I live in the desert, and it leaves me just a tad too dry.  If I still lived in Florida, I&#x27;m sure I would have given it a perfect 5.  Good product, though, an very long lasting.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and Mitchum Power Gel does the job of keeping me dry without irritating my skin. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Everything came packaged well, and for the price you just cant beat it.</li>
    <li> Stocked up at great price</li>
    <li> This product has be reformulated and is no longer as effective. I never sweated with the power-gel formula (as shown here), but a newer &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; product was shipped to me that does not work nearly as well and has a strange odor. Also the new packaging is not as convenient either. It was much easier with the previous dispenser to regulate the amount of product applied. The new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; packaging uses dozens of tiny holes which makes it difficult to apply consistently and the cap has a tendency to pop off whenever I grab for it in the medicine cabinet. Why some companies insist on changing proven formulas and packaging is beyond me,  but I am returning this product and will now have to search for a new brand to take its place.</li>
    <li> My Favorite deodorant...great price!</li>
    <li> Always my favorite. This Brand clear gel works/smells great! I have never had a problem using this anti-perspirant. The price/quantity is very competitive compared to my local brick and mortar stores. I would highly recommend this product and seller to anyone who is interested.</li>
    <li> Mitchum is a very good deodorant -- in fact, it&#x27;s the only my husband will use after trying many kinds.</li>
    <li> Not like the prior formula that was available in May, which was great.  This formula is sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry readily -- takes 5 minutes or more.  The dispenser makes it hard to control the quantity -- very sensitive to turning the dial and once the gel extrudes blasting out that&#x27;s it.  Not clear why Mitchum changed the formula to this inferior product.</li>
    <li> Good price for the amount. I don&#x27;t care for the new style applicator. It uses too much, too fast - more than necessary.</li>
    <li> This might be a man&#x27;s deodorant, but I am not the first woman to like it. Smells great, does a nice job at antiperspirant, too.</li>
    <li> Sure it prevents body odor, but if the gel comes into contact with any fabric  it&#x27;ll bleach that area where it came into contact. I guess it&#x27;s okay if you wear white shirts...</li>
    <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used mitchum for over 30 years.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed, but I my underarm hair gets caked up with this stuff, where it didn&#x27;t in past.  I still keeps me from stinking, and I have body odor with other brands so will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This stuff realy smells good.  I up&#x27;d my rating from a 4 to 5.  I&#x27;ve used a few containers and am very happy.</li>
    <li> The new formula sucks.  It never dries and feels sticky all day.</li>
    <li> Always great and a better way of picking up this product. Now I don&#x27;t have to pick up for the year.</li>
    <li> Everyone is different. Even though all anti-perspirants seem to have about the same ingredients they do not all work alike. So when you find one that works well and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes you stick with it.  Amazon makes it easy.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff, the only reason I gave it four stars was because it sometimes stains my clothes. Otherwise, love it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Mitchum!  His job is quite physical and this lasts through the day. Great scent too, it&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
    <li> New formula is bad.  It&#x27;s not a gel anymore.  It pours out.  After years of using the gel, now I have to look for a new brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is you don&#x27;t have to turn the dial anymore.  When you turn it sideways to apply, it will run out the holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is you better put the cap on very tight and store it standing up or else you&#x27;ll have a mess.</li>
    <li> Great buy great product</li>
    <li> For years I have used the Mitchum Cream deodorant.  However, they stopped making it.  So, I switched to the Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;It provides the protection I need without irritation to the underarms.</li>
    <li> I ran out of Mitchum and tried a high rated version of Secret.  Although it kept me dry, I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it was hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchum remains my number one choice and the $1.06 per ounce here is the cheapest I could find online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for bait and switch pricing from Amazon.  I clicked on this Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant Power Gel, Sport, 2.25 oz (63 g) (Pack of 6) for $14.27.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, it says I can get 5% discount with Subscribe &amp; Save.  I click on that button and suddenly the price has jumped up to $16.73!  What kind of racket is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying it anyway, just not the Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  I have been using this product for many years and found it to be excellent in controlling perspiration without leaving any marks on the shirts.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum for many years. Recently they stopped selling the great solid I had been using that kept me dry and odor free. My only choice was to try the clear gel. UGH!!! Stays so wet and nasty that I have to wait 15 mins fanning my under arms to get them dry so that I can get dressed. One time I bent down and stood up and my knee was covered in wet goop. Not only that, the crappy formula is weak and does not last but a few hours. I don&#x27;t know what got into the minds of those making decisions at Mitchum. I say \\&quot;shame on you!\\&quot;    Update: Visited another state and FOUND the Mitchum deodorant I have ALWAYS used \\&quot;Smart Solid Clinical Performance\\&quot; is what it is called. Cost me $4.99. This is NOT the one called \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot; by Mitchum, which costs anywhere from $9.99 and up. I&#x27;ve seen it at $11.99. Tiny box half the size of regular deodorant for two to three times more. Now I believe this so called \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; is the same as the \\&quot;smart solid\\&quot;, but with a triple expensive price. As I wrote initially, I had been looking in three states for the \\&quot;smart solid\\&quot; and could not find it. I believe this product was removed so they could play a wicked game of \\&quot;let&#x27;s put the s***ty product on the shelves so the consumers will be FORCED to buy our regular \\&quot;smart solid\\&quot; renamed and smaller for triple the amount. Well, nice try GREEDY Mitchum. THIS particular consumer is too smart for that deceit and trickery. I WILL NOT be buying your so called \\&quot;clinical\\&quot;. Not gonna happen. I would rather find alternatives than see myself getting ripped off by a bunch of greedy Business Executives looking to boost their GP. Nice try!!</li>
    <li> My husband and son uses this deodorant and it is on a tad on the pricey side in the stores. Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Always known about mitchum man great powerful deorderant, what i liked most is that i recieved this quick and on a Sunday</li>
    <li> 6 for less then 20 bucks! guys buy it it&#x27;s great and you won&#x27;t have to worry about anit-persirant for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and Amazon has it for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great product and really great in blocking perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;I tried other products but non as good as this one.</li>
    <li> The new dispenser is terrible as it is very difficult to control how much comes out (which seems always to be way too much even when just removing the cap)! They should go back to the old tired and true design or I will soon be looking for a different product.</li>
    <li> they changed it again, why not leave well enough alone, no!!!!!</li>
    <li> As others have stated, the new formula is terrible.  I have used Mitchem unscented longer than I can remember.  Now that the formula  has changed it&#x27;s terrible.  The contents flig out all over the place when you try to use it.  It&#x27;s terribly watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not normally one to get all butthurt about something and spout off in a review, but this went from the best deodorant on earth to the worst.  It&#x27;s as if they didn&#x27;t test it at all.  If you take the lid off, a ton of the product get&#x27;s sucked out and plops on your floor.  When you go to use it, you will of course invert the tube slightly to get under your arm, which will cause tons of the product to shoot out, dollop onto your sink and body.  I&#x27;m not talking little tiny amounts either,  I&#x27;m talking huge globs of liquid deodorant.  It&#x27;s like somebody ran through my bathroom shooting sex lube all over the place, when I know for a fact it is not Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please fix your product Mitchem.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the Mitchum deodorant, especially with the Sport scent.  We&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in the stores.  But this was such a great deal, that we ordered a lot.  Now he&#x27;s set for quite awhile.  No longer have to shop multiple stores to find it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant. Smells great without being overbearing. He works a very labor intensive job, and says this prevents him from being a sweaty mess. He&#x27;s also not an overly sweaty person, however. Dries clear, but it&#x27;s a gel so it takes a couple minutes to fully dry.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will use and it is so much more convenient and less expensive to buy the 6-pack from Amazon.  It is the only way we will be purchasing it from now on.</li>
    <li> Felt the immediate difference on the first day I tried it out. Use it together with Certain Dri for best results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been on subscription for Mitchum for a very long time. The product works very well for me. This is the first time for the sport gel but I am sure it will be fine. I don&#x27;t like perfumery deodorants and Mitchum is not.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mitchum deodorant for many years. They are veryyyy good.&lt;br /&gt;But, never paid this cheap. I thought they were fake. But, they seem they are fine for now.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy for now. I re-ordered 3 more packs.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant for a teenage son who runs track and cross-country . There are many others on the market of that this antiperspirant works the best for him.</li>
    <li> have use mitchum for a number of years.  It prevents ordor, keeps me dry and does not cause any type of underarm rash or sores. I had a problem with a deodorant I used at one time causing lumps under my arm.  They went away when I stopped using it, but returned as soom as I started again. It was very annoying.  I would suggest mitchum for anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great. I usually don&#x27;t get &#x27;sport&#x27; scented things because they usually smell too masculine or strong but this just smells fresh and clean. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Totally agree with other reviews of the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Mitchum gel deodorant.  I was a customer of Mitchum products for over 30 years but not any more!.  The many holes at the top of the stick results in wasted gel that you have to pour in the sink. What were they thinking?</li>
