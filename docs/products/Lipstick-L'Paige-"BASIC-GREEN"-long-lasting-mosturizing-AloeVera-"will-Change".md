<ol>
      <li>Best find ever.</li>
      <li>Looks Great!</li>
      <li>Feels Great!</li>
      <li>Great price, great product.</li>
      <li>The seller is great though.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Paige mood lipsticks are great.  </li>
      <li>and it is every bit as good as what I bought in Tangiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its just okay!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I have used this product since it originated 20+ years ago and it is the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>Good for all the time, or just as an &#x27;undercoat&#x27; to support your favorite lipstick</li>
      <li>It turns a becoming color on the lips and is good about remaining there for some time while eating, drinking, swimming, and so on.</li>
      <li>I love this kind and brand of lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this lipstick!</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick and am so glad that they have it online.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than liner/lipstick combo.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite lipstick and its all i wear for my lipstick and refuse to change lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I love love love it.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>so it adheres to the lips and doesn&#x27;t easily smudge or come off within an hour.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I use as makeup in the summer because it looks great with a tan and lasts all day as well as protects the lips from the sun.  </li>
      <li>even tried to apply lightly</li>
      <li>It lasts a full day and comes off reasonably well with makeup remover and some scrubbing-</li>
      <li>I just wish that the company would work something out with Amazon and/or the customer so that the postage and handling do not cost as much as the product itself!</li>
      <li>It turns out to be this pretty fuschia color.</li>
      <li>pink/rose when applied and lasts a very long time, unlike most lipsticks.</li>
      <li>its a little bit intense of a pink but totally effective and cute if use sparingly.</li>
      <li>my &#x27;mood&#x27; shade turned out to be something straight from my childhood dress-up photos.</li>
      <li>If they could do the latter, not only would I give it five stars instead of four, but I would order the product more often.</li>
      <li>Well I was so happy when I receive my magic lipstick, but for no reason it broke and only was able to used with careful, because I did not wanted all over my fingers etc. :(</li>
      <li>The green is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I am not a usual lipstick wearer, but, when I got this I loved it and used it often, a little goes a long way, so it lasts.</li>
      <li>love the color and its very long lasting!</li>
      <li>The black is so cool when it turns!</li>
      <li>I have been searching for this lipstick since my very old supply from the ABC store in Hawaii ran out.</li>
      <li>I visited Morocco in 2008 and bought a green lipstick there that was fantastic....</li>
      <li>When she tried it out, it shows up redish on her lips not green.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for a friend that loves this particular shade when she uses it on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>color seems to last a long time and DOES NOT DRY your lips, like most other long-lasting lip colors/stains currently on the market do.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and is green on the outside.</li>
      <li>The lipstick itself lasts for a long time and  my lips are always soft - never dry.</li>

<li> It last a long time.  </li>
<li> The lipsticks last a long, long time.  </li>
<li> This lipstick is green, but like the old &#x27;60s mood rings, it changes color when applied to your lips based on your body&#x27;s makeup.  </li>
<li> The aloe vera is healing to my lips and the color stays on a long time.  </li>
<li> all day pink lips, no need to constantly reapply, no smearing on cups or glasses.</li>
<li> It didnt last that long per other customer claimed....</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as the green lipstick that I had years ago</li>
<li> call me a sucker, but i actually thought this product would be the answer to my red lipstick woes.</li>
<li> I order a half dozen tubes at a time, because I don&#x27;t know how long it will be for sale.  </li>
<li> There are other colors to chose from, but if you like deeper, rosy pinks to red lipstick then get the green.  </li>
<li> Lipstick turned out to be a little bit dry and a little bit too red.</li>
<li> read: not pretty.</li>
<li> I have been wearing this brand of green lipstick for a very long time.  </li>
<li> i expected green and got pink</li>
<li> However, I bought this for my daughter who needs green lipstick/color for a costume for a convention in February.</li>
<li> Two years ago, we were in Tangiers, and I purchased two green lipsticks that turn your lips</li>
<li> It is unbelievable how this works.  </li>
<li> Was not a good shade-</li>
<li> unfortunately, it&#x27;s a skin tone gamble.</li>
<li> For myself...too expensive otherwise.</li>

    <li> Love this lipstick. Best find ever. It lasts a full day and comes off reasonably well with makeup remover and some scrubbing- but it&#x27;s better than liner/lipstick combo.</li>
    <li> Well I was so happy when I receive my magic lipstick, but for no reason it broke and only was able to used with careful, because I did not wanted all over my fingers etc. :(</li>
    <li> It is unbelievable how this works.  Good for all the time, or just as an &#x27;undercoat&#x27; to support your favorite lipstick</li>
    <li> This lipstick is green, but like the old &#x27;60s mood rings, it changes color when applied to your lips based on your body&#x27;s makeup.  It last a long time.  I visited Morocco in 2008 and bought a green lipstick there that was fantastic....I cried when I applied the last bit from the last tube a few month ago!  When I saw this lipstick I decided to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It works the same as the ones I bought in Morocco.  Just be careful about pushing the lipstick too far out of the tube as mine broke as I was applying it.  Not to worry, I just keep using it and pushing it back into the tube.  There are other colors to chose from, but if you like deeper, rosy pinks to red lipstick then get the green.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this brand of green lipstick for a very long time.  The color lasts forever and does not come off on your glassware or your kid&#x27;s cheek.  The lipstick itself lasts for a long time and  my lips are always soft - never dry.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Paige mood lipsticks are great.  I love them.  The color lasts and doesn&#x27;t run and they are never gooey.  The lipsticks last a long, long time.  And they moisturize the lips.</li>
    <li> call me a sucker, but i actually thought this product would be the answer to my red lipstick woes. unfortunately, it&#x27;s a skin tone gamble. my &#x27;mood&#x27; shade turned out to be something straight from my childhood dress-up photos. read: not pretty.</li>
    <li> Two years ago, we were in Tangiers, and I purchased two green lipsticks that turn your lips pink/rose when applied and lasts a very long time, unlike most lipsticks. Since I was running out, I searched for a similar product online and found it on Amazon.com. I ordered  it and it is every bit as good as what I bought in Tangiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color seems to last a long time and DOES NOT DRY your lips, like most other long-lasting lip colors/stains currently on the market do. I will DEFINITELY order this product again.</li>
    <li> What can I say. I love love love it. Its my favorite lipstick and its all i wear for my lipstick and refuse to change lipsticks. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Looks Great! Feels Great! No, not for me, for  my wife She likes it and it does the job. word</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lipstick!</li>
    <li> I love this kind and brand of lipstick. It turns a becoming color on the lips and is good about remaining there for some time while eating, drinking, swimming, and so on. I just wish that the company would work something out with Amazon and/or the customer so that the postage and handling do not cost as much as the product itself! If they could do the latter, not only would I give it five stars instead of four, but I would order the product more often.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since it originated 20+ years ago and it is the absolute best.  It is not greasy so it adheres to the lips and doesn&#x27;t easily smudge or come off within an hour.  In fact, I can apply only a couple of times a day, even when we are at the lake all day, and it stays. This is the only product I use as makeup in the summer because it looks great with a tan and lasts all day as well as protects the lips from the sun.  I hope this company stays in business FOREVER because nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> Love this! I am not a usual lipstick wearer, but, when I got this I loved it and used it often, a little goes a long way, so it lasts. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick and am so glad that they have it online.  I order a half dozen tubes at a time, because I don&#x27;t know how long it will be for sale.  The aloe vera is healing to my lips and the color stays on a long time.  The green is my favorite.  It turns out to be this pretty fuschia color.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as the green lipstick that I had years ago</li>
    <li> I am thinking of returning it. I would not recommend it.  Like the case and the box it came in though.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and is green on the outside. However, I bought this for my daughter who needs green lipstick/color for a costume for a convention in February. When she tried it out, it shows up redish on her lips not green. So as far as the product is concerned, it is not what I expected. The seller is great though.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this lipstick since my very old supply from the ABC store in Hawaii ran out. Not the same brand, but definitely the same effect: all day pink lips, no need to constantly reapply, no smearing on cups or glasses. Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> This lipstick has become my go-to!  love the color and its very long lasting!</li>
    <li> Lipstick turned out to be a little bit dry and a little bit too red. Works well with regular chapstick and does stay on longer than regular lipstick.</li>
    <li> i expected green and got pink but it all works just the same. its a little bit intense of a pink but totally effective and cute if use sparingly. The black is so cool when it turns!</li>
    <li> Its just okay! It didnt last that long per other customer claimed....</li>
    <li> Was not a good shade- we looked like a clown- even tried to apply lightly</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend that loves this particular shade when she uses it on a daily basis.  For myself...too expensive otherwise.</li>
