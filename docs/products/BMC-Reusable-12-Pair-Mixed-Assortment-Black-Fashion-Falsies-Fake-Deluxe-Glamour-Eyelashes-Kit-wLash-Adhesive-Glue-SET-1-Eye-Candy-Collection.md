### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best variety of eyelashes ever</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just great.</li>
      <li>A great find, a great price.</li>
      <li>Good for the price</li>
      <li>I liked the style of all 12 pairs, they&#x27;re great quality lashes &amp; easy to apply!</li>
      <li>For the price, these are amazing.</li>
      <li>Most of the eyelashes werent good to work with..</li>
      <li>each is unique and looks great on.</li>
      <li>I find its a good consistency, dries clear, has great hold, but doesn&#x27;t rip your eye lid off your face when you remove.</li>
      <li>will tuck the rest away for another halloween, nothing more than that though.</li>
      <li>Great selection, and really inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I love every pair I got.</li>
      <li>I love the lashes.</li>
      <li>The eyelashes work fine</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t describe how great it feels to have big dewy lashes.</li>
      <li>These are awesome, they are super thick though, probably better as costume lashes.</li>
      <li>The glue also runs out quickly, might want to buy that seperately</li>
      <li>Package was opened, glue dried and eyelashes not that great.</li>
      <li>In fact, when I removed the pair I wore for Halloween using my Target brand eye makeup remover, the lashes came right out of the band.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these for a specific makeup look, &amp; was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>If you have actual lashes to help keep them on your eyes it might be better, I don&#x27;t have any natural lashes so these were a no go for me.</li>
      <li>The first couple I tried looked good, but then I ran into a few where the lashes just pulled off of the strip with the slightest tug - total trash.  </li>
      <li>Got them on time , they are very pretty and are lasting well.</li>
      <li>There is a nice selection of lashes in this collection that range from &amp;#34;super dramatic night on the town&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;very realistic day time amplification&amp;#34;.</li>

<li> They&#x27;re a bit flat</li>
<li> As somebody that wears natural looking falsies on a regular basis, these were not very good quality.  </li>
<li> Glue dry and falling apart, along with the lashes, never again.</li>
<li> Glue was already dry!</li>
<li> They are not really practical for every day.</li>
<li> If you have a costume party and only plan on wearing these for a few hours go for these.</li>
<li> Of course there are some completely unrealistic costume style lashes in the pack, but isn&#x27;t that half the fun of falsies??&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> These won&#x27;t work for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Ok, once you get past that, the eyelashes aren&#x27;t terrible.  </li>
<li> I complained to BM but no answer, of course.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve worn every pair at least once.</li>
<li> very poor quality, while trying to remove a lash from the tray,the lash  pulled apart.  </li>
<li> I had a lot of lift on the ends of the lashes on these which is annoying during the day</li>
<li> The adhesive they attach these things to the packaging with is insane!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s yellowish, sticky, and horrible to get off.  </li>
<li> Not even my worst enemy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Glue was already dry!</li>
    <li> I love the lashes. Got them on time , they are very pretty and are lasting well. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for halloween so me and my girlfriends would have some choices for falsies.  While they worked for the night, I would not recommend for regular use.  As somebody that wears natural looking falsies on a regular basis, these were not very good quality.  In fact, when I removed the pair I wore for Halloween using my Target brand eye makeup remover, the lashes came right out of the band.  The option to reuse that pair was not even a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tuck the rest away for another halloween, nothing more than that though.</li>
    <li> Glue dry and falling apart, along with the lashes, never again.</li>
    <li> Some of the lashes fell apart trying to remove them from the packaging.</li>
    <li> They are not really practical for every day. If you have a costume party and only plan on wearing these for a few hours go for these. I had a lot of lift on the ends of the lashes on these which is annoying during the day and I had to carry glue with me to redo them. If you have actual lashes to help keep them on your eyes it might be better, I don&#x27;t have any natural lashes so these were a no go for me.</li>

There is a nice selection of lashes in this collection that range from &amp;#34;super dramatic night on the town&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;very realistic day time amplification&amp;#34;. Of course there are some completely unrealistic costume style lashes in the pack, but isn&#x27;t that half the fun of falsies??&lt;br /&gt;I have had zero issues with the glue. I find its a good consistency, dries clear, has great hold, but doesn&#x27;t rip your eye lid off your face when you remove. I&#x27;ve reused several pair of the lashes over and over again.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, they are super thick though, probably better as costume lashes. The glue also runs out quickly, might want to buy that seperately</li>
    <li> The adhesive they attach these things to the packaging with is insane!  It&#x27;s yellowish, sticky, and horrible to get off.  Ok, once you get past that, the eyelashes aren&#x27;t terrible.  They&#x27;re a bit flat so the ends pop up.  The first couple I tried looked good, but then I ran into a few where the lashes just pulled off of the strip with the slightest tug - total trash.  They wash, but don&#x27;t maintain their shape as well as I expect from &#x27;reusable&#x27;.  I won&#x27;t buy them again, but if you just want a bunch of lashes to play with, I would still recommend these for that purpose.  These won&#x27;t work for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the glue they provided, so I have nothing to say about that.</li>
    <li> Great selection, and really inexpensive.</li>
    <li> very poor quality, while trying to remove a lash from the tray,the lash  pulled apart.  lashes did not want to stick,,not pleased.would not recomend or purchase again.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes work fine but a couple pairs were mis matched. You get what you pay for. Good for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a specific makeup look, &amp; was not disappointed! I liked the style of all 12 pairs, they&#x27;re great quality lashes &amp; easy to apply! A great find, a great price. I 100% recommend!</li>
    <li> I do not believe they are reusable, but for the price who cares? You get a bunch of lashes for the same price as one pair of lashes.</li>
    <li> Most of the eyelashes werent good to work with.. Theyre just rotting away. Speaking of rotten, all of the glue except 1 was rotten, clumpy, smelled like fish and just did not work. Can&#x27;t use eyelashes, gg. Would not buy again OR recommend to anyone. Not even my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> Package was opened, glue dried and eyelashes not that great. I complained to BM but no answer, of course. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
