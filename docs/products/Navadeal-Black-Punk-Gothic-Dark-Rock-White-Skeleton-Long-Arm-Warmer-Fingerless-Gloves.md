      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Also there is a brand named printed at the top of the gloves.</li>
      <li>They look nice but are not the most comfortable.</li>
      <li>the vendor we used was very helpful in explaining this detail, and we were happy with our purchase.</li>
      <li>Very cool.</li>
      <li>Theyre fine now</li>
      <li>My mistake for not reading fine print, but 2 months for delivery!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super cute.</li>
      <li>really great gloves the only thing is the finger part is has an akward fit</li>
      <li>this look like cheap wool hand warmers</li>
      <li>but overall they made my costume and kept me warm!</li>
      <li>Definitely more costume than really for warmth (which is fine for what I purchased for).</li>
      <li>Thumb holes are just fine and bones are in appropriate placing on my own small hands and arms for a more accurate look.</li>
      <li>exactly as pictured and they&#x27;re warm, and were shipped fast.</li>
      <li>While these are cool, the picture made it look there were holes for thumbs - which they were not.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good product</li>
      <li>Much faster than most.</li>
      <li>Not too tight and nice and warm.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>First, they are pretty itchy, the tolerant able itchy.</li>
      <li>They fit like a second skin which is nice.</li>
      <li>She wears them when she wants to go with a goth look, and of course they&#x27;re also just fine for a Halloween costume.  </li>
      <li>a little snug but very cute and very cool.</li>
      <li>not what I was expecting; but they are cheap and came fast.</li>
      <li>They look nice, but the white bone material started coming out as soon as we got it out of the package.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>NOW, they are worth the money.</li>
      <li>Also shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>They were a little snug and I have fairly skinny arms</li>
      <li>It is pretty much was</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>They were for Halloween and they served their purpose, they were cheap enough, but don&#x27;t buy them for quality.</li>
      <li>but they didn&#x27;t really ruin the gloves once cut off.</li>
      <li>These were pretty cool as part of a female skeleton Halloween costume.</li>
      <li>I love the Gloves there are very well made and I will shop hear in the near future.</li>
      <li>These are for like long distance bike riders, not so much costumes or daily wear to keep your arms warm.</li>
      <li>and they cut into the crotch of my thumb after wearing them for a couple of hours but overall not bad.  </li>
      <li>The &#x27;bones&#x27; are a puffy screen print on top of black fabric.  </li>
      <li>Wish they were a little longer so that my T-Shirt sleeves drape over them more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to say how long these will last, but they seem pretty sturdy and the pattern looks great.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable to wear and actually stay up on my arms without constant readjusting.  </li>
      <li>Shipping took quite a while, but as long as you don&#x27;t need them RIGHT</li>
      <li>Soft, stretchy, and comfy.</li>
      <li>They are cute but a little tight at the top, not very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for, came just in time for Halloween, they have a snug tight fight and it is thick in fabric, which I like, but other than that they kept my arms really warm and put together my costume!</li>
      <li>The thumb holes didn&#x27;t feel too tight while I was wearing them, but after several hours they left behind very tender spots (a minor complaint in what has turned to be a great product overall).  </li>

<li> Second, there was 3 prices of loose string hanging out</li>
<li> It was a pair of black arm warmers with white stamped onto it, it was not same as the picture up above.</li>

<li> I had the same as one of the other reviews here.</li>

<li> These are even nicer than I expected.  </li>
<li> What I expected.</li>
<li> Minus one star cause they do take a while to get to you.</li>
<li> Disappointed for sure.</li>
<li> the bone portion of the gloves I received are not white, and the hand section is not on my hand, it ends in the middle of my arm all weird.</li>
<li> Shipment was slightly quicker than Amazon estimated but there was no tracking number.</li>
<li> but, there were little setbacks.</li>
<li> The arm &amp;#34;socks&amp;#34; are a little itchy to wear(wool?)</li>
<li> The print is very thick and is starting to peal already.  </li>
<li> I agree with other reviews the thumb holes are a bit tight and are uncomfortable for day wearing.</li>
<li> Slow</li>
<li> My daughter loves these--they took a little while to arrive, but they aren&#x27;t very expensive and they lasted a lot longer than I expected them to.  </li>
<li> Also the glove material itself is extremly thin and not warm at all.</li>
<li> quality-- think socks with poorly printed skeleton hands.</li>
<li> I cut off the hemmed edge because it was uncomfortable.</li>

    <li> I agree with other reviews the thumb holes are a bit tight and are uncomfortable for day wearing. Definitely more costume than really for warmth (which is fine for what I purchased for). Shipment was slightly quicker than Amazon estimated but there was no tracking number. The shipment comes from China.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments with these gloves even from guys.  But of course my supervisor does not approve. But I could care less.&lt;br /&gt;I love them.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these--they took a little while to arrive, but they aren&#x27;t very expensive and they lasted a lot longer than I expected them to.  The &#x27;bones&#x27; are a puffy screen print on top of black fabric.  She wears them when she wants to go with a goth look, and of course they&#x27;re also just fine for a Halloween costume.  Just plan ahead a bit because they ship from overseas--the vendor we used was very helpful in explaining this detail, and we were happy with our purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, they&#x27;re longer than I expected, which is good! :)) I&#x27;ll probably buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> They are cute but a little tight at the top, not very comfortable. I cut off the hemmed edge because it was uncomfortable. Theyre fine now</li>
    <li> They help me overcome writer&#x27;s block.</li>
    <li> really great gloves the only thing is the finger part is has an akward fit but otherwise they are pretty great!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. What I expected.</li>
    <li> They were a little snug and I have fairly skinny arms but overall they made my costume and kept me warm!</li>
    <li> These took longer than any item I have ever ordered on Amazon to arrive (was ordered before Halloween arrived over a month after!) and was very low quality-- think socks with poorly printed skeleton hands. These will probably land in a thrift store and stay there for a long time.</li>
    <li> These are even nicer than I expected.  They are nicely made and the design is knitted into it.  Very cool.</li>
    <li> exactly as pictured and they&#x27;re warm, and were shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Love these, Good quality. Minus one star cause they do take a while to get to you.</li>
    <li> good quality, fit great.</li>
    <li> These look great, nice and shiny. They fit like a second skin which is nice. The bones match up nicely; I only wish the design was on the back too.</li>
    <li> AWESOME AND VERY COMFORTABLE AND WARM</li>
    <li> The arm &amp;#34;socks&amp;#34; are a little itchy to wear(wool?) and they cut into the crotch of my thumb after wearing them for a couple of hours but overall not bad.  Wish they were a little longer so that my T-Shirt sleeves drape over them more.</li>
    <li> Love these. Fits great and lots of comments while out and about</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the material and the color</li>
    <li> The thumb holes didn&#x27;t feel too tight while I was wearing them, but after several hours they left behind very tender spots (a minor complaint in what has turned to be a great product overall).  It&#x27;s hard to say how long these will last, but they seem pretty sturdy and the pattern looks great.  I am very satisfied with these.</li>

    <li> I love these gloves!  They are comfortable to wear and actually stay up on my arms without constant readjusting.  Bone pattern looks very nice.</li>
    <li> this look like cheap wool hand warmers</li>
    <li> A gift...SHE LOVES THEM. Great gloves, great price, want more! Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> perfect fit very nice fit.</li>
    <li> Love them! They fit perfectly and I don&#x27;t have slim arms! They are very warm and exactly as shown!</li>
    <li> Arrived way after Halloween for this year but the item is just as described. Thumb holes are just fine and bones are in appropriate placing on my own small hands and arms for a more accurate look. Can&#x27;t wait to wear them next year.</li>
    <li> Cute, fun, and surprisingly comfy! I ordered these for my daughter and her friend, but am keeping a pair for myself.  Shipping took quite a while, but as long as you don&#x27;t need them RIGHT NOW, they are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Super cute. Soft, stretchy, and comfy.</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for a skull&lt;br /&gt;Lovers its good for a gift. Its&lt;br /&gt;Pretty&lt;br /&gt;Cold&lt;br /&gt;Right&lt;br /&gt;Now. So this&lt;br /&gt;Is&lt;br /&gt;Perfect&lt;br /&gt;For winter.</li>
    <li> When I bought this and it came in, it is not exactly the same. It was a pair of black arm warmers with white stamped onto it, it was not same as the picture up above. It isnt exactly very comfortable to wear either.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth the money so don&#x27;t bother buy this one.</li>
    <li> Cheap and poorly made, also even though ordered 2 weeks prior to Halloween, they showed up two weeks after Halloween.</li>
    <li> a little snug but very cute and very cool. Will go great with costume!</li>
    <li> Slow delivery- but around holidays. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Received 1 item and it was not what I ordered. Wasn&#x27;t even anything like what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not too tight and nice and warm. Exactly what was expected. Also shipping was very fast. Much faster than most.</li>
    <li> They look nice but are not the most comfortable. If u order this product watch the shipping it takes a Very long time.</li>
    <li> So awesome I wear it so much</li>
    <li> It is pretty much was I was hoping for, came just in time for Halloween, they have a snug tight fight and it is thick in fabric, which I like, but other than that they kept my arms really warm and put together my costume!</li>
    <li> I love the Gloves there are very well made and I will shop hear in the near future. &#x3D;)</li>

    <li> My granddaughter loved them!</li>
    <li> These were pretty cool as part of a female skeleton Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> What I received wasn&#x27;t the same as whats pictured. I had the same as one of the other reviews here. The bones part is like stamped on and not knitted in, also doesn&#x27;t line up with the wrist and hand. Disappointed for sure.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews where they said that the bones were woven in.  In my case they are printed on.  The print is very thick and is starting to peal already.  Also the glove material itself is extremly thin and not warm at all.</li>
    <li> They look nice, but the white bone material started coming out as soon as we got it out of the package. They were for Halloween and they served their purpose, they were cheap enough, but don&#x27;t buy them for quality.</li>
