      <li>The fragrance is just as incredible as I remember it and the shipping was so fast and the package was delivered without any complications.</li>
      <li>Everything was as they described and the box was beautiful and in great condition, not to mention it arrived super fast :]</li>

      <li>I have received many compliments.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I love this set.</li>
      <li>Was extremely pleased with the set.</li>
      <li>The items are perfect for a blossoming teen who is not quite at the apex of adolescence and not quite beyond the charms of a princess fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very nice gift set with large heart shaped bottle of perfume.</li>
      <li>I loved this so much</li>
      <li>The perfume itself smells amazing but the one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the little lotion that came with it it didn&#x27;t smell that great. . .</li>
      <li>Then at home sprayed some onto a clean tester stick.</li>
      <li>A quick search reveals that Coty is the company that manufactures this perfume for Vera Wang.</li>
      <li>Where the store version has a sweet chocolate marshmellowy scent, the Amazon one smells very much of powder.</li>
      <li>Very flowery and light fragrance.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little too powdery for my liking, but I&#x27;m sure my niece will love it.</li>
      <li>Very unusual for Amazon.</li>
      <li>When I came across this deal I was floored to know that I could get an entire gift set for such an amazing price!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>In the product listing Amazon states that they sell only authentic perfumes and the shipping box does say Cody on it</li>
      <li>I have wearing this perfume for years and the product they sent must be super old.</li>
      <li>This really made me  wonder if this was used.  </li>
      <li>and you can see the current sets available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tantric scent that really gets attention of passers-by.</li>
      <li>The lotion didn&#x27;t smell much like princess.  </li>
      <li>She was very satifisfied, i expected the inside to look a lil more flashy, but its all good, as long as she liked it</li>
      <li>This allows you to lift the upper lid and see the product but keep it sanitary or clean for the buyer.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still decent as a body moisturizer.</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>Be careful this is not the original Vera Wang Princess perfume.</li>
      <li>and I sprayed some from their new sample bottle onto a tester stick.</li>
      <li>the box Is cute the package arrived on time the items were bigger than expected so that was a plus.</li>
      <li>The Amazon version smells flat, not as sweet and much more dull.</li>
      <li>The Amazon test stick is half as strong, the scent quite faded.</li>
      <li>Well when mine arrived, the shipping box was clearly reused.</li>
      <li>In stores, the gift set has a clear plastic protective seal on it around the bottom of the box.</li>
      <li>the lotion in this set is old and has the smell of old lotion</li>
      <li>The store version is sweeter and more complex.</li>
      <li>&quot; perfume set direct from Amazon, not one of the Marketplace sellers.</li>
      <li>I thought that whole pack was definitely a steal for the price!</li>
      <li>Package arrived a day early.</li>
      <li>The surface of the cardboard was ripped from where a prior shipping label was removed and there was old tape with new tape over it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see that my Vera Wang set arrived early and several days early.  </li>
      <li>The perfume is long lasting and exactly how I remembered it would smell.</li>
      <li>then I expected and the larger bottle of perfume that I received was huge compared to what I had expected it to be.</li>

<li> Long review but bear with me...</li>
<li> The box says \\&quot;Property of Coty, Inc\\&quot; on the side in big black letters.</li>
<li> It seems just like it but smells very differently DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
<li> Not Available\\&quot; in pink text.</li>
<li> My perfume set came in a pink and purple metallic box.</li>
<li> I closely examined the other products in the package and found that the lotion appeared to have been used.  </li>
<li> I bought the set here because I wanted the perfume pretty badly and it is cheaper to buy this gift set on Amazon than to purchase just the single perfume bottle in a local store.</li>
<li> It has that sour smell.</li>
<li> I almost wonder if it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
<li> and it was half the cost.</li>
<li> I was very skeptical about buying this gift especially since its a Christmas gift for my mom.</li>
<li> The perfume smells quite faint and dull compared to the one you find in the store.  </li>
<li> If I would have known I&#x27;d get a poor product like this, I would have saved.</li>
<li> Awful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this set! I have been out of this scent for a while and my husband got it for me for my birthday. I love it! and I especially love the roll on bottle. Great on the go!!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that my Vera Wang set arrived early and several days early.  When I opened my package I noticed a sticker on the box that stated, &amp;#34;Attention! Please peel off this label and use this piece for your on-counter display set&amp;#34;.  This really made me  wonder if this was used.  The box wasn&#x27;t sealed with shrink wrap either.  The perfume smells quite faint and dull compared to the one you find in the store.  I almost wonder if it&#x27;s watered down. The color doesn&#x27;t look as purple either.  I closely examined the other products in the package and found that the lotion appeared to have been used.  If I would have known I&#x27;d get a poor product like this, I would have saved.</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest i could find it.  Me and my wife went on a cruise in july and got it for 60$</li>
    <li> Beautiful set, incredible smell... I loved this so much I got 2 more as gifts!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying this gift especially since its a Christmas gift for my mom. But I was so pleased with it the box Is cute the package arrived on time the items were bigger than expected so that was a plus. So yea all around I loved it!! And I know my will love it too its her fave scent. So yea this Is a great product to buy.</li>
    <li> the lotion in this set is old and has the smell of old lotion my review of this product was taken off the site.</li>
    <li> Long review but bear with me... I ordered this \\&quot;Princess\\&quot; perfume set direct from Amazon, not one of the Marketplace sellers. When you see this item listed in the search, the photo for it says \\&quot;Image Not Available\\&quot; in pink text. Very unusual for Amazon. My perfume set came in a pink and purple metallic box. This box is not the current packaging that you see in stores. Just do a search online and you can see the current sets available. I bought the set here because I wanted the perfume pretty badly and it is cheaper to buy this gift set on Amazon than to purchase just the single perfume bottle in a local store. Well when mine arrived, the shipping box was clearly reused. The surface of the cardboard was ripped from where a prior shipping label was removed and there was old tape with new tape over it. Also it was not an Amazon box. The box says \\&quot;Property of Coty, Inc\\&quot; on the side in big black letters. A quick search reveals that Coty is the company that manufactures this perfume for Vera Wang. Well inside the perfume set was wrapped in bubble wrap and in good condition. However, the set was not sealed. In stores, the gift set has a clear plastic protective seal on it around the bottom of the box. This allows you to lift the upper lid and see the product but keep it sanitary or clean for the buyer. No seal whatsoever on the Amazon set! The perfume is an authentic bottle, it meets my rigorous inspections of checking the perfume color, bottle shape, bottle size, cap engraving details, cap ring, jewel color, etc. However, the scent of this perfume is noticeably different than that of the in store perfume. Ive smelled it in the mall at several stores and at a smaller boutique. A beauty store nearby has it and I sprayed some from their new sample bottle onto a tester stick. Then at home sprayed some onto a clean tester stick. The store version is sweeter and more complex. The Amazon version smells flat, not as sweet and much more dull. Where the store version has a sweet chocolate marshmellowy scent, the Amazon one smells very much of powder. They are similar but not the same. In the product listing Amazon states that they sell only authentic perfumes and the shipping box does say Cody on it but again the gift set box is not current art. I can only assume that the sets being sold here are either old (as perfume ages its scent changes and dulls), or they could be \\&quot;off\\&quot; production bottles discounted here. Whatever the case, I did decide to keep mine because it does still smell good and it was half the cost. I did the test two days ago and the store stick still smells just as strong and pleasant. The Amazon test stick is half as strong, the scent quite faded. You get what you pay for I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Added a photo to show the box of the set as well as the cardboard box that the item was shipped in!</li>
    <li> Best Fragrance! I Love it!</li>
    <li> Awful! The perfume smelt nothing like it was supposed to, roll on smelt like alcohol,  lotion had no scent,  and I didn&#x27;t even bother opening the lip gloss! The box design different as well!</li>
    <li> Package arrived a day early. Was extremely pleased with the set. The perfume is long lasting and exactly how I remembered it would smell. The lip gloss is the only downside. It smells like plastic.</li>
    <li> Love princess!  It&#x27;s been my go to for over 5 years. The lotion didn&#x27;t smell much like princess.  But it&#x27;s still decent as a body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my daughter but it could move to my vanity.</li>
    <li> Be careful this is not the original Vera Wang Princess perfume. It seems just like it but smells very differently DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> The perfume itself smells amazing but the one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the little lotion that came with it it didn&#x27;t smell that great. . .</li>
    <li> I have missed this scent for a while. SO GOOD! It&#x27;s a tantric scent that really gets attention of passers-by.</li>
    <li> I love this set. The items are perfect for a blossoming teen who is not quite at the apex of adolescence and not quite beyond the charms of a princess fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items I received were in perfect condition (including the box). The scent is a little too powdery for my liking, but I&#x27;m sure my niece will love it. The combination of items also makes this great as a special birthday gift.</li>
    <li> I have wearing this perfume for years and the product they sent must be super old. It has that sour smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for a friend of mine and she absolutely loved it! Everything was as they described and the box was beautiful and in great condition, not to mention it arrived super fast :]</li>
    <li> This perfume was a christmas present for my daughter, she loves it.  Very nice gift set with large heart shaped bottle of perfume.</li>
    <li> She was very satifisfied, i expected the inside to look a lil more flashy, but its all good, as long as she liked it im good.</li>
    <li> great! it came way faster then I expected and the larger bottle of perfume that I received was huge compared to what I had expected it to be. I thought that whole pack was definitely a steal for the price! highly recommend</li>
    <li> Had smelled this while on a cruise and loved it. Decided to order from amazon and try it for myself. It smells wonderful. I have received many compliments. Very flowery and light fragrance. love it!.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great set, smell lasts for days!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Gave as a gift, so didn&#x27;t like the big price sticker on the front of the package that didn&#x27;t remove well.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. The gift set was a really great bonus for me to give her. She loves everything about it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the quality of Vera Wang Princess. I began running low on my current perfume and did not want to travel 1.45 hrs to the nearest perfume shop so I figured I would see what amazon had to offer. When I came across this deal I was floored to know that I could get an entire gift set for such an amazing price! I ordered the set after reading some reviews about the dealer and could not be happier. The fragrance is just as incredible as I remember it and the shipping was so fast and the package was delivered without any complications. I will order from this company again if I see similar deals :) happy amazon customer :) :)</li>
