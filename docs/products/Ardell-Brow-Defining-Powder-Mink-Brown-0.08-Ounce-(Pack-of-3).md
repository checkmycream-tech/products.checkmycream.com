      <li>It is not too dark and not too light for someone who just wants a dash of color.  </li>
      <li>but the price was right enough for me to take a chance.  </li>
      <li>I have been using eyebrow powder for many years, but I couldn&#x27;t find my usual brand, so I ordered these.  </li>
      <li>I do have a different, higher quality brush but the one that comes with it works in a pinch.</li>
      <li>the powder seems to go on really smooth when I use a little bit of lotion to my eyebrow area.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
      <li>I does last the whole day and beat the old eye brow pencil.  </li>

      <li>and I brush the powder over and they look natural.</li>
      <li>I also apply the powder with a slanted soft brow makeup brush.</li>
      <li>I thought the color would be a little darker, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>And they never seem to grow back normal after that.</li>
      <li>no drag queen</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I own this product and it works</li>
      <li>Color is nice, my only complaint is the powder is a little loose</li>
      <li>You only need a little bit of this to give you full, dark coverage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was pleased with price and the amount of product-will probably last 10 years. The color is very deep and slightly auburn so I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> You only need a little bit of this to give you full, dark coverage. I really like it! I&#x27;m a brunette and it is the perfect shade for me:) It&#x27;s going to take a long time to use up a pack of three though! Wish you could get it in a single pack.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, but I don&#x27;t use it as brow color.  I have badly thinning hair in front and on top.  This camoflauges those spots beautifully!  It stays on until I wash it out.  I&#x27;ve tried some of the expensive hair thinning products like Topix, and I wouldn&#x27;t give this brow color up for three free cases of that stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so beautiful!  It is very easy to apply and a little goes a very long way.  I love that it looks 100% natural even when you extend the brow line.  It is a cinch to make your brows look fuller and glamorous!  This three pack will last a longggg time&amp;it&#x27;s a fantastic price.  The mink brown is the perfect color for my dark brows.</li>
    <li> I like the way it stays on all day.. Color works well for me since I have dark hair. Slight reddish undertone. Brush works well to comb hair into place and apply color.</li>
    <li> Very good product, dose what they say I dose. Also I got a very good service. Received  my package on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Ardell brow powder is the truth......I am amazed how well this work. It is better than the top brands I have used ladies you cant go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted!  It looks so natural and blends well with my brow color.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I used to use eyebrow shadow for my eyebrows.  This is much better.  You may think they are the same thing but they aren&#x27;t.  Eyebrow powder is actually made for eyebrows - made to go on hair.  Works much better than the eyeshadow.  I also have oily skin which means even my eyebrows produce oil during the day and eyeshadow didn&#x27;t last very long at all.  But this brow powder does.  Great stuff.  Now the mink brown brow shadow I actually use as liner on my lower lid.  But the soft black Ardell is what I use on my brows.  It is not brown, it is a soft black (before I discovered this, I was using dark gray eyeshadow).  It is for people who have black eyebrows.  You don&#x27;t need much. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I thought the color would be a little darker, but it&#x27;s not bad.  I does last the whole day and beat the old eye brow pencil.  Looks more natural than the pencil.</li>
    <li> This product was too light for my brow color. I&#x27;ve used brow powders that go from dry to wet. This product becomes extremely mushy when wet.</li>
    <li> I was using this product for a while until I notice I could not get it anymore at the stores, I just love the product. I had my eyebrows tattoo a while back and I brush the powder over and they look natural. I will recommend this to anyone that likes a natural way of makeup. I use the mink brown for eyeliner and the taupe for my eyebrows. I thank Amazon.com for making it easier for me to get this product from Ardell.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it came in a pack of three. I have tried similar products and even expensive product like the Benefit brand, but that one doesn&#x27;t last long and gets a greasy eyebrow. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow powder on the market</li>
    <li> This is my first time using eyebrow powder.  I was worried I&#x27;d get 3 of the wrong color but the price was right enough for me to take a chance.  Glad I did.</li>
    <li> Love this color, I use it in conjunction with my taupe eyebrow powder. Only complaint I have is the brush that comes with it.  It&#x27;s very stiff, and I prefer the soft brushes. On another note the powder is awesome, and I purchased a slanted soft brush separately.</li>
    <li> Best Eyebrow powder available. Way better then pencils too. Give professional look</li>
    <li> Color is nice, my only complaint is the powder is a little loose so it does flake on your skin a little when you first apply, but nothing too outrageous. Stays put all day, blends well with liner.</li>
    <li> Mink Brown in the Ardell brow Defining powder is wonderful. It looks so natural and the color stays on all day. I never need a touch up unless I wipe my brow by mistake. Even if I sweat it doesn&#x27;t come off. It will only come off if I wipe with a tissue or rub it or wash it off with soap and water. I love it and use it every day. When I was a younger woman I started to puck them and went overboard with it. And they never seem to grow back normal after that. Then I went and out and got permanent brow tattoos. Now they faded with the age and the sun and after doing it twice over the years I don&#x27;t want to put that needle in my skin again. So I went to using pencil. The pencil gives it a heavily made up look. So when I started with the Ardell powder I couldn&#x27;t believe how beautiful and natural my brows look. I also apply the powder with a slanted soft brow makeup brush. I don&#x27;t like the one they include in the package. It&#x27;s too short and too stiff. But I love it and I use nothing else. I even ordered like 4 of them. I always afraid of them discontinuing something that you really love and works great! Also a little tip...the powder seems to go on really smooth when I use a little bit of lotion to my eyebrow area. And the powder color is really rich so you don&#x27;t need a lot to get great results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have dark brown eyebrows and I have trouble finding something that matches and doesn&#x27;t rub off. I could not find this color anymore at any of our local stores and so when I saw this on Amazon I snatched it up!! The price is great considering what I would pay for one in the stores!</li>
    <li> I really like this powder for my eyebrows.  I also use it for my hair line when my silver lining starts to show.  It covers really well and is a very good color for me.</li>
    <li> Great to use as an eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I have been using eyebrow powder for many years, but I couldn&#x27;t find my usual brand, so I ordered these.  The jar-like opackage is easier to use than the flip top plastic box and the powder is very easy to get on the brush without scraping.  The set of three is much less expensive than the other type and should last for many years.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it came in a three pack, but for the price it was great!  I even got the right color!  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> The application of this powder is so smooth and it sets nicely with or without brow gel..&lt;br /&gt;I luv it. A touch to light for me considering my hair is pretty dark.. I just line and blend with a dark brown pencil. I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering more in the future. So yes! I give it 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> fills in the brow very nice.</li>
    <li> Buy went with no issue. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> very messy and hard to come off...looks very elegant otherwise jsut very message to take off...makeup remover doesn&#x27;t work as good..</li>
    <li> True to color.  Stays on amazing</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brow powder!  I bought several but would buy more as needed.  Tried other online web sites before I found it here.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This worked well on the eyebrows but it is too light for me. I have dark eyebrows (black) so it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me. Probably better if your eyebrows are a shade lighter than black though</li>
    <li> This is and has been the only eyebrow makeup I&#x27;ve used for the last 2-3 years. I do have a different, higher quality brush but the one that comes with it works in a pinch. I usually brush a bit of translucent powder over it to help it set and to soften the edges. I have very dark brown hair and this is perfect- no drag queen (although I love drag queens) brows during the day and using a powder is always a much more natural look than using a pencil. Highly recommend and absolutely worth the price. With every day use, each jar should last at least 5 months.</li>
    <li> Why do they have to sell this item in packs of 3?! It&#x27;s going to take awhile to use ONE, let alone THREE! Well I guess I have my lifestyle supply of it. Anyone want to buy my other 2 unopened, unused items?? Good color and easy to put on, haven&#x27;t had any complaints yet. But then again I haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot. I use it to fill in my brows because I have super thin brows. Realistically I should&#x27;ve gotten black, but I thought black might look too stark, but this brown might be too light (and reddish) for my natural black hair.</li>
    <li> This product fits the bill for making your eyebrows look as fresh as the makeup on your face.  It is not too dark and not too light for someone who just wants a dash of color.  Excellent product...pick up a few so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to find powder eyebrow makeup, which I prefer to eyebrow pencils.  Powder gives a much more natural look.  This product goes on very smoothly and looks great.  The brush is too short so I use my own.</li>
    <li> +This is the first time I have use this brand.  I  prefer the brush to be in the case.  Otherwise everything was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Karen Kienast Wife</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with all the products I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
    <li> bought it for my cousin, totally loves it!</li>
    <li> The brush needs to be thinner and softer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I own this product and it works -Amazingly-. I got hooked on it when I borrowed it from my sister to try out, and I really thought it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference- my brows look fantastic! I don&#x27;t usually do this, but I&#x27;m definitely going to submit a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But $12? Are you SERIOUS? I can get it for $3 at the drugstore. Come on.</li>
    <li> Everything i expected i love this product!just glad i found it since i haven seen it in stores lately. Great</li>
