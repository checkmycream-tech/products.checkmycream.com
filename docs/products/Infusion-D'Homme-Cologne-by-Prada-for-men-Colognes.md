    <li> Its ok! kinda soapy but a different scent...</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but a pleasant cologne.  A bit over priced</li>
    <li> Smells great and not over powering. Can use daily! My wife really likes it! I get head aches from most smelly stuff, but not this.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is pure elegance. For me is one of those smells that are good smelling all day long. When you spray by accident on clothing and smell it the next day, smell is still there. I use: diesel by diesel, light blue d&amp;g, rochas and nautica voyage -- and I can tell you infusion d&#x27;homme is now my signature.</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my husband. It&#x27;s the only fragrance we both like. I know he gets lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Amazing, bought it for my husband and he loves it and I love the way it smells on him! came to me brand new in the box!</li>

    <li> My Springtime morning scent. Clean and non-offensive.</li>
