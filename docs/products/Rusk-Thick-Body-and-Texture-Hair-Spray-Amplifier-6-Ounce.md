      <li>Thanks, Rusk.</li>

      <li>Works very well.  </li>

      <li>and it gives me nice messy beachy almost-curls.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, isn&#x27;t too heavy, oily or sticky.</li>
      <li>This product, in spite of some good reviews, did nothing except make my fine hair even more limp (as in DEAD), and dried out.  </li>
      <li>Have been loosing my hair since getting older.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>It makes my fine hair look thick and full.  </li>

      <li>My hair is very fine, straight and limp as well as being thin on the top.  </li>
      <li>Same exact product my wife has been buying from her salon</li>
      <li>Ive tried so many products and am usually diappointed.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
      <li>My wife has been buying this from a local salon and really likes the product, when the salon ran out I found it online for her</li>

      <li>Smells ok,  not great</li>
      <li>I have coarse, but not thick, oily scalp but dry hair.</li>
      <li>I have very thin, fine hair that is always flat and limp by the end of the day but not any more thanks to Thick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that just don&#x27;t work well, or they make my hair feel dirty the first time I use the product.  </li>

<li> Rusk Thick really helps add volume without that \\&quot;crunchiness\\&quot;.</li>
<li> I feel that you just can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Rusk products, and Thick is the one I use the most!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it works on my frizzy hair!</li>
<li> and I blow dry and style it every day.</li>
<li> You just spray it in and dry.</li>
<li> Not worth sending it back.</li>
<li> But I always felt like by the time I actually left my house to go out my hair was limp again...</li>
<li> &quot; I use only a squirt on each side of the front bang area when wet, then blow dry as usual.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed in the bottle. Will not spray. Not worth sending it back.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really volumizes without making hair sticky.  Tried everything on the market, this is a winner.</li>
    <li> Same exact product my wife has been buying from her salon only this is a better price even with the shipping. Works great on her hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using it to help create a more voluminous bang area which has sadly  thinned with \\&quot;age.\\&quot; I use only a squirt on each side of the front bang area when wet, then blow dry as usual. The hair does appear maybe slightly thicker...to me. It dries without any residue, not sticky, or crunchy. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> Lightweight texture works great with fine hair</li>
    <li> I applied this after I washed my hair with bumble bee and bumble bee thickening shampoo and conditioner. After I blow dried with a round brush. There really was no difference. I couldn&#x27;t even feel any product in my hair. If I could return this I would.</li>
    <li> Thick is a great product.  It works really well on my fine hair when I use an electric comb dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses it on me and gets better results.  It probably does as advertised but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; and&lt;br /&gt;b/t/w it doesn&#x27;t claim to...</li>
    <li> Just want to add one more rave--this product really works. My flat, thin hair now has body and looks alive. I hope to keep using Thick forever.</li>
    <li> I have medium-fine, wavy hair, cut into longish layers. Rusk Thick really helps add volume without that \\&quot;crunchiness\\&quot;. it&#x27;s lightweight and not sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Works for me! Thanks, Rusk.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rusk products for a few years now. I love the whole Rusk line. I feel that you just can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Rusk products, and Thick is the one I use the most!</li>
    <li> Where has Rusk Thick been all my life???  My hair is very fine, straight and limp as well as being thin on the top.  I found this to be the best I have ever used.  It&#x27;s not heavy so my hair is not weighed down plus I can go two days in betweek washings.  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m on my first bottle and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is the best for fine straight hair. Gives body and volume. I spray all over after using a volumizer at the roots.</li>
    <li> Love this.  No crunchy hair,  and fluffs me up just enough.  Smells ok,  not great but you only smell it while you&#x27;re spraying it.  I  actually saw this at Tj Maxx so I&#x27;ll get it there next time and save a couple bucks.  Good stuff,  though.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that is frizzy.  Ive tried so many products and am usually diappointed.  This thickening spray is awesome.  It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell and it doesn&#x27;t seem that you can use too much.</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying this from a local salon and really likes the product, when the salon ran out I found it online for her and it was a few dollars cheaper than the salon, even with the shipping.</li>
    <li> This product actually does what it claims.  It gives body to super-fine hair, making it hold a style as if it were much thicker.</li>
    <li> Does a good job to make my hair appear thicker and with volume.  Easy to apply...sprays neatly and feels clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It is just the best for fine, thin hair. It adds volume without making the hair feel sticky. Also, curling iron styles seem to last longer. The strands of hair feel like there is some weight to them without weighing the hair down. Initially, I didn&#x27;t spray on enough, then used too much, but learned that it works best if I spray all my hair a medium amount.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair whatsoever.  My hair feels brittle when I spray on this product.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look any thicker.  As a matter of fact, it seems to take OUT the natural bounce in my hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I have very thin, fine hair that is always flat and limp by the end of the day but not any more thanks to Thick. This spray does exactly what it says. It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and leaves your hair feeling fuller without any kind of residue at all. Highly recommned!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It thickens my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it sticky. You just spray it in and dry. Works great.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Adds volume without making hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> My beautician used this on my hair at my last haircut and I had to have it. It really adds life to fine limp hair.</li>
    <li> Good product, works as described.</li>
    <li> My friend who has thinning hair swears by this but I bought it and used it 3 times and it has sat in my closet ever since bc I saw no results. This item is a pass.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a wonderful result from this product.  However, my friend loves this product.  She gets visible results, while I do not.  It must be a difference in hair types.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and even though I keep it cut short I still need help with extra body.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that just don&#x27;t work well, or they make my hair feel dirty the first time I use the product.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that and it adds the extra body and texture that makes styling my hair much easier.  It doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to do a good job so a bottle lasts a long time.  This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue to order it as needed.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This works great for fine limp hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair! Got this as a free sample &amp; it makes my hair so soft &amp; manageable! I love it! I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it works on my frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It really made my hair thicker.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my fine hair look thick and full.  I wish I could find it and purchase it locally.</li>
    <li> Fast Service - Product is as it was described and pictured! I will shop with them again in the future :)!</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what I was looking for! Cheaper to buy here than in stores! I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have thin soft hair and I blow dry and style it every day. R T B gives me what I want and need. I love it..</li>
    <li> Great products great deal</li>
    <li> I use this product solely for the smell.  It does not leave any residue in my hair.  Whether it gives it volume, not so sure!</li>
    <li> Does help a lot, but my hair is just so thin now.  This products smells great.</li>
    <li> This product, in spite of some good reviews, did nothing except make my fine hair even more limp (as in DEAD), and dried out.  Would never purchase again nor recommend!</li>
    <li> Have been loosing my hair since getting older.  This really gives my hair more body.  Everyone tells me they can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m loosing my hair.  I have just ordered some more.</li>
    <li> very nice hair product!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I have coarse, but not thick, oily scalp but dry hair. I spray this in and tousle it and it gives me nice messy beachy almost-curls. Smells nice, isn&#x27;t too heavy, oily or sticky.</li>
    <li> I bought this after purchasing some of Rusk&#x27;s W8LESS hairspray (LOVE LOVE) and some of its Moroccan type oil (also love) so I assumed I would love this too after reading the reviews. At first I thought it was pretty fab (had never used any other root lifter thickener before), it gave me some lift and made my hair thicker. But I always felt like by the time I actually left my house to go out my hair was limp again...ugh! Thought it must just be my hair, until I bought the Generic root lifter at a Sally&#x27;s Salon...and oh my BAM! Big,lifted,thick hair that stayed ALL day and night! So its definitely not my hair,its this product. Bummed it doesn&#x27;t work because I am usually a big Rusk fan</li>
    <li> Have been using Thick for years. i have been blessed with wonderful hair but this product just makes it even better. Thick is for everyone. It will enhance any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I  lke it better than mousse.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I live in the south where the heat and humidity takes a toll on ones hair.  My hairdresser recommended  this and I tried it.....that was over a year ago.  Now it&#x27;s all I use.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product if you want more body in your hair. I&#x27;d used this in the past and then forgot about it. But my sister&#x27;s hair looked really great a while back, and when  I asked her what she was doing differently, she said the was using &amp;#34;Thick&amp;#34;! It arrived at my doorstep quickly, the price was right, and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before - cannot find it locally - glad you are there to help those who cannot find products they love</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  Someone else told me about it, and I ordered it.  It&#x27;s way better than mousse for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Works for our family.</li>
    <li> Great product. I do use a cleaning shampoo once a week. Makes my fine, but plentiful hair, have tons of body.</li>
    <li> I really the volumn this product gives my hair.</li>
    <li> The texture aspect to the hair is not as a good hold.  If the hair dries before you finished bow drying it will become like egg whites difficult to comb.</li>
</ol>
