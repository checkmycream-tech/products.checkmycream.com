<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  An excellent product.</li>
    <li> moisturized but made my face break out</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product - I am 62 years of age and have somewhat dry skin - this product keeps my face moisturized and looks almost glowing.</li>
    <li> NOT for people sensitive to Vitamin A. I found out too late that I can not use any products with Retinol which is Vitamin A. Now, I can not use any of the products and can not return.  Gave me a horrible rash, took forever to find out what was causing it. Too late to return!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Doesn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years &amp; I live it , I&#x27;m 55 and this stuff makes my skin soft &amp; smooth , takes away the dull -</li>
    <li> This is by far the best serum I&#x27;ve ever purchased, it smells wonderful your skin absorbs it quickly it appears to have the consistency of oil however, it does not leave a residue I have been using it for about a month or so I no longer have any type of breakouts and my skin looks so much younger I highly recommend this over all serums, and I can easily compare this ranking higher than anew, Estée Lauder perfectionist and night advantage don&#x27;t even come close to this stuff and the price is amazing also!</li>
    <li> i like it. it smells fresh and my skin gets softer after use.</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily after I have used the Gratiae Cleansing Lotion.  It is readily absorbed into the skin making it feel soft and supple.  I appreciate being able to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I apply it into my face and neck every morning&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin moist immediately after applying&lt;br /&gt;It,s great!</li>
    <li> Happy to have found this product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me!!?!  The first time I put this one wrinkles, the haggard look disappeared almost completely.  A few times later my skin looks amazing.  much smoother and fresher looking.&lt;br /&gt;The forehead lines above your nose are almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing my skin after a month of Gatiae.&lt;br /&gt;Either way, the improvement is so amazing I am going to order 2 more to have on hand</li>
    <li> I received a sample at a dept store and was intriqued so I ordered it on Amazon and I am very pleased, the serum leaves the skin soft and supple and cuts down on shine the entire day.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> For me it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Expensive for what results you will experience.  Won&#x27;t hurt to use it but probably won&#x27;t see results.  Want a lift see a surgeon.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product to see what the brand was all about. First, it smells amazing - slightly citrus with a light floral note. Second, when I applied it, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy. I have combination skin, so I was a bit worried it might make me look super shiny, but it didn&#x27;t at all. It makes my skin feel like butter, so soft and luxurious. I freaked out my boyfriend because I just kept petting my face. You won&#x27;t regret this product at all, and the price is perfect. I can&#x27;t wait to try more from this brand!</li>
    <li> Wife has tried a lot of facial products over the years,some over the counter others online only,but she rates this the best.</li>
    <li> kind of irritated as i ordered this product in october and accidentally dropped it, it being glass broke everywhere. i loved it when i used it then so much definitely would have rated it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i then ordered this product again a few weeks ago and i honestly don&#x27;t feel its the same product for some reason.. the quality, smell, feeling is all off to me. kind of bummed.</li>
    <li> I bought this on my husband&#x27;s account - Wrinkles are coming quick for me at 51, after a week I could actually see how the large smile lines were minimized-I mean I saw a lot of change! I had been buying more expensive serums and moisturizers (clinique and others), but I have not seen anything make a difference, really.  This serum is very thick and gooey like honey, but it works!!! and the bottle is big! Those expensive little bottles of serum did not seem to help - I&#x27;m impressed.  I will look no further, ever!</li>
    <li> Could not be without it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and everyone asks what do I use on my face because it looks glowing.  I would recommend this product to everyone who wants younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I loved it. Send 2 more bottles.</li>
    <li> I have not had this product long enough to determine if it really lifts, But I can say this feels so good on your skin.  I love.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Go look up a few other reviews. I went to the mall. I always tell those people at the kiosks no thanks but this time they wouldn&#x27;t take no for an answer. I paid 250 for products that are 20 dollars on Amazon AND they charged me for a product I did not even get and I believe they did it knowingly. I am scared now they even saw my credit card number too. What a scam. do more searches you will see for yourself.  I paid 90% more than it&#x27;s worth plus tax (outrageous here in Fla and you would not pay the tax online)</li>
    <li> This is amazing, first time I used it was by accident, I was on vacation with my sister and I grabbed her serum instead and boy I wont use anything else on my face. My husband starting using it too so I hide it now...lol</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Excelent product&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again</li>
    <li> Just love this face serum. Makes your face look young and feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I have size 39. But this shoes with size 39 was not right to me. It was too small</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My poor face has suffered enough with out it. Adult acne has had it&#x27;s way for too long. I have tried just about everything and this one is a keeper. My face loves this stuff. I want to wash my face several times a day now because I love applying this serum to my clean face and my neck.</li>
    <li> The results are visible in weeks. My skin seems revitaliced and the product helpled contour my flacid areas. cheek and chin.</li>
    <li> This was given to my girlfriend as a gift.  She says that it&#x27;s very moisturizing and makes her face feel extremely soft. She said she&#x27;d like another bottle once this once runs out.</li>
    <li> Sheeeeeesh this makes my face feel sooooooo goood! I have really oily skin so I was hesitant to try it, but I will not lie, the SMELL made me try it out. It smells so amazing. It just makes your skin feel like silk. You can&#x27;t beat the amazon price!  A steal! GET THIS STUFF!!! You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually lifts, but it does create the softest skin I&#x27;ve ever had and prevents my typical breakouts!</li>
    <li> This really works I was very skeptical in the beginning but after 2 weeks noticed a big difference in my complexion and not greasy at all soaked right in I would definitely continue to use it</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this while I had it.  Unfortunately I dropped it on my tile floor and it broke (glass bottle), so i can&#x27;t rate it for more than a couple weeks of use.  It was a great consistency...not too thin or too thick.  Didn&#x27;t bother my skin.  Hard to rate much when you haven&#x27;t used for very long.</li>
    <li> Really oily and the perfume smell is very strong. Not sure if I like it for my face.</li>
    <li> I had bought this cream before, but paid a fortune.  Bought it again with Amazon for a great price.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s light weight and has a great smell. Make up spokes on smooth with it.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and leaves your skin baby smooth, without feeling greasy or oily.  Also, no breakouts and love that it is oil-free.</li>
    <li> Best face serum ever.  Non irritating and really smoothes out the skin/complexion.  Gets rid of redness.  Feels a bit oily when you first apply.  Let it sink into skin for a few minutes then apply moisturizer and then wait a minute before applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase on Amazon.com for a fraction of the retail price.  All certified organic ingredients .... LOVE IT!!!  You will see immediate results and people will notice.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference after using this product.  Will buy it again once I run out.  I am also using other products along with this.</li>
    <li> My wife got a sample at the mall, and this is a great product and the price being offered is worth it.</li>
    <li> Perfectly described, neatly packed and shipped superfast. will definitely order from SA Products again.  Already started using it and it feels wonderful on my face.</li>
    <li> The facial serum is a thick serum very much like their eye serum.  You only use a very small amount so the bottle will last for a long time.  The price is very reasonable, I have seen this product for as much as $350 in Las Vegas. It makes a noticeable difference immediately.  When combined with the eye serium and lifting creme, your face has a more youthful look.  It truely reduces the lines and the skin appears to look lifted.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results. I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but thanks God I bought this. The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and the eye serum for two years. I started getting compliments on my complexion shortly after I started. I am 49 and my skin looks fresher, and more radiant, and almost no eye wrinkles anymore! I love these products. I am glad I found them on Amazon for such a great price. I also recommend the Vivo Per Lei facial peel. It rounds out my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I didn&#x27;t notice any lifting action. It feels more like a silicone type base I have used under mineral powder makeup. It wasn&#x27;t bad for my skin, I just didn&#x27;t see the results I was looking for in this product after using for over 2 weeks daily.</li>
    <li> I got this from looking at all the great reviews. Ive been using it 2-3 times daily for a week and dont feel its doing anything at all. When I put it on, the perfume factor is very very strong. It does absorb quickly. However, it does not appear to be doing anything for my skin. It seems they are marketing something that is truly just a slippery substance with perfume in it.  I will keep using it in hopes of something happening, but definitely wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> false advertising, it does not instantly fix your wrinkles and hasn&#x27;t yet after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Serum made me break out, so I used it for my hands instead...good absorption.</li>
    <li> IT IS OKAY,BUT THE COVER VERY LOOSE AND IT CAME OUT  EASILY. THE SAME THING AS EYE SERUM .I AM HOPING THIS CAN BE FIX.</li>
    <li> good product at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Recently started to use the facial serum before using the lifting moisture cream and the combination has really made a difference. On reading other reviews I find I was not the only one to be taken in at a Vegas kiosk but loved the products.  Have used the eye serum/cream and lifting moisture face cream so at the low price I could add the serum to my routine.  As described by others it is thick so use sparingly but it absorbs well.  Follow with the cream for maximum results.  Trust me I&#x27;m a Senior and have compliments all the time on my youthful looking skin!!!!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin very smooth. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it. I first bought it in the mall, but forget that. Amazon has it for a fraction of the mall price.</li>
    <li> Finally received serum after 2nd request. The size is wonderful, should last a while, which is pleasant.  So far, it&#x27;s ok, I use it daily, but will really know the effects in about 30 days.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It&#x27;s silky smooth and although it is initially greasy, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling DELICIOUS! I use it on my Hands and arms too, leaves them so soft. Works great under your makeup, you put it on and it drys super quick, leaving a really smooth foundation for mineral powder. You only need a little so it goes a long way. The bottle is a good size. Haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes in my skin, but I don&#x27;t really use it as regularly as I should. I also bought that Egyptian Magic Cream but I find that is way too greasy.  I&#x27;m ordering 2 more of this serum before they are not available. At this low price its amazing!</li>
    <li> nice texture, nice dispenser, however bottomline is I am not sure if this is any different then putting argan oil on your face?&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice smell, but I am not sure if I would buy it again a little however does go a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just like argan oil no way to wear it during the day, if you wear it at night, put your bang from your hair back.&lt;br /&gt;Also at times I use a bit of argan oil in my hair, rub it in my palms before just like 2 drops , makes it very shiny, there is not way you can do it with this product. And I know it is labeled serum, but I guess all I am saying is the argan oil is more a multi use product and cheaper</li>
    <li> Leaves a smooth primer type finish on the skin.  I like it well enough as a primer, though I don&#x27;t see obvious &amp;#34;Lifting&amp;#34; benefits beyond moisturizing the skin, which is plumped a little by all moisturizers.. After trying several lifting products, I have come to the conclusion that word lifting is just manipulative to convince women to try a new line of products.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, especially for the price. It smells great and makes my skin supple and glowing. I am not sure about actually having any long term lifting effects but I like using it anyway</li>
    <li> I know reading a lot of reviews on this product how we mention about getting pulled into a Gratiae shop &amp; being told how they sell the item for $300 but being able to be cut a special deal this day only. This also happened to me &amp; I was suckered into buying the product for a low price of $90, but am glad I did. I&#x27;ve tried MANY moisturizers &amp; eye serums &amp; they all tend to cause my skin to break out, but NOT these products. I own this product, the eye serum &amp; eye cream and they&#x27;re all wonderful! They each make my skin look &amp; feel great and no breakouts!! :)  I&#x27;m SO happy to see that Amazon is selling these products at a much more reasonable price! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way.  my skin feels soft and subtle.  it really hydrates.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I use this serum with other products.  Although I do love the fragrance and feel of this product I can&#x27;t say it works with &amp;#34;Concentrated active ingredients to transform your skin in seconds from being saggy, tired, and dull to being lifted, refreshed, and radiant&amp;#34;, as stated.  In &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; is going a bit far.  It is a very thick serum that after application leaves a very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feeling on your skin until it is slowly absorbed which is a bit annoying.  It is the serum I use before retiring for the night...not in the morning.  Dispenses a bit slow and you feel the dispensing mechanism is faulty, but its not, the serum is just very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has it helped?  Well it hasn&#x27;t hurt, but there are no &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; fixes.  No doubt my skin feels smoother.  I&#x27;m 64 and actually still fairly wrinkle free due mostly to good genes and the fact I have taken care of my skin since I was 18, but the eventual sagging has slightly started to occur and I am hoping with these new facial serums to put the skids on that.  So far so good....but it is NOT an instant anything so don&#x27;t expect to see changes in &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; or over-night....you will have to give it some time.</li>
    <li> I tried these products several years ago on a vaction trip to Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;The products lasted a long time as very little has to be used to achieve&lt;br /&gt;desired results. I&#x27;m glad I was was able to find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The cost is great. Saw visible difference immediately. Wrinkles and age spots continued to disappear with use. I can now go out without make up and feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> Could not and would not live with out this!! First time ordering the facial serum as I usually only get they eye serum and cream so i was quite happy with this product.</li>
    <li> feels great on my skin. I use it every night under miosturiser&lt;br /&gt;absolutely love it. Goes on smooth and my skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great value for the money.  The serum feels luxurious going on.  My skin is very dry, and it moisturizes pretty well (not great) throughout the day.  For the best result, it must be used with the Organics Lifting Moisture Cream.  I have not observed any lifting though, but then I haven&#x27;t observed any lifting from any other very pricey serums I have purchased either.  Overall, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Business Lady</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels after using this product.  It only takes a little bit so lasts long.  When I first put it on it seemed greasy but it quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves it soft.</li>
    <li> A+ my skin is smoother less dry areas and wrinckles are less noticible - will buy again&lt;br /&gt;the price is great</li>
    <li> I was in Vegas a couple of years back and was approached by a predatory sales person with the product.  The product was outrageously expensive but I would gladly pay it again because I was introduced to it. Because amazon sells it, I can get the product at a fraction of the cost and still get all of the benefits of a superb product.  This products helps bring elasticity back to your skin.  The serum leaves your skin feeling silky versus oily.  If you experience patches of dry, flaky skin, this serum will correct it.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it makes my face smoother but is a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have a moisturizer as well?</li>
    <li> At nearly 70 years, it doesn&#x27;t seem to eliminate wrinkles but it does soften them some and makes my face feel good and softer so...I will probably continue to use it when I can purchase at a somewhat reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it almost 5 years. Their facial cleansers is great also. I&#x27;ve introduced it to some of my relatives they love it too!</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth. I love the way it feels. It only takes a little to go a long way.</li>
    <li> I used the facial serum for the first time this weekend and loved it. I plan to order the facial mask and moisturizing cream for a better result. I am very please with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this lifting facial serum - it works!  It really helps to lift your skin and keep it moisturized.  It really helps in lifting the skin under the neck area.</li>
    <li> This was so greasy that I couldn&#x27;t stand for it to be on my face.</li>
    <li> I love it. I will continue to buy it as long as I live. I use it every morning and night. My skin looks great because of it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and always have hives due to being out in the sun, so I am always a bit scared of buying a product and spending money that it might make things worse. I love this product, a little goes along ways.  I only use it at night.  I have noticed and so has my hubby that my hives have lessened and my face looks brighter and has softened my wrinkles, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is just the greatest.  I use it twice a day AM &amp; PM and it makes my skin look wonderful.  I get complements on my skin all the time.</li>
    <li> Ok, so not sure if this has any long term results, but gives excellent instant results. Makes the little bit of tinted moisturizer I use stay all day and skin looks fresh.</li>
    <li> Product is good, however it leaked into the packaging, so I did not get a full bottle. Can&#x27;t give it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t get the whole bottle!</li>
    <li> Just a drop or two spread with fingertips over my entire face, let it set/soak for a minute or two and my face feels soft all day long.  It is worth the price I paid on Amazon, certainly not what I originally paid for it while vacationing in Key West.</li>
    <li> so silky when applying. feels oily at first, but is instantly absorbed and does NOT leave my face shiny or greasy looking. Where does it go? I don&#x27;t know--great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and is not greasy. Not sure if its firming but it feels good and my skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> In almost every review that I have read about Gratiae organic lifting cream, everyone seems compelled to mention how much cheaper they are on Amazon. Please keep in mind that the vendors read these reviews also. If you persist in doing this the products will no longer be affordable. I have seen this happen. Please keep this in mind when posting your reviews.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and well worth the price, I am really happy I bought it, it looks a little shiny when you put it on but if you wait a minute it absorbs in and feels great.</li>
    <li> I will never know the effectiveness because after applying, I had a tingling sensation and an hour later, broke out into hives.</li>
    <li> This item had leaked out some in the box.  This was my first order thru Amazon.  Reference product Item Lifting Facial Serum.</li>
    <li> I really like how this Gratiae serum doesn&#x27;t have a greasy after effect. My skin absorbs it quickly. Like it!</li>
    <li> love love love this product.</li>
    <li> Not what it said it was going to do Sent back.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Feels great and the oil soaks in right away. Will keep on using it</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.THE BEST I EVER USED. MY SKIN HAS NEVER FELT SO SOFT AND MY MAKEUP GOES ON SO SMOOTHLY AND THE BEST PART, I NEVER HAVE TO RETOUCH my makeup once I put it on.. LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> like the majority of people on here- I was approached by a vendor at the mall and got suckered in to trying the products (they are very pushy). I&#x27;ll admit- when I saw my face with the products, it appeared that my fine lines had diminished. Naturally, I figured this was a temporary result and would fade after about 10 minutes. I told the sales guy I would come back after I verified it worked- but then when I found out the ridiculous price- just left. I&#x27;m pretty sure the serum gives a dramatic improvement for about 5 minutes...then disappears.&lt;br /&gt; I got home and found the same products on amazon for a fraction of the cost, so figured what the hell, I&#x27;ll try the serum. I do question whether it&#x27;s the same product as the packaging was not the quality one would expect from a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; facial product. While the serum seems fine, I like the texture and smell, I can see no improvements/results from using it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;Hate&amp;#34; the product but I don&#x27;t love it. I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying again. I think it&#x27;s more  or less a con, I could  Olay and get better results...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a difference :( sorry</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Order it regularly. Love the smell and feel of the product!!! Great price!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used it for a couple of years</li>
    <li> I first used the oil cleanser from Gold bought from one of the Gratiae pop up shops at silly prices, I paid 60 and also had a free face scrub [which is equally brilliant]  I was blown away by these excellent products so have no regrets in paying the higher price but after finding the same products at a fraction of the price offered on Amazon I decided to order their face, eye creams and serums and had them forwarded to me by a friend in the States, I absolutely love the serum, it is slightly thicker than the eye serum but also melts into your skin, excellent!</li>
    <li> It should  be good for dry skin. I did not notice a big difference after using up one bottle. It did not hurt my skin either.</li>
    <li> still applying takes a little time for results, so far so good</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the facial serum before but I do use the eye serum and cream and really like them. I have been using Loreal dark spot remover cream but once using this facial serum I have been seeing even better improvements to those dark/age spots. Will continue to use and see what happens in a few months.</li>
    <li> Lightweight moisture for your entire face, retails over $200, so a deal here!</li>
    <li> Nice facial serum.  Like an oil, but it blends in nicely.</li>
    <li> over hyped. I&#x27;m glad I paid what I did for it because there is no way I would have paid the MSRP</li>
    <li> Product arrived when promised. I have been using the serum for several years &amp; am very pleased with it. Unlike other serums which make your skin feel tight, this serum makes your skin soft &amp; is a good base for your moisture cream. I was introduced to the product while visiting Las Vegas &amp; paid over one hundred dollars for it --  what a scam! I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in price on the Amazon site &amp; now, I buy all my Gratiae products on the Amazon site. I live in Canada &amp; many companies will ship here.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great -- a nice oil that isn&#x27;t greasy -- absorbs well and leaves skin soft and smooth. Plus, it shipped quickly and was a fantastic price, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I&#x27;ve used their eye serum for a few years and their facial serum for little under a year now. One bottle last for a couple months or longer. A little dab will do ya! You apply gently and relax while the serum sets in. No tingling, no funny feelings at all. I think it took less than a week for the fine lines to disappear if memory serves me correctly and approx. a week for a few of the more stubborn ones. Just love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and am in my 40&#x27;s. I was looking for a light serum to go under my moisturizer. This serum is thicker than I would like and didn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin. I had a couple of breakouts while I was using it. On the plus side, I really didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer cause this serum was enough. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin while using it. I guess it kept it hydrated because my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry. But I did notice some spots around my lip area that looked a little dry. I have been using this bottle for over three months and still have about 1/3 of the bottle left.  I doubt I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> so far so good ...i&#x27;ve only been using the serum for less than a month ...but i like the way it feels !</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my face - you would be amazed at what it does for your skin!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and the product is exactly what I purchase from a department store for the regular price.  Very happy!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Arrived half full spilled all over the box won&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> Smells so strong, feels greasy and does nothing for my skin. Threw most of it away and it was almost full.</li>
    <li> Best hand lotion ever! What? What did you say....hand lotion? Isn&#x27;t this for the face. Yes it is, but it did not do what it said it would do for my face, like diminish lines. I started using this on my hands, and lo and behold! the fine lines on my hands are disappearing and my hands do not look or feel like a dry piece of paper. I still use it on my face as well in hopes that it will work there also. So far, my complexion does look improved with a softer look, but no lifting or lessening of lines. I like the design of the pump. It dispenses just the right amount of serum each time, but the top doesn&#x27;t really close firmly. I&#x27;m not sure I will buy it again. If I don&#x27;t and my hands begin to get that lined and papery look again, I probably will.</li>
    <li> I like it, but probably need to alternate with other products for a better result.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is a genuine gratiae product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the serum.</li>
    <li> Love this! It is the real product not a knock off, and a much lower price. Makes my skin feel amazing, like I&#x27;m pouring silk on it I&#x27;m obsessed. Smells really good too but I&#x27;d imagine the strong fragrance might bother those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> But exp. Date is 9 months only.</li>
    <li> I use the Gratiae foam cleanser then I use the serum and my face feels silky smooth.  Will try the eye serum next.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the place to buy these products, prices are great.</li>
    <li> A little bit oily as expected. Not sure if it really works but I&#x27;ve been using it. I still look old so not sure about it. LOL</li>
    <li> so far I like it a lot.  We will see if it smooths out my wrinkles.  It feels good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I endorse buying this product from Amazon but not directly from Gratiae or at the kiosks in shopping centers.&lt;br /&gt;They charge outrageous prices for the same product.  I was told at the kiosk in Las Vegas that if I bought it from Amazon I would be buying outdated products.  Not true.  This product is date 2015 which is the same date as the ones at the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic.  I love how it makes my face feel.  I use it every night at bedtime.  Sometimes I add additional moisturizer if my skin is feeling dry, but usually this product is fine by itself.</li>
    <li> Goes on wonderfully smoothly and leaves my face looking younger and smoother.  Love the feel of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted for a facial serum.  However, it is not for humid climate use! I like it!</li>
    <li> This feels like silk on your face and disolves quickly and clean.  It is a wonderful product to use and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 5 years now. Won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
    <li> This serum feels amazing and smells divine!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year,  wroth every dine. I&#x27;m over fifty years old, I look like I&#x27;m in my thirty&#x27;s, Because of same type of product in this line.</li>
    <li> I love the Gratiae Organics product line. The only thing is, the bottling manufacturer needs to make a better cap that slips on (the one that doesn&#x27;t screw on) I purchased 2 facial products with this type of cap and both caps were off and leaked out during shipping and are pretty useless when using it to keep the product fresh. If you pick up the bottle by the cap the bottle will fall off. The cap doesn&#x27;t effect the lotion or serum but it may as well not be provided or at the very least, taped before shipping.</li>
    <li> Nothing is special and worth the money except its fragrance! Did nothing to my skin. It takes a lot of time to apply cause it needs like 5 to 10 minutes of massage to get rid of its oily texture. Then after moisturizing  takes another minute, if only this much of work was worth anything. Just a waste of time and money. I finished it half bottle and then got frustrated that I had to toss it off.</li>
    <li> This feels great and smells great and makes my skin feel very soft.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Moistens the face well with no side effects for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product. Works as advertised and is way cheaper than other places. Overall it was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how organic this actually is, but it does the job very well. I use one pump and it covers my entire face and neck. I let it absorb completely (it takes a couple minutes) and then apply eye cream and moisturizer. It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> I like  Gratiae Lifting Facial Serum, It tightens and smooths your skin. I used this product with the rest of the Gratiae products. First, use the facial cleansing lotion, toner, eye serum, facial lifting serum, eye cream &amp; face moisturizing cream.  This products are great.  I have been using for 4 months, I can definitely see the improvements in my face. My skin looks a lot better. I would recommend these products to anyone wanting to improve your skin, to look and feel younger.</li>
    <li> I love the serum, I feel and see the firmness of my face when I apply it and it makes your makeup glide on</li>
    <li> After ordering this product 4 times 3-4 years ago..I found it in the Mall they gave me several samples.  I loved it ..at the time I was working..so I ordered several 1.7 oz bottles..and the eye cream too...Both products were very good..so I return today in 2017 to again order this because it seemed to be a very good serum that really seemed to soften your face and neck and really felt good when you applied it...shocker today..when I ordered it back in 2014. The price was less than $12.00 per bottle of this Lifting Facial Serum..how can this item who&#x27;s manufacturers is no one I ever heard of charge $82.50 for this same item..now that I&#x27;m disabled...not employed. Living on disability afford this ..even I&#x27;d it did seem to lessen wrinkles...btw. it don&#x27;t. It is only a very good serum that softens the skin..wrinkles don&#x27;t get smaller erase..or even fade away. For this to have gone up so high in price is a rip off totally. Shame on this company. I obviously won&#x27;t be reordering it ever..I understand having to raise prices...due to marketing..however it does not even do what the claims say..don&#x27;t waste your money on this product..I&#x27;m sorry but the truth is the truth..I guess I will have to return to Coconut oil..it&#x27;s much cheaper and does just as well. Shame on this price gouging.  Had the price gone up $10- $12. I would have been more willing to pay that increase..not with this outrageous increase to this product that does not live up to its claims...</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the quality and results of this product. It is light and easily absorbed into my skin. I use it under my daytime moisturizer. I think it helps improve my skins smoothness and brightness. Great for those looking for organic and natural beauty products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed about this product! When it goes on it feels greasy, but it does eventually absorb well and I have not broke out at all since using it but if you are in a hurry in the morning it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I will say that it hydrates. But it does not lift. I have read all of the horror stories about unscrupulous vendors marketing this as some kind of miracle. I feel sorry for anyone who paid more than 20 bucks for this. Or for any of the products in this line. Though they are not bad, they are not worth hundreds of dollars a jar! But then I don&#x27;t think there is any topical skin care that is!&lt;br /&gt;I would probably purchase it again at the Amazon price, because it is very hydrating and seems to hold the moisture to your skin for a few hours, which is great for older skin.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 2 stars because it is not what it claims to be</li>
    <li> no lifting noticed after religious use...very oily so it helps my dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t lift...</li>
    <li> TRIED IT AT THE MALL IT WAS A MIRICAL..BOUGHT IT TWICE ON AMAZON...IT WAS A JOKE...WASTE OF MONEY.....IT WAS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT AS THE REAL STORE HAD</li>
    <li> While this item came intact and well-packaged (unlike the thermal mask and eye cream that came pre-opened and used), it does have an unusually thick and gooey consistency, so I&#x27;ve had to dilute it by mixing it with the moisturizer in my hand before application... Even though this product brand sells for way less on Amazon than in their boutiques, the quality is highly inconsistent. You can get pre-opened and used stuff, or maybe &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; items that have been sitting around for too long. I guess you do get what you paid for!</li>
    <li> I looked up the ingredients in this and indeed it contains things like jojoba oils which do combat wrinkles and are alleged to firm skin. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks and I can say this leaves my skin smelling great, feeling soft, and looking dewy. For 17 bucks, you cannot find a better deal, even through the actual maker of the solution. Good buy-and a little goes a long way, so this container will last months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so now and I like it - At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, it seemed a bit oily, but I think I was just using too much.</li>
    <li> This product works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before .... Outstanding</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use this and other Gratiae products that work miracles with my wrinkles which have become more noticable since I turned 50. My husband and friends have noticed an improvement and comment on how much younger I look.</li>
    <li> This made my face feel so smooth. The lifting is not as visible as I would like , but it is still a good product.</li>
    <li> Oily iverly fragranced. Stop using</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve used every serum on the market and these I really do love.  Just don&#x27;t buy them from the premier spa stores, you&#x27;ll get ripped off.  The product I received had leaked slightly from the cap, but not must was gone.  They weren&#x27;t expired and otherwise arrived quickly. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Gratiae products before and have been impressed.  This one is very oily and I am not seeing any results after 1 week of use.  In fact, it was so oily that it is causing breakouts to occur.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum several weeks ago and I love the sensation on my face after I apply it, you just need a little drop for all your face, it is fresh and seems to smooth my face. I like the fact that it is organic and that it is an affordable product. I purchased it because of all the positive reviews I read on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> One of the only two moisturizers I use for my fac e. An excellent product. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product after I was \\&quot;captured\\&quot; by a very animated sales person at the Gratiae kiosk in the mall. Liked the feel of the product, but not the $600 price tag! Went home and searched the internet. On Amazon I found all the products I&#x27;d sampled at the mall, for a fraction of the cost. Paid about $20 for the serum, including free shipping. Been using it every night and notice that fine lines on my face and neck seem to have \\&quot;plumped\\&quot; and faded. Will keep using the product.</li>
    <li> Greasy and has done nothing for my skin but make me break out, which is something i never do.</li>
    <li> Smells very strongly of frangrence. I use it only on my feet. It it rated my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I had originally bought it from a store in the local mall and paid $500.00.  Thank goodness for amazon as I was able to purchase the same exact product for $11.99 and no shipping - a dream come true!!  My skin looks and feels very beautiful with much improved texture.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial serum. It goes on smooth and does not leave your skin feeling oily. I use this day and night. Highly recommend this product and I would definitely reorder this product. It has made my skin look more youthful. Finally, a product that works!</li>
    <li> I read lots of great reviews about this product but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different with my skin. Although amazon gives such a great price compared to the kiosks, I&#x27;m not motivated to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My wife really liked Gratiae Organics Lifting Facial Serum, 1.7 Ounce because it met your expectations! Surely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Not sure why someone would pay over $100 for any serum but this one is great. It feels like honey going on your face.  I&#x27;m using it alongside another serum I got from an aesthetician. The other one dries very quickly which makes me think there&#x27;s a lots of alcohol in it.  This serum dries slower and feels wonderful on my face. And beyond that it is an extremely generous amount for the money:)</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel fantastic. Within the first week there was a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and I use this product 2x/day and it&#x27;s simply hydrating!  Fast shipping, excellent product, worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice serum, is not as oily as I thought it would be. My skin is soft and seems to be younger looking. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I like this.  It&#x27;s thick and moisturizing without being greasy &amp; sticky.  I use it as a base for my l-abscorbic acid (vitamin C) powder.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this product at an expensive shop in Vegas. Used the sample for several days and fell in love with it. It makes your skin so soft! Wanted to buy it after I returned home, and found it on Amazon for a price that was very satisfactory. Very pleased with the product. I also ordered the Lifting Moisturizing Creme and the Replenishing Eye Serum. Can&#x27;t wait for those to arrive so I can try them as well. My skin gets so dry and irritated during the winter this is the only product that relieves it. Literally feels as soft as baby skin, not oiliy or greasy. I love it.</li>
    <li> Very good sellers. very good prices</li>
    <li> When I first bought this product, I loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t continue with it because of cost.  If the cost remains affordable, It will be part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> For the so low price compare with the original version ! They arrive with damage boxes and giving me the feeling it was a copy or generic version of the original products???? having douts to use them!</li>
    <li> Really this is a great product to find at this price. I have purchased several different things by this brand and I love them. I bought more after using the first time. It works to improve my skin and I&#x27;m saving lots of money! Try it, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was one of those Vegas visitors that get sucked into the little stores in the hotels and malls. I could see the quality of the product, but the price there was unreal. After seeing it on Amazon, I thought I would go ahead and try it at this price. I love it. At 50 years old, I was starting to see the signs of aging. I take really good care of myself, but menopause and time was beginning to show. I see a marked improvement. It was visible in 2 weeks. I will be leaving this same review for all of the products from this company that I order. I think it’s a rip off from the stores, but from amazon its a great price and an effective, quality product.</li>
    <li> Love the products and love that they are much cheaper on amazon.</li>
    <li> The package wasn&#x27;t good at all. The box of this product only was opened and the bottle was uncapped. The serum was dripping.</li>
    <li> Great for wrinkles...makes them appear less deep.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this product it feels good on your face!  I&#x27;m not sure how much lifting I got - for the price you&#x27;d be better of getting a facial.. but I do like how the product feels.</li>
    <li> Great Serum, realy makes my face feel great, I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this.. feels greasy when you first put it on, but dries to a nice smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Caused me to break out</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I have used alot of productsand different lines on my skin over the years.  I love how this serum absorbs in my skin quickly and  makes my face feel so soft.  It is a great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> it makes me skin feel soft without feeling oily.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product and price</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Got it right away too</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but I paid $14 a few months ago..now $57? I wont be purchasing for that price</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin feel great when I put it on.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are both in our late 50&#x27;s, early 60&#x27;s. We are trying the medical free treatments as opposed to undergoing surgery&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Feels plastic. I won&#x27;t put this thing on my face. I use it on my hair, works well on hair, makes it shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Good product,great price</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Doubled in price this year though.</li>
    <li> Love these products,  great price</li>
    <li> My face feels kind of greasy after I use this.</li>
    <li> Could not tell any difference</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much lifting it does, but you could probably get the same results from another product.</li>
    <li> Your face feels smooth .</li>
    <li> love this product! great for the winter months, my face is well hydrated after I used Gratiae Organics Lifting Facial Mask and followed up with the lifting facial Serum.  the Vendor shipped ASAP!</li>
    <li> I tested this in a mall in Florida. And was amazed by the effect. However the price was awful. So I went home without purchasing it - googled it and read all the negative stories. I decided the amazon price was low enough to compensate for the risk. And I am happy about the purchase. My lines have been reduced.</li>
    <li> I have never tried this product and love the look and feel of my skin after.&lt;br /&gt;Not as crazy about their eye cream but do love this. Highly recommend it.</li>
