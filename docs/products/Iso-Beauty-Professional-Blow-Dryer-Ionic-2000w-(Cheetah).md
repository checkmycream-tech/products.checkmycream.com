      <li>I love everything but wish that the blow dryer came with a comb attachment.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This Hairdryer is powerful and very hot and does a great job at smoothing and straightening my curly hair.</li>
      <li>But I am very pleased with my purchase and feel it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this dryer and it is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>The lowest setting also blows very cool air (not just room temp air).</li>
      <li>The product in general is great</li>
      <li>I have fine curly hair</li>
      <li>- I was getting suspicious of what was happening within the inside, but since it was working fine</li>
      <li>Great blower but did not last.</li>

      <li>Not only is it cheetah which is my fav, but it works great and was very affordable.</li>

      <li>it deffinatley worth</li>
      <li>we&#x27;ll see if Iso makes this right.</li>
      <li>First off, it arrived with a crack on the exterior.</li>
      <li>That really scared me!</li>
      <li>I unfortunately never exchanged or returned on time ....</li>
      <li>when you turn on the dryer, it sounds and smells funny like it is going to explode.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make this dryer even better would be a retractable cord.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much, I bought another one for my other daughter.</li>
      <li>Other than that a very good product that drys my hair in less time then before.</li>
      <li>I was very nervous purchasing with out trying</li>
      <li>so it is almost effortless to get my naurally curly hair to look sleek and straight.</li>
      <li>Very powerful for my spanish hair!  </li>
      <li>It is quiet, but very powerful.</li>
      <li>I like the dryer a lot but the switches are backwards from what you would normally expect.</li>
      <li>The dryer kept on making squeaky sounds whenever it hit the wall or was placed down, but it still worked fine.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness I had saved my other really old &amp; cheap dryer that has lasted for years.</li>
      <li>know it looks like a modern, sleek &amp; cool Blowdryer, apparently no one spent as much time on the mechanics as they did on the design.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Within a month of receiving it, the dryer had malfunctioned completely.</li>
      <li>noticed it would switch on its own from HOT to COLD, Making my blow-dry time</li>
      <li>powerful hair flow and dry time is cut down.</li>
      <li>I cut my hair styling time down by 30 minutes thanks to the ISO 2000w.  </li>

<li> powerful hair flow and dry time is cut down.</li>
<li> I cut my hair styling time down by 30 minutes thanks to the ISO 2000w.  </li>
<li> I originally bought this dryer for my daughter because she has very long, thick hair that takes forever to dry.  </li>
<li> This dryer cuts the drying time in half and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
<li> I have long hair</li>
<li> The only downer is the switches are up side down and backwards, not a deal breaker though.</li>
<li> /&gt;VERY UNGHAPPY &amp; WITH FRIZZY HAIR but at least I am Alive in MIAMI, FL!</li>
<li> Additionally, my hair comes out silkier than with other dryers because of the Ionic system.  </li>
<li> Couple days later I starting hearing jamming noises whenever I turned on the dryer, like a broken piece was hitting the inside fan</li>
<li> I have to put it down sometimes to rest my arm, and with weight limits on luggage</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s heavy, heavier than any other Hairdryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
<li> My hair dries faster and is less frizzy</li>
<li> All with a lot of power or a little power, your choice.  </li>
<li> The air can be set from warm to hot and to cold, and the cold is cold.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
<li> One day I noticed a piece of transparent plastic had fallen from the dryer, but since there seemed to be no piece missing from the exterior, i assumed something from the inside had fallen.</li>
<li> I purchased this dryer a few years ago through Shoe Dazzle.  </li>
<li> The dryer itself is quite heavy and your arm gets tired after holding it for some time - you also have to be careful about where you&#x27;re holding the handle because you can often change the settings that are located on the grip part of the handle just by holding it.</li>
<li> I was disappointed when I saw the hair dryer due to the fact that half of the print on it was lighter than the other half</li>
<li> She hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet, so I assume all is well in</li>
<li> should not sponser this product &amp; should make the Company Refund or at the very least EXCHANGE all faulty products for their clients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> (I have another) but this one was packaged so poorly that it was damaged when I received it.  </li>
<li> and I think it looks weird.</li>
<li> Price isnt bad either.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this dryer and will not recommend to anyone.</li>
<li> This dryer was all around horrible for me.</li>

    <li> I was very nervous purchasing with out trying but it works wonderful and is super cute!! I love it deffinatley worth it&#x27;s money in my opinion ! Hope this helps future buyers</li>
    <li> This Blow Dryer was defective from day .&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it would switch on its own from HOT to COLD, Making my blow-dry time Longer...I unfortunately never exchanged or returned on time ....Just last night, Sparks &amp;  Flames were coming out of the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not sponser this product &amp; should make the Company Refund or at the very least EXCHANGE all faulty products for their clients.&lt;br /&gt;I know it looks like a modern, sleek &amp; cool Blowdryer, apparently no one spent as much time on the mechanics as they did on the design.&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNGHAPPY &amp; WITH FRIZZY HAIR but at least I am Alive in MIAMI, FL!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this dryer for my daughter because she has very long, thick hair that takes forever to dry.  This blow dryer works just as well as a salon dryer, in my opinion.  It is quiet, but very powerful. I liked it so much, I bought another one for my other daughter.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great!! powerful hair flow and dry time is cut down. The only downer is the switches are up side down and backwards, not a deal breaker though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a month now and I am in love with it! I have long hair and I used to dread they drying time. This dryer cuts the drying time in half and it makes my hair feel soft. The only thing that would make this dryer even better would be a retractable cord. But I am very pleased with my purchase and feel it is worth every penny. I will never go back to an 1875 watt dryer again!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my best friend and she loves it.  She hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet, so I assume all is well in hair dryer world lol.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Amazing!! I give my self the Brazilian blow out look with this blow dryer!</li>
    <li> Love it. Very powerful for my spanish hair!  Would def recommend. Love the cheetah print!!!  Price isnt bad either. Love</li>
    <li> Not only is it stylish, but it is light weight and gets very hot with the highest setting! The lowest setting also blows very cool air (not just room temp air). I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair styling time down by 30 minutes thanks to the ISO 2000w.  My hair dries faster and is less frizzy so it is almost effortless to get my naurally curly hair to look sleek and straight.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. Not only is it cheetah which is my fav, but it works great and was very affordable.</li>
    <li> This Hairdryer is powerful and very hot and does a great job at smoothing and straightening my curly hair. There are 3 heat settings and power levels - suits every need.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s heavy, heavier than any other Hairdryer I&#x27;ve had. I have to put it down sometimes to rest my arm, and with weight limits on luggage I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to take it traveling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer a few years ago through Shoe Dazzle.  I absolutely love this dryer and it is still going strong.  The settings are perfect - you have 3 choices, low, medium and high.  All with a lot of power or a little power, your choice.  The air can be set from warm to hot and to cold, and the cold is cold.  This has been one of the best purchases for a blowdyrer I have made, and in the end of great value as i have not had to purchase another one in a little over 2 years.  I use to replace my dryers every 6 months.  Additionally, my hair comes out silkier than with other dryers because of the Ionic system.  I have fine curly hair and I am never disappointed with my blowout, full and shiny.</li>
    <li> By far the best hairdryer I have ever owned. I actually bought this for my teenage daughter but I use it way more than she does. It&#x27;s a little heavy but it does a great job!</li>
    <li> This dryer was all around horrible for me. First off, it arrived with a crack on the exterior. The dryer itself is quite heavy and your arm gets tired after holding it for some time - you also have to be careful about where you&#x27;re holding the handle because you can often change the settings that are located on the grip part of the handle just by holding it. The dryer kept on making squeaky sounds whenever it hit the wall or was placed down, but it still worked fine. One day I noticed a piece of transparent plastic had fallen from the dryer, but since there seemed to be no piece missing from the exterior, i assumed something from the inside had fallen. Couple days later I starting hearing jamming noises whenever I turned on the dryer, like a broken piece was hitting the inside fan - I was getting suspicious of what was happening within the inside, but since it was working fine I kept on using it. Finally, today, I smelled something funky (like plastic burning) when I was using it and when I turned it off and unplugged it, I saw SMOKE coming from the inside... That really scared me! Within a month of receiving it, the dryer had malfunctioned completely. Thank goodness I had saved my other really old &amp; cheap dryer that has lasted for years. I am very disappointed in this dryer and will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product in general is great (I have another) but this one was packaged so poorly that it was damaged when I received it.  I was allowed to return it and it was replaced without charge.</li>
    <li> I love everything but wish that the blow dryer came with a comb attachment. Other than that a very good product that drys my hair in less time then before.</li>
    <li> the blow dryer that Iso shipped looks like a returned blow dryer. there are chipped pieces on the body of the dryer and it rattles like there are loss parts inside. when you turn on the dryer, it sounds and smells funny like it is going to explode.&lt;br /&gt;i filed a return request. we&#x27;ll see if Iso makes this right.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I saw the hair dryer due to the fact that half of the print on it was lighter than the other half and I think it looks weird.</li>
    <li> Great blower. Lasted 5 months and the electrical connection where the cord meets the blower broke. Great blower but did not last.</li>
    <li> I like the dryer a lot but the switches are backwards from what you would normally expect. Power is great.</li>
