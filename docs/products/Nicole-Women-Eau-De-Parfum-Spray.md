### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great deal and great perfum!</li>
      <li>but it seems to fade greatly after a couple hours.  </li>
      <li>so it is a great deal and comes in the official box.</li>
      <li>No sillage and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the sample I had.</li>
      <li>A very attractive bottle presents this light floral scent.  </li>
      <li>But this smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing price for a nice perfume.</li>
      <li>I think it makes a nice daytime scent and summer  evenings too.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume and got a good price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall: NICOLE RICHIE is pleasant and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>It is strong when you first spray it on, but does fade a bit and leaves the perfect amount of scent.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of a very light Shalimar with berry tones.</li>
      <li>Product does not seem authentic</li>
      <li>Better deal than at any department store.</li>
      <li>This perfume cost $20+ more at the department store ($40 vs $60)</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve put my more spicy scents away for the season.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh smelling, which is great now that it&#x27;s summer</li>
      <li>The reasonable price and good longevity [between six and eight hours] make up for the lack of originality, so the perfume is a pretty good buy and a nice gift choice.</li>
      <li>I love Nicole&#x27;s new scent, it smells amazing!  </li>
      <li>blackberries, oranges, golden amber, Moroccan rose, lily of the valley, papyrus, cashmere, sandalwood, sugared patchouli and vanilla.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nicole Richie you create such a beautiful fragrance.</li>
      <li>Omg, this perfume has such a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>I prefer \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; but pleasant perfumes, ones that someone needs to be near you to enjoy the experience.  </li>
      <li>but I use it in the summer and winter and it smells just wonderful especially if you have somewhere important to go get ready for plenty of compliments</li>
      <li>The rose mixes with the slightly spicy vanilla, for a pleasant &#x27;Turkish Delight&#x27; aroma.</li>
      <li>The soft, creamy cashmere and sandalwood mingled closely together so it is a warm, comforting mix,</li>
      <li>Berry notes seem to be popping up in most new mainstream perfumes now and NICOLE RICHIE opens with a rich blackberry note.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find NICOLE RICHIE sweet-but-not-too-sweet, creamy, slightly spicy and also woody, so I think it is perfect for the colder weather, although it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;d probably wear all year round as the juicy fruits stop everything else from becoming too much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>clean , slightly vanilla, a bit berry and rose fragrance.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not able to separate any floral notes apart from the listed rose and a hint of lily from the sweetly powdered floral jumble heart of the fragrance, as the patchouli develops quickly and lasts for the duration of the perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and it lasts all day for me.</li>
      <li>This smells so good and is very versatile I usually change up my scents as the seasons change</li>
      <li>husband loves the smell, and he is REAL picky...</li>
      <li>It is very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>recommend this very highly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Not only was it extremely WELL priced, it smells amazing, as well.</li>
      <li>It was very lightly scented, and did not last very long at all.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this parfum, but the scent does not last on the skin very long.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this order back in the summer, from Dillard&#x27;s for 20 dollars, except the size was a 1.3 ounce bottle.</li>
      <li>I have to say the smell is the exactly the same, and it lasts a bit longer!</li>
      <li>but then I could smell the smell clearly.</li>
      <li>The only thing that this product does is diminish it&#x27;s scent soon after applying, and the cost is way too much...</li>
      <li>Soft smell, so feminine</li>
      <li>I purchased it due to the pretty bottle.</li>
      <li>The dispenser is pretty but fails in delivering a full spray.  </li>

<li> I take responsibility here since it is hard to buy a fragrance without smelling it first.</li>
<li> RICHIE is very wearable and can be worn to work, casual wear/weekends and crowded parties, but it&#x27;s not unique enough to make me feel glamorous on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not familiar with papyrus, but I&#x27;m guessing that it is responsible for the slightly bitter spiciness that hides under the sweeter notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I threw the sample size in my travel bag a few weeks back and finally used it.</li>
<li> I normally do not care for floral scents.  </li>
<li> These berry notes are long and distinctive, so carries down to the heart of the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> is how I decided to try it, was because of other reviews.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it is so big and bulky that it is hard to dispense.  </li>
<li> Of course the first couple of sprays smelled a little weird</li>
<li> /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant presence of the powdery floral/vanilla mix and patchouli.</li>
<li> It is very heavy and anyone with arthritic hands would struggle with it.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in this product!</li>

    <li> No sillage and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the sample I had.</li>
    <li> A very attractive bottle presents this light floral scent.  It is very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;A clean , slightly vanilla, a bit berry and rose fragrance.  I think it makes a nice daytime scent and summer  evenings too. It reminds me of a very light Shalimar with berry tones.</li>
    <li> I take responsibility here since it is hard to buy a fragrance without smelling it first. I purchased it due to the pretty bottle. But this is ginormous on my vanity and swallows it up. Will be gifting it for Christmas</li>
    <li> Great deal and great perfum! My wife loves it! Better deal than at any department store.</li>
    <li> I first bought this order back in the summer, from Dillard&#x27;s for 20 dollars, except the size was a 1.3 ounce bottle. I was looking online and found that this product was a larger size and a cheaper price, so like any person who loves perfume I bought it. I have to say the smell is the exactly the same, and it lasts a bit longer! Of course the first couple of sprays smelled a little weird but then I could smell the smell clearly.</li>
    <li> My niece loves it...thank you ..</li>
    <li> Product does not seem authentic I bought it for my mom as a gift and it doesnt last her not even 3 hours.</li>
    <li> I normally do not care for floral scents.  But this smells amazing.  It is strong when you first spray it on, but does fade a bit and leaves the perfect amount of scent.  This is one of my favorites in my collection</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in my Birchbox forever ago and never opened it. I threw the sample size in my travel bag a few weeks back and finally used it. I fell in love with it. It&#x27;s not expensive and it lasts all day for me. The scent is light and fresh smelling, which is great now that it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;ve put my more spicy scents away for the season.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and is very versatile I usually change up my scents as the seasons change but I use it in the summer and winter and it smells just wonderful especially if you have somewhere important to go get ready for plenty of compliments</li>
    <li> Soft smell, so feminine</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price for a nice perfume.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and got a good price. Bought two bottles.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this parfum, but the scent does not last on the skin very long.  I prefer \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; but pleasant perfumes, ones that someone needs to be near you to enjoy the experience.  I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents-ones you can smell across the room &amp; make your eyes water.  Nicole Woman fits that requirement for me but it seems to fade greatly after a couple hours.  The dispenser is pretty but fails in delivering a full spray.  All I get are short spurts which require repeated pumping.  Maybe my bottle is defective in this regard, but I will not purchase another to find out.</li>
    <li> I love Nicole&#x27;s new scent, it smells amazing!  Unfortunately, it is so big and bulky that it is hard to dispense.  It is very heavy and anyone with arthritic hands would struggle with it.</li>
    <li> Berry notes seem to be popping up in most new mainstream perfumes now and NICOLE RICHIE opens with a rich blackberry note. I can&#x27;t pick up the Seville oranges, but I can make out what I think is raspberry. These berry notes are long and distinctive, so carries down to the heart of the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not able to separate any floral notes apart from the listed rose and a hint of lily from the sweetly powdered floral jumble heart of the fragrance, as the patchouli develops quickly and lasts for the duration of the perfume. The rose mixes with the slightly spicy vanilla, for a pleasant &#x27;Turkish Delight&#x27; aroma. I&#x27;m not familiar with papyrus, but I&#x27;m guessing that it is responsible for the slightly bitter spiciness that hides under the sweeter notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant presence of the powdery floral/vanilla mix and patchouli. The soft, creamy cashmere and sandalwood mingled closely together so it is a warm, comforting mix, that is again similar to the heart notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official scent notes: blackberries, oranges, golden amber, Moroccan rose, lily of the valley, papyrus, cashmere, sandalwood, sugared patchouli and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find NICOLE RICHIE sweet-but-not-too-sweet, creamy, slightly spicy and also woody, so I think it is perfect for the colder weather, although it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;d probably wear all year round as the juicy fruits stop everything else from becoming too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NICOLE RICHIE is very wearable and can be worn to work, casual wear/weekends and crowded parties, but it&#x27;s not unique enough to make me feel glamorous on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: NICOLE RICHIE is pleasant and easy to wear. The reasonable price and good longevity [between six and eight hours] make up for the lack of originality, so the perfume is a pretty good buy and a nice gift choice.</li>
    <li> Not only was it extremely WELL priced, it smells amazing, as well. I have always been a one perfume, kinda gal til I received a sample of this in my Ipsy Glam Bag. I have definitely stepped outside my comfort zone with this one.</li>
    <li> OMG  I agree, this parfum spray is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the smell, and he is REAL picky...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this very highly.&lt;br /&gt;This is how I decided to try it, was because of other reviews.</li>
    <li> Omg, this perfume has such a beautiful scent. I so recommend this to all female all ages. Nicole Richie you create such a beautiful fragrance.</li>
    <li> This perfume cost $20+ more at the department store ($40 vs $60) so it is a great deal and comes in the official box.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product! It was very lightly scented, and did not last very long at all. I had read somewhere in the product description that the scent actually changed in time as you wear it, and this does not seem to be the case at all! The only thing that this product does is diminish it&#x27;s scent soon after applying, and the cost is way too much... Look for something else!!!</li>
