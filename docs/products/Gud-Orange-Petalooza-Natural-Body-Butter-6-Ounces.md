      <li>And the price is very affordable.  </li>
      <li>but the scent goes away too fast.</li>
      <li>I was really pleased to find it here on Amazon at a much lower price than in stores and other online sellers.</li>
      <li>What I like so much is that it moisturizes without being greasy, that one application lasts a long time, and that it has a light, citrusy scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m particular about moisturizers and insist that they always have shea butter.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a large jar that lasts a long time</li>

    <li> Smells amazing and moisturizes. The only thing I will say is there is not a lot that comes in the container. Like a bag of chips 40% of the container is air which was a little disappointing seeing as I assumed the container would be filled to the top like a lot of body butters are. I am mixing it with some of my other Walgreens over the counter lotions because it smells great but there is not as much in the container as the 6 oz advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this....  My 73 y/o hands never felt or looked or smelled so good....</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would smell like real oranges.  Instead, it smells like artificial orange bathroom cleaner.  Good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant body butter. The scent is so subtle and fresh and the consistency is very nice. It is not greasy at all but keeps hands and other skin nice and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say more, but I am sure that it smells wonderful and is a great product, otherwise I would not have sent it to my sister, no matter how ungracious she seems to be.</li>
    <li> I received one of these as a gift. I&#x27;m particular about moisturizers and insist that they always have shea butter. This does. It does the job well, is creamy and has a nice light scent. I bought one for a Christmas gift (thinking ahead) and one for myself. This is a Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
    <li> This product is the nicest Shea butter I have ever found.  It is smooth, not pasty or waxy like some shea butter products.  It smells wonderful if you like very citrusy aromas.  Yet the citrus is not overwhelming. It never feels sticky or greasy on the skin.  And the price is very affordable.  I purchased 3 tubs and each will last about 5-6 weeks with daily use.</li>
    <li> I bought this only because I couldn&#x27;t find the Body Shop body butter. It feels a bit too runny and it takes longer to absorb. Overall it does an ok job. Scent wise it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
    <li> I place this product on my nightstand and use it before i go to sleep. The gemtle smell is relaxing  and the product helps to remove traces of dry skin.</li>
    <li> The second body butter (out of the two I ordered) came open and half of it was missing. Terribly disappointed!</li>
    <li> I use this primarily as a hand cream.  What I like so much is that it moisturizes without being greasy, that one application lasts a long time, and that it has a light, citrusy scent.  It doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients I won&#x27;t use (phthalates, parabens etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large jar that lasts a long time and it doesn&#x27;t take much to spread over a large area - a little dab will do ya.  I was really pleased to find it here on Amazon at a much lower price than in stores and other online sellers.</li>
    <li> I like it but the scent goes away too fast. I had sampled the lotion and it smelled nice all day on my skin. The body butter doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s scent as long. But other wise is a very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This body butter smells amazing! I am a big fan of body butter. I was very pleased and this product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The smell of this body butter is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t really stay all day or anything, but it is a really bright citrus smell. I love using it in the morning after a shower. It isn&#x27;t the richest lotion, but it absorbs nicely. It did a nice job smoothing my winter-dry elbows. I think I will go through it pretty fast but I will probably look for it again.</li>
    <li> great product and love the smell</li>
    <li> Smells fresh, nice creamy lotion! Arrived on time. Would purchase again. Bought for teens girls and they love it and use it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love the product - great scent too.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with a subtle citrus smell that you notice after you leave a room and then return.  I love all the Gud products.&lt;br /&gt;This ones a keeper.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and moisturizes well. My Mother tried the one I had, and loved it so much I bought her one for Mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have eczema on my face and this stuff seems to help.  Smells awesome too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> I got this in a surprise box from Burt&#x27;s Bees last year and have used it everyday to help moisturize.  It is such a refreshing scent of citrus and makes your skin softer than you thought it could be.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff  its  not only smells great it lasts on my skin for hours... Thanks so much Try it..</li>
