      <li>My hair looks and feels shiny and soft.</li>

      <li>I have very fine, thin hair, so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
      <li>The mousse gives my hair the body I want, but the Loma Leave-in Conditioner keeps it soft, not dry and frizzy.  </li>

      <li>I tend to be sensitive to hair chemicals and my last detangler/conditioner worked on my hair but stung my scalp.    </li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair.</li>

    <li> I will never buy another brand of leave in conditioner again. It smells amazing &amp; a little drop goes a long way. It has helped nourish my hair &amp; helped repair it from color &amp; heat damage. I have recommended this product to family &amp; friends and they love it also. One of the best purchases I have ever made! Loma hair products are the best that I have used &amp; will continue to use!</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair. Virtually every styling or conditioning product I&#x27;ve ever used weighs my hair down and makes it go flat - but this one doesn&#x27;t! It actually does build volume as well. Very happy I found this product.</li>

    <li> love this i have naturally very curly waist length hair and this helps me with detangling it after the shower</li>
    <li> I tend to be sensitive to hair chemicals and my last detangler/conditioner worked on my hair but stung my scalp.    This works and doesn&#x27;t burn. YEA!!!        02/01/2015    I no longer use this product. I still like it but I found a lemongrass scented natural conditioner I like more.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is fine and very curly.  It gets dry easily.  I was impressed with this product from the first time I used it.  My hairdresser taught me a great trick.

Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not what it use the be</li>
    <li> This product as the attributes of scented water. It leaves no conditioning properties on the hair.</li>
    <li> Its a good product but overpriced</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  Great smell. Very lightweight.</li>
    <li> Great leave in conditioner. Smells great, not too heavy, but not a light conditioner. My hair feels incredible, soft and healthy.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! makes my hair so soft!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair. This condition doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and moisturizes well. I use it every time after washing my hair. Keeps my hair soft and shinny.</li>
    <li> I love these Loma hair products. But as a person with curly, dry hair, this particular leave in doesn&#x27;t really work. It makes my hair a little poofy and it doesn&#x27;t feel great either. I suspect it works better on dry limp hair.</li>
    <li> Loma Organics hair products are the best hair products I have ever found !! No more half used products on my self anymore !! Using my Loma Organics  squeezing every last ounce out I can get and buying replacements so as not to run out ! I love the complete line .... haven&#x27;t tried one product of theirs I don&#x27;t love !</li>
    <li> Absolutely worst leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Does not help with tangles at all. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine hair much easier to comb when wet, and works on dry hair as well when the wind whips it to a flurry of tangles.</li>
