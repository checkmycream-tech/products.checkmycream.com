<li> I developed adult acne which left dark spots on my face.</li>
<li> Depending on how dark your dark spots are this product works pretty well</li>
<li> I bought this product a long time ago and it didn&#x27;t work because i didn&#x27;t use it constantly.</li>
<li> I was getting so light to the point I had to stop using it because it was really scary.</li>
<li> I noticed a little improvement nothing major.</li>
<li> If you want to lighten small areas on your body just a little bit and are willing to wait two months for results, I do recommend this product for you.</li>
<li> I recommend anyone of color to use if you have dark blotches on your skin or an old pimple which leaves a dark mark.  </li>
<li> I have spent a fortune in creams, moisturizers, lotions and potions and NOTHING worked to clear a rough, very dark patch on my face.  </li>
<li> It has not only lightened, but cleared the dark spots, and have given me an all over even toned complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have sensitive skin just apply once a day and don&#x27;t rub hard.</li>
<li> I did use this on other areas of my body and it worked too.</li>
<li> I will now try it on other areas of my skin.......</li>
<li> After reading the reviews on this product from another seller i decided to buy it from this seller since the price went up from the other guy.</li>
<li> I had to lighten my underarms only a little bit because I hated that they were tan while the rest of my skin was very light</li>
<li> The redness and the dark skin peeled off.</li>
<li> now they a closer to a medium dark.</li>
<li> I had dark spots all over my face and after using this I could see results almost in a week.</li>
<li> underarms were close to a black (dark) color and</li>
<li> I need lighter and less foundation.</li>
<li> my underarms were just slightly lighter.</li>
<li> It burn a little not a lot</li>
<li> I use this in combination with the cream and it faded my dark marks!</li>
<li> I am Latina and my underarms were very, very, dark.</li>
<li> I had very dark underarms for like about 4 years.</li>
<li> i ordered cream , waste of money .</li>
<li> and i&#x27;ve been using it everyday twice a day.</li>
<li> first your face will peel what is happening is is peeling dead ugly skin off.  </li>
<li> This product sucks</li>
<li> Call me crazy, but my next step is purchasing the Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel.</li>
<li> Just give it a few weeks!!</li>
<li> Well the cream SUCKS!</li>
<li> And to make it worse, my armpits blackened again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this cream thinking it would work as well as the gel did but it wasn&#x27;t good. I&#x27;m going to buy the gel.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have been using this cream for about 3 months I had dark spots all over my face and after using this I could see results almost in a week. first your face will peel what is happening is is peeling dead ugly skin off.  If you can bare with the peeling ...afterwards you will have a complexion that will start looking like a baby&#x27;s face . I love this cream and I will be using it forever</li>
    <li> I really like it it did what I need to do for me very happy</li>
    <li> Love this product been using it for about 6mos and now my skin is soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Spend the extra dollars and buy the gel instead of this cream. This cream smell like a hair bleach! It makes it less effective for me because I don&#x27;t use it as often. It does lighten.</li>
    <li> LOL To the people who want to bleach their skin so bad. This is why you guys experienced rashed and breakouts. Anyway, I have never had any issues with this product. I have been using it for years and it is really excellent. You have to use the soap religiously though but it does work really well. I was getting so light to the point I had to stop using it because it was really scary. I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> This was great but I wasn&#x27;t so proactive in using this. I did see some results but not take the point where I wanted certain areas to really be even toned with my skin. Overall, it did it job especially after using it seldomly</li>
    <li> This product did not work after 2 tubes used. I think the Eraser cream or even Vicco cream is much more effective.</li>
    <li> If you want a clear complexion, get this cream!!!  I have used it for 6 years and can&#x27;t begin to tell you how brighter and smooth my face is.  I have spent a fortune in creams, moisturizers, lotions and potions and NOTHING worked to clear a rough, very dark patch on my face.  Dermatologist said to use a cream that cost over a $100 (this was 20 years ago) and all it did was burn and peel my skin.  I used the morning and night for 3 weeks and WOW!!!  My face became very bright but it darkened a little after continued use to a very clear and even tone.  You will NOT be disappointed in this product!!!  Just give it a few weeks!!</li>
    <li> I used this crème faithfully for approximately two months with no noticeable change outside of the awful allergic reaction I had from it. I went to the Doctors and was prescribed prednisone and a topical cream !! However I did not get any lightening results</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for about a month now.   I noticed a little improvement nothing major. So  I am still waiting</li>
    <li> Great stuff really help with my dark spots</li>
    <li> I was planning on buying the gel but instead i bought 3 tubes the creme. At first i didn&#x27;t want to see it as a loss, but when i used up the first tube and i didn&#x27;t see any results, i was really disappointed, so now i&#x27;m stuck with 2 tubes of this rubbish.</li>
    <li> I developed adult acne which left dark spots on my face. I decided to purchase this cream, based on the reviews I read, and am truly happy with the results. It has not only lightened, but cleared the dark spots, and have given me an all over even toned complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I purchased 2 tubes, and will continue to buy. I will now try it on other areas of my skin.......</li>
    <li> Cream didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. Gel works wonders. Im Hispanic, with medium Tonr skin. Gel works within a week, that I do recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while, it really does work well. I had marks that wasn&#x27;t going away and with this product it is gone now.</li>
    <li> Well this didn&#x27;t do anything for me,</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin just apply once a day and don&#x27;t rub hard. I had to make changes in the time  to apply it I live in sunny FL so I just apply @ night.</li>
    <li> I did use xtreme bright gel and liked it ,  by mistake i ordered cream , waste of money .</li>
    <li> IT DO NOT WORK AS WELL AS I THOUGHT NOT 100%</li>
    <li> Great cream, I love it, it works so good, thank you for having it it is hard to find</li>
    <li> I initially bought the gel and saw the results after using the entire tube. my armpits were not totally white but lightened obviously. I then decided to buy another set. This time was the lightening cream. I applied the same way with the gel but after my first week of application, I felt there was a stinging sensation. Then I noticed that there were parts on my armpits that burnt. I stopped using this after the incident. Both my armpits have scars. Red scars. And to make it worse, my armpits blackened again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product,  check the ingredients and you will know why.</li>
    <li> I gave this one a try hoping to see some changes, turns out I was allergic to it, I&#x27;ve used it for a week when I started to feel some skin irritation where I applied the cream. (Wasn&#x27;t expecting it since the extreme bright I&#x27;m using did not gave this kind of problem at all) skin was really red, blisters around it and very itchy. So I recommend test them first before applying it to your skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know How people are selling this Product . I experienced Rashes and it not at all lighting my Back marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not at all satisfied with this Product</li>
    <li> Depending on how dark your dark spots are this product works pretty well but you have to be patient. I had to lighten my underarms only a little bit because I hated that they were tan while the rest of my skin was very light so I tried this product but I didn&#x27;t see any results until 2 months later and my underarms were just slightly lighter. I still like it because I didn&#x27;t want my underarms to look totally bleached, so that good. If you want to lighten small areas on your body just a little bit and are willing to wait two months for results, I do recommend this product for you.</li>
    <li> I have used the xtreme brite lightening Gel before and I loved the results. But the cream has a nasty smell and when I apply it to my skin it becomes even worse. I went back to using the gel, as it smells great and is absorbed much quicker.</li>
    <li> I am about to complete a month using this product twice a day and there has been ZERO improvement. Call me crazy, but my next step is purchasing the Xtreme Brite Brightening Gel. That&#x27;s the one that I&#x27;ve read positive reviews on. I bought this one thinking it was the same one, just bigger, but the cream isn&#x27;t working out.</li>
    <li> Works ! Cant wait to order again.</li>
    <li> So, I wrote a review on gel. And I got this creaming thinking it will be stronger since the gel wasn&#x27;t giving me fast results. Well the cream SUCKS! after 3 days using it 2x a day! My underarms were red! It burn a little not a lot but they&#x27;re were red as a tomatoe! After a day or two my underarms were darker than before! Before I started using the Gel! This product sucks and I&#x27;m calling the company I want my money back! Now I&#x27;m scared to use the Gel but since the gel I had a better result idk what to do! Please m-a-y-t-e-0-5-l-a-t-i-n-a at hotmail . Com let me know if anyone else knows about a better effective product! And/Or if the same thing happen to them using this cream!</li>
    <li> I recommend anyone of color to use if you have dark blotches on your skin or an old pimple which leaves a dark mark.  I tried it and I continue to use it to this day.  I suggest taking a break from it for a week and then go back to it.  I have had amazing results and I continue to purchase this item.  The price is average for a product of this kind.  I would also suggest that you follow the directions closely and do a skin test just to make sure that you&#x27;re not allergic to, with anyhing you must do a skin test.</li>
    <li> It works. I bought it last year. I applied it only to the area I wanted lightened and it appeared it got darker. So I stopped using it. Recently I saw a review and she applied it to her whole face and said stick with it. I did and now have the results I was looking for. It has been working so far to even out my whole face. I need lighter and less foundation. I did use this on other areas of my body and it worked too. I did burn the area as I was over zealous with the cream. The redness and the dark skin peeled off. I don&#x27;t recommend this but it did the trick and area is visibly lighter now that&#x27;s it&#x27;s healed. It&#x27;s effective but the smell is strong but that&#x27;s the agent that helps it work so well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to even out a scar he has and it works.  I did not use it daliy because his skin started to break, but when I use every 3 days it worked much better. He puts it on now. I wanted to see how often we had to use before I gave it to him  He likes it too which is the important thing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by accident, really wanted the gel.. Noticed when i received it i had ordered tge wrong one.. I cant use this due to the strong odor..makes me nauseas. Smells different than the gel.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product from another seller i decided to buy it from this seller since the price went up from the other guy. I&#x27;m not going to say this product does not work, maybe it does, and i just got the fake stuff. I have been using it 3-4 weeks and i have not seen results. About 2 weeks in i realize the skin got a bit darker, currently it has gone back to what it was and the tube is almost finished. The smell is not my liking, but its not like many other bleaching products, however I can tolerate it&lt;br /&gt;Am I going to buy this product again...NO, would i suggest someone else try it, maybe. Not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same, what may work for me may not work for you or vice versa.</li>
    <li> I had very dark underarms for like about 4 years. I wasn&#x27;t free to raise my arms because it was very noticeable. I couldn&#x27;t use the shirts i wanted to. I bought this product a long time ago and it didn&#x27;t work because i didn&#x27;t use it constantly. I bout it again Nd it came in April 15 and i&#x27;ve been using it everyday twice a day. Today May 2 i decided to wax to see the difference and it did work. I was really happy about my skin lightening. :) &lt;3</li>
    <li> It really works. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t work, but the gel works.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the cream and it faded my dark marks! its a keeper!</li>
    <li> I was running out of my FIRST tube of the xtreme brightening GEL. I thought I had ordered the 3 tubes of brightening gel, but mistakenly ordered the cream. So instead of returning it I decided to try it since I was already out of my gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it last night and the this morning I had a very noticeable improvement! Yay! I am Latina and my underarms were very, very, dark. I was using the brightening gel twice a day, morning and at night. One gel tube lasted me about 3 weeks. The gel worked very well and had a nice scent to it. I&#x27;ll re-order the gel once I use all the Xtreme creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream does not have the same scent as the gel. The gel&#x27;s scent is similar to a baby powder scent where as the cream smells like a lightening cream/chemical order. The cream also contains hydroquinone. Im unsure if the gel contains it too, but I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on day two of the cream and applied it this morning. I have also stopped shaving my underarms and using natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms were close to a black (dark) color and now they a closer to a medium dark. I hope to have underarm clarity matching my skin tone within one month. Overall, I&#x27;d say expect to use gel or cream for up to two months if your situation is like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a month if requested. Good luck to everyone. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would work And it didntnt.njust gave me a rash and I felt a burning sensation in my pits. Not ordering again</li>
    <li> Smells awful, heavy texture and does not work. The gel formula is a better option although I have not seen a major improvement my skin does look more even overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the gel version awhile back and consumed my first tube (works great compared to this one) and so I tried this one because it was cheaper. Only used it once or twice because I cannot stand the smell. Very awful odor from it. Smells like burnt plastic of some sort. I threw it away. I will stick to the gel and wait for the prices to drop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of whitening cream or deodorant before, for my under arms but it&#x27;s useless. Some burn my under arm. But this product really awesome.. I love using this it&#x27;s effective on me.. Thumbs up..!!!!</li>
