      <li>I rinsed my hair and applied a good amount of the conditioner from root to tip</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a longtime user of Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner. It was my Holy Grail conditioner for my thin, babyfine curly hair. The formula appears to have changed......it is not as thick, and it used to have a pearlescent quality to it. It is now runny and blah and doesn&#x27;t look pearly--just like every other conditioner out there. It does not work the way it used to. It now leaves my hair dry and tangly, whereas before it left it soft and moisturized(no tangles).&lt;br /&gt;I thought perhaps I had gotten a bad batch, so I bought another bottle-----same thing, nasty hair.&lt;br /&gt;WHY, WHY, would they change their formula when it was SO successful for so many people? People bought it because it worked when other conditioners wouldn&#x27;t! Now it&#x27;s changed to something completely ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;After 7 years of regular use, I will no longer be buying this product or recommending it to others. It simply doesn&#x27;t work the way it used to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really sad about this, as this was the only conditioner that worked on my hair. I&#x27;m on the hunt for something that works the way AOHR used to.</li>
    <li> I tried the Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner after reading a lot of glowing reviews about it.  I liked the ingredient list and the fact that the ingredients were all natural.  The price on Amazon.com was excellent.   I purchased it along with another item and got free shipping.  You got to love that.  The conditioner is very thick which makes it difficult to get out of the container.  I&#x27;m thinking about adding some oil or water to make it easier to use.  I used the conditioner with a plastic cap and heat for 20 minutes.  My hair felt moisturized immediately afterwords.  But, after rinsing and air drying my hair was as dry as ever. I liked this conditioner and will continue use it. However, it was not my Holy Grail....the hunt continues for the *perfect* deep conditioner.  Something that will leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized even after my hair has air dried.</li>
    <li> This conditioner defined my daughter&#x27;s 4a curls beautifully. Like the previous poster, I also used this under a coconut oil seal on her hair, and three days later, they are still gorgeous little curls!!</li>
    <li> I have been completely natural for only a few months and from the beginning have only used all natural products. I love this conditioner. The scent alone sold me and the consistency is wonderful and leaves my 4a/bit o&#x27; 3c hair so moisturized, soft, supple, silky, need I say more. I apply it as it describes on the bottle, on dry hair, leave for 20 mins then wash or co-wash in shower. I&#x27;ve also used it as a deep condish after a wash with a plastic cap and 20 minutes of heat. I have just seen the other commentor who uses it as a leave-in so will have to try that next. I absolutely love this conditioner and would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> So after reading all these great reviews, I made a trek to an organic health food store in a town a half hour away to pick some of this up. It was expensive-ish ($19 for the shampoo and the conditioner) but I was really eager to try it. I have long, naturally curly hair that has been color treated MANY times MANY years ago. It&#x27;s very thick, and my mom swore it would thin as I got older, but I&#x27;m 26 and it&#x27;s still as thick as can be. I always try many different kinds of shampoo and conditioners and have never gotten really fantastic results from any of them.   I started using the Yes to Carrots line for my face, then I ordered the shampoo and conditioner. I have yet to receive it, but doing that got me interested in other organic products. Aubrey products are actually 100% organic, whereas the YTC line is only 96% organic.   Anyway, I used the Honeysuckle Rose shampoo and conditioner this morning in the shower and, though it did seem to make my hair softer and silkier when it was wet, it wasn&#x27;t the miracle that others had described. My hair felt a tad softer when it was dry (I let it air dry, I almost NEVER heat-style), but nothing all that remarkable. Some of the reviews say to be patient, it will work, and I will continue to use it, but so far I&#x27;m not floored as I hoped I would be. I like it, though. It&#x27;s got a nice texture, and the smell is strong, but it goes away when your hair is dry. I like the fact that it is vegan, organic, and made in the US. If I could go back in time and choose whether or not to buy it again, I still would. I think it will improve my hair over time.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. Used it twice and it left my hair very soft and hydrated. Will continue to use it. For those who are looking for flowery smells this may not be for you. But if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality conditioner this is for you. This is serious stuff for your hair. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, occasionally I&#x27;ve tried switching to something else but I always come back. Aubrey conditioners are only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for my hair. I love the Honeysuckle Rose for the smell though some of the other scents are less girly for some of you guys. The Honeysuckle Rose is a very light scent that smells exactly like it suppose to but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I have very dry, very fine hair that has a tendency to look dull and stringy if not taken care of. Aubrey conditioners are the only conditioners that I&#x27;ve found that moisturizer my hair without making my highly sensitive skin/scalp break out. Lately I&#x27;ve started using it before I wash my hair as a hair mask. (Putting the conditioner on my dry hair.) After an hour or so my hair has almost completely absorbed all the conditioner! I am also going to try it as a leave in conditioner. It can be difficult to rinse out if used like a regular conditioner, putting it on first prevents any greasy feel and gives my hair more time to hydrate. I only need to do this one a week to keep my hair healthy, the rest of the time I just use a watered down shampoo. (The Aubrey Shampoos though they seem to be good quality don&#x27;t work for my hair, I use another brand.) If you have oily hair this product would probably be over kill but I can&#x27;t recommend it enough for dry hair. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, bouncy and smelling great!</li>
    <li> This is a spectacular conditioner!!!  I am a black female with relaxed and color treated hair.  Despite the chemicals, My hair is very healthy and my stylist and I work very hard to keep it this way.  So I am very particular about my hair care products.  My hair doesn&#x27;t like lots of protein so I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a sulfate/paraben and protein free conditioner.  I read a few blogs and saw the ingredients of this conditioner and decided it was worth a try.  I am amazed at the results!  I rotate between hot oil treatments and moisture every week to keep my hair hydrated.  Theses ingredients are top of the line and the results left my hair so soft, moisturized and without weighing it down.  This will now be a staple in my hair regiment along side virgin coconut oil and my secret weapon (can&#x27;t tell you what it is).  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a vitamin shoppe and after the reviews I had seen, I expected miracles. But this conditioner really didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair was left feeling brittle and dried out pretty quickly afterwards. Now it&#x27;s just another bottle of unused hair product banished to the dark recesses of a bottom bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> At one point, no other conditioner rivaled this one. It was the best. My hair was happier with this in it over all other conditioners I had tried for my newly natural hair. I was willing to invest the extra money on it because of its superiority&#x27;. It is just not the same. Everyone who says it is runny, watered down and doesn&#x27;t smell as pleasant is exactly right. I will no longer be blowing my money on this subpar product.</li>
    <li> Just tried for the first time after reading positive reviews on natural hair forums.  My hair detangled very easily after using and was soft and manageable.  Great conditioner for combating dry brittle locks made worse by the bitter cold!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think Aubrey Organics makes incredible conditioners however this one didn&#x27;t work out so well for me. The smell is really strong and overall it didnt moisturize my hair the way I had hoped. On the flip side, it is a very thick and heavy conditioner which is what I need for the winter months. So it will not go to waste but I will not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> For reference, I am an African American female with mid-back length hair that is wavy in places, curly (3b) in others, and very thick with a tendency to frizz.  My son has gorgeous corkscrew curls that are dry as sandpaper, even after intense moisturizing.  After comparing ingredients between this and the White Camelia Conditioner, I decided on the Honeysuckle Rose to try as a leave-in for both myself and my son. It gave good results for me as a leave-in when I used it under virgin coconut oil for a wash-n-go.  But on my sons dry-as-a-bone corkscrews, it worked wonders as a leave-in, giving him moist shine and softness that lasted just about all day.  After co-washing his hair with Suave Naturals conditioner, I apply about a quarter sized amount of Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner to his hair while still damp.  Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time using an all natural product on my biracial type hair, and while it was okay, i dont think i&#x27;ll buy it again. My hair wasn&#x27;t all that moisturized when using this product however when i would straighten my hair then i would see the effects of this conditioner. My hair would be super straight. When i use my hair natural after conditioning with this it was still a bit frizzy and i had to use hair grease so it wouldnt look dry. I would leave this in for 20-30 mins but honestly Dove conditioners do a better job and my hair is way softer.</li>
    <li> Pricey but a great product.  Love the Aubrey organics line for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried to order this I order the shampoo by mistake and loved it. I order this right the second time and used it today and loved it. I have been transitioning to natural African American hair for the past 9 months and this is the only product that softens my hair to were I can truly detangle it with ease. I have 3c/4a hair. The product is very thick, almost like a moisturizer or a lotion type consistency to me. I mixed it with some honey and coconut oil and used it as a deep conditioner (as I have done with other conditioners and still never gotten this good of results). My hair doesnt even feel like my hair because it is so soft. It has also loosened my curl pattern. It has been over 10 hrs since I washed my hair and i can just run my fingers through my curls with no problem. At first, I was thinking I wasn&#x27;t going to use this as a cowash conditioner bc my hair doesnt really feel clean after a cowash, but this left my hair feeling clean but moisturized. This will now be the only conditioner that I use. Love it</li>
    <li> It smells good, but beware if you have long thick hair you will go through the bottle quickly.  If it was a little cheaper or came in a bigger bottle it might be  worth it....I used it all in a week of hairwashing.</li>
    <li> I Love Love this condtioner, it makes my hair so soft, I am a natural  and i havent found to many condtioners i like that make my hair feel soft  and its all natural, i love to co-wash my hair with it, that i dont like shampoos  i use conditioners, but aubrey organics honeysuckle rose is the best, i wish the bottle was bigger  i got to order some more 2 at the time.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair with damage from bleaching it. I am currently growing all the bleached portions out and going all natural for the first time in 22 years. I have never found a shampoo or conditioner that I loved. Nothing ever made my damaged hair look less frizzy or feel soft until I washed my hair with AO Honeysuckle Rose shampoo and conditioned it with this conditioner today. My hair has just finished air drying and I couldnt wait to write the review. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical because it seems there are a few negative reviews and since nothing worked for me before I assumed this wouldnt either. I was wrong! My hair has never felt so soft and smooth. It literally feel like strands of silk, even the damaged ends. there is also no frizz anymore. I will not be caught washing my hair with the toxic chemical shampoos and conditioners I have been using all my life again. I have found my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Aubrey&#x27;s Organic Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner at Good Foods Grocery, and I am very pleased with the results.  I am an African American woman with fine, shoulder length hair which I relax it about 3 times per year. My hair tends to be very frizzy, and the conditioner left my hair very soft, more manageable and less frizzy. My hair had become very dry and tangled in the last few months and using this conditioner really made a positive difference.    This is the first product I have purchased from Aubrey Organics, and I do plan to try more of them in the future.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so bad, my hair looked horrible after I used it. First of all it does not do anything what it is supposed to do, I could not even comb my hair after using it. Second of all, my hair looked dirty after I washed it. I am never going to use any product form this brand as it is obvious to me they use lies to advertise their products. If the ratings would allow minus points I would definitely use them now, unfortunately I have to put one star which they don&#x27;t deserve it as this product did nothing for my hair, it even made it worst ever. My hair never looked so bad, unless I don&#x27;t wash it for a week or so. I would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an East African woman with curly hair. I purchased this because it has no cones and is moisturizing for winter. I&#x27;ve heard bad reviews on the smell, but I love it! It made my hair smell great, I can use as a deep conditioner, and I got great moisture. Detangling was easy and I can&#x27;t wait to co wash with it!</li>
    <li> I am an AA woman with 3b/3c/4a hair and while this was conditioning, it wasn&#x27;t a spectacular product. It also seemed to leave a film in my hair and my hands every time I touched my hair. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t rinsing well enough.</li>
    <li> African American Natural 4A/B hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for a conditioner that actually penatrates my hair shaft and makes my hair stronger, this does. I follow the deep conditioning directions except, I sit under a hooded dryer for 10 mins (hair in plastic cap). No, this may not be the best detangler. This conditioner does not make my hair super soft like Giovanni Smooth as Silk but, it strenghtens my hair which prevents breakage and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;ve compared shed hair pre Aubrey Organics to post Aubrey Organics shed hair, the post hair is notably stronger. I deep condition my hair as stated above, shampoo, and then apply Giovanni Smooth as Silk mixed with Aubrey Organics for 5 mins, to give me that smooth finish. *****Important note, rinse your hair with cold water to close up the hair cuticle.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! My hair is relaxed. It moisturizes &amp; conditions my hair and leaves my hair soft and easy to detangle! At first I was weary to purchase this because of some negative reviews--but all I can say is that my hair loves it!!! Remember, what might not work for someone might work for you and vice versa..Listen to your hair. I also love the fact that I can go to Whole Foods or Vitamin Shoppe to pick this up and it&#x27;s only $10-11 and it&#x27;s all natural! I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like to do my homework before buying cosmetics and hair products and I read quite a few reviews on this conditioner. I have thick curly hair that tends to be dry and so many people gush about this conditioner on the \\&quot; curly websites\\&quot; that I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I usually judge a conditioner by how quickly I can get a comb easily thud my hair after I put the conditioner in and by how smooth and silky my hair feels right after I rinse it out. This conditioner does neither for me BUT I do mix a bit of it with my gel and my hair is less crunchy from the gel plus I&#x27;m hoping it has a long term positive effect on my hair by using it as a leave in...</li>
    <li> I love all the Aubrey products that I own &amp; use (GBP, Island Spice, Aloe-jojoba) and now the Honeysuckle Rose conditioner. I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo bc I heard it wasn&#x27;t that great but I LOVE the conditioner. I use this after I use my heavy protein treatment &amp; it makes my hair very soft &amp; moisturized. It&#x27;s very thick which I love &amp; best of all its cruelty free :-). I am african american with fine realxed hair &amp; it works great. I&#x27;m going to try this as a leave-in too!</li>
    <li> I am a busy college student with bushy 3c/4a curls. Since the bottle is on the smaller side, I stick to using this as a once a week deep conditioner. It is very thick, but you notice water isn&#x27;t an ingredient so there are no fillers and it actually SINKS into your hair. When I&#x27;m at my wit&#x27;s end and all of my other conditioners aren&#x27;t moisturizing enough  I&#x27;ll smear this all over and do chores for a few hours with a plastic cap. I&#x27;m always amazed that when I take off the cap all of the thick white conditioner has been absorbed into my hair. Seriously a GREAT product, the smell is gentle and natural (I hate overpowering man-made scents) and it leaves my hair LUSH and BEAMING with shine. Staple product forever.</li>
    <li> I resort to washing my hair every other day, and as a result, my becomes considerably knotted and mangled. (Although this is mainly due to my lack of brushing it daily.) I used this product after using a very basic shampoo, and not only does my hair smell phenominal, it feels hydrated and I can actually run a comb through it with little effort. I really can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;m glad to have purchased this product and will definitely continue doing so for as long as I live. (Unless they enhance the formula, of course.)</li>
    <li> This conditioner has all the best things for your hair: coconut oil, aloe juice, shea butter, jojoba oil, and many others. No fillers here and nothing that&#x27;s going to make you toxic. Considering the ingredients, I would bet this would make a great face cream. As a conditioner, it is the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet. I have dry, coarse hair that curls into a frizzy mess (or at least it did when I used sulfate products) but this conditioner makes it smooth, shiny, manageable and healthy. Everything by this brand is totally awesome. Aubrey is everything we expect in a great product: all natural effective ingredients, cruelty free, made in USA, and none of the crap that causes cancer. Highly recommended, especially for African Americans or anyone with curly hair, dry hair, coarse hair, heat treated or color treated hair.</li>
    <li> i bought this conditioner because i had a few knots that was so bad i thought i would have to cut and i saw a youtube review where a woman with natural curly hair said she used this and the knots just started coming out without much detangling. i used this and i will say the knots i thought i would have to cut did come out but my hair felt really dry while they were coming out and i saw alot of shedding. since i have been natural my hair doesnt really shed that much so this product was bitter sweet. for the knots that was REALLY DIFFICULT i used both giovanni smooth as silk and aubrey organics together and i am telling you the knots do not stand a chance with those 2 conditioners mixed together.i will say i will stick to giovanni smooth as silk and stay on top of detangling my hair so this problem wont happen again but if it does i would not put aubrey organics on my whole head i would put it on the knots that are too hard to get out with giovanni smooth as silk. i would do a strand test or a section of hair test to see if causes a lot of shedding before i put it on my whole head. its okay but i am sticking to giovanni smooth as silk. my hair never shed with giovanni conditioner.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like the smell so much that I can&#x27;t attest for how well it works - I&#x27;ve only been able to use it once. The odor reminds me of the perfume making kit a friend of mine had as a kid where you could make cheap, bad selling perfume with blue or yellow dye. The scent of the conditioner makes me feel slightly nauseous (though a lot of perfumes have that affect on me). I didn&#x27;t know something natural could smell so artificial. Hopefully the store will take it back!</li>
    <li> Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner has to be the utmost moisturizing conditioner I&#x27;ve owned up to date.  I am a Hispanic, late 20&#x27;s, who was on a path of finding staple products right after I stressed my hair out with severe heat damage.  After a year of trying several products on my 3C type hair, it was evident I needed lots of moisture.  This product provided that and more.  It serves as a great deep treatment, alongside essential oils; it is well for a leave-in because the ingredients are organic and safe to leave onto the hair and scalp; it contains ingredients that are proven to promote hair growth; and dry curly hair drinks this stuff up. It is indeed a STAPLE curly hair girl PRODUCT.    If you&#x27;re interested in additional reviews, visit me on YOUTUBE, under username, \\&quot;CCNYCA\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this conditioner to be so thick.  The directions say to shake the bottle before using but the formula is so thick I couldn&#x27;t even make the liquid move by shaking vigorously.  In the shower, using this product felt very nourishing and rich.  It was during the blow drying process that I noticed the heaviness in my hair.  It also feels like there is residual conditioner in my hair and a bit sticky.  This may be too heavy for my hair.  My hair is on the fine side and damaged from abusing it with a blow dryer and flat iron everyday.  I may use this only on my ends and not too much of the product and see now it goes.  If it still weights my hair down, I&#x27;ll use this as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> I believe u should TRY a product before posting a review about it, and AVOID giving 1 star reviews based on the Smell of the product.This conditioner is amazing !It made my hair supple ,incredibly soft and shiny ,it has a thick consistency ,it can be applied smoothly from root to end ,it s extremely noushing yet not heavy or greasy .I have fine hair and this is the best conditioner i ve used so far ..and i ve tried many ... 2thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I have curly (type 3b for those who hairtype). I do not use silicones, and my hair is protein sensitive. it is hard to find an effective conditioner that is rich, thick and free of both silicones and proteins. This stuff works wonders. It tames my curls and quenches their thirst. No buildup from silicones, no dryness from proteins. Lovely.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great for my 3C biracial (black/white) curls, which tend to be thin and dry.  It has the perfect balance of moisture and \\&quot;slip\\&quot; for detangling my hair.  It smells really good too.  The price and shipping costs are phenomenal too.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!  And the fact that it&#x27;s an organic product is a major plus.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. So far its my favorite one from the Aubrey Organics line (though I have others on order to try). Aubrey Organics is completely natural - unlike other brands who may claim to be natural and/or organic (but somehow still manage to sneak the icky chemicals in) - so that alone makes this an awesome product for someone who&#x27;s concerned about what their beauty products are made from. And on top of that, after only a few days of consistent use, my hair is softer and silkier than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried. The smell is a little strong, but fades to a nice subdued floral scent after the hair dries. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve gone back to using Aubrey Organics. I&#x27;ve spent a few years trying out all the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands to find the perfect line for my hip length hair...again, of all those supposedly natural brands - Aubrey&#x27;s seems to be the only one that really is purely natural, and on top of that, has been the best for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Okay, I followed the shampoo with this conditioner and as soon as i put a dab of the conditioner on my head my hair instantly felts soft. I was really amazed! It was real easy to de-tangle, too. The fresh scent also makes this product worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair, even after repeated use, i felt no difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 21y/o white woman with wavy hair that has been heat styled, dyed, ignored, over brushed, tangled, scrunched, and generally abused to the point that you could actually hear a distinct crunching sound from my poor hair if you grabbed a lock in your fingers. It was ridiculous. But, no number of specialty conditioners or deep treatments ever did anything to restore the slightest hint of vitality to my hair. Until this stuff. After the very FIRST wash, it was soft, smooth and oh so silky. It doesn&#x27;t even seem possible. Fair warning, though, if you&#x27;ve only ever smelled honeysuckle from a distance or in small quantities you might be surprised by the strength of the honeysuckle scent in this shampoo- its almost intense enough to think you&#x27;ve dived headfirst into a bush hoping to suffocate. Thankfully, I really love the smell, and it fades to the light, airy fragrance we know and love once your hair is dry again.</li>
    <li> I am tired of trying organic shampoos and conditioners. My conventional shampoo and conditioners were very good but I wanted to try organic ones.  I have tried many brands from whole food store. Along with this I had bought \\&quot;Aubrey Organics - Camomile Luxurious Herbal Shampoo\\&quot;.  My hair started falling  A LOT from the very first day, during shower and whenever I combed, also otherwise.  My hair then started becoming brown.  Not understanding which one might be the cause , shampoo or conditioner, I tried the shampoo alone with another organic conditioner I had been using (which made my hair very rough)  . I also tried just the conditioner with my regular shampoo.  But the things were not getting better.  I gave up, came back to my conventional Dove shampoo and conditioner. Its been just 3 washes. My hair is coming back to normal.  I am not sure if its just my hair. May be it did not suit my hair. But just wanted to share my opinion.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet; but am hoping that I will be just as impressed with this product as I have been with the GPB and can change from a 3 star to a 4 star. :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use of the above, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to evaluate the cost effectiveness; as I have long, thick hair and product usually depletes quickly.  But am hopeful to be pleased as the quality of other products have proven to impress.</li>
    <li> I only use Aubrey hair products because all of their ingredients are truly safe enough to eat. My hair is thick, wavy/slightly curly, and tends to get frizzy. I use this conditioner at my gym because they use hard water and this one works best there. I&#x27;ve tried the other \\&quot;Dry Hair\\&quot; products and the Island Naturals and White Camellia left my hair too soft or oily and I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the Desert Herb as much as I like the Honeysuckle Rose. I use the GPB conditioner at home because I have soft water there and the Honeysuckle Rose can make my hair too soft. A recommendation - if you have problems selecting a shampoo and conditioner, bear the water hardness in mind and try several, especially if you shampoo at more than one place. Thank you Aubrey for developing and producing such wonderful products!</li>
    <li> The formula changed for the worse. Thinner and much too runny. Also doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it used to. Seems like the intensity of the smell was decreased by half. It used to be my absolute favorite conditioner. No more.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s so good, and i love the smell, how it untangles my hair, and my hair shines nicely after using it... so good! and it&#x27;s all organic?? this conditioner is amazing... i just need to find a local store that carries it!!</li>
    <li> This Really Get My Tangles Out, Leaving My Hair Soft and Silky. I chose this product originally because of the conditioners it has in it that are really good for my hair. I really love this conditioner in every way!</li>
    <li> I usually love the smell of Rose and Chamomile. Together, the scent is overpowering and hardly pleasant until after the shower is complete and hair is dry.   The product is thick and smooth. It says on the bottle to shake well before using, however that is impossible to do.   As for softness, it does works, but not nearly as well as the swimmer&#x27;s conditioner.   Really, the scent might just be too much for me. Maybe, maybe not.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. it smells really really goood and leaves my hair SUPER moisturized! I use it as a daily moisturizer when my hair is damp since most of the moisturizers out here just arent hitting it &#x3D;/ very happy I learned about this product&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair.  This is great for my hair, and gives it the moisture it desperately needs.</li>
    <li> I love this organic conditioner so much that I bought the organic shampoo as well. I use it mainly for a deep conditioned treatment because it&#x27;s so thick. It leaves my hair soft, manageable and smelling great. It&#x27;s great for hair if you&#x27;re transitioning. I highly recommend this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair for what seems like forever and nothing has worked. I used Pantene&#x27;s long and strong or whatever it&#x27;s called with the same problems- dry hair &amp; split ends. I tried homemade remedies when I found out that conventional shampoos which contain sulfate end up making your hair drier. Nothing. I was resigning myself to having dull, mid-length hair until I read somewhere that organic shampoos were much healthier.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo/conditioner/protein conditioner for 2 weeks and I cannot stop telling people how happy I am with the results. The first week I didn&#x27;t notice any differences in terms of how my hair looked but when I ran my fingers through my hair I could immediately feel like it felt softer. Then it started to get noticeably shinier. And now when my hair dries it is not a frizzy mess. It&#x27;s beautiful! The shine is amazing, and when I straighten my hair I  cannot believe how soft and silky it feels; I never knew my hair could feel so nice. I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of it! I&#x27;ve also noticed in this short time that my hair feels thicker. I finally feel as if I&#x27;ll be able to have long, healthy, beautiful hair for the first time in my life and I&#x27;m so excited!   Some people commented that they didn&#x27;t like the smell. This is completely a matter of taste. I happen to like the smell but my mother states it smells like very strong medicine. It is strong when you are taking a shower but as your hair dries the smell fades fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very curly hair and follow the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method.  I was hoping this would be similar to my Biolage conditioning balm.  It is way thinner.  I can use it as a co-wash but that&#x27;s about it.  It smells great, just not thick enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4a African American hair. This conditioner did leave my hair soft but not as soft as Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner. It also doesn&#x27;t have a lot of slippage. The fragrance is OK, overall I feel that this product is overrated.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It always leaves my hair soft, silky, shiny, and lightly scented (it smells great!).  It never weighs my hair down, it does help with frizzies, and you only need to leave it on your hair a couple minutes.  Best of all, it&#x27;s truly all-natural!!!!!  Aubrey Organics also has a matching shampoo for this conditioner.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> As much as I try to rinse it out, I can&#x27;t. My hair looks dirty right away. It might be good for really dry hair, but if your hair has any tendency toward looking greasy, this won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Aubrey Organics makes some of the best conditioners on earth. I just wish their shampoos were on the same par. I love this conditioner. It makes the hair soft and supple without leaving a film.</li>
    <li> I use this product to refresh my hair after a week to two weeks much needed refresher.  I luv the smell and how soft my curls are after using this product.</li>
    <li> This conditioner actually makes my hair softer and less frizzy than just shampoo alone - which is not something I can say about any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I really like that it is all natural, and it makes my hair feel healthy.  And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite conditioner</li>
    <li> I can really smell the difference between conventional conditioners and more natural conditioners that don&#x27;t contain substances such as mineral oils, sodium laureth sulfates, parabens or artificial fragrances. This conditioner has a very pleasant floral scent and works great with the shampoo of the same scent, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve learned that I really shouldn&#x27;t use too much of this stuff in one go. I have long, straight black hair below-the-shoulder length. I think I should be using like .1 ounce (size of chapstick or something, don&#x27;t know any other point of reference to use here?) in one application. This stuff doesn&#x27;t really lather, but it&#x27;ll spread out quite a bit when you&#x27;re washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think after having used this conditioner for a few weeks now, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is a lot more sleek, straight and easy to comb through. I mean, most conditioners can do this but this conditioner is \\&quot;stuff your hair can eat,\\&quot; without synthetic chemical substances. I guess I could say though, styling my hair to be more straight has been easier with the use of this conditioner. It&#x27;s a slight difference, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish this stuff was cheaper, and/or sold in larger containers.</li>
    <li> from all these fantastic reviews you would think this conditioner worked miracles. bought into it, and it does not. I am african-american and so is my 18-month-old son. didn&#x27;t work any miracles on either of our hair. personnaly all the non-organic conditioners seemed to work better on my hair, and we just gave ended up giving my 18-month-old another haircut.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for detangling, in leave conditioner and deep conditioning. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this back a year ago as I started my journey to dealing with the hair God gave me. I hated this conditioner then because it was too, too thick when applied and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft or detangled. It ended up in the back of my stash and I moved on.  Fast forward to tonight! I pulled this one out thinking how bad could it have been?? Very bad!!!  Since I&#x27;d moved on to better conditioners I noticed immediately that this one did not instantly soften or detangler,  my hair but I kept going.  I sat under the dryer and then rinsed, my hair was a dry Tangled mess!!!! I applied detangler, tried to comb it throughand nothing worked. I started to set my hair and noticed the entire back of my hair was poofy and  dry!!!! Just like I had been in front of a fan!  My hair rejected this soundly!!!!!  Fearing breakage I washed my hair again and applied a good deep conditioner.  All is well now and I threw this entire bottle in the TRASH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I didn&#x27;t throw this out. I use it as a pre-poo and it still doesn&#x27;t perform well for me, but I&#x27;m using it up so maybe my hair will get some kind of benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for almost a year and a half now and during this time I have gone thru so made different brands of conditioner but have never felt fully satisfied. With this conditioner however,I&#x27;ve finally found \\&quot;the one\\&quot;! I have 4a/b kinky, curly, coily hair which tends to dry out easily. With this conditioner there was an instant replenishing of my hair strands. Even after the rinse out I didn&#x27;t even feel the need for a leavin conditioner! This will definitely become a staple in my haircare regimen! I&#x27;ve also hear great things about the AO White Camelia and will be purchasing this as well!</li>
    <li> I recommend Aubry Honeysuckle shampoo and conditioner for those that have coarse, dry, mature hair!</li>
    <li> A year ago I quit using chemical products in my hair, because of hair loss &amp; damage. I had been using other natural shampoo &amp; conditioners, until they either became unavailable or stripped my hair. I&#x27;ve ordered several different conditioners from Aubrey and love this one the most. It is the scent that is so light &amp; feminine, plus the conditioning power of this stuff id amazing! I put it on with a shower cap an hour before I shower, then shampoo &amp; condition again. When I brush there are no tangles, very little hair loss &amp; my hair is so silky, shiny &amp; full of life! The other day a friend asked if I had dyed my hair because the natural color is coming back out! I also have the shampoo that goes with this condition &amp; it works great to get my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;The softness, shine &amp; life this stuff brings back into you hair is literally amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not put anything else into my hair again after using these products. The conditioner is thick, yet it does not weigh down hair. I have medium thick, dark, middle of my back Latin hair. This works great for me &amp; my grandmother who has short, dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and doesn&#x27;t linger. In my opinion this one smells the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/24/13&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using Aubrey products in my hair about 6 months ago &amp; started trying out the salon brands (Chi, Sebastian) Chi worked very well in my hair, but the price is so expensive that I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep buying it. Then I went to store brands like Herbal Essences &amp; Garnier. The only one I have stuck to is Garnier because the ingredients are partially natural &amp; the shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out so bad. A few days ago I started using Aubrey conditioner with the Garnier shampoo &amp; my hair is actually softer, shinier, easier to manage &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel so brittle. When I stopped using Aubrey my hair was getting very brittle, dry &amp; had so much split ends that I had to cut 3 inches off the length. I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference if I stopped using Aubrey in my hair and tried something else, but I guess it did, because I didn&#x27;t change anything else but the product I was using to cleanse &amp; condition my hair. Now I am using Garnier shampoo, Aubrey conditioner &amp; a wonderful whipped mouse from Bamboo. My hair is shiny, silky &amp; less fall out since going back to Aubrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair &amp; budget are different. If you have great luck with Aubrey that is wonderful, I did have a great experience but after a few months my hair was getting weighed down by the conditioners &amp; I tried about all of them to see which one would stop my hair from being so weighed down. My cousin owns a hair salon and told me to change up my brands of shampoo/conditioner every couple of months to keep my hair from getting weighed down &amp; used to a certain product. I&#x27;ve done that since stopping using Aubrey within the last 6 months &amp; it worked. I have given my hair a break and now am just using the Aubrey conditioner everyday.ence if I stopped using Aubrey in my hair and tried something else, but I guess it did, because I didn&#x27;t change anything else but the product I was using to cleanse &amp; condition my hair.

    <li> I have to agree with the review above. I&#x27;m so disappointed in Aubreys product now.&lt;br /&gt;I was a faithful costumer loved their products all I neded was 1 conditioner for deep conditioning treatments and rinse out, but now Aubrey is straight garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their conditioners used to melt into my hair even if I was only doing a rinse out. Now the products just sit on top off hair it&#x27;s never absorbed and my hair doesn&#x27;t drink it on like the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even called Aubreys hotline to tell them that their products didn&#x27;t work like before the new labels and they treated me like I didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about. The attendant no fault of hers just read me the script no these are the same products as before it&#x27;s just a labeling change to comply with labeling regulations.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried 1 more bottle same thing didn&#x27;t work like the original. I wonder how many people have to complain before they get it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no dummy I know something IS different it&#x27;s so obvious like trying to hide sunshine with a toothpick come on Aubrey we all KNOW what you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Whole Foods is slowly and quietly dropping their line. Now I&#x27;m searching for a new rinse out conditioner and deep conditioner because with original Aubreys I had both in 1 bottle.  Bad move you just lost another customer Aubrey.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing as a deep conditioner (haven&#x27;t tried it as a rinse out or Leave in b/c it&#x27;s kind of pricy and I have long hair) I do exactly what the directions says but tweak it to my hair needs I apply a small amount about a palm full to dry sometimes damp hair I leave on for anywhere from 1 hour - overnight with a shower cap and hair bonnet then I rinse in the morning OMG my hair is soft not slippery and curls are defined frizz free the smell is ok I didn&#x27;t like it at first going from using herbal Essenes long term relationship amazing smelling products to natural was hard but when I&#x27;ve seen that this product does what it says the smell grew on me . I would deffinately reccommend this to anyone with frizzy curly hair and I will be purchasing this again before my bottle runs out</li>
    <li> Curl type: Even blend of thick 3c and 4a with some wavy bits. African textured, transitioning with 50% natural, 50% relaxed, mid-back length hair. Hair texture: Fine to medium-coarse, highly porous hair (does not hold moisture well).    Let me first say that I was initially put off by the price of the product. I bought it at a local vitamin store for around the same price as Amazon. Since, I&#x27;m transitioning (going from relaxed to natural hair), I figured that I would try to be as organic as possible--this conditioner certainly fits the bill! It&#x27;s so thick in consistency that I could not follow the directions to \\&quot;shake well\\&quot;, but this was a good thing for me because I was seeking something somewhat \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; for my thirsty curls and damaged relaxed hair.     I normally co-wash (\\&quot;wash\\&quot; hair with conditioner only), so a condtioner this thick is perfect for my thick hair. I rinsed my hair and applied a good amount of the conditioner from root to tip and I let it sit for about 5 minutes. Upon rinsing out the conditoner, I immediately noticed the slip that it gave my hair. My hair was also VERY easy to detangle with my fingers. The smell was quite strong, but not harsh in my opinion--very floral though. Once my hair dried it was noticeably softer than it normally is.     Though the results were great from my first two trials of rinsing the product, I found that my highly porous hair actually benefits more from this conditioner when I apply a vegetable glycerin and water (1:4 spray bottle) mix to dampen my dry hair and use the Aubrey Organics as a leave-in. I tried it this way because I was looking to weigh my hair down with moisture and to my surprise it worked! The instructions state that you can apply the product to dry hair as well. It has been 3 days and my hair is super soft, slightly weighted (like I wanted) and uber moisturized! My hair is even shiny, something that my natural hair somewhat lacks ordinarily. This is the hydration that my hair has been waiting for!!!My curls have better \\&quot;hang\\&quot;, less poof and more shine and my edges are easily smoothed now. It does not get any better than this for me, so I highly recommend this product even over Giovanni, Suave Naturals, etc.     Thank you Aubrey Organics!!!</li>
    <li> Good price+shipping:)</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOW GARBAGE!! Aubrey&#x27;s death was very unfortunate because I&#x27;m sure he is turning in his grave if he knew how his children have completely and utterly disgraced his product line with garbage ingredients. Two nights ago I did my usual routine and purchased the Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner from my local Whole Foods. I was using the product as usual that night and as I was working it through my hair I noticed a major difference in how the product felt and how it was affecting my hair. THe reason I have so loved the Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner was because it was the only conditioner among many that I have tried that left my hair feeling, moisturized, bouncy, curly, smooth and overall rejuvenated. I immediately noticed a difference when I was using this new bottle on my hair. Something in my mind told me to pick up my old bottle that I had in the shower and the new bottle I had just purchased. The bottles looked the same but the ingredients and labeling are radically different. THe old bottle says 100%Natural No Parabens or Petrochemicals while the new bottle only says All Natural ingredients. The old bottle has the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Fatty Acid Cream Base, Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Shea Butter, Wheat Germ Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Rosa Mosqueta® Rose Hip Seed Oil; Extracts of Fennel, Hops, Balm Mint, Mistletoe, Camomile, Yarrow, Chrysanthemum, Angelica, Forsythia and Magnolia; Honeysuckle Oil, Carrot Oil, Aubrey&#x27;s Preservative (Citrus Seed Extract, Vitamins A, C and E).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe new bottle has these ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua, cetyl alcohol, alcohol denat. (38b, lavender*), butyrospermum parkii (shea butter)*, triticum vulgare (wheat) germ oil, lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) extract, aloe barbadensis (aloe) leaf juice*, glycerin, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, rosa rubignosa (Rosa Mosqueta®) seed oil*, citrus grandis (grapefruit) extract, tocopheryl acetate, foeniculum vulgare (fennel) fruit extract, humulus lupulus (hops) extract, melissa officinalis (balm mint) leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, daucus carota sativa (carrot) root extract, beta-carotene, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, angelica archangelica extract, chrysanthemum sinense flower extract, magnolia biondii flower extract, ascorbic acid. *Organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thi is a total change in formula and a HUGE change in the effectiveness of the product. I am incredibly disappointed that Aubrey has decided to reduce their product to such garbage(and still charge the same price) and drag the Aubrey name in the dirt. Aubrey Organics has long been known for selling pure and natural products and have now reduced themselves to insulting its consumers and long time supporters of the brand name by selling low quality products for the same price. I am willing to pay good money for quality products but I cannot stress enough how much it infuriates me to have to pay a high price for poisoning, unnatural, garbage ingredients.  The old formula did great things for my hair and in my line of work I have recommended it to many customers who have asked me what is the best conditioner based on their hair type and I have always steered them toward Aubrey knowing that I was recommending a great product. Now it embarrasses me to know that I may have led people to buy what I thought was a great product but what I now know is new garbage. It makes me look like a liar and I&#x27;m offended that Aubrey would change their formula to something so cheap and not inform their customers. I hope the people at Aubrey take note and that other users of the brand speak out against this new horrible change and low standard of products from Aubrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Hurt, Frustrated, and Enraged FORMER Consumer</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews for products I actually like but I had to let people know about this product. I&#x27;ve been using this Conditioner for a few months about now and I love what is has done for my hair!! I&#x27;m an African American college student that is in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural (for the second time) and I must say this is a must have! After using it makes your feel so soft and easy to manage, just amazing! For the first time I&#x27;m ordering the shampoo as well so I will see how that goes!</li>
    <li> My toddler&#x27;s hair has been very dry since his baby hair is now gone. This product has added moisture back into his hair and I am able to manage and style his hair, if it is with a wide tooth comb or pick to make his natural curls bouncy or if I am wanting to braid his hair, no more fighting with the dryness and tangles. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing!!! Needed help with my overly dry relaxed hair which is long and for the first time I can say this is a keeper for me!! A great detangler and conditioner, made combing thru incredibly easy and left my hair so soft and shiny I went ahead and ordered a few more bottles to keep this in stock, simply great!! Highly recommend for anyone struggling with thick, dry and easy to tangle hair!</li>
    <li> I have an old bottle of this formula and it list the following as ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Fatty Acid Cream Base, Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Shea Butter, Wheat Germ Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Rosa Mosqueta® Rose Hip Seed Oil; Extracts of Fennel, Hops, Balm Mint, Mistletoe, Camomile, Yarrow, Chrysanthemum, Angelica, Forsythia and Magnolia; Honeysuckle Oil, Carrot Oil, Aubrey&#x27;s Preservative (Citrus Seed Extract, Vitamins A, C and E).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a new bottle, not knowing the change, and noticed a difference first in the texture of the conditioner (it was way more watery - no surprise since the first ingredient now is water!) and then also in my hair - it was not nearly as soft. I am so sad to see this change and also to see that the price has increased (!) since changing to obviously cheaper ingredients (like switching from Coconut as the first ingredient to water - which was not in the original formula at all).</li>
    <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and although I was very dissapointed with the shampoo, the conditioner was very thick and it made my hair very easy to comb through.  I have very thick, coarse hair and I have to have moisturizing shampoo even though it isn&#x27;t technically \\&quot;damaged\\&quot;.  This stuff was great and the smell is amazing.  I would continue to use the conditioner, but the shampoo does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this conditioner.  This is all natural and good for people with sensitive skin and sensitive noses.  The scent is very subtle and the conditioner detangles my long thick hair extremely well.  It leaves my hair feeling like silk.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Due to bad maple shampoo which almost destroyed my hair the honeysuckle rose shampoo and conditioner did wonders for my hair. Thanks</li>
    <li> I use only two conditioners, one is GPB from this same line and the other is this one, the Honeysuckle Rose. With these two I dont need to use anything else. I use the Honeysuckle Rose as my daily conditioner and the GPB as a hair treatment. I apply the conditioner and let it sit on my hair while I shower. After that I comb out my hair and rinse, voila I&#x27;m done and my hair is soft and moisterized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about parabens and chemicals so I use this conditioner as a substitute for many things in the shower. I use this instead of shaving creams always, my legs, and arm pits are grateful. I am big on exfoliating and in winter after I shower, I add baking soda to the Honeysuckle Rose and apply it all over my body in a circular motion (paying attention to elbows, knees, hands, and feet) then do my final rinse. I do this once a week and I follow with shea butter or Extra Virgin Olive oil and this keeps my extra dry winter skin super soft, without chemicals and parabens. And it smells great, so no need for body sprays afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve had a really hard time finding a natural conditioner that works for me, but i finally found one! I have kinky-curly, dry hair and this really smooths it out :)</li>
    <li> I use Aubrey because I put keratin treatments in my hair so I need sulfate free products. I love this line because it&#x27;s all natural and it still does a great job without stripping my hair.</li>
    <li> i only use this conditioner along with the shampoo.  i will not use anything else.  i am glad it ships over seas</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t seem silky after using this conditioner. Also i seemed to need a lot of it just to feel like my hair will be easy to comb after washing it. I hope there are better organic/natural hair products out there.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it is organic and i felt safe using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other organic conditioners, but I have found this to be the best.  It&#x27;s leaves my hair (which is very curly) smooth, but yet not too heavy.  (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; at the end of my review!)</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for the scent. It&#x27;s difficult to spread on the hair, and doesn&#x27;t effectively moisturize my thick, coily AA hair. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! I have been searching for a natural alternative to what I had been using with very little luck. Everything I tried had dried out my hair horribly, even though I kind of have oily hair. My hair is on the thick side, curly with lots of frizz thanks to South Florida humidity, but blows out straight when I take the time (or when I am up north). The only product I ever was happy with was Head &amp; Shoulders but I really wanted to get away from using such a nasty product on my head. This product is a dream!!! My hair is shiny, silky, nourished, and I can actually skip a day washing it because it does not get oily. I&#x27;m so in love, I hope they continue to make this forever! I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner together.</li>
    <li> I use this as my regular condition and it makes my hair feel strong and moisturized. It&#x27;s also natural and organic. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I want people to realize 2 things :) -- First, sadly, if your hair is already reeeeaally damaged, no product will fix it. You&#x27;re better off starting over with brand new healthy strands. This leads me to my second point, the average conditioner is loaded with synthtic oils and silicones that coat your hair shaft, making it appear magically softer, giving it more \\&quot;slip\\&quot; and a false sense of moisture retention. It&#x27;s like someone with really bad skin layering on MAC makeup everyday rather than addressing their skin issues.... Then when you wash it all off, its back to damage city again. The gunk in conditioners that sticks to your hair does more harm than good in the long run! Please, please do your research if you are depending on a hair product *alone* to give you manageable hair...    Anywho, I love Aubrey&#x27;s conditioners. This one is great!! I have 4a/b hair with some odd 3c in the back and I have found that Aubrey coconut fatty based conditioners are super duper moisturizing. I use this one on dry hair. I slather it on and let it sit for about 20 minutes, then I rinse it out and wash or co-wash in the shower. It makes my hair sooooo soft and tangle free. I also use the GBP conditioner in the same manner, which I love even more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find all-natural hair products! This conditioner is not only all-natural, but it works great -- moisturizes well without weighing my straight, fine hair down. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews here and I am so happy I did! This is the best detangling conditioner I have ever tried. In fact, it&#x27;s the best conditioner that I have tried. I am giving away all of my other conditioners because this WILL BE my staple product. This conditioner detangles like no other. My hair 4a/4b/4c hair would get matted at the ends. This conditioner made my tangles disappear. I&#x27;ve been searching for a great product for some time now and I have FINALLY found it! Believe the hype, friends, this stuff WORKS WONDERS!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner for adding moisture to fine, dry, curly hair. I still use coconut oil afterwards. Between the two my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz like it used to yet maintains its curl.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for moisture!!! I love how it doesn&#x27;t have protein like most conditioners because too much protein can make your hair brittle and break so its nice to have this! Its nice and thick and its smells great! I use it as a deep conditioner under a hooded dryer for 20 mins and my hair was so soft and moisturized without being weighed down! Great for dry hair or dry ends!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews from people who were upset the formula is different…well let me tell you; for me the formula change was a good thing. I tried this conditioner about 4 years ago and had so much damage from it because it was TOO moisturizing. I wear a relaxer and I don&#x27;t think I used enough protein products…anyway, my hair started out soft but morphed into mush and I didn&#x27;t understand how to combat it back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m more knowledgeable about black hair maintenance and health. This is the only conditioner that actually infuses REAL moisture (NOT cones, sneaky proteins, mineral oils, etc.) into the hair. I could feel the difference immediately. I have been in search of a deep conditioner that would do this for about 3 months- I&#x27;ve tried the expensive salon brands to the drugstore stuff. Everything left my hair tangly, hard to comb, or coated. This makes my hair feel like butter! Just naturally soft and manageable and smooth. I was so leery to go back to it but I&#x27;m glad I did. I shampoo and do my protein treatment like normal then smooth small amounts all over my hair in small sections, really working the product into my strands. Then I sit under a warm dryer with a processing cap for about 20- 25 mins then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However- take my advice. If you are relaxed and you know you need more protein in your haircare regiment than most, you MUST stay on top of the protein when you use this or you can get out of balance and cause damage. But keep feeding your hair regular doses of protein along with other healthy hair practices and this will make your mane beautiful!</li>
    <li> I was never too fond of rinse out conditioners because I have thick hair and it needs to stay moisturized. But I love this because it makes my hair feel great and it defines my curls a bit even after I wash it out.But naturally this being rinse out conditioner, I had to use another moisturizer for my hair to keep it moisturized haha. And I love the smell. It&#x27;s like a naturey, sweet rose petal-like scent.</li>
    <li> Switched to this conditioner a year or so ago and I&#x27;ll never go back! Smells great and does amazing things to my hair!</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner on dry hair as well as wet hair. While it is moisturizing, there was nothing else spectacular going on considering the price. Detangling wasn&#x27;t much easier unless I deep conditioned with oil on my hair first. It would be the perfect conditioner for cowashes if it just cost a little less. I use the GPB and I will be trying the White Camellia from this line next.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  Extremely conditioning. Highly recommend for dry, lifeless hair.  My hair just loved the moisturizing effect it had after shampooing with the Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this as a leave in, but as just a regular moisturizing conditioner it did nothing to improve the condition of my hair...it actually seems to make it even more brittle and dry! I would recommend Shea Moisture Shea Butter Conditioner to anyone wanting a leave in conditioner that adds great moisture and softness and smells great! This is the review I left for the shampoo which includes some comments about the conditioner:    I read so many positive reviews that I was extremely excited to try this shampoo. I have really dry 4a/4b hair, with 2 daughters that both have 4a. Unfortunately this product wasn&#x27;t the moisture experience for me that it was for all the reviewers. Yes, I shook it before each use and it even lathered a LOT during washings, but after shampooing my hair felt completely stripped of any moisture that it had to begin with! It definitely felt clean as it felt stripped of everything, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give it a 1 star rating...it at least did that. But moisturize, no. I bought the conditioner with it and that added no help whatsoever to softening or moisturizing my hair. It was extremely brittle and rough after drying....worse than when starting. I also tried it on both of my daughters&#x27; hair, tried leaving the conditioner on longer for deep condition, and have waited until 2 months after use to write this review just to be fair. It was the same result with their hair and every single time of use. It was like washing my hair with harsh dish soap. I really didn&#x27;t like the smell either unfortunately. I was hoping that would be the one bonus. I hate wasting money, so I&#x27;m going to use it until the bottle is empty. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying again though. Luckily I also bought a bottle of Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner which makes a dramatic difference in moisture for my daughters and myself. It keeps our hair soft and fluffy ALL day! Now that stuff is awesome!! It has helped counter balance the moisture stripping effect of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has been reformulated and now includes ALMOND OIL.  I had loved this conditioner- it had taken me a couple of years to find a conditioner that did not have harsh chemicals or almond oil.  I am violently allergic to almonds, and now have to start the hunt all over again...&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey, please rerelease the original version!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t much for my hair as I thought it would based upon other reviews. It&#x27;s okay for the product</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for my dry, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Good for co-washing, detangling, deep conditioner. Work well on low porosity hair. Great value, smells great. Heavy, thick, and creamy.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I have used it on dry hair, wet hair and even deep conditioned overnight with it. This product is great for thick, kinky hair. Especially those of us who are transitioning and or natural. I would definitely recommend it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this conditioner is the consistency. I like my conditioners to be thick, but this conditioner was so thick it&#x27;s hard to squeeze out the bottle. I find that adding 4-5 tablespoons of water to it does the trick.</li>
    <li> We are a transracial household, and this conditioner works great for both myself and my husband (European ancestry) and as a co-wash for our two children (African ancestry, 3C hair and 4b hair).  The smell is light, the ingredients organic and non-toxic, and it does a terrific job moisturizing.  I leave in the conditioner for about one minute in my own hair.  For my children, we gently massage it along the scalp and throughout, then leave it in for about five minutes prior to rinsing.  It can also be diluted in distilled water for use as a spray leave-in conditioner.  Love it!    As a less spendy alternative, [[ASIN:B000NNQ4YU Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Moisturizing Conditioner 23 fl oz (700 ml)]] also works great.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this conditioner! I used it for the first time yesterday and was amazed. I am a Black woman with thick type 4a/b hair that is prone to dryness, brittleness and breakage. I have also been transitioning to natural hair over the last few months. In the past, with other shampoos and conditioners, my hair would feel soft while it was wet and for a little while after it air-dried but would soon go back to being hard and dry. With AO Honeysuckle Rose Conditoner (and the shampoo-I bought both) I noticed a difference immediately. Sure, it was soft while wet, as per usual, but it was a different kind of softness. And it STAYED soft as it dried. And now 24 hrs later it&#x27;s STILL soft! I never had that happen before. The super thick formula is like ambrosia to my poor moisture-starved hair. My hair moves, I can get my fingers easily through my tightly coiled curls and I love the light floral scent. I&#x27;m going to try using it as a leave-in conditioner next. And definitely deep condition with an oil (coconut, shea butter, olive, etc) and see what difference that makes. And I&#x27;m DEFINITELY buying more.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick and creamy filled conditioner. After shampooing with the shampoo i apply a very small amount in the palms of my hands, rub them togetherr and distribute through my hair and it feels so soft. I have natural hair at my roots and relaxed hair on the ends and my hair from the roots to ends is so soft. I also like to use this conditioner on my 2yr old daughter&#x27;s hair with a conditioning cap and OMG...her hair is so soft and easily detangled afterwards. I would recommend this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> After hearing the rave reviews from numerous naturalistas about Aubrey Organics, I decided to give it a go and try it out on my twa (about 4.5-6.5 inches all over).... And wow I am so happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the conditioner has a strong-soft scent to it. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering like some products I&#x27;ve used in the past but it does have a nice smell. Now, when it came to applying the conditioner to my hair, I have to agree with other women, it is quite thick to the point that you can barely get it out of the bottle. After each application to my hair, I had to close the lid shut and shake the bottle up just to loosen the conditioner (I have 4b/4a hair with a majority of my head being 4b so there were numeroooous applications all over my head). Although the size of the bottle is relatively small, a pump would work best for this conditioner since it&#x27;s so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once the conditioner was completely applied in my hair, I decided to spray a little bit of water and slap on a processing cap and sat under my hooded dryer for about 25-30 minutes and dear looord I am so happy I did! I have never felt my hair get this soft for a conditioner (then again, it is a deep conditioner...). I&#x27;ve tried this process with Herbal Essences Hello Hydration and Aussie Moist and neither product could ever get my hair to be as soft as it was when I used Aubrey Organics. I&#x27;ve heard some people complain that this conditioner dried out their hair, but I used this over a week ago and I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair felt so great after this, I will definitely use it as a deep conditioner the next time I do my hair and I would definitely recommend this to anyone and to also try it out as a steaming conditioner :)</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily conditioner. My hair is 2b/3a and fine. I try other things, but the grass was not greener and my hair better moisturized with other conditioners. Why do we do keep buying stuff hoping our hair will be perfect? Ain&#x27;t gonna happen except for a day here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I find this conditioner moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t have protein, it doesn&#x27;t have any silicones and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. And it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive. Win!</li>
    <li> If I had to pick *A* detangling conditioner for my type-4 natural hair, it would be this one. I&#x27;ve gone through several different conditioners but I&#x27;ve never encountered one with as much slip as the Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose. It&#x27;s extremely thick and, while it doesn&#x27;t necessarily deliver oodles of moisture to my hair, it does an incredible job as a detangler. As an added bonus, I discovered that as a leave-in conditioner (if I use a small amount on wet/damp hair) it&#x27;s actually pretty moisturising! It also plays well with Kinky Curly Curling Custard (in my hair), so it&#x27;s great to know there&#x27;s an alternative in case I can&#x27;t get any Knot Today.</li>
    <li> Love this! Thick and creamy conditioner that smells amazing and has an awesome EWG rating!</li>
    <li> I bought my Honeysuckle from Whole Foods for $10. Everyone said this was a great conditioner. I tried it and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. It did not feel stronger, healthier, or softer. My detangling process took the same amount of time. So no, this did not help in that department either. I gave it two stars because the conditioner is all natural, free of harsh chemicals and dyes, and is good for all hair types. It also tamed my frizz also.    FYI: I have combo hair. Im transitioning from relaxed to natural so I have chemically straightened hair mixed with 4a natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the heavy floral scent, but it works so well that I&#x27;d probably still use it if it smelled like chicken.</li>
    <li> As a chemist its kind of funny how people freak out because the ingredients listed changed&lt;br /&gt;Well just a warning&lt;br /&gt;The exact same chemicals can be said in different ways&lt;br /&gt;There is formal name and common name. And then there are names people in the industry exclusivly use.&lt;br /&gt;I looked through it and there does not seem to be a major change&lt;br /&gt;I surely did not notice a difference in quality&lt;br /&gt;Its kind of like a placebo effect except opposite i guess... one girl claims her hair feels different with the new label&lt;br /&gt;Everyone suddenly feels their hair is worse off&lt;br /&gt;Try it out without bias and please tell me what you guys think</li>
    <li> I noticed a change in the ingredients as soon as I used the updated (or should I say downgraded) product.  I have tried to find bottles of the product with the original ingredients and am not able to find them.  I will no longer use this product.</li>
    <li> I have thick, straight, hip-length hair and I LOVE this conditioner. I&#x27;m a product junkie, so I&#x27;ve tried a zillion conditioners, some good, some bad; this conditioner is great for moisturizing dry ends. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a leave-in and would be sure to rinse it out well, but it really lives up to the hype. My hair is so shiny and soft after using it!</li>
    <li> A waste of money. It left my 4a hair feeling dry, stringy and rough. I tried it twice and regretted it both times. I do know about ingredient changes  earlier in the year.  But since I had never tried it before, I decided to splurge. What a mistake. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I had high expectation for this product, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards. The shampoo smelled A LOT like \\&quot;Scrubbing Bubbles,\\&quot; yes, the well-known bathroom cleaning product. The shampoo is runny. It lathers, but very well. Cleaning wise, it strips my hair clean to the point it felt excessively dry. The conditioner helped combat the dryness of the shampoo, but it&#x27;s not an exceptional conditioner. It does the job as conditioner, but it&#x27;s not the best conditioner out there. I typically will leave in the shampoo just a little longer than usual for a more reasonable result. Overall, I&#x27;m giving this product a one star because I don&#x27;t feel like it fully served its purpose for helping dry damage hair. I experienced dryness, fall-outs, and increase split-ends.</li>
    <li> I live in Chicagoland and winter here can easily cause troublesome static.  Not with Aubrey&#x27;s Honeysuckle Rose Moisturizing Conditioner.  This conditioner - just a little combed through and rinsed right away - makes my hair behave and leaves it feeling great all season long!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and contains no protein.. I use this as a deep conditioner after I do a aphogee 2 step protein treatment</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff. It left a weird film on my hair, my hair feels drier and the smell is kind of pungent and not in a good way. I know this stuff works well for others but my hair didn&#x27;t like it.    UPDATE: After going blonde and growing out my hair, I used this on my ends and a mixture of Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner and V05 on the rest of my hair and I actually liked how much moisture I got. It&#x27;s not amazing, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as bad as when my hair was shorter and my natural color.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really live up to the hype, for me. It was fine but didn&#x27;t really have enough &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;. It was just like any other conditioner. It smells nice though and obviously has wonderful organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite conditioner, but it seems that the formula has changed. I won&#x27;t purchase this anymore.</li>
    <li> I thought organic shampoo/conditioner would be the answer to my dry hair. This shampoo/conditioner made the texture of my hair feel like hay. So disappointed with this product, I am back to using salon quality hair products. Smells weird too</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I use it about once a week strictly for deep conditoning. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the smell though (it&#x27;s not bad, just smells like old fashion hair products from the &#x27;70&#x27;s), but after rinsing it out, and adding other products to my hair I can&#x27;t smell it anymore. I just have to deal with it for about an hour.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time looking up \\&quot;natural organic\\&quot; hair products.  I finally settled on Aubrey because of the great ingredients list.  I got the shampoo and conditioner yesterday and used them.  My hair felt like hay.  I was so disappointed.  I read the ingredients and they were so different from what is listed on the amazon site.  Water and alcohol are now the first two ingredients, Rather than aloe and a coconut cream base.  This is false advertising.  I am going to try to let amazon know.  I now checked the other reviews and see someone else noted the same thing.  Wish I had checked the reviews first.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I use it as a leave-in. It smells amazing and makes my 4c hair super soft.</li>
    <li> OK, let me set the scene with the mess that my hair was before I started my new haircare regime. I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect. It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle and was driving me crazy, nothing was working for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this conditioner (and the shampoo to match, even though I don&#x27;t shampoo often) to use regularly as a part of a moisture-only routine as I wanted to avoid using anything with protein added for my &#x27;regular&#x27; washes (as opposed to deep conditioning days). I&#x27;d read some recommendations of this product online and I liked that it&#x27;s fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the actual product and opened the bottle, it smelled pretty disgusting to me; it&#x27;s very herbal in an unpleasant way, to the point of smelling almost like chemicals, if that makes any sense. When I used the shampoo I was worried because it didn&#x27;t feel nice on my hair after, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing any good either. Nevertheless, I combed it gently through my hair and rinsed it out at the end of my shower. The smell once it was mixed a little it wasn&#x27;t quite so bad but I still wouldn&#x27;t describe it as nice, to my tastes at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I detangled my hair with a wide-toothed comb and it seemed to be easier than usual. But I didn&#x27;t notice how incredible my hair felt until I dried it off. I felt like blow-drying my hair which I don&#x27;t often do, and from the very first section I was stunned at how silky and easily manageable my hair had become again. Seriously I cannot praise this stuff enough; I have not used it long term but for it to have done my hair this much good from one simple sitting, I&#x27;m pretty amazed - especially considering how sceptical I was. This product is definitely worth a try considering it&#x27;s not that expensive, and the bottles aren&#x27;t exactly small so it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the good that it does to my hair, I can forgive the smell; it actually doesn&#x27;t smell at all unpleasant once the hair is dry and if you&#x27;ve applied other products it mixes well - you know that smell your hair gets when you&#x27;ve just been to a salon to get your hair washed, cut etc? That&#x27;s what it smells like to me after, which is nice lol. If it bothers me when I use it regularly I&#x27;ll just mix in another oil to make it smell better. The main point is, this stuff works for me and I&#x27;m really happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that before I used these two products, I had done a deep cleansing and balancing/conditioning treatment in order to fix the foundations of my hair as much as possible, so this also adds to the reasons why my hair is feeling much better than before. However I do feel that this conditioner and its shampoo really works well with my hair type and I definitely have this product to thank for how well my hair is doing on only day 2 of my routine. I can recommend it to anyone with moisture problems with their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It&#x27;s all natural and makes my hair feel great. I also sue it on my dog since he has sensitive skin.  He has real hair since he&#x27;s a Shihtzu.  Great product</li>
    <li> it is a pretty good conditioner but not the best organic I have used</li>
    <li> smells fantastic and keeps my hair nice and soft</li>
    <li> I first tried this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair when i visited my sister. I loved it so much that i had to get me some...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nourishing moisturizing conditioner. It smells so good and has tons of slip. This conditioner is second to none. I ordered this on a whim and realized that it&#x27;s one of the best choices for my African American textured hair. My hair was very bouncy and noticeably healthy looking. I am now going to order the shampoo. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This a great product and will make your hair super soft!  If you love a thick conditioner like I do you will love this!!  It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, but it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this conditioner based on all the great reviews for curly hair.  My hair is 2b and fine.  I am have used lots of natural products and did not like the overwhelming perfume smell as soon as I opened the bottle.  I was hoping the smell would go away after rinsing, but I can smell it all day.  Since I have fine hair, I need something that I can use to comb through my hair while conditioning.  This does the opposite, I feel I have to keep using more and my fingers just get stuck in my hair.  My hair is more frizzy and dry looking since using this.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much for this useless bottle.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice  conditioner but they should change the icon to the most recent product change, instead of keeping the white bottle as it can be misleading</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aubrey BPG protein conditioner for a few years and really like it, but I thought I would try this HRC based on the positive reviews it&#x27;s gotten on the Curl Talk forum, which is a site for those who don&#x27;t use silicones or sulfates on their curly or wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a wonderful rose smell that isn&#x27;t too strong or cloying at all for me (and I can be very sensitive to strong smells).  It also is extremely creamy and moisturizing, and it leaves my hair feeling super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is so thick, it takes me a bit longer to rinse out, but I love what it does for my hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing conditioner. It is heavy and not for all hair types. I think it works best for those with curly or very dry hair. It smells so good. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair looks with this shampoo - it leaves it soft and shiny. However, the scent is cloying and overwhelming. I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve been trying for ten years to find a conditioner that would help me with my crazy and troublesome hair, and now that I&#x27;ve found this I&#x27;m hooked.  The scent is also wonderful, floral without being cloying and cheesy, and it lingers faintly for a few hours.</li>
    <li> this worked well, it dried my hair out slightly when I added baking soda (changed the ph too much). by it&#x27;s self it&#x27;s great and softening without any hidden protein.</li>
    <li> I purchased this  with the shampoo and they both work great. Smells nice. Definatly will buy it again for the price.</li>
    <li> I could rant and rave and write 200 words on why this &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34; should be a staple in any 4c chick&#x27;s regimen- but I won&#x27;t because once again, they have changed the formula! This product used to be thick, creamy and silky feeling and looking. Now it is a watery, milky mess. I am so sad to have to write this review because i&#x27;ve been a dedicated customer for so many years. I can not understand why they would change the formula so much? It didn&#x27;t even react the same in my hair like it used to. My low porosity hair even felt a little dry afterwards. I&#x27;m not gonna bash too much because that isnt right. I just will have to find another product to use to replace AubreyOrganics- and it sucks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have been looking for an organic conditioner for years and this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found. It actually moisturizes (for once) and smells wonderful. Will be buying more Aubrey products in the future!</li>
    <li> This conditoner smells great, feels great and seems to work. I am african american and natural so I cowash my hair  about everyday or every other day. The conditioner is very thick and I have thick hair and i love that. I try to apply it to my scalp first then the rest of my hair but I know I can&#x27;t. I have to save some for the next wash. I just need to get like a gallon of this because I like to smoother my hair in it. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I used this as a deep conditioner. The smell is wonderful. It even lingers after your done doing your hair. It gives you soft hair but doesn&#x27;t deep condition as much as I like. It worked better for me as a deep conditioner than the JASON aloe vera conditioner that I tried before this one but not as good as ORS replenishing conditioner (which I am obsessed with but trying not to use anymore because of the dmdm hydantoin in it which is a by- product of formaldehyde). I actually realized after using this that I should really stop trying to use conditioners as deep conditioners. They just dont give the same result. Not even this one that says it can be used as a deep conditioner. I never tried it mixed with oils or anything and that might have given me slightly better results but I like my DC&#x27;s to be able to work without any help. I would use this again in a mixture or something. Maybe even as a DC base.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing conditioner! I will def buy this again! I use it as a Co wash as well and it&#x27;s great! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have heard rave reviews about this product from so many curlies and naturals. I thought for sure this would become a main component in my weekly regimen. However, I was a teeny weenie bit disappointed because it took A LOT of product to fully saturate my coarse 4b/4c strands. I typically leave my deep conditioner on for about an hour and my hair really didn&#x27;t have much reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To work with this, I mixed this product with shea butter, a cheapy condish (suave naturals), coconut oil, jojoba oil, and honey and it is wonderful. I love that it is organic and smells great. Will definitely continue to use as a base for my pumped up DC.</li>
    <li> The item was great and feels good I&#x27;m my hair too.</li>
    <li> Nice ,nice slip, nice smell leave hair soft ...</li>
    <li> i love this conditioner! its not too heavy and it leaves my hair feeling awesome. id totally recommend others to buy it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products as deep conditioners, and I always come back to this one.  It makes my hair soooooo soft and makes detangling my curly hair easy.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t understand what took me so long to purchase this product! I would say this is the best conditioner ever, but I feel its probably not a good detangler due to the protein in it. I thought at first it was goin to be a total miss when I started applying and it had absolutely no slip! Well I applied sat under hooded dryer for 10mins and washed out and let me tell YOU, this is the best deep conditioning I have ever had in my hair. My hair came out so soft! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I am an African woman with 4b hair. My curls are as tiny as the springs inside pens and my hair is very thick, coarse, and downright dense. I first went natural in 2009 and had a lot of trouble finding a conditioner that gave my sahara-dry thirsty hair the replenishing it desired until that fateful day I walked into a Vitamin Shoppe store looking for this conditoner thanks to the recommendations of many ladies on a black hair care forum I frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I spread that pearly creamy goodness into my kinks, my love affair with this conditioner began. My hair drank up that conditioner like a milkshake and my hair was SOFT! Even after it dried, my hair felt nourished and soft! Not only that but my hair is insanely prone to tangling and this conditioner melted those tangles away like butter! Honeysuckle rose has never let me down. I have been using it for four years now and it is so good, I have never felt a need to find any greener grasses because I am genuinely convinced this is the best for my hair. That, and being a product junkie is expensive. Times are tough! The conditioner being $8-10 has never bothered me because it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed this year the look and consistency of the conditioner has changed so it seems they may have changed the formula. I haven&#x27;t noticed a major change in the effects it has on my hair so I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but from what I&#x27;ve read from a couple reviews on here, Aubrey Organics is not living up to their last name as strongly.</li>
    <li> Performance far superior to many more expensive brands.  Scent is lovely and my curly hair is sans frizz and very shiny when I use it.  And at this price, I can afford to every day.</li>
    <li> I used Aubrey face products a few years ago and was very satisfied. Products were clean, wholesome.Recently my husband stocked up on their shampoo, so I ordered this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to start by saying that I do not have allergies. Ever. First thing I noticed when I started using this product was a very aggressive and, what seemed like, chemical smell. I was surprised as this is definitely not something I expected from this brand. But further more...as I started using this product I broke up in HORRIBLE hives all over my body. I am absolutely positive it was it, I checked (discontinued it for a week - hives went away; tried again - again horrible break-out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product, think it has some toxic ingredients in it and think this is absolutely unacceptable for any company/brand, especiall one that positions itself as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;organic\\&quot;. This is false advertising at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend staying away from this.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to creating my own organic shampoo and conditioner. It was a long drawn out 2 months of disaster on my hair. Finally in my efforts to use something more natural and organic still, I tried this shampoo and conditioner. I loved it! The smell was wonderful! I normally have incredibly thick, long, frizzy, naturally curly hair. I also suffer with psoriasis on my scalp which causes dandruff, because of the dryness. My hair loved this! My hair became soft and manageable. I struggled less with frizz, tangles, and the natural unruliness of my hair. Thank you Aubrey Organics for creating such a lovely natural shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Product formula changed in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have a bottle purchased in 2011 that lists first 3 ingredients as: coconut fatty acid cream base, organic aloe Vera, organic Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current (2012)  formula&#x27;s first 3 ingredients are: Aqua, cetyl alcohol, alcohol denat.</li>
    <li> Bought this conditioner to work into my co-washing routine. Smell is amazing! Fragrant but not overwhelming. The product doesnt contain harsh chemicals that can be damaging to hair (-cones, sulfates, etc). Just be aware that it is not like regular conditioners and has a different feel when lathering. I have thick, course hair so I add a little more than reccomended. No matter how tangled my hair is by the time it has worked its magic, I am detangled. Price is not bad considering how great it is for your hair &amp; environment.</li>
