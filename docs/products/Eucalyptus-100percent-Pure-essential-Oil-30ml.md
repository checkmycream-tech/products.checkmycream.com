    <li> I&#x27;m come to rely on Plantlife eucalyptus oil, not only for use in the laundry (a dozen drops along with a little liquid detergent and small handfuls of Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Powder [[ASIN:B0029XNTEU Arm &amp; Hammer Super Wash Soda, Detergent Booster 55 oz (1559 g)]] and Borax [[ASIN:B000R4LONQ TWENTY MULE TM BORAX]]) but also to apply EXTERNALLY below your nostrils to clear your sinuses, to use in aromatherapy and also to use just on a damp sponge to really freshen the way your space smells. Cheerful, pure, clean fragrance. Plantlife is superior to every other manufacturer I&#x27;ve found so far. So I&#x27;ve gone from never having heard of this stuff before to making certain that I always have a supply on hand! I would not want to be without it. Really a key find. Makes your life better.</li>

    <li> This is used in a Bissell steam mop.  The mop cleans fine, but the added Eucalyptus oil makes the entire house smell great!</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me or the wife, will not buy again...</li>
    <li> The Eucalyptus 100% Pure essential Oil works really well in draining my sinuses. I have rubbed a little on my fingertips, under my nose, or even some drops in my bathtub and I can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Use  this product in the sauna when I have sinus problems. Also put it on a tissue and breathe it in helps alot.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. I have not used this oil yet, but the plan is to add a couple of drops of the oil to a warm moist cloth to relieve a stuffed up nose.</li>

    <li> Used with oil pulling</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This is a bargain deal for Eucalyptus oil!  I use this in my daughter&#x27;s bath and humidifier when she is sick and it seems to help with her congestion.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. The scent lasts and mixes easily with a carrier for spraying or use as drops in a bath.</li>
