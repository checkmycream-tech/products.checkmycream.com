      <li>good smell like candy</li>

      <li>And I love this product!</li>
      <li>AMAZING PRODUCT</li>
      <li>, it is really nice</li>
      <li>I took a chance on this one day because I couldn&#x27;t spend the $20+ on Biolage and was THRILLED.</li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner because I liked the smell of it.</li>
      <li>This conditioner did not seem to deliver any kind of moisture</li>
      <li>My hair still frizzes more than i would like it to, but these are the best results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far.</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years, with and without the salon keratin treatments.  </li>
      <li>This being said I bought this product with the hopes that it would make my hair more manageably and reduce the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ONE CHECK FOR OK SMELL.</li>
      <li>I thought these would be better for my hair.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure this doesn&#x27;t benefit blond hair any.</li>
      <li>I like this brand of conditioner and tried many of them.  </li>
      <li>better than in all the stores</li>
      <li>Simply the best.  </li>
      <li>and it was really really lovely.</li>
      <li>hair felt okay</li>
      <li>I use the conditioner and as many have mentioned, it does not condition or moisturize.</li>
      <li>It works slightly better on my hair than it does on my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I am still searching for the perfect conditioner and this is the most recent one I tried.</li>
      <li>It is softer, much more manageable and healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love the conditioner (hence 4 stars).</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>I think of it as one more weapon in my frizz-fighting arsenal.</li>
      <li>but I love it and recommend it</li>
      <li>They smell lovely and seem to be salon quality for a better value.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it for the smell.</li>
      <li>My hair is better for it.</li>
      <li>The bottles are so pretty and the conditioner smells sooo good.</li>
      <li>I like the way this smells, but more importantly mine and my girl&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>This conditioner greatly improves the ease of straightening my hair and makes it incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh or anything and smells great like caramel.</li>
      <li>Clarifying shampoos and conditioners lift all residual product for a clean hair shaft, which is extremely healthy.</li>
      <li>best if used less than an a nickle sized amount.</li>
      <li>The product is fine as a smoothing conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and it is again silky smooth.</li>
      <li>This product does make a noticeable difference is reducing frizzies, controlling flyaways and helping the hair to appear smooth, sleek and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t straighten my hair after using the conditioner, it makes it smooth and is acceptable to use when just air drying.</li>
      <li>It does not leave a residue but does leave my hair shiny and smooth - not greasy as some conditioners do.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I use a lot more of this conditioner than I do others, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me because I can feel it absorbing into my hair rather than just sitting on top of it.</li>
      <li>If this were a curl enhancer, it&#x27;d get a 10 out of five for doing a super, super job!    </li>
      <li>Smells great and leaved long hair silky.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to switch to a more organic shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Turns out the smell is the only good thing about this conditioner.</li>
      <li>It is not a conditioner that works with my hair on a regular basis (or it looks greasy) but occasionally it is good to use.</li>
      <li>I have found that if you leave it in the hair overnight, it works a lot better, but that&#x27;s too much work for me.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really notice any difference, but will continue to use to for better experience</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair straight and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love Organix&#x27;s Brazilian Keratin Therapy line.</li>
      <li>This hair conditioner smells great, if you like a strong chocolate scent not really my favorite, as I live in a warm climate.</li>
      <li>I have always been looking for organic hair care products and thought this one, shampoo and conditioner, would be worthy.</li>
      <li>blow dried and ironed and my hair is lovely shiny, smooth, no frizz, no frazzled ends, but it has a nice body.</li>
      <li>first time I ever returned a hair conditioner!  </li>
      <li>one use of this and the shampoo and my hair is smooth, silky straight, no frizz, plenty of body.</li>
      <li>I have the most sensitive scalp and temperamental hair in the world...</li>
      <li>smells great, very rich so only use a little</li>
      <li>I ended up giving it to my mom who uses cheap stuff normally like Suave.</li>
      <li>I have very fine strands and low density.</li>
      <li>not pin straight flat, but nice.</li>
      <li>The only thing I trust to make sure my hair is trapping in moisture.</li>
      <li>IF YOUR ARE LOOKING FOR A SMOOTH AND SOFT HAIR</li>
      <li>I love it but not as ilove its deep conditioner</li>
      <li>Being that this is the final step in the process I thought that this product could have been a lot better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to manage, so this product sounded like it would be perfect for me.</li>
      <li>This is great conditioner if you have thick hair or medium density with lots of tangles.</li>
      <li>It made it more coarse and tangly (</li>
      <li>the reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is not fabulous, it is just good.  </li>
      <li>If I could get my hair like that, I&#x27;d wear it natural more, and I plan to this summer when I usually go natural because it&#x27;s too hot and humid to bother with straightening.</li>
      <li>i love keratin treatments but not the damage or flat hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not naturally curly more like wavy with lots of frizz.</li>
      <li>I use another conditioner pretty much all the time, but once in awhile I switch off for variety.</li>
      <li>exactly the opposite of the silky, smooth results I desired).</li>
      <li>I had very high hopes when I purchased this product</li>
      <li>Not only does this smell amazing, I can actually run my fingers through my hair at the end of the day, which I could NEVER do before.</li>

    <li> This hair conditioner smells great, if you like a strong chocolate scent not really my favorite, as I live in a warm climate. It doesn&#x27;t seem to detangle or leave my hair smooth like other conditioners.I have found that if you leave it in the hair overnight, it works a lot better, but that&#x27;s too much work for me. I ended up giving it to my mom who uses cheap stuff normally like Suave.I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it for the smell.</li>
    <li> Agree my hair started to fall out too. I gave it a chance, used it for a month, and was afraid to use it again after more and more of my hair fell out. I want to use the Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray but am afraid it will also have adverse effects. I really wanted it to work, haven&#x27;t used a BKT and don&#x27;t think I ever will now. Still on a mission to get rid of my frizzy, unruly coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner with a great smell. It&#x27;s hard sometimes to remember to put this on early in a shower because you have to let it set for a while but my hair looks and feels great after use.</li>
    <li> Greatest hair conditioner ever.  I switched to something else for a bit and couldnt figure out why my hair felt like straw.  Switched back to this and it is again silky smooth.</li>
    <li> My hair was fantastically curly because of this conditioner. I mean round, bouncy curls and it was really really lovely. If I could get my hair like that, I&#x27;d wear it natural more, and I plan to this summer when I usually go natural because it&#x27;s too hot and humid to bother with straightening. If this were a curl enhancer, it&#x27;d get a 10 out of five for doing a super, super job!    Unfortunately, when I bought this, it was because I was looking for a smoothing conditioner comparable to Garnier but with the awesome smell of coconut.    I feel I have no choice but to give it a 1 simply because it is misleading to buyers. Yes, I would give it a 10 out of 5 stars (200%) if it were for curly hair, but this is about straight hair.    Yes, I will re purchase - but only when I want curly hair. Just like someone wrote below, this seemed to clarify my hair. Clarifying shampoos and conditioners lift all residual product for a clean hair shaft, which is extremely healthy. If this were advertised as a curl enhancer or clarifier, the ratings and ravings would be through the roof.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but best if used less than an a nickle sized amount. This bottle will last a LONG time. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> smells awesome! I have in between straight to wavy thick hair. Haven&#x27;t really notice any difference, but will continue to use to for better experience</li>
    <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner.  The shampoo was fine but the conditioner was awful!  I thought the product was defective because it was like water with little pieces of white cream in it.  My hair felt awful afterwards...stawlike and dry, even hard to get a comb through it!  I am returning this product today... first time I ever returned a hair conditioner!  Couldn&#x27;t give no stars, but if  had the option this is the product that deserves it.</li>
    <li> i love keratin treatments but not the damage or flat hair. one use of this and the shampoo and my hair is smooth, silky straight, no frizz, plenty of body. the original keratin salon treatment is long gone. i have to fill my very porous hair by coloring it. with that and the flat ironing, my ends were beyond dry and split. they were completely unmanageable. i read the reviews, washed and used conditioner and left a little on the ends without rinsing. blow dried and ironed and my hair is lovely shiny, smooth, no frizz, no frazzled ends, but it has a nice body. was fast to dry and style, just like after the keratin treatment. not pin straight flat, but nice. actually the way i want it: mostly straight and not flat,no friz and lotsa shine. will buy their other styling products. :)  btw, after the salon keratin treatment, my hair has not grown in two years: lots of breakage so was not worth it for me to ever repeat as i want to grow out my hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair that looks great until I step out into the humidity. This conditioner greatly improves the ease of straightening my hair and makes it incredibly soft. If I don&#x27;t straighten my hair after using the conditioner, it makes it smooth and is acceptable to use when just air drying. I feel like I use a lot more of this conditioner than I do others, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me because I can feel it absorbing into my hair rather than just sitting on top of it. This is not some miracle humidity buster, though. My hair still frizzes more than i would like it to, but these are the best results I&#x27;ve gotten thus far. On another note, I would buy this product at Walgreens or Target, because it&#x27;s about the same price and you don&#x27;t have to worry about shipping. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time, and was disappointed. It may smell decent, but this is the worst conditioner I have ever used. And I&#x27;m not even that picky! It leaves my hair feeling like plastic and straw at the same time. If I wasn&#x27;t so broke at the moment, Id buy the shampoo/conditioner I know works well, (not Organix) but until then I dread having to use this each time I shower.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this conditioner would be making people&#x27;s hair fall out.... I have the most sensitive scalp and temperamental hair in the world... my hairstylist even says I have the most tangly hair in the world, which she handles with extra extra care. The only other conditioner that has left my hair with the fewest tangles has been&lt;br /&gt;Biolage. Everything else either makes my scalp break out or I can&#x27;t get anything through my hair to detangle. I took a chance on this one day because I couldn&#x27;t spend the $20+ on Biolage and was THRILLED. Not only does this smell amazing, I can actually run my fingers through my hair at the end of the day, which I could NEVER do before. My hair is soft, shiny, and manageable. If your hair falls out, you&#x27;re probably allergic to something in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular Redken user. I love the stuff, but as a college student it can be very expensive to pay for high-end salon products. I thought I would give Organix Ever Straight conditioner a try because it was considerably cheaper than what I normally use. I have thick, naturally wavy hair. It&#x27;s difficult to manage, so this product sounded like it would be perfect for me. I was wrong. I was instantly turned off by the smell--it smells like tanning oil. It&#x27;s also rough in appearance. Instead of being creamy and consistent, it&#x27;s rough and a medium brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt okay after it dried....for a little while. Shortly after drying and straightening it (with a ceramic salon-quality straightener, I might add) it felt thick, coarse, rough and wirey. It felt frizzy and looked dull. I gave it another try just in case I was having a bad hair day, and I got the same result (although it looks even worse today.) The smell paired with the texture/look of my hair made this product a WASTE OF MONEY. I am switching back to my regular products even though they are more expensive. You truly do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants a recommendation for a better product, Redken Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner are FANTASTIC for thick and difficult-to-manage hair. I put a little DermOrganic Argon Oil Leave-in Treatment before drying and then after styling, and it makes my hair feel like silk. It maintains its softness and style all day even when windy, when you sweat or when you sleep on it.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Works well. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner and it was the worst I have ever tried. It does not make your soft at all, had problems getting a comb thru my hair. My daughter tried and she hated it also. It does nothing for your hair.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE SHAMPOO YOU CAN&#x27;T TELL IF IT IS IN YOUR HAIR, NO DE-TANGLING OR SMOOTHNESS.  HARD TO COMB HAIR AFTER USE.  ONE CHECK FOR OK SMELL.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so great! It keeps my hair straight and healthy looking. It&#x27;s not harsh or anything and smells great like caramel. I recommend you buy this great product</li>
    <li> It is a good one and good price.. the reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is not fabulous, it is just good.  I tried different kinds of these Keratin products.. this one is not the best ever but it is good, it is  the best you can get with this price. I also like its coconut scent, it is really nice</li>
    <li> I use the Shampoo, which does soften my hair. I use the conditioner and as many have mentioned, it does not condition or moisturize. I wonder if I used another conditioner, if it would improve, not do anything or worsen the effects of the shampoo and the serum after it. It works slightly better on my hair than it does on my daughter&#x27;s. who has really thick curly hair that forms dreadlocks!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is absoultely terrible. I would think that keratin products would be more effective than any others because keratin is so well known for the positive things that it can do to hair, this was awful though. After using it my hair was not smooth at all-- i had to use an excessive amount of leave in conditioner after the shower to be able to start brushing through the knots. I ripped out so much hair on my brush after using this and my head was in pain from all the torn hair. After using it I even went back to the bottle to doublee check that I used it properly and that this was, in fact, a conditioner... I don&#x27;t understand house they can even call this a conditioner because it made my hair worse than not using it at all. Another down side is the brown color-- I am no expert but I&#x27;m sure this doesn&#x27;t benefit blond hair any.</li>
    <li> I have always been looking for organic hair care products and thought this one, shampoo and conditioner, would be worthy. Since the first time I used, it left my hair with a rough touch and a strange texture that I thought would go away by applying the conditioner. The latter did the same to my hair. More than that is the fact that my hair started to fall out crazily. I never had this problem before. I just used this shampoo and conditioner twice and my hair is shedding all over. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone at all. It&#x27;s a complete rip off.</li>
    <li> Works great for my frizzy hair. I also use the keratin shampoo. I would recommend this product for gray hair. Soft and gentle. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a review for Keratin by Organix. I have very curly, dry, tangly hair and lots of it. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product for a long time. I use the shampoo and the conditioner and the breakage serum, then I blow dry it and straighten it and my hair feels wonderful. It is soft, shiny and I can run my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand when people say this product dries out your hair, not in my case. It seems to give it a boost in oil that I really needed. If you have oily hair, this may not work for you.</li>
    <li> Softens my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling heavy or greasy</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s like this: I use another conditioner pretty much all the time, but once in awhile I switch off for variety. Thought I&#x27;d try something I&#x27;d never used before, and bought this cute little fat brown bottle. It smelled coconut-y and was 6 bucks, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it the next day. Not only is it thick and gruel-like coming out of the bottle, but the weird, unpleasant thing is that the coconut smell (which was pleasing enough when I took one whiff of it in the store) became sickeningly overpowering. I know this will sound bizarre, and believe me, it FELT bizarre, but after I thoroughly rinsed this crap out of my hair and got out of the shower, the coconut smell was putridly strong. As my eyes began to burn and water from this cloud of sickening sweetness, it felt as though I had dropped into some sort of Coconut Hell and was attempting to claw myself out while being chased by coconut meat demons who were taunting me as they cracked open, wait for it, YES, MORE COCONUTS and hurled them at me in my attempted escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I came here to Amazon to look up this nasty swill, thinking \\&quot;Someone else HAS to have mentioned this.\\&quot; But no. Instead I got to read little interesting tidbits about how people&#x27;s hair fell completely OUT after using this brown nether-paste for a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even had I not read reviews telling me of my possible future baldness, I could not stomach the smell any longer and went back to the shower and re-washed my hair with the smelliest normal shampoo I had, then used some kind of Suave conditioner I had on hand, and then blew my hair dry and STILL the coconut hellfire raged. Not quite as bad as before, but what in the name of all things holy have these people put into this??? It&#x27;s like nuclear waste in a bottle. I&#x27;m taking it back AND calling the company to tell them they should sell this to third world governments as biochemical weaponry.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so soft! and it smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Simply the best.  The only thing I trust to make sure my hair is trapping in moisture.</li>
    <li> smells great, very rich so only use a little</li>
    <li> It is not a conditioner that works with my hair on a regular basis (or it looks greasy) but occasionally it is good to use.</li>
    <li> The product is fine as a smoothing conditioner.  I like it.  I started using it only because OGX quit making the keratin masque (which is practically the same thing only in paste form).  My beef is with the packaging.  It is in the exact same container shape and color as the shampoo bottle.  I had to quit buying the shampoo because I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in the shower without my glasses.  Second, the marketing person who decided a put really thick conditioner (it doesn&#x27;t pour) into a large-bottomed container with a very small hole in the top obviously knew that the last half would be difficult to get out.  (The wide lid in the photo flips up and underneath is a very small hole.)  You can never get out all of the product.</li>
    <li> Being that this is the final step in the process I thought that this product could have been a lot better. I used the 30 day which was awesome and I use the shampoo everyday and follow up with this. The only thing is, I have long hair that has highlights and this product does not de-tangle and you have to use a ton of it to even condition. It does help your hair stay straight, but at I wish it was more of a de-tangler and added moisture to my hair like other conditioners.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated, waist-length hair, and I have to shampoo it every day because I work out and sweat a lot. I also live in the South, and it&#x27;s humid. So I have a frizz problem. I am still searching for the perfect conditioner and this is the most recent one I tried. I&#x27;m liking it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells wonderful (like coconut). I wish it didn&#x27;t have artificial dyes in it, but they haven&#x27;t been irritating my skin. The smell doesn&#x27;t stick around for too long (it&#x27;s been an hour since I used this and the shampoo from the same line and the smell is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that keratin can only come from animal sources so this is not a vegan product. (This review is for the Brazilian Keratin Therapy variety.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that this is helping to keep my hair straight. It&#x27;s not going to take the place of a flat iron, of course. I think of it as one more weapon in my frizz-fighting arsenal. It rinses out without leaving residue and my hair is particularly soft since I started using this. I even got a compliment on the condition of my hair when I went to the salon yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if I had one complaint, it would be that, for some reason, I am having trouble squeezing the conditioner out of the bottle. I don&#x27;t have this problem with the shampoo, which is in the same type of bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner every time I wash my hair.  It does not leave a residue but does leave my hair shiny and smooth - not greasy as some conditioners do.  I already have my hair straighten every 4 months so I don&#x27;t know how it helps with straightening your hair but I love it and recommend it</li>
    <li> They need to go back into the labs and add something more hydrating to this conditoner, it&#x27;s completely lacking in moisture and leaves your hair frizzy and feeling like straw. Stay away from this product, especially if you have very curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair is better for it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love Organix&#x27;s Brazilian Keratin Therapy line. The bottles are so pretty and the conditioner smells sooo good. Plus, it&#x27;s cheap! However, IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! It only made my hair worse! It did nothing to condition my hair, it just coated it and made it feel heavy and waxy. It made it more coarse and tangly (exactly the opposite of the silky, smooth results I desired). I had to do a deep clarifying treatment to get my hair to feel normal again. It seriously just messed up the texture of my hair and i&#x27;m bummed I wasted my money on it.</li>
    <li> I love it but not as ilove its deep conditioner</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner and helps keep my curly hair from frizzing up.  I have used it for many years, with and without the salon keratin treatments.  The Amazon price is very good....better than in all the stores I where I usually shop for it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to switch to a more organic shampoo and conditioner.  I thought these would be better for my hair.  This is not the case for the Organix brand of these products.  The shampoo did not lather and the conditioner did nothing for my hair.  My hair was left dry, brittle, dull, tangled, and difficult to manage.  This has to be the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried.  Do not buy these products!</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner smells good too</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes when I purchased this product and I have to say it as left me disappointed. I would describe my hair as long and thick it&#x27;s not naturally curly more like wavy with lots of frizz. I have the hair type that stays bone straight when I use a flat iron, no type of humidity can cause my hair to frizz. This being said I bought this product with the hopes that it would make my hair more manageably and reduce the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is very thick and rich almost like paste, it was kind of difficult to squeeze it out of the bottle. After I rinsed the conditioner out I noticed my hair was a lot more tangled than usual. Once dried my hair felt course and my ends looked fried and kinky. My ends where so bad that no matter how any times I went over it with the flat iron it stayed the same. This conditioner did not seem to deliver any kind of moisture what so ever it actually made my hair look more dry and damaged. I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and dry. After doing a hair treatment, I needed to buy a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Love the conditioner (hence 4 stars). The scent is very good! I would have given 5 stars but my only gripe is about the bottle it is in. It&#x27;s very difficult to squeeze the content out. I wished the conditioner had a pumped option (I have the shampoo with a pump and it&#x27;s much easier to dispense).</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I liked the smell of it. Turns out the smell is the only good thing about this conditioner. I have long, thin, slightly wavy hair. This conditioner did absolutely nothing that a conditioner is supposed to - my hair became super tangled and unmanageable, dry, flat, and frizzy. This product gives my hair such a strange texture - it feels like plastic. My hair feels thinner than it did before I used this product - I hope I didn&#x27;t actually lose any hair and its just the weird plastic/straw-like texture that makes it seem thinner, but either way my already thin hair is so flat and lifeless. I gave this product maybe a week to a week and a half and now I&#x27;m throwing it out. I can&#x27;t put my hair through this abuse anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 49 year old redhead.  For the past two years, my hair has looked way older than the rest of me, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products that promise to help but don&#x27;t.  This product does make a noticeable difference is reducing frizzies, controlling flyaways and helping the hair to appear smooth, sleek and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, but so far I think it is delivering on the promises.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of coconut scents except occasionally in the summertime,(which is why I only gave it 4 stars), but I can live with the scent as long as the results continue.</li>
    <li> I have very fine strands and low density. My texture is probably a 4a. Using this conditioner has made my strands noticeably thicker (even my stylist noticed), slightly more &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; (kinky) but in a good way! It is softer, much more manageable and healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews,  but I was shocked to see all the negative reviews! just goes to show that everyone&#x27;s hair has different needs.</li>
    <li> I have long thick frizzy/curly/wavy hair and have tried tons of products over the years with only keratin express blowout really making a difference. And I love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaved long hair silky.</li>
    <li> So love the smell and the volume it gave especially a little curl it provides for my hair ends.</li>
    <li> Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy: This conditioner should come with a warning! Back in the end of December, I started using this on a nightly basis. After a few months of using this conditioner, I noticed that my hair was noticeably thinner and that so much hair would falling out in the shower. My hairbands used to snap because of how thick my hair was. At first, I thought I was just being paranoid and crazy, until my shower drain was so clogged to the point where it would take hours to drain. (Take note, I had cleaned my drain back at the end of December). In February, when I cleaned out my shower drain, I removed about 1/4 of the hair that was on my head. Yes, this conditioner made my hair shinier, but it was not worth losing 1/4 of my hair thickness! I&#x27;ve never had an issue of clogging my shower drain in just 2 months of cleaning it. It&#x27;s been over 3 months since I&#x27;ve stopped using this conditioner, and thanks to 5000 mcg of biotin, my hair thickness and strength has improved.</li>
    <li> I live in Denver, CO where its pretty dry, so for us black women finding &amp; trying new moisturizers is a constant thing! I like the way this smells, but more importantly mine and my girl&#x27;s hair both show the difference. We do rotate products frequently (I find it helps make our hair to not get &amp;#34;used&#x27; to a product), this conditioner will stay in rotation. I honestly haven&#x27;t tried any of the shampoos or other products, but this conditioner definitely earned its 3 stars from me.</li>
    <li> good smell like candy</li>
    <li> I like this brand of conditioner and tried many of them.  They smell lovely and seem to be salon quality for a better value.  I have colored hair and none of them seem to affect my color and they help leave it hydrated and soft.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is great conditioner if you have thick hair or medium density with lots of tangles. I am able to blow dry my hair without the need for extra products in order to keep my hair from being fly-away.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT IF YOUR ARE LOOKING FOR A SMOOTH AND SOFT HAIR</li>
