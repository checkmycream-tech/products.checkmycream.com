      <li>Jour D&#x27;hermes is great for spring and summer.</li>

      <li>Its the kind of scent that either meshes perfectly with your body chemistry or just won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>This smells good..</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
      <li>But I love this perfume!</li>
      <li>I am in love with it!</li>
      <li>Really nice.</li>
      <li>Terrific deal on a wonderful fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love this eau de parfum.</li>
      <li>I wear it the better it gets during the day.</li>
      <li>I simply love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>More words are required in this so here they are and stuff..</li>
      <li>We both love Hermes fragrances.</li>
      <li>They are always balances and never over the top.</li>
      <li>At these prices, you have to be sure it&#x27;s the ONE.  </li>
      <li>Personally I love it.</li>
      <li>For the size of the bottle, the price is very much accurate.</li>
      <li>This is another unique fragrance by Hermes.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite new fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Its the first time she buys this product; she used to buy obsession before</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;ve never tried it go for a sample in a department store to see if you like it first.</li>
      <li>Very rich, not too too powerful, unlike other Hermes fragrances.  </li>
      <li>and I think it is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>That would have been very helpful to know.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>We really like this</li>
      <li>I managed to kill some time in a duty free shop in Heathrow last time</li>
      <li>I have smelled many perfumes, and I have never smelled anything like this~ I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad.    </li>
      <li>I love it and it seems to last a long time on my skin.</li>
      <li>However if you are prime don&#x27;t expect this in the normal 2 day range, it takes quite a lot longer because of how they have to ship perfume.</li>
      <li>Tester from Sephora smelled better than actual perfume in the bitter</li>
      <li>FINALLY, I would recommend that you get the sample, and try it for yourself a few days before buying the full size bottle, in order to decide if this is for you.</li>
      <li>When it is initially sprayed it is strong but will eventually fade, leaving a delicate aroma.</li>

    <li> Wonderful perfume! Smells so awesome! Very rich, not too too powerful, unlike other Hermes fragrances.  Got it for my mom-in-low! And she loves it!  Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> this perfume does  not worth the money and I think it is not the real thing.</li>
    <li> I managed to kill some time in a duty free shop in Heathrow last time I was there and came across this scent. I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;ve never tried it go for a sample in a department store to see if you like it first. Its the kind of scent that either meshes perfectly with your body chemistry or just won&#x27;t. Personally I love it. It lasts and it seems the longer I wear it the better it gets during the day. Really nice. I&#x27;m going to have to try other Hermes Scents. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Tester from Sephora smelled better than actual perfume in the bitter</li>
    <li> This beautiful fragrance has noticeable floral scent with underlying hints of citrus. When it is initially sprayed it is strong but will eventually fade, leaving a delicate aroma. This parfume will give a lasting impression to whomever takes the slightest whif.</li>
    <li> I love this eau de parfum.</li>
    <li> We really like this and it&#x27;s a good deal.  More words are required in this so here they are and stuff..</li>
    <li> Big hit with the wife.  We both love Hermes fragrances. They are always balances and never over the top. Jour D&#x27;Hermes met and exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> My wife is very much happy about it. For the size of the bottle, the price is very much accurate. Great purchase. Its the first time she buys this product; she used to buy obsession before and she prefers Hermes.</li>
    <li> I simply love the fragrance. It was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite new fragrance.  I tried samples twice before I bought it.  At these prices, you have to be sure it&#x27;s the ONE.  This is the best price I found.</li>
    <li> I bought this bases on the reviews and it was very light and boring to me. It smells a little of sunscreen to me.</li>
    <li> This is another unique fragrance by Hermes.I already have &amp;#34;L&#x27;Ambre des Merveilles &amp;#34; which is another divine scent.Jour D&#x27;hermes is great for spring and summer.It is a floral,clean yet warm fragrance with grapefruit,lemon,white flowers and gardenia as base notes.Once you start  smelling it ,you can not get enough of it! The only drawback might be the price,yet ,let me tell you that it is over 149 $ in department stores! So this is a great price to pay for this great perfume! I am in love with it!</li>
    <li> The perfume itself, I can&#x27;t get enough of. I love it and it seems to last a long time on my skin. However if you are prime don&#x27;t expect this in the normal 2 day range, it takes quite a lot longer because of how they have to ship perfume. That would have been very helpful to know. But I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> This smells good.. Smells like a flower with a citric scent similar to a lemon.    I have smelled many perfumes, and I have never smelled anything like this~ I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad.    I do have to admit that it gives me a headache :,( which is why I had to give it a 3. After a while it does settle in a little bit.    FINALLY, I would recommend that you get the sample, and try it for yourself a few days before buying the full size bottle, in order to decide if this is for you.</li>
    <li> Terrific deal on a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend and she loves it.</li>
