      <li>I think they&#x27;re super cute!</li>
      <li>Plus its always nice when friends come over and run to see what new things you have because they apparently cant find a great deal and great product combo.</li>
      <li>They can in a great variety of assorted colors, which i love because i like to change out with different outfits.</li>
      <li>The balls screw on tight and everything fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>People complain they are cheaply made but they&#x27;re plastic</li>
      <li>Definitely better than what I was expecting and worth the buy</li>
      <li>Overall great product you get your moneys worth</li>
      <li>It may be a good deal, but I only got 15</li>
      <li>They looked cool in the picture</li>
      <li>Got it 6days before estimated time not bad but still had to wait 14days to receive them.</li>
      <li>20 pcs came all colors as shown none the same kind of a tight fitting nice and stylish</li>
      <li>I love them but the bar is a bit to short a little taller would be perfect</li>
      <li>Accurate and fast delivery</li>
      <li>So, no bad review here, all positive.</li>
      <li>I got 3 lip rings the exact same, 2 more that were the exact same, &amp; 2 more that were the exact thing..</li>
      <li>I decided to get metal ones at hot topic.</li>
      <li>be buying more in the future!</li>
      <li>My lips are fuller, so it&#x27;s pretty snug.</li>
      <li>I love the different colors and designs that&#x27;s on each one of the lip rings.</li>
      <li>the colors are very unique especially the rainbow one.</li>
      <li>Who wants a bright green lip ring when your rocking baby blue..just doesn&#x27;t work that way.</li>
      <li>alot of times with the plastic ball and steel post the ball with break or strip them out with to much removal and replace.</li>
      <li>, I am very upset with this buy.</li>
      <li>I wouldve gave 5 stars but they gave me three clear balls and only one of the three is somewhat cute</li>
      <li>They are very small but the price for them is very worth it. !!</li>
      <li>too small to even fit my lip!</li>
      <li>but i expected my moneys worth</li>
      <li>i also have full thick lips</li>
      <li>Very pretty but hard to get the ball to twist on.</li>
      <li>They are all different except I got two cross bones and two clear with a thin blue line to give them the effect of being light blue</li>

    <li> Very small, and the purchase came damaged and i was missing pieces. Never again.</li>
    <li> Horrible &amp;&amp; Never Buy Again</li>
    <li> Bought these I love em the colors are very unique especially the rainbow one. They are very small but the price for them is very worth it. !! Satisfied Customer Again. (:</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive all of the pieces and there were a lot of identicals.</li>
    <li> I got 3 lip rings the exact same, 2 more that were the exact same, &amp; 2 more that were the exact thing.. Also got a eyebrow bar... It may be a good deal, but I only got 15, I am very upset with this buy.</li>
    <li> I love these.. they are beautiful and stand out.. The only down fall is that its hard to put the balls on the tips.</li>
    <li> nice set but the balls break easy</li>
    <li> The lip ring balls broke two days later. I had to go replace them everyday. I decided to get metal ones at hot topic. They are so totally not worth it and a waste of money....</li>
    <li> Think i got this within a week of ordering. Its been awhile and I am just getting to the review. It came in a usual padded envelope with a little Ziploc sealed with contents of the rings. They can in a great variety of assorted colors, which i love because i like to change out with different outfits. Who wants a bright green lip ring when your rocking baby blue..just doesn&#x27;t work that way. :) Plus its always nice when friends come over and run to see what new things you have because they apparently cant find a great deal and great product combo. LOVE IT!! They always end up snagging a few for themselves too. Anyways, the quality and quantity i was/am very happy with.  I have not had any of these come loose and end up losing them. alot of times with the plastic ball and steel post the ball with break or strip them out with to much removal and replace. So, no bad review here, all positive.</li>
    <li> I love the different colors and designs that&#x27;s on each one of the lip rings. Definitely better than what I was expecting and worth the buy (: I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. The balls screw on tight and everything fits perfectly. It also arrived quicker than the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Um well theses suck. Idk who would like them. They looked cool in the picture but they suck they are ugly and I wouldnt wear them and plus they are the type that are cheep and fall out. Wast big wast of money. They are junk. And they belong in a junk yard.</li>
    <li> 20 pcs came all colors as shown none the same kind of a tight fitting nice and stylish</li>
    <li> I like them I think they&#x27;re super cute! I like that they&#x27;re small. I got all 20. They are all different except I got two cross bones and two clear with a thin blue line to give them the effect of being light blue but I&#x27;m not upset about that. People complain they are cheaply made but they&#x27;re plastic so I don&#x27;t know what they were expecting. I&#x27;m very happy!!</li>
    <li> They came a little ahead of the projected date, all 20 were in there.The balls on the rings are very small, and the bars are all really short as well. My lips are fuller, so it&#x27;s pretty snug. Good for it&#x27;s price though.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but hard to get the ball to twist on. I had to try several times before it stayed on. The bar is kinda short.</li>
    <li> Got it 6days before estimated time not bad but still had to wait 14days to receive them. Idk why everyone is saying bad things about this product i LOVE them i had 20diff design&#x27;s and they fit perfect i also have full thick lips so when i read the reviews not gonna lie i was expecting the worse. The only bad thing i can probably say about this item its that the ball broke the same day i had it but then again i bote down on mine i play with my ring so that might of been the reason who knows. Overall great product you get your moneys worth they are the same ones as walmart so think about it do you rather pay 12 for 1 or less then $5 for 20?</li>
    <li> The bars are way to short i didnt get all 20 bars and my lip started to bleed the next morning it cut off my blood flow to my lip what ever you do don&#x27;t buy tese they are a wast of your money</li>
    <li> These tiny but, that&#x27;s what I like if your Elbert is gaged these probably won&#x27;t work for you but, for me the are great!</li>
    <li> For the price it was good because in a store the go for like 10 to 20 each. The only thing bad was they are really small.Well smaller then i thought they would be</li>
    <li> I love them but the bar is a bit to short a little taller would be perfect but I love them</li>
    <li> I wouldve gave 5 stars but they gave me three clear balls and only one of the three is somewhat cute</li>
    <li> They are OK not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> The Bar&#x27;s Were Too Small, Or Maybe I Shoudlve Ordered Some Kind Of You Know, Different Type Or Something, Hm</li>
    <li> Sends you at least 3 of the ssme design 5 times and its suppose to come with 20 and i only received 17 not major but i expected my moneys worth</li>
    <li> The Didn&#x27;t Say What Size They Were So The Bar Was To Small For My Lip</li>
    <li> It was good except there was two ball and cone missing I got the inner part but the part that screw&#x27;s on wasn&#x27;t there</li>
    <li> too small to even fit my lip!</li>
    <li> Accurate and fast delivery</li>
