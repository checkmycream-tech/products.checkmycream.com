<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are great. Good quality</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. Good quality..for a great price.</li>
    <li> I expected the bows to come in on a Wednesday and came much sooner than that. The bows are smaller than what I had expected but they still look so adorable on my 21 month old daughter. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Beautiful bows. Perfect size,  and i love how it&#x27;s all the colors ! PERFECT for every occasion ♡</li>
    <li> Bows keep falling off clip even after hot glueing it. They are smaller then they seem</li>
    <li> I love the bows.. Perfect for my babygirl!</li>
    <li> The bows got here and some are very pretty where others have frayed edges or are burnt too much. Kind of disappointed she can only use ten or so.</li>
    <li> I love how it has a variety of colors! My little girl can wear any outfit and a have a matching bow for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the description it says the clip has some teeth, but mine didn&#x27;t have it. There were some traces of glue gun thread on some bows, but it was not a big issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended to everyone who has a darling girl.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product! Super happy with the size.  Not too big for every day wear.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put two of the bows in my daughters hair the bow part fell off the metal clip. But for the price less than a dollar a bow and they are bigger than 3&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors, but the bows come apart very easily!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter LOVED this collection of bows.  Lots of colors that are hard, or impossible, to find. Great value and well made.</li>
    <li> They are very nice but way smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Tiny and poorly made in China</li>
    <li> They are cute bows, but absolutely not 3 inches in length. I measured, and they are 2 inches. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but the description should be more accurate. They did come in a big bag all smushed together like some other people said, but they weren&#x27;t permanently smashed. I just had to fluff them up a bit. Overall, I&#x27;d say they were worth it.</li>
    <li> They are great! Just very small for my daughters big hair. I thought they would be a lot bigger than what they are.</li>
    <li> Very good price and so far, they are holding up well. I just don&#x27;t really love the style- its not as cute in person and looks a little cheap. I wish I had spent more money on fewer bows and gotten a nicer style.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter. They&#x27;re very colorful, they hold hair firmly and look nice on the hair. They come from Singapore, so have to wait a while, couple of weeks as far as I remember, but they&#x27;re very cheap but I think worth to wait and have as a nice addition to your lovely one hair :)</li>
    <li> The clips aren&#x27;t actually glued to the bows. They easily slide out of the bow loop. I&#x27;ve hot glued them altogether, but it sure would be nice for the clips to be more permanently and securely attached to the bows.</li>
    <li> They are nice for the price. They are not glued to the clip it just slips in. Its not poorly made but you get what you paid for. I fairly happy and no repeats in colors in my bag</li>
    <li> They are gorgeous but they tare easily....</li>
    <li> Some alligator clip came off</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the hair bows. They are too flat for my liking. The colors are pretty but too flat.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 2 yo daughter. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase! Would definitely recommend them as they are great quality for a very low price.</li>
    <li> Excellent items!!! ♡ lovely bows, my daughter swear them every day With every outfit and I&#x27;ll be gettin bigger ones.</li>
    <li> Cute and simple ...love the variety of colors</li>
    <li> I have an obsession with bows! Any color any shape and any size. And now i have over 40 bows and thats a big thanks to the one and only &amp;#34;Boutique Hair Bows etc.... Now I have so many bows and they all have a different meaning. Like.... the beach bow, airplane bow, BFF bow, movies bow, spring bow, bored bow, hot air ballon bow, before I go in the pool bow, before I go to bed bow, strange bow, family bow, One Direction bow, hanging out bow, hanging out WITH MY FRIENDS bow, and a lot more but the bow I am wearing right now is my about to go to the mall bow. So in the end i love bows and that will be forever so everyone say a special thanks to bows.Good night. Thank you for your time now I must go change my bow to almost at the mall bow. BYE!</li>
    <li> I bought two of the same set of these bows just so I could do pig tails in my daughters hair, and OMG!! They look so cute!!! I keep telling all my friends, and the other parents at daycare about what a great deal I got on all of them!!! Usually hair bows for kids are between $2.99- $12.99 each and I got 40 plus shipping for less than $30.00, so doing the math it came out to be, $1.33 each, can&#x27;t beat that! I could not believe the deal I got. They bows are the perfect size for her, I have received so many compliments about how cute the bows look on her. I specially love that my daughter, who is 2, comes up to me now and point at her bow board and tells me me, &amp;#34;mama, bow, bow mama!&amp;#34; she loves sitting there letting me do her hair. Thank you so much for the wonderful bows, they have been used everyday, the only thing I wish there was a Yellow bows :( but other than that I would buy them over again!!!</li>
    <li> They are very small I will not lie, but rather than that these bows are perfect for me I love them</li>
    <li> So cute must have collection. Best price on the web. Happy mom here and my little one is decked out. Size is ideal for toddler!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Wish the clip was covered with ribbon because it snagged my kids hair, I did it myself in the end.</li>
    <li> Nice size for my crochet needs.  Only wish they were paired up ie  two red, two yellow etc.  I like putting on booties ets.  Other than that I will find things to do with them.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the way the bow was put together. The material slides off of the clip. It&#x27;s not glued all the way. I would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have busted our a ruler instead of comparing to other bows my daughter has, but it&#x27;s ok. The bows are smaller than I wanted, but they match the 20 headbands I bought to go with them so they&#x27;ll do for every day use :)</li>
    <li> For the price, these bows are great :)</li>
    <li> I wear these to work because as a waitress, I have to have my very long hair up in a bun and since I hate the way it looks up, a bow makes it cuter and adds some individuality. These are the perfect size, a great price, and I get a lot of compliments. Love em!</li>
    <li> These are smooth, not teeth&#x27;d. A customs image shows it with teeth. The seller answered a question stating they&#x27;re with teeth, but these are 100 smooth. They&#x27;re not totally useless, but I like/need the added grip.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for the seller not knowing the difference. Something my 3 year old can identify... None the less, the price was good and I like the variety of colors!</li>
    <li> Color assortment of bows is great. Some of the bows are a little crooked, but for the price $8.99 for 20, I can not really complain. They stay in my daughter&#x27;s silky hair fine.</li>
    <li> So much fun! She loved them!!</li>
    <li> These are the ONLY hairbows that I have found ANYWHERE that stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair!!!  I HIGHLY recommend these!  I&#x27;m ordering more a year and a half later b/c they are so awesome!</li>
    <li> These clips were a little different than I had thought I was ordering and I contacted the seller about it. The seller insisted on sending me new ones at no extra charge. All of the colors are beautiful- at least 4 or 5 of them are shades of pink- exactly what we needed. Thank you Cellot!</li>
    <li> I thought tese bows were good.&lt;br /&gt;They look a lot bigger in the pic and really they are pretty small. Good for toddlers and babies. The red one came out broken. Mine came with 24 bows</li>
    <li> These are adorable bows but a few of them have broken (the clip just breaks!) in the few months we have had them...I would order again though bc they are such a great price...wish there was a real yellow one, the yellow pictured is more of a green/yellow.</li>
    <li> I bought these bows since the price was great and I hated not having bows to match most of my daughters outfits. These work perfect! I love always having something that will match and they are the perfect size!</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors. I love hair bows. I jist hate I have to re-enforce them they aren&#x27;t glued together well</li>
    <li> Received these for my little girl &amp; they are great! It&#x27;s wonderful to have a large selection of beautiful colors. I wish there was a true yellow but for the most part they&#x27;re awesome!!</li>
    <li> Nice pieces and great quality!</li>
    <li> My three year old loves them so much she carried them around until I forced her to put them in her bow basket. They go with every outfit imaginable and my 3 month old can even wear them. Will definitely be getting some larger ones in the future for my older daughter, as well. They are very well made and must have for every little princess.</li>
    <li> I love the color selection.  I received ALL the colors listed.  They are made well. 6 months later and they are still in great shape, none have broken or come apart. I will reorder as neccessary.</li>
    <li> Great for little girls. Big selection so my granddaughter can pick out the one she wants.</li>
    <li> These are the only type of clips that stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She wears this type of bow all the time so having a color assortment in one package was just perfect.</li>
    <li> Pretty bows, but the clips were not covered.</li>
    <li> Loved the bows and the colors!!</li>
    <li> Great price for so many bows</li>
    <li> The bows are really cute! the only thing is that they are not glued to the metal part so they can fall easily but you also can easily put them back. I love them for my 8 year old! and she loves them too!</li>
    <li> I ordered Theese bows and I absolutely loved the color variety and the quality I just think when buying these You should know that these are pretty small !! I just wish they were bigger</li>
    <li> Recieved it on time love the colors</li>
    <li> Bows took almost 3 months to receive and when we received the alligator clips were not attached so there was no way to wear the bows.</li>
    <li> I gave this a two because when I finally got them they were all 40 of them stuffed in a bag not much bigger than a ziplock bag! They are all crumpled up and cheap looking.i guess we will use them if they don&#x27;t fall apart. The first time we wore one the bow fell off!!!! Not only that but you can see the metal clip the bow is attached to when you are looking at it in the hair. The ribbon looks cheap and flimsy and half of my bows were noticeably uneven. All things considering I would not recommend this seller :-/ sorry I know someone had to work hard on them but it&#x27;s just not quality work.</li>
    <li> Cute. Great price. Good quality. Faster than quoted shipping. A surprising winner.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews! Unless you feel like buying your own super glue and re-gluing all of these, don&#x27;t buy them. They&#x27;re cute for about 5 minutes before your toddler tears the bow completely off the clip.</li>
    <li> They are cute but they are alot smaller then I expected but other then that I like them 😊</li>
    <li> Exactly what they look like. They&#x27;re good quality and hold well, even in fine hair. They&#x27;re a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing price and nice bows! The clip slides out of the bow if you pull it, but otherwise stays in great. Small dab of glue could fix it but it doesn&#x27;t bother us.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find bows larger than 1&amp;#34; that aren&#x27;t attached to a head band. 20 bows not even for $20??? And you can&#x27;t go wrong with these! The bows are neatly shaped, lay flat, and are attached to an alligator clip. The clip is not covered in ribbon which I actually like (so so much easier to put into little girls hair) and the clip portion doesn&#x27;t bother my two little girls at all. The size is accurate and I can tell they won&#x27;t be falling apart anytime soon. There are at least four shades of pink-which is great if you are picky about getting just the right shade to match an outfit. I may get another set for those pigtail days!</li>
    <li> I love hair bows. We have a dress code at work so these let me show a little personal flair. Plus they come in a bunch of cute colors.</li>
    <li> The bows arrived a week before the earliest predicted date. The alligators clips on my set do not have \\&quot;teeth,\\&quot; but still stay in place on a very active 9 month old who has kept the full set of hair she was born with and needs her hair kept out of her face.</li>
    <li> Very cute bows.  I actually got them for my little Yorkie.  I have to rubber band the open end because the little stinker learned how to get the clips out.  They are perfectly adorable.</li>
    <li> Quality bows, looks great on crotched headbands.</li>
    <li> Very good deal. Color selection is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great colors and the bows stay in my daughter&#x27;s fine hair! I would definitely buy from here again.</li>

    <li> Love these! Look exactly like the picture and came when they said they would :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these bows! My daughter is almost 17 months and has went through so many bows, we always got her the ones with the fabric back and she&#x27;d completely tear them apart and so I finally got these to try and she hasn&#x27;t broken or lost any so far. They are the perfect size I was looking for and with so many beautiful colors she has one to match every outfit she will ever wear. I was a little worries they would weigh down her hair or pull it but they dont hurt her at all and she leaves them in all day because they aren&#x27;t too heavy on her hair. For the price, they are even less than the super cheap ones walmart has for a dollar a piece that break after one or two wears for my daughter so I&#x27;m really glad I found these!</li>
    <li> Super Cute ,Love it :)</li>
