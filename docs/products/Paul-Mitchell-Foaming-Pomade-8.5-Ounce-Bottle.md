      <li>I cannot live without this hair product.</li>
      <li>The foaming pomade does a nice job of keeping the friz down without weighing down the curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this products for 20 years. Recently I found out that it is no longer being manufactured by Paul Mitchell. I am devistated by this and can now only purchase online from various ventors. Keep the product out there. I have yet to find a product that compares.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for shine, and softness to your hair.  I am African American, no relaxer in hair, wash, deep condition, put this on afterwards blow dry and goodness, the best full body effect ever! I will be buying it again.  Seller was fine too, came on time.</li>
    <li> This product is getting harder and harder to find. The prices higher and the quantities lower.  But I have found nothing in 20 years that gives better balance of shine and softness while locking in curls.  Write Paul Mitchell to keep this product!</li>
    <li> What more can I say!! It is exactly what I wanted, no flakes/ hair remains soft/ lusturous but maintains the style, I can go on...but you get the idea</li>
    <li> I am on a constant quest for products to help tame the friz of my very curly hair.The foaming pomade does a nice job of keeping the friz down without weighing down the curls.</li>
    <li> According to my husband, Steve, Paul Mitchell products are high quality and they do what they say they&#x27;re going to do.  The Foaming Pomade adds moisture and managability to his hair after a shower.  He highly recommends it and the other Paul Mitchell products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but it is not always easy to find, especially at a good price.  I got it here at a good price and it arrived when promised.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This lite feel of the product, the added shine, the wonderful smell.....so refreshing.  I use this with the affirm products and I don&#x27;t have any shedding or breakage even though I use straightening products on my hair.  These two together work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for awhile now and it doesn&#x27;t do the job.  It&#x27;s kind of greasy.  If you want the 60s wet look, go for it.</li>
    <li> When I buy this product at a local salon they only sell the 5.1 ounce bottle.  I was happy to see that Amazon is selling the larger size bottle!  Goes on wet but does not leave a messy residue or sticky one.  It is great for natural curly hair and it retains the natural curl pattern.</li>
    <li> As always, amazing service and the right product</li>
    <li> Perfect hair product to use for hot summer days. This product provides shine to your hair with a light hold. It is not greasy. A small amount of this product used will last you for about a week</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few hair products I&#x27;ve purchased that hasn&#x27;t been used twice and then collected dust on my bathroom shelf until I gave it to my sisters. It is my &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; product for days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair. My hair is wavy to curly, depending on its mood, and coarse or silky, depending on its mood (usually coarse, especially if I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; it by adding product and backcombing it). This product provides control and some shine to the ends. If it is wavy it makes it curlier (I have never tried it when my hair is straightened, but I don&#x27;t do that very often). It&#x27;s actually kind of hard to explain how it helps my hair; it makes unwashed hair look clean, I guess, and adds texture and more curl. I only need to use a small amount so it&#x27;s well worth the cost. If you have hair like mine, I really recommend that you give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and it does a nice job for me, keeping my hair in place and making my gray hair looking darker, which I like. However take care of were you rest your head as this will leave behind a gummy film that is not east to take off my leather chair as well as my hair brush.</li>
    <li> My hair is on the short side. I wash it nearly everyday to air it out. When I put this product on it, it doesn&#x27;t look as dry&lt;br /&gt;and it makes it shiny. Then, I mess it up on top so it sort of waves and push the sides back, check for those sneaky&lt;br /&gt;little cowlicks in back and head out the door. I look good to myself.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this hair product. This is an absolute must for those of us with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll love this for your hair - it&#x27;s a timeless useful product that you will continue to use for years!</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have curly hair, gives it a nice shine and defined curls, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, speedy service, and an overall wonderful experience!</li>
    <li> It really brings out the natural curl in my hair. My stylist introduced me to this product and now I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Used this for years &amp; it really helps combat the dryness of curly hair whilst defining curls. Non-greasy if used sparingly as directed.</li>
