### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If you are looking for something that is not too overpowering, this is the perfect fragrance.</li>
      <li>would either buy a set and layer the fragrances, then hope for the best or skip this all together.  </li>
      <li>The best musk out there!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent seller!!</li>
      <li>you haven&#x27;t smelled the ideal scent combination, try spray some TBS Vanilla OVER the TBS</li>
      <li>The scent is still beautiful though.</li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s perfect and makes me feel, i don&#x27;t know, WOMAN and sexy.</li>
      <li>My wife smells good any day of the week, but when she uses this stuff --</li>
      <li>Love this scent!</li>
      <li>and I honestly use it every day</li>
      <li>It would be nice if they would send me another one to try.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I have to use this oil very lightly</li>
      <li>And thats the more fruity scents.</li>
      <li>I love.</li>
      <li>Top notes are noticed as soon as you apply a fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the freshness of this scent.</li>
      <li>I tend to love scents with nectar for example.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>&quot; within the notes, and they both in my opinion come off as  \\&quot;Grandma&#x27;s\\&quot; favorite perfume (my opinion).</li>
      <li>Love the scent</li>
      <li>unless im placing Vanilla Extract in pie, cake pancakes, or french toast, ingredients to add flavor, its delicious.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, \\&quot;Vanilla\\&quot; is NOT is favorite scent at all</li>
      <li>It is not too sweet, has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>And most importantly for me, my husband loves it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>nice fresh sweet musk fragrance that is not too over powering in fragrance, i love mine</li>
      <li>Its compact and fits into my purse and the cap goes on easily without risk of leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But at the same time they are 2 of the most popular scents Men love to smell on a woman im finding upon research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it really smells nice</li>
      <li>This fit the bill.</li>
      <li>The item arrived in good condition and is exactly what my girlfriend wants to have.</li>
      <li>This wonderful fragrance is a brilliant mixture of Musk, Lily, Ylang Ylang, hints of Galbanum and Basil Middle: Musk, Jasmine, Lily, Rose Base: Musk, Jasmine, Rose, Iris, Amber, Patchouli, Vetiver, hints of Peach, Oakmoss, and Vanilla.</li>
      <li>This was always my favorite perfume, and this morning I had to put so much on to even start smelling the scent.</li>
      <li>As with any fragrance that can be too sweet and overpowering.</li>
      <li>But as a scent on the body, Since I was a teenager Vanilla, has given me headaches by it being too sweet.</li>
      <li>The product came over quickly and intact.</li>
      <li>(im more of a fan of Designer (or not)Fragrance oils, they last longer than the upscale store versions of the Designer fragrances &amp; lotions that are mostly alcohol &amp; water..</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the soft, clean scent.</li>
      <li>It was shipped right on time for her birthday</li>
      <li>I generally like the product, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a brand new.&lt;br</li>
      <li>fades quickly, more so than other musks, but I do use it and enjoy it.</li>
      <li>for the scent, it is a very warm, soft, feminine scent with top notes of Ylang - Ylang, Galbanum and Basil, and middle notes of Jasmine, Rose, Musk and Lily, and base notes of Musk, Amber, Vanilla, Oakmoss, Vetiver, Peach, Patchouli, Rose, Iris, and Jasmine.</li>
      <li>This is the first review I am ever writing</li>
      <li>The nozzle broke the first day.  </li>
      <li>I think of this White Musk EDT like more of a body</li>
      <li>Middle notes emerge just before the top notes dissipate.</li>
      <li>It smells heavenly (more about the scent later) and can be worn for any occasion.</li>
      <li>first off it looked like someone was using the perfume</li>
      <li>I purchased this scented oil for the positive &amp; rave reviews it gets all over the internet who sell the scent.</li>
      <li>Both products have been dilluted becoming a shadow of their former selves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This scent is subtle, sophisticated, and appropriate for my age.</li>
      <li>a full set.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance seems a little more garish than it used to, but that may be the difference comparing it to the perfume.  </li>
      <li>This \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; scent has long been said to be a favorite scent MEN seem to adore and love to smell on a woman above all other scents &amp; fragrances no matter where I look it up Vanilla always comes up as by far a Favorite of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It has a much harsher edge to the scent.</li>
      <li>I expected more from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I have to use 2x as much.</li>
      <li>Too much work, as I don&#x27;t have transportation to the post office.  </li>
      <li>Very watery.  </li>
      <li>I love the Body Shop WHITE MUSK perfume oil, but this eau de toilette is not the same at all.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;It is light but distinct and will last for a long time!</li>
      <li>Body Shop White Musk was originally launced in 1981 and the scent was described as \\&quot;soft, velvety and forever sensual\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s a very neutral scent, it makes this 22 year old smell like an old lady.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume because they tend to be overwhelming</li>
      <li>I would lightly dab this White Musk oil to my pulse points ONLY, while my regular fragrance is worn all over</li>
      <li>This seems to have changed markedly since I used it years ago.  </li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work for me to go around smelling strongly of white musk for hours on end</li>
      <li>They have this old fashioned perfume scent.</li>
      <li>What I can tell you (and I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say) that after drying the scent quickly begins fading and is completely gone within a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> (All fragrances have layers which the perfume industry refers to as top notes, middle notes, and base notes.</li>
<li> /&gt;This Eau de Toilette version of The Body Shop White Musk is less concentrated/has less fragrance oils than their Eau de parfum version, and so you might want to reapply it</li>

<li> It was quite a let down.</li>
<li> but I have to advise, it seems watered down.</li>
<li> The scent is subtle enough.</li>
<li> , I felt like the perfume was not completely filled...</li>
<li> My wife has been wearing this for a few years now, and its just how she smells to me.  </li>
<li> Smaller size than usual, disappointed</li>
<li> /&gt;the packaging was really bad.</li>
<li> Base notes become perceivable about 30 minutes after application.)&lt;br</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> This seems to have changed markedly since I used it years ago.  I bought this to try again and to see if I wanted to get a full set.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance seems a little more garish than it used to, but that may be the difference comparing it to the perfume.  What I can tell you (and I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say) that after drying the scent quickly begins fading and is completely gone within a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;I would either buy a set and layer the fragrances, then hope for the best or skip this all together.  It was quite a let down.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have used this product for years. The stores are not longer in my area. The product came over quickly and intact. Thank you for a job well done!</li>
    <li> nice fresh sweet musk fragrance that is not too over powering in fragrance, i love mine</li>
    <li> Love this scent! I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift for my mother on her birthday cause she always drops hints about white musk from the Body Shop. It was shipped right on time for her birthday it really smells nice i would order it again</li>
    <li> fades quickly, more so than other musks, but I do use it and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller!! Love the scent</li>
    <li> I generally like the product, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a brand new.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was really bad. the product was wrapped up with plastic.&lt;br /&gt;It did not have a box or something.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I felt like the perfume was not completely filled...</li>
    <li> I bought this set back in 2007 from my local &amp;#34;Body Shop&amp;#34;. I ran out last year and decided to reorder here on Amazon. I sprayed it and the scent won&#x27;t last like it used to. What&#x27;s up with that? The scent is still beautiful though.</li>
    <li> My wife smells good any day of the week, but when she uses this stuff -- oh yeah. Someone said perfumes smell different on each user -- your results may vary.</li>
    <li> I purchased this EDT to mix with The Body Shop&#x27;s Vanilla EDT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t smelled the ideal scent combination, try spray some TBS Vanilla OVER the TBS White musk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination will astound you and please those around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately in 2013 The Body Shop changed the formula for their vanilla EDT and put the White Musk in a glass bottle.  Both products have been dilluted becoming a shadow of their former selves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I think of this White Musk EDT like more of a body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try...pick up a bottle of this White Musk EDT and a Vanilla EDT and spray some vanilla over the white musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are in for a treat if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys can use this combo as well.</li>
    <li> I dont like the frangance</li>
    <li> The item arrived in good condition and is exactly what my girlfriend wants to have.</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t find this at the body shop at our local mall.  My wife has been wearing this for a few years now, and its just how she smells to me.  I like it too!</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a very neutral scent, it makes this 22 year old smell like an old lady. Plus it can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume because they tend to be overwhelming and I&#x27;m very sensitive. This scent is subtle, sophisticated, and appropriate for my age. I&#x27;m 25. I don&#x27;t want to go around smelling too candy or vanilla. This one&#x27;s perfect and makes me feel, i don&#x27;t know, WOMAN and sexy. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I expected more from this product.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find it all that is described.&lt;br /&gt;the scent does not remain for very long.</li>
    <li> I have used the White Musk body shop oil for years and just wanted something similar I could use every day and pop into my handbag. This fit the bill. Its compact and fits into my purse and the cap goes on easily without risk of leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviewers saying the scent does not last long; however, I think it lasts just long enough. It really doesn&#x27;t work for me to go around smelling strongly of white musk for hours on end and I honestly use it every day so I only use small amounts for just a hint of scent not a real bouquet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however, prefer the perfumed oil which if it just didn&#x27;t leak out of the bottle when jostled around in my bag I would take over this any day - so not quite 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The scent is subtle enough. The product arrived on time. I fully recommend it.</li>
    <li> first off it looked like someone was using the perfume and it didnt come in a box...i was suppose to give as gift...Not Now!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I am ever writing but I have to advise, it seems watered down. This was always my favorite perfume, and this morning I had to put so much on to even start smelling the scent. Very disappointed. They should have sent me an extra one bc now I have to use 2x as much.</li>
    <li> This wonderful fragrance is a brilliant mixture of Musk, Lily, Ylang Ylang, hints of Galbanum and Basil Middle: Musk, Jasmine, Lily, Rose Base: Musk, Jasmine, Rose, Iris, Amber, Patchouli, Vetiver, hints of Peach, Oakmoss, and Vanilla. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is light but distinct and will last for a long time! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a BIG fan of white musk fragrances. The Body Shop White Musk is one of my favorites. It smells heavenly (more about the scent later) and can be worn for any occasion. It doesn&#x27;t affect people with sensitivities to other fragrances. It garners compliments from both men and women (who almost always want to know what fragrance it is and where they can get it). And most importantly for me, my husband loves it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Eau de Toilette version of The Body Shop White Musk is less concentrated/has less fragrance oils than their Eau de parfum version, and so you might want to reapply it mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it is a very warm, soft, feminine scent with top notes of Ylang - Ylang, Galbanum and Basil, and middle notes of Jasmine, Rose, Musk and Lily, and base notes of Musk, Amber, Vanilla, Oakmoss, Vetiver, Peach, Patchouli, Rose, Iris, and Jasmine. (All fragrances have layers which the perfume industry refers to as top notes, middle notes, and base notes. Top notes are noticed as soon as you apply a fragrance. Middle notes emerge just before the top notes dissipate. Base notes become perceivable about 30 minutes after application.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT FIND USEFUL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Shop White Musk was originally launced in 1981 and the scent was described as \\&quot;soft, velvety and forever sensual\\&quot;. It is made by The Body Shop International plc, which has its headquarters in Littlehampton, West Sussex, England, and was founded in 1976 by Anita Roddick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Shop International plc never tests on animals, and all of their products are 100% vegetarian. They have over 2,500 stores in over 60 markets worldwide and are now part of the L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al corporate group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS (The Body Shop White Musk Eau de Toilette): Alcohol Denat., Water, Fragrance, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, t-Butyl Alcohol, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hydroxycitronellal, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Benzoate, Isoeugenol, Denatonium Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Evernia Prunastri (Oak Moss) Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Eugenol, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Cinnamate, Limonene, Farnesol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Cinnamal, Citralenzyl Benzoate, Isoeugenol, Denatonium Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Evernia Prunastri (Oak Moss) Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Eugenol, Amyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Cinnamate, Limonene, Farnesol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Cinnamal, Citral</li>
    <li> Smaller size than usual, disappointed</li>
    <li> The best musk out there!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very watery.  The nozzle broke the first day.  I think it is defective.  I am not going to bother to return this.  Too much work, as I don&#x27;t have transportation to the post office.  It would be nice if they would send me another one to try.  But I doubt it.  I already sent feedback to the company and no response.</li>
    <li> I love the Body Shop WHITE MUSK perfume oil, but this eau de toilette is not the same at all.  It has a much harsher edge to the scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this scented oil for the positive &amp; rave reviews it gets all over the internet who sell the scent. I also purchased it because it has notes of \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; in its ingredients.  This \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; scent has long been said to be a favorite scent MEN seem to adore and love to smell on a woman above all other scents &amp; fragrances no matter where I look it up Vanilla always comes up as by far a Favorite of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, \\&quot;Vanilla\\&quot; is NOT is favorite scent at all unless im placing Vanilla Extract in pie, cake pancakes, or french toast, ingredients to add flavor, its delicious. But as a scent on the body, Since I was a teenager Vanilla, has given me headaches by it being too sweet. Any fragrance with vanilla in its ingredients has given me headaches. This Body Shop \\&quot;White Musk\\&quot; scent is very similar to \\&quot;Shalimar\\&quot; by Guerlain. Both fragrances have that \\&quot;Vanilla\\&quot; within the notes, and they both in my opinion come off as  \\&quot;Grandma&#x27;s\\&quot; favorite perfume (my opinion). They have this old fashioned perfume scent. But at the same time they are 2 of the most popular scents Men love to smell on a woman im finding upon research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way u can wear White Musk by Body Shop is by layering it over another scent  I love. And thats the more fruity scents. I tend to love scents with nectar for example. I would lightly dab this White Musk oil to my pulse points ONLY, while my regular fragrance is worn all over (im more of a fan of Designer (or not)Fragrance oils, they last longer than the upscale store versions of the Designer fragrances &amp; lotions that are mostly alcohol &amp; water..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have to use this oil very lightly or I will end up with a headache. As with any fragrance that can be too sweet and overpowering.</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t the way I expect it</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance. It is not too sweet, has a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> I love the freshness of this scent. Although I&#x27;ve tried others, I always come back to White Musk. Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the soft, clean scent. If you are looking for something that is not too overpowering, this is the perfect fragrance.</li>
</ol>
