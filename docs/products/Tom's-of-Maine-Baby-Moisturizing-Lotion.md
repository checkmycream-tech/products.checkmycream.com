### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it works great!  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>but I think best to reapply after swimming.  </li>
      <li>He is very fair.  </li>
      <li>Throughout the years, we have depended on Tom&#x27;s of Maine products and believe the company to be an honorable one and they made very good products.</li>
      <li>, so I happily jumped at the chance to test this out.</li>
      <li>Not greasy at all, very nice feel to the cream.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m thrilled to find something that works -- used faithfully and with awareness of time/exposure - and that doesn&#x27;t paint me noticeably paler than I already am!</li>
      <li>&#x27;s the good:  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s good for babies is good for me (usually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have good results for him with Neutrogena brand as well.  </li>
      <li>This is the best of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, though I still have to mix it with moisturizer in order to get it to apply smoothly.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;s the good:  </li>

      <li>and you can DIY your own zinc oxide sunscreen if so inclined, but I&#x27;m not quite that \\&quot;earth</li>
      <li>I used this on my 3 month old and was very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>To have a product specifically designed for babies is awesome, the fact that is fragrance free is excellent as babies should not be exposed to harsh aromas.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We are pretty happy with this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s been working pretty darn</li>

      <li>Until I can find something better, it will be my go-to.</li>
      <li>I can go out into the garden with this and spend a morning without burning, and without wearing the floppy hat that my kids say is goofy looking.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used the baby sunscreen from Australia and the famous California baby sunscreen</li>
      <li>I can go out into the garden with this and spend a morning without burning, and without wearing the floppy hat that my kids say is goofy looking.  </li>
      <li>It is doing a great job of protecting our busy toddler from the sun.</li>
      <li>Since I also am sensitive and dislike fragrance, I&#x27;m happy to report that this lives up to its claim.</li>
      <li>(depends on what you need, I forget the details so you&#x27;ll have to do your own research :P), so I tend to stick with 30 or so for the longer lasting power.</li>
      <li>This product worked great, and is all natural.  </li>
      <li>Most sunscreens sting, and no one was brave enough.  </li>
      <li>This cream is fragrance free, easy to apply, safe,and most importantly protects all of us from the sun.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on easily and it does fade to clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m thrilled to find something that works -- used faithfully and with awareness of time/exposure - and that doesn&#x27;t paint me noticeably paler than I already am!t, but the alternative is to paint the face with opaque, pure zinc oxide.  </li>
      <li>I got this for free through the Vine program so I cannot complain, but I was sent babys diaper cream not sunscreen.</li>
      <li>burn free the day of his school&#x27;s field day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the primary user of this product and no, I&#x27;m not pre-verbal.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen isn&#x27;t cheap but</li>
      <li>but Tom&#x27;s is fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>I know the Toms brand to be a good one from Maine and like the fact that this is natural.  </li>
      <li>Good natural sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I have used sunscreen for many years, and am always trying new ones to see if I can find something better.  </li>
      <li>Our first line of defense is clothing and eyewear designed to protect against the sun and Tom&#x27;s of Maine is the perfect sunscreen for the face and other exposed areas.</li>
      <li>but I do have an 8 year old son who has sensitive skin on his face and will break out in a rash from most sunscreens so this is great.  </li>
      <li>to keep the baby out of midday sun, and this is a good product to use when you&#x27;re outside.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a really nice product for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It works very well for SPF30 and am pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Sun protection is so important, especially for babies and Tom&#x27;s of Maine really works, is safe and easy to use and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The scent is very neutral, and the cream applies smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Collects in creases, which is a big deal, because I question how effective a film it is forming.</li>
      <li>Comes off on stuff--again, not only aesthetically unpleasing, but I question how effective it is, then.</li>
      <li>The natural content makes it safe and because it is water resistance, it kept the baby protected for the 1/2 hour</li>
      <li>but I have to stick my nose right up to my arm to detect it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything added.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
      <li>If baby is going to be exposed to a lot of direct sunlight I want something more like an SPF 50, or even higher.  </li>
      <li>Very natural product with good coverage and protection, and last well even with splashing around for hours.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen works very well and is better for your skin than most other sunscreens out on the market</li>
      <li>any case, this stuff is *very* gentle on my super-sensitive skin, just as it has to be on baby skin.  </li>
      <li>The review of this product, Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Baby Sunscreen Lotion Cream, Fragrance Free, 3 Ounce is part of our obligation to the Vine Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey</li>
      <li>I checked the boys after an hour of outside play and they seemed to be doing okay and found that it lasts about 1 1/2 hours and about an hour in the pool.  </li>
      <li>Although this is often true of natural sunscreens, it&#x27;s a deal breaker for me, hence the 2-star review.</li>
      <li>After an hour there was a noticeable difference, in that the right arm was red and warm but the left arm was neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I prefer the ease of use, simple ingredients and easy to handle tube of Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
      <li>So we keep sun screen on his as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not so much.</li>
      <li>My toddler grandson has light blonde hair and blue-eyes.  </li>
      <li>This worked really well  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s added here is just carrier oils really</li>

      <li>/&gt;My most recent \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brand has been Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Moisturizer, which has been pretty kind to my skin, but occasionally (mildly) irritating -</li>

      <li>My baby has sensitive skin, and there were no problems!</li>
      <li>Due to that I always use fragrance free lotions, including sunscreens, but sometimes adult versions aren&#x27;t made for my sensitive skin and still irritate.  </li>
      <li>but if you have a child who is sensitive to traditional sunscreens than price really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
      <li>This is a natural sunscreen with no Phthalates, No Parabens and No Phenoxyenthenol.  </li>
      <li>It is odorless and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;While it wouldn&#x27;t be ethical to leave part of a child uncovered to test the SPF claim, it does seem to work, along with hats and umbrellas whenever possible</li>
      <li>It rubs in and leaves the skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to salicylic acid and sodium benzoate, which makes nearly all sunscreens off limits for me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My toddler grandson has light blonde hair and blue-eyes.  He is very fair.  Yet he loves going outside.  The child care center also takes his class outside.  So we keep sun screen on his as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sunscreen doesn’t last for long.  Some sun screen doesn’t have enough protection.  Some have ingredients that we just don’t want to use on our baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen doesn’t have ingredients that we worry about.  It lasts, even in water for just over an hour. It is SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking the white strip down the lifeguard’s nose because of the zinc oxide, don’t.  It rubs in and leaves the skin soft.  It was not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are pretty happy with this sunscreen.  It is doing a great job of protecting our busy toddler from the sun.</li>
    <li> We trust Tom&#x27;s products and have also used their toothpaste and diaper cream. This sunscreen is no exception in terms of quality and ingredients. After using a few times this summer, noticed that the lotion spreads very easily and leaves a slight pinkish tinge on his skin. However, that neutralizes slowly with time. We have observed avoiding of sunburn and reduction in redness of facial skin with the use of this lotion and hence recommend it.  I&#x27;m also glad that the ingredients are all natural and there is nothing to worry me, especially the neutral smell.</li>
    <li> I have used sunscreen for many years, and am always trying new ones to see if I can find something better.  Some sunscreens sting my eyes, and others make my skin dry, so I was interested in trying Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Baby Sunscreen.  I am not a baby, but rather an adult woman who spends what I think is an average amount of time in the sun, usually commuting to work and running errands.  Also, I run out outside a few days a week, but I am always out around 6:00 am.  I tried the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Baby Sunscreen Lotion in a variety situations, and here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen feels like a thick, creamy paste and you do need to give it time to absorb into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell, and it does not sting if you get any in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to last for a few hours, even if you perspire a bit.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and it can feel a little bit oily or tacky at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems wearing minimal make up over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It is odorless and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;While it wouldn&#x27;t be ethical to leave part of a child uncovered to test the SPF claim, it does seem to work, along with hats and umbrellas whenever possible</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a trusted brand and this sunscreen for babies is no exception, with a short list of natural products, as recommended by pediatricians. There is zinc oxide, a form of coconut oil, beeswax, sunflower seed oil and castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a thick creamy white but it rubs in quickly and does not feel sticky. It&#x27;s recommended that you put this on 15 minutes before going in the sun and to repeat after 80 minutes. There is no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work well. I put some on my left arm and went out gardening -- probably out there for about an hour. After an hour there was a noticeable difference, in that the right arm was red and warm but the left arm was neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to keep the baby out of midday sun, and this is a good product to use when you&#x27;re outside.</li>
    <li> This Tom&#x27;s sunscreen for baby has some good things going for it.  It doesn&#x27;t have phthalates, parabens, and phenoxyethanol for example. [If you&#x27;re curious about the Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride ingredient it comes from coconut oil.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder about the SPF 30.  If baby is going to be exposed to a lot of direct sunlight I want something more like an SPF 50, or even higher.  I think it&#x27;s sufficient though for indirect sun, which is all I&#x27;m likely to expose babies to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES&lt;br /&gt;-- When they say no fragrance, they mean it. There is a scent but I have to stick my nose right up to my arm to detect it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything added.&lt;br /&gt;-- There is a silver protective tamper seal.&lt;br /&gt;-- The lotion is a little difficult to squeeze from the tube.&lt;br /&gt;-- The lotion is a step back, in that it is Zinc based. So it goes on white and thick.&lt;br /&gt;-- Be careful of putting this on baby&#x27;s fingers because they will put them in their mouths. That said, you should put lotion on the back of their little hands.&lt;br /&gt;-- The lotion goes on easily and it does fade to clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government and Pediatrician advice is to not expose babies and very young children to the strongest rays of the sun --like at midday.  They agree that babies should be kept in the shade, and that they should be dressed in light weight clothing like long pants and shirts.  For cheeks and the back of the hands of babies they suggest sunscreen of at least SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this sunscreen and it&#x27;s lack of fragrance.</li>
    <li> I used this on my 3 month old and was very happy with it.  I know the Toms brand to be a good one from Maine and like the fact that this is natural.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and goes on easily and smoothly.  I would highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The review of this product, Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Baby Sunscreen Lotion Cream, Fragrance Free, 3 Ounce is part of our obligation to the Vine Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in South Florida, it is imperative to protect the skin from the harsh rays of the sun. To have a product specifically designed for babies is awesome, the fact that is fragrance free is excellent as babies should not be exposed to harsh aromas. The natural content makes it safe and because it is water resistance, it kept the baby protected for the 1/2 hour we were in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say that it will only last 80 minutes, so we left and the baby skin did not burn.</li>
    <li> Safe sun protection for baby and me. This cream is fragrance free, easy to apply, safe,and most importantly protects all of us from the sun. Our first line of defense is clothing and eyewear designed to protect against the sun and Tom&#x27;s of Maine is the perfect sunscreen for the face and other exposed areas. Baby&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and I am using this cream on exposed skin every time we go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a lot of comments about the price. This sunscreen isn&#x27;t cheap but when I think that I&#x27;ve spent  16.00 - 30.00 on a lipstick it puts things into perspective. Sun protection is so important, especially for babies and Tom&#x27;s of Maine really works, is safe and easy to use and worth every penny. I&#x27;ve used the baby sunscreen from Australia and the famous California baby sunscreen and I prefer the ease of use, simple ingredients and easy to handle tube of Tom&#x27;s of Maine. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The good stuff: no fragrance or other common irritants, including &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; sunscreens. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. Zinc oxide is the only ingredient, and it provides broad spectrum coverage. Smells okay--probably from the beeswax. Moisturizing. No nano-particles.&lt;br /&gt;The not so good stuff: takes forever and a lot of rubbing to make remotely invisible and still leaves a whitish cast. Is sticky, like beeswax, duh, or oily, depending on the ambient temperature. Collects in creases, which is a big deal, because I question how effective a film it is forming. Comes off on stuff--again, not only aesthetically unpleasing, but I question how effective it is, then. It seemed to float on my skin when I sweated, so....&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically unscented diaper rash cream.</li>
    <li> We are using this product this summer and so far like it very well. My family is widely varied in age but we are all using this as our sunscreen lotion. It does not leave an odor and it is not particularly greasy. It stays on for quite a while even after being in the water so that is a good thing. Throughout the years, we have depended on Tom&#x27;s of Maine products and believe the company to be an honorable one and they made very good products. We like this especially for our little people who don&#x27;t fuss when they get the &#x27;lotion up&#x27; treatment before getting in the sun.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s is well known for making natural products, and this is another item in their line-up. It&#x27;s baby sunscreen (but can also be used by adults), and has an SPF of 30.  The scent is very neutral, and the cream applies smoothly.  We used this on our toddler during a recent vacation to Cancun, and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the price is high, but that is normal for Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> As I burn if there happens to be a full moon out, I tend to shy away from the outdoors come summer, so I happily jumped at the chance to test this out. I&#x27;m a longtime fan/consumer of Tom&#x27;s of Maine but haven&#x27;t tried their sunscreen yet. I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s been working pretty darn well so far. I used to buy the higher SPF sunscreens until I read that they&#x27;re not necessarily better than the lower ones (depends on what you need, I forget the details so you&#x27;ll have to do your own research :P), so I tend to stick with 30 or so for the longer lasting power. Since I also am sensitive and dislike fragrance, I&#x27;m happy to report that this lives up to its claim. While it does have a slight scent from the zinc oxide, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least. Overall, I think I&#x27;ll be sticking to this particular sunscreen for quite a while, the others I&#x27;ve tried just haven&#x27;t measured up.</li>
    <li> Both of my grandsons have sensitive skin especially the 2 year old and I was a bit hesitant to get this products as it is only SPF 30 and I usually use at least SPF 50  on the boys.  But thought I would give it a try as it is made for sensitive skin and is fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it works great!  The boys usually go out to play in the morning and in the late afternoon and early evening and avoid the hot California afternoons.  A little bit goes a long ways and like other sunscreens it is a bit heavy and a bit greasy but that is to be expected for specialty sunscreens.  It does go on white and clears when it gets on the skin.  And definitely no fragrance!  I&#x27;ve used some products where the boys smelled like coconuts but Tom&#x27;s is fragrance free.  I checked the boys after an hour of outside play and they seemed to be doing okay and found that it lasts about 1 1/2 hours and about an hour in the pool.  It works very well for SPF30 and am pleased with it.  Also it does not stain clothing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a natural no chemical sunscreen that really works you have found it (at a very steep price). This sunscreen works very well and is better for your skin than most other sunscreens out on the market but I find it is way too expensive for my budget.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t listed on the ewd site, but all the ingredients are listed as zero or 1 on toxity level. The only ingredient I didn&#x27;t know was caprylic, so I looked it up.&lt;br /&gt;About CAPRYLIC/ CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride is a mixed triester of glycerin and caprylic and capric acids.&lt;br /&gt;Function(s): Fragrance Ingredient; Skin-Conditioning Agent - Occlusive&lt;br /&gt;I find the lotion to be creamy, not gritty like some all natural products I&#x27;ve used. I was not able to detect any scent, which is a big plus for me. It seem to last a long time and doesn&#x27;t come off to easily in the water, though I do recommend reapplying after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on white but blends in completely if you don&#x27;t plaster it on. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for to send to day camp with my 8 yr old.</li>
    <li> So I actually received diaper cream, not sunscreen.  I am rating this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t want to negatively affect this product. The diaper cream was not scented which I liked. It was very thick (similar to California Baby&#x27;s sunscreen) but not hard to wash off (like say Boudreaux Butt paste). My baby has sensitive skin, and there were no problems!</li>
    <li> This is the thickest sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried - it&#x27;s more like putty than like lotion coming out of the tube, although it wasn&#x27;t difficult to rub into the skin. What I really didn&#x27;t like is that skin remains sticky for at least an hour after using it. Although this is often true of natural sunscreens, it&#x27;s a deal breaker for me, hence the 2-star review.</li>
    <li> I got this for free through the Vine program so I cannot complain, but I was sent babys diaper cream not sunscreen. I&#x27;m sure it is great diaper cream but I have no use for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the primary user of this product and no, I&#x27;m not pre-verbal.  (Babies on the internetz!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people gravitate towards all-natural, zinc oxide based sunscreens due to concerns about phthalates, parabens, and other, potentially harmful chemicals.  I use them because the last time I tried a conventional sunscreen, I got a rash that was as red and painful as any sunburn.  My allergies had been present for awhile, but when they became worse, I started trying everything from expensive dermatologist office brands to plain old diaper cream (pretty much pure zinc oxide - which works! Also leaves you painted in \\&quot;whiteface\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most recent \\&quot;go to\\&quot; brand has been Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Moisturizer, which has been pretty kind to my skin, but occasionally (mildly) irritating - it has a long list of all or mostly natural ingredients, including a number of botanical ingredients and fruit acid, so I guess I could be slightly reactive to one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tom&#x27;s here has about as minimalist a list of ingredients for a sunscreen as I have ever seen:  Zinc Oxide, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, beeswax, sunflower seed oil, and castor oil.  That second weird-sounding ingredient is also known as \\&quot;fractionated\\&quot; coconut oil, or coconut oil refined to a form that remains liquid at relatively low temperatures.  It&#x27;s used a lot in soaps and as an oil for cosmetic preparations, and under it&#x27;s \\&quot;MCT\\&quot; label is also consumed as a \\&quot;superfood\\&quot; coffee additive.  (No, I don&#x27;t \\&quot;get it\\&quot; either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this stuff is *very* gentle on my super-sensitive skin, just as it has to be on baby skin.  I don&#x27;t perceive a scent beyond a vague note that is present also in diaper cream, so I guess that&#x27;s the zinc oxide itself.  I actually enjoy the smell of my Juice Beauty more, but scentless takes down the number of potential skin irritators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is price.  All of these natural brands are pricier than the ingredients would seem to warrant, but the alternative is to paint the face with opaque, pure zinc oxide.  What&#x27;s added here is just carrier oils really and you can DIY your own zinc oxide sunscreen if so inclined, but I&#x27;m not quite that \\&quot;earth mother.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the good:  I can go out into the garden with this and spend a morning without burning, and without wearing the floppy hat that my kids say is goofy looking.  Keep in mind that it doesn&#x27;t have the extended SPF heft of chemically laden brands - you&#x27;ll want to re-apply after an hour or so of sun exposure.  As a practical manner, if it&#x27;s a bit shady, or overcast, or I have the goofy hat - and if I&#x27;m staying out of the water -- it&#x27;ll go pretty far though, without reapplication.  It is a bit heavy like other sunscreens with the same natural formulation, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing (read \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; if you already have oily skin.)  I don&#x27;t believe that the zinc oxide is treated to remove opaqueness here, but for me, under foundation, it&#x27;s close to imperceptible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Choosing \\&quot;natural\\&quot; means choosing to forego the beneficial features in some of the big brands, but those brands being effectively dead to me, I&#x27;m thrilled to find something that works -- used faithfully and with awareness of time/exposure - and that doesn&#x27;t paint me noticeably paler than I already am!t, but the alternative is to paint the face with opaque, pure zinc oxide.

    <li> This product worked great, and is all natural.  We have a pool in our backyard and are constantly trying new sunscreens.  It is supposed to be waterproof, and gives instructions of applying after 80 minutes.  We had to reapply after about 60.  You could start to see some color on the kids.  I am not sure about the 30 for babies.  Research is all over the place.  We generally use 30 for everyday use, and 50 plus at the pool.  We also didn&#x27;t try this on our faces.  Most sunscreens sting, and no one was brave enough.  We use the copportone face sticks.  We are just sold on those.  Tired of stinging eyes.</li>
    <li> Good natural sunscreen.  Mostly zinc oxide.  Goes on white but will blend in if you work at it.  It is water resistant but I think best to reapply after swimming.  Work the money to be free of the phalates and other chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to salicylic acid and sodium benzoate, which makes nearly all sunscreens off limits for me.  I have fair skin, so I need to use it everyday, which has resulted in the most boring life&#x27;s quest ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several titanium oxide sunscreens and I&#x27;ve never really loved any of them.  This is the best of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, though I still have to mix it with moisturizer in order to get it to apply smoothly.  It does leave a white residue but it fades after just a few minutes so it&#x27;s not a major issue.  Doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. Until I can find something better, it will be my go-to.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am also very sensitive to fragrances.  Due to that I always use fragrance free lotions, including sunscreens, but sometimes adult versions aren&#x27;t made for my sensitive skin and still irritate.  Tom&#x27;s products never irritate my skin.  What&#x27;s good for babies is good for me (usually).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small tube and is pretty pricey, but if used for babies, it will last quite a while.  Used for me, outside every day during the Florida summers....not so much.</li>
    <li> Very natural product with good coverage and protection, and last well even with splashing around for hours. Only had to apply twice. Not greasy at all, very nice feel to the cream.</li>
    <li> This is a natural sunscreen with no Phthalates, No Parabens and No Phenoxyenthenol.  It&#x27;s made with Zinc Oxide and has virtually no scent at all.  I don&#x27;t have a baby but I do have an 8 year old son who has sensitive skin on his face and will break out in a rash from most sunscreens so this is great.  I have good results for him with Neutrogena brand as well.  It&#x27;s pretty pricey but if you have a child who is sensitive to traditional sunscreens than price really doesn&#x27;t matter.  My son is very fair skinned and burns easily. This worked really well  and he came home from school burn free the day of his school&#x27;s field day and he was outside the entire school day.  I recommend.</li>
