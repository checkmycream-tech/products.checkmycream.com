      <li>luck, hope this helps :)</li>
      <li>you aren&#x27;t sure if you should get them online or at Sally&#x27;s</li>

      <li>Still trying to get the hang of these, but they do make lovely curls.</li>
      <li>I received so many compliments after using these.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>love the curlers but the sticks tend to break easily....</li>
      <li>They are easy to put it.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use.</li>
      <li>Store easy</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and easy to take off</li>
      <li>Easy to work with once you get used to them.  </li>
      <li>I believe I will never have to replace this product because of the fine craftsmanship.</li>
      <li>Also, instead of wearing them as they are, you can do as I do and spray the curls with an oil-free spray (or water) and lightly brush/comb the curls to have them as relaxed as you</li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially if you can sleep in them without discomfort;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I have yet to figure out how to sleep comfortably with these.</li>
      <li>and they still don&#x27;t fit from scalp to tip.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I originally saw these on YouTube being used on human-hair extensions, which is how I am also using them.</li>
      <li>and they left a good curl.</li>
      <li>Will definitely recommend this to anyone hope they have more sizes looking forward to buying more.</li>
      <li>I just really wish I paid attention to what amazon said the delivery time frame would be and not the great big sign that says FAST DELIVERY NOW FROM THE US!</li>
      <li>so i bought these good ones and against negative reviews also got the cheap cheap ones.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Better then I ever expected:).</li>
      <li>Just with the right product in the hair the curls stays for days.</li>
      <li>you are still interested in buying these buy</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it say it will do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-These are a pain in the @$$ to use at first.</li>
      <li>and it really speeds up the process!  </li>
      <li>advertise fast delivery from the US!</li>
      <li>They were shipped in time for Christmas and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>a more positive note, we have some of knock off curlformers from a different manufacturer.</li>
      <li>The hook could be constructed a little sturdier, but overall good buy!</li>
      <li>Love them for my daughters long hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s coming straight from China which means you have to wait for a month to recieve your order.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the foam curlers for heat-free styling.</li>
      <li>Never used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones, but these were fabulous and quite simple.  </li>
      <li>With that said, I can&#x27;t really comment on how their product works because it&#x27;ll be a few more weeks before I recieve it.</li>
      <li>If you were to compare these to the originals these are high quality.</li>
      <li>for long hair, you have to keep the silicone opening held open to be able to pull your hair through with the hook, otherwise your hair gets stuck on the silicone</li>
      <li>also I put them in and they slide right back out</li>
      <li>These are not NARROW as stated in the title or picture!</li>
      <li>Giving them to my 9 year old niece for her birthday!</li>
      <li>Sally&#x27;s: 6 extra long (13.99)x 4&#x3D; 55.96 PLUS 2 hooks (4.29)x 2&#x3D; 8.58  Grand Total&#x3D; 64.54 (before tax)&lt;br /</li>
      <li>These probably work great for shorter hair, but for long hair, the curls shouldn&#x27;t be half as tight as these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants soft bouncy curls.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old has hair that does not respond to anything.</li>
      <li>My 14 year old daughter learned how to do this herself in one day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a little trouble getting them in at first but after watching a couple of you tube videos i was amazed with how easy and fast they were to use.  </li>
      <li>In other words, if you place the curl former at the scalp, up to 20 inches of hair could fit in it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I too find that the curls are tight once they&#x27;re set, but it&#x27;s a good thing as they fall out slowly.  </li>
      <li>I have my daughter feed the hook through the curl former while I get the next piece of hair ready</li>
      <li>I look at both the bad and good reviews.  </li>

<li> They&#x27;re hard to use, and if you have the tiniest bit too much hair in the curler it gets stuck.&lt;br</li>
<li> My only con would be they are not extra long and not that narrow, they are only 6 inches long.</li>
<li> It was just really long for my hair length.  </li>
<li> I have long hair, and bought the longest size</li>
<li> I have rather long hair (my hair stuck out in a couple of curlers), and when I took them out after sleeping in them at night, the ringlets were just that, ringlets.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The hook was extremely poorly made both broke on the first time I used it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  I am sorry I brought them.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter learned how to do this herself in one day.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness saves me bunches of time!</li>
    <li> it was very easy to put them in once I tried it.  Not comfortable to sleep in, so not convenient unless I have a 1/2 day to stay indoor and get ready to go somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about an hour to get them all in because I have long, thick hair; then at least an hour for them to set, or I have to sit under a hair dryer.  the curls fell out in a few hours.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved these. The problem is that the tool that comes with them broke on the second use. We have superglued it but don&#x27;t expect it to hold. Hopefully we can get a replacement.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the curl formers. I had beautiful bouncy pretty curls without the heat. Just with the right product in the hair the curls stays for days. I will buy more of these from this seller.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Does exactly what it say it will do. Recommend this to any one. Take a shower, dry my hair. put them on for couple hours and my hair has great loose curls all day long!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are approximately 10 inches coiled and approximately 20 inches pulled completely flat from end to end. In other words, if you place the curl former at the scalp, up to 20 inches of hair could fit in it. This is a great product, especially if you can sleep in them without discomfort;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</li>
    <li> Pros: made beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no instructions telling how to use them.  Had to you tube - no biggie but took a little time.&lt;br /&gt;Could NOT sleep in them as we hoped.  They were very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Didnt even need hair product. Held for hours. Prefect for cheerleading. Very easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt to our in or out.</li>
    <li> These curlers were twice the price in the beauty store. They were shipped in time for Christmas and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These make a perfect spiral curl! Love them for my daughters long hair.  Better then I ever expected:). Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants soft bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old has hair that does not respond to anything. We&#x27;ve tried curling iron, rollers and flat iron. We put these on and checked after 2 hours, no result. Then she slept in them, and in the morning she had perfect curls.&lt;br /&gt;She has thin hair and still takes about 24 to cover her whole head. If you can manage to sleep with them, they are great curlers.</li>
    <li> So I am sitting in the bed watching the walking dead and putting these rollers in my girls hair, they needed their hair done for school pictures. First thing in the morning we have little Shirley temples running around everywhere!!!!</li>
    <li> Love how my hair turned out.  It was just really long for my hair length.  Wish I had some smaller ones.</li>
    <li> If you were to compare these to the originals these are high quality. My only con would be they are not extra long and not that narrow, they are only 6 inches long. Awesome product , amazing quality for price!</li>
    <li> We love them.  1 set is great for a head of hair. For my younger daughters, we have some left over, but not enough for another person, so we might have to get another set.  Never used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones, but these were fabulous and quite simple.  I have my daughter feed the hook through the curl former while I get the next piece of hair ready and it really speeds up the process!  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Great price great product can&#x27;t beat it. Will definitely recommend this to anyone hope they have more sizes looking forward to buying more.</li>
    <li> love the curlers but the sticks tend to break easily....no matter who i buy from</li>
    <li> My hair is 2 inches past my callor bone, they wern&#x27;t long enought. also I put them in and they slide right back out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through that money away.........</li>
    <li> Not as pictured!!! These are not NARROW as stated in the title or picture! What a WASTE of time and money!!!! Just go to Sally&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I have not used them but they camejust as shown in the photo.</li>
    <li> These Curl Formers are GRRRRRRREAT! They are easy to use. Form great spiral curls. The hook could be constructed a little sturdier, but overall good buy!</li>
    <li> I have long hair, and bought the longest size and they still don&#x27;t fit from scalp to tip. I have to start them mid way down my hair. They&#x27;re hard to use, and if you have the tiniest bit too much hair in the curler it gets stuck.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to take out, which is nice and they left a good curl. Unfortunately, they were INCREDIBLY uncomfortable to sleep in, compared to sponge curlers. And the curls didn&#x27;t last until noon, and I took the curlers out at 8am (nothing to do with weather/what I was doing, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls to well....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy, and would not recommend to a friend. Save your money and time and use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I had a little trouble getting them in at first but after watching a couple of you tube videos i was amazed with how easy and fast they were to use.  I love them.</li>
    <li> They are made of excellent quality. They went beyond my expectation. I believe I will never have to replace this product because of the fine craftsmanship. The price blew my mind because at famous name brand stores, they wanted four times the amount of money for what I paid. I received so many compliments after using these. I would recommend these to anyone that want quick, beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> These work so so so so so well for cheerleading! They create perfect ringlets but I would never wear these curls to school</li>
    <li> I look at both the bad and good reviews.  The worst review was for poor shipping time.  I personally received mine in a matter of a couple days. Still trying to get the hang of these, but they do make lovely curls.</li>
    <li> These curl formers are awesome; I almost didn&#x27;t buy them because one of the reviews said that they were not the same quality as those at Sally&#x27;s... Turns out that they are (I bought an 8 pack at Sally&#x27;s because the 24 in this pack weren&#x27;t enough). On to the specifics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I originally saw these on YouTube being used on human-hair extensions, which is how I am also using them. There is no info as to the maximum length of hair you can use on the extra long curl formers; my hair is 10\\&quot;, 12\\&quot; and 14\\&quot;.  I would estimate that these could hold up to 20\\&quot;-22\\&quot; length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I too find that the curls are tight once they&#x27;re set, but it&#x27;s a good thing as they fall out slowly.  Also, instead of wearing them as they are, you can do as I do and spray the curls with an oil-free spray (or water) and lightly brush/comb the curls to have them as relaxed as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-These are a pain in the @$$ to use at first. Seriously. But, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of them by holding the opening open over the hook AND pushing the spiral up so that the bulk of hair can get through the opening without getting stuck (this WILL happen several times before you get the hang of them, lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have yet to figure out how to sleep comfortably with these. If any one else has, let me know. I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you are still interested in buying these buy you aren&#x27;t sure if you should get them online or at Sally&#x27;s, here&#x27;s the pricing from my local Sally&#x27;s (Miami)[same as their online prices]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *Online: 24 extra long + 2 hooks &#x3D; 30.98(no tax)&lt;br /&gt;  *Sally&#x27;s: 6 extra long (13.99)x 4&#x3D; 55.96 PLUS 2 hooks (4.29)x 2&#x3D; 8.58  Grand Total&#x3D; 64.54 (before tax)&lt;br /&gt;  *33.56 saved (before tax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;They advertise fast delivery from the US! They LIE. It&#x27;s coming straight from China which means you have to wait for a month to recieve your order. There are a ton of companies that sell the knock off curl formers, which I love, for a great price. I just really wish I paid attention to what amazon said the delivery time frame would be and not the great big sign that says FAST DELIVERY NOW FROM THE US! With that said, I can&#x27;t really comment on how their product works because it&#x27;ll be a few more weeks before I recieve it. Dang it!!!&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, we have some of knock off curlformers from a different manufacturer. They work extremely well. They are easy to put it. The girls don&#x27;t have a problem sleeping with them in their hair. There is a trick to this though. Give the hair about 2-3 inches of slack before the curler actually starts. I really wanted to put them in close to the scalp, that makes it uncomfortable to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the other product reviews were actually from this manufacture. These guys suck. :(</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it says, but the size of the curls for hair this length is just silly looking. I have rather long hair (my hair stuck out in a couple of curlers), and when I took them out after sleeping in them at night, the ringlets were just that, ringlets. They didn&#x27;t relax, and in fact, they ended up looking like dreads. I much prefer the foam curlers for heat-free styling. These probably work great for shorter hair, but for long hair, the curls shouldn&#x27;t be half as tight as these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on usage: for long hair, you have to keep the silicone opening held open to be able to pull your hair through with the hook, otherwise your hair gets stuck on the silicone and it&#x27;s rather painful! Sleeping is uncomfortable to say the least.</li>
    <li> Easy to work with once you get used to them.  Store easy&lt;br /&gt;Make really cute curls&lt;br /&gt;Using for cheerleading and makes my life a lot easier</li>
    <li> I loved them!!! As soon as I got them I tried them out...I&#x27;m in love.  Easy to put on and easy to take off</li>
    <li> ugh..do not buy these if you have fine hair!  I will gladly throw them away or take them to the thrift store.</li>
    <li> Giving them to my 9 year old niece for her birthday! They work just as advertised, take a look at instructions on YouTube.</li>
    <li> These are such a pain. Sometimes curl sucks other time curl was to tight. Plus my hair in some spots is longer tham 24&amp;#34; so I had 3&amp;#34; sticking out.</li>
    <li> Works great! Worth the money. Same as name brand but less money! very suprised at the awesome curls! Great for cheer dance or fun! Easy!</li>
    <li> great way to get curls when you want them without damage from perm or heat. mine will hold for 3-4days (then i like to wash :) ) i&#x27;ve tried it on three of my friends all with wonderful results. was nervous about price for something i&#x27;d never tried so i bought these good ones and against negative reviews also got the cheap cheap ones. they honestly work just as good although the hook in this pack is much better.</li>
