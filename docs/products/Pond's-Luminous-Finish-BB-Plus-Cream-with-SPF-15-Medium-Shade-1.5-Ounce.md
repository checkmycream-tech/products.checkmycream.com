<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite.It blends into my skin better than the others.</li>
    <li> All the other BB creams made my skin so oily, this one does not, because of that it can be a little harder to apply. But it lasts all day and is a good alternative to poor matching cakes foundations. Nice matte finish with a little more coverage than the average BB cream</li>
    <li> Too dark for my skin!</li>
    <li> I ordered Medium which is what I would normally wear in a BB.CC cream but color was a little dark &amp; had a funny tone/texture.  Not sure if that is the way it is or if the tube I had was maybe expired?</li>
    <li> I was shocked  and excited to find this in the discount bin at my local drug store. The primary reason I use a BB cream is to even out my skin tone and for quick mornings when I don&#x27;t have time to do a full foundation routine before work. The shade is matches nicely but the formula is too thin for my liking. After applying two layers of Ponds Luminous Finish BB cream it didn&#x27;t cancel out the redness in my face.  I will continue to use this product hopefully with time this product will grow on me.</li>
    <li> I tried the Garnier BB cream last year and I didn&#x27;t like the feel on the skin. I bought this one and the color is just perfect and it hides the imperfections on the skin. I had acne in my 20&#x27;s on the chin. I am very pale in the winter but as soon as I start gardening, I become more tanned. I am now in my 50&#x27;s and prefer to wear a light BB cream with a SPF 15 to a thick day cream or liquid foundation. I do recommend it! I looked for it in the department stores and drugstore; they didn&#x27;t have it. I will probably buy the other one (light skin) next winter. The smell is not overwhelming like the Garnier.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. I was skeptical at first. I really didn&#x27;t think that I would get great coverage, let alone that I could use it on my skin tone. I am biracial so my skin is slightly darker than medium. I was very impressed. Not only did it give me full coverage, but it also minimized the appearance of my enlarged pores and freckles. It gave me a flawless finish. I just needed finishing powder to set my makeup. I also love that it is a sunscreen. Over time it is supposed to improve the appearance of skin but I felt the effect immediately. I felt so pretty since I looked like I didn&#x27;t hardly have makeup on.</li>
    <li> At first I wasnt sure if I would like this product, but WOW!!! It is so lightweight and non greasy. I love how it balances my skin tone and Im super excited about the SPF coverage! I would totally recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle from influenster, but these are my opinions after trying it out. I always used BB cream, but a different brand. After using Ponds, I will not go back to my old brand. Ponds smells nice (I was pleasantly surprised!) and it goes on smoothly. I used the medium brand now because I still have a nice summer glow, but I also received a light shade which will come in handy in the winter when I look more pale! :)  I love that they offer a variety of shades.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream, I&#x27;ve usually use higher end bb creams, but I tried the ponds bb cream When I received for free to try from influenster and I fell In love! It&#x27;s so smooth and matches my skin tone perfectly. Absolutely love it! #pondsbb #infulenstervoxbox</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample of this in medium.  Blends perfectly on my olive skin tone.  Does it cover all imperfections?  No!  Does it even my skin tone? Yes.  Certain times of the month my skin will look blotchy, red spots, etc.  The Ponds BB cream does give me a more polished look and also radiates my skin, I go sans makeup a lot and feel more pulled together and fresh faced with this cream.</li>
    <li> I have long used tinted lotions instead of foundation or make-up.  My skin is fortunately pretty clear, so I just like having a little bit of something to even out my skin tone and to add a bit of glow.  Being Korean, I have heard of BB cream for a long time, but the types I could find in Asia were all too light for my skin tone.  I finally saw Clinique came out with a BB cream for duty-free shops, but again, still too light in color (and expensive).  I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream for a couple of months and have been fairly satisfied.  But then I received the Pond&#x27;s BB+ Cream in a Influenster Vox Box.  It&#x27;s a game changer.  First, I love that it has SPF protection in it.  I use regular face lotion that is SPF 20, so I don&#x27;t go without sunscreen, but it is nice to have an added layer of protection.  Second, it feels far thicker than the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream, but that&#x27;s ok--like I said, I use moisturizer anyway, so I don&#x27;t really need something that provides total moisture.  In fact, my combo skin likes the drier thicker Pond&#x27;s BB+ cream.  Also, the Pond&#x27;s BB+ cream does not go on thick.  It goes on super light and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I love the way my skin feels after putting on the BB+ cream.  And the color blends nicely.  The medium did look a bit dark, and I might have to shift to the light kind in the dead of winter when I am at my palest, but really, the cream evens out my skin tone perfectly and matches my skin well--no lines like foundation leaves if you&#x27;re not careful!  So easy, and I am officially converted to Pond&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> From the first application I love this BB, I&#x27;ve tried many bb creams.  This one blends  well with my skin tone, my skin absorbs it quickly and it moisturizes it leaving it soft and supple. It has not broken me out.  It&#x27;s very light and the coverage is good.  It smells nice, not an overpowering scent.  The finish is semi matte on my combination oily skin and a light dusting of translucent powder is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;  Now the packaging says you have to re apply every two hours but I don&#x27;t do that.  That&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this bb but that&#x27;s ok because it&#x27;s about the SPF and that&#x27;s why you have to re apply every two hours.&lt;br /&gt;  Other than that this bb it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I recieved a complimentary sample from Influenster.com. I have always been a foundation user and have never tried a BB cream before. I&#x27;m am a changed woman. My skin has never looked better. It gives all over coverage, and leaves a very even tone. It even works on my dark circles. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin and even makes it feel softer after. I love it and will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Ponds luminous BB cream is a great product. There are so many products out on the market it&#x27;s tough to tell which ones to try. Well I&#x27;m glad that I had the opportunity to try this product!!  It is an amazing cream and makes my skin look smooth and flawless. I hate the feel of having heavy makeup on this product is the opposite. You can&#x27;t even tell you have it on until you see what it does to your complexion. I have an olive tone to my skin and the medium color works wonderful with my skin color. My face feels moisturized and looks younger (honest) when I use ponds BB cream.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream and I have tried many of them. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is in search of a cream that isn&#x27;t heavy but still has great coverage with lots of benefits for your skin. Give Pond&#x27;s BB cream a try!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the new Pond&#x27;s BB+ cream that I received from Influenster.  What I loved was that I was given two different shades of color, which made it easier to determine my perfect shade.  I could even mix them if I needed, but the medium cream color was the best for my skin.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday as I work from home but when I do go out, then my Pond&#x27;s BB+ cream is what I apply first to my face.  It definately makes a difference in the feel of my skin and helps with the overall appearance.  Another thing I think is great is that it has sunscreen in the formula making it perfect to protect me from my local Florida sunshine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a cream before I tried ponds, but I&#x27;m hooked now. It leaves my skin almost flawless looking, soft and healthy. I&#x27;ll never not wear this again! I received this as part of my complimentary vox box!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used a BB+ cream and I love Pond&#x27;s.  The light shade is perfect for my skin AND it makes my complexion so uniform...super light too!</li>
    <li> This BB+ cream is the first one i&#x27;ve ever used and it was great! The coverage was amazing and the medium color was perfect for my *slighty* tanned summer skin! I&#x27;m sure I will be needing the light one in the winter months! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I got this for free in my MamaVoxBox from Influenster. I havent find any BB cream which suited my face till now But Ponds worked well. It goes on smooth, matches my skin tone very well, and I don&#x27;t even feel it when it&#x27;s on.It is not greesy and didnt make my face dry !! I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> The is one of the best bb creams I have tried.  I use it both allow with pressed powder or also as a primer.  Using it as a primer is my fav way to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a dense and creamy lotion with just enough tint to mask small skin imperfections.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and glides on smoothly; a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this as a base for my standard foundation instead of a primer.  While the coverage isn&#x27;t as opaque as I&#x27;d like when worn alone, it does work wonderfully as a primer or base.  At first, it irritated my rosacea (stinging skin is icky!) a bit, but after a few days, my skin calmed down and adjusted to it well.</li>
    <li> I was not familiar with this product before ordering it. Several women in my family have battled melanoma so I value using sunscreens. I was concerned at first that the cream felt thicker than other moisturizing sunscreens I have used, but it went on smoothly, felt light rather than thick when on, and evened out my skin tone so well that I do not use another liquid make-up over it. The medium shade is slightly too dark for me, but I plan to still use because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to research good vs. bad sunscreen ingredients only to get more confused the more I read. So far, the ingredients in this cream appear to be safe if used correctly. It protects against both UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one facial moisturizing cream with sunscreen that I can highly recommend to others and will continue to use as part of my daily skin routine. Pond&#x27;s has a winner with this one!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn any kind of product on my face in years. I received a sample of Ponds BB cream from Influenster for testing purposes. I was very pleased at how light the product was. It did a great job evening out my skin, and I really liked the matte finish I got. The only complaint I have is at the end of the day, it started to feel a bit greasy, but since my skin is normally oily, I figured this was just par for the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy having to use one product and get sunscreen and foundation together in one product. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved this bb cream. Makes my face glow and evens out my skin tone. I have not used a foundation since I got it from Influenster. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Gives an even finish and smells delicious. I was a little worried of the creamy texture but it dried matte and looked natural. This is now my go-to BB cream. Although I will say the price on amazon is a little more expensive than your local drug store.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample of Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Cream from the Influenster program. I was skeptical of it, to be honest. I like to limit the amount of products I use, especially ones that seem frivolous. But this is not frivolous. I can use it in the place of my regular make-up or in addition to it. It covers blemishes better than make-up, even concealer. It has a light, pleasant scent and is lighter and less greasy than most make-up. I often forget I&#x27;m wearing it. And as an added bonus, it has SPF 15.</li>
    <li> I received both the light and medium shade in a VoxBox from Influenster. With stuff like this I am usually the \\&quot;light/medium\\&quot; shade so at first I was mixing them together.  I found the Light to be almost invisible on me after the tone perfecting kicked in. After a week or so I got tired of mixing them together and started wearing just the medium alone and I realized it was ending up the same shade as mixing and this \\&quot;tone perfecting complex\\&quot; was actually working to match the shade of my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this is not very much coverage so if you&#x27;re looking for coverage I would not say this is for you. I have freckles (which I love) and they still showed through brightly which I was happy about BUT so did my under eye circles. I expected this as I have used BB creams before so I still had to use my under eye concealers and on days I needed fuller coverage I used my liquid foundation instead of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 things I absolutely loved --  1. Broad Spectrum SPF 15 included IN the BB cream. Not all my moisturizers have SPF in them and I like not having to worry about this. 2. The creamy texture. This blended and went on super easily which also made applying it fast. I now use this mainly in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to apply full makeup to go to the bus stop or to run errands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not dry me out and I barely felt like I had it on at all.</li>
    <li> I used the medium shade because I have a dark skin tone. I love that when you apply it, it&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s moist and gives your skin soft and smooth texture. It hides dark circles, dark spots and facial scars.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this BB Cream. The Medium shade is a nice match for my skin, and I&#x27;m happy with the light-to-medium coverage this product provides, especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry and just want to slap something on my face and run out the door. If you have severe skin imperfections, you&#x27;ll definitely want to use a concealer in conjunction with this product, but if you have fairly good skin, I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the coverage this product provides. My favorite things about this product are its natural-looking finish and its fantastic staying power (even in hot, humid weather). I also love that this product does not become cakey, even if you build for more coverage. I do wish that the SPF were higher for an all-in-one product (I prefer SPF30 or above).</li>
    <li> Second container of this, easy to apply for a nice light weight summer look.</li>
    <li> great i was so happy to find the item that has been discontinued in most stores in az .</li>
    <li> This cream is a little thick and I found the medium color to be a bit too dark.  I ended ordering a bottle of the light color and mix the two together to get the right color.</li>
    <li> Just ok - a bit too luminous for me and I have dry skin.  I would not buy if you have oil or even combo skin.</li>
    <li> The medium color is very dark. Definitely meant for olive skin tones. Also, the product doesn&#x27;t blend well. My skin absorbed it very fast and I would need to use a huge amount of it for even a light coverage.</li>
    <li> Nice amount of coverage while feeling light and almost nonexistent on the face.</li>
    <li> I love it it makes my skin look a bit even it doesnt feel cakey or look unnatural it complements my skin. I bought the medium and its the perfect shade.</li>
    <li> influester send me a ponds BB cream  first i wasnt sure and i tried and i like it i use everyday</li>
    <li> I received the Ponds BB cream in my mamavox box. I hate \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my face, why I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I LOVE this cream! It is so light and silky, I had no idea I had it on except my skin did feel and look luminous with the added bonus of having sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;‪#‎PONDSBB‬&lt;br /&gt;@InfluensterVox</li>
    <li> Well let me start of with I have been anxious to try a BB cream. Though with so many on the market and my sensitive/oily skin I was unaware of what brand to go with. When I received Pond&#x27;s BB cream I was so excited to try it. With my surprise it was amazing! It goes on smoothly with nice coverage. I still use my under eye concealer and cover my few blemishes but overall a great product. So you guys know my skin is very fair with a few reddish blemishes. This is one product that will be on my shopping list. Thanks Pond&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product from influenster and even though it was a free product, I promise this has been the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. It leaves a glowy look and it isn&#x27;t heavy, but provides a great coverage. I will definitely be purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I found this product to do everything it said &amp; more. I am a makeup &amp; skin care junkie. I have tried many of products  just to be disappointed, however after trying this product I will be using it time &amp; time again. Not only did I notice a bit of difference in my Dark spots just a week into using the product. I also notice a healthier difference in the feel of my skin. It not only did this all, but did it without caking or clogging my pores. One Happy Customer.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this cream and just love it. It is light and airy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy nor greasy on my face... Perfect for busy moms on the go!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product is SPF 15 and for protecting your face-- it&#x27;s hard to find good quality sunscreens that don&#x27;t make my skin greasy or break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream has a light feel to it, so it&#x27;s perfect for a casual look.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. The coverage is perfect. Not too heavy but evens out skin and mosturizes. Has that amazing light ponds scent to it. By far my absolute favorite BB Cream and I have tried SEVERAL.</li>
    <li> I really like this bb cream that being said the only thing I would change is that I have oily skin and it did not help. I wish it had something in it to help control oil. Other than that this stuff is awesome it makes my skin really soft and it also covers well and it can be layered and it don&#x27;t feel thick or look it either!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received Pond&#x27;s BB Cream in Light and Medium to try in the Influenster VoxBox.  I knew light was too light to I tried the medium which had a light floral scent.  Since I am dark-skinned, the medium was still too light,how I used the product is I mixed it with some too dark tinted moisturizer and it blended perfectly as so I did not need to wear my full coverage foundation and I can never not wear it because I have hyperpigmentation and it is all thanks to this BB cream.  I love how it looks like I have nothing on.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my review, but I must say that after several weeks of using the product I really like it.  I am using the medium shade and was initially afraid that it would not match my medium brown skin African American skin and make me look like my face was ashy.  I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used the product and it not only matched my skin alright, it also made my dark spots (acne scars) look less dark.  I cannot say for sure if it will fade them in the long-run, but for daily use it is lightweight and non-greasy despite the SPF in it.  I typically hate products with SPF due to the smell and feel on my skin, but neither of these are issues with this product.  Nice job Ponds!</li>
    <li> I recieved ponds luminous finish BB cream for testing purposes from influencer and totally love it. Its light goes on smooth has a great fresh scent since using it for two weeks my skin tone is more even then ever</li>
    <li> I received this bb cream complimentary to treat out in the #mamavoxbox from influenster.com. I love it for the days where I don&#x27;t want to put on a ton of makeup. It has a light coverage that evens out my skin and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I had heard many rave reviews over the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream and since I had been wanting to try it I ended up buy it. I loved it. However, when I heard that I would be able to try out the Ponds BB cream in Medium shade I figured why not. Well my \\&quot;Why not\\&quot; then turned into \\&quot;Hell yeah!\\&quot; I ended up loving it more than the one I purchased. Definitely a returning product in my make-up bag.</li>
    <li> I was given a tube of Pond&#x27;s Medium BB Cream courtesy of Influenster and I absolutely love it! It goes on smoothly and covers blemishes and skin spots evenly without that \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look. And my skin feels great! Pond&#x27;s, you created a winner!</li>
    <li> I am in love with Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB. I was lucky enough to get to try it for free from Influenster. It smells great, covers great and the texture is just right. If you haven&#x27;t tried it you really should. You will fall in love just as I did.</li>
    <li> I received POND&#x27;S BB+ cream as an item to review in my Influenster VoxBox. I had been wanting to try it for awhile, but was waiting to finish my \\&quot;other\\&quot; foundation first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, I decided to give it a shot right away and was pleasantly surprised to see (and feel) how great the texture was and how lightweight it felt on my skin! I don&#x27;t have horrible skin, but when I applied it those few blemishes seemed to vanish before my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious to see how great the coverage really was, I let my mother borrow it to see how it worked with her dark spots and she was left with seemingly flawless skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I received this in the #MamaVoxBox from Influenster. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone. Usually I wear Medium/Deep in BB creams. Hopefully they will offer a Deep shade in the future.</li>
    <li> Its okay I guess but although I have naturally tanned skin and usually use a medium shade, I think this cream is just a little too dark for me. Also its very shiny on skin so you definitely have to follow with some kind of powder. I gave this to someone away and I&#x27;ll try the lighter shade.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brand BB cream that I want to permanently keep in my makeup routine. I&#x27;ve searched high and low, and the search is over. Of all of the brands I&#x27;ve tried (about 4 total), the Pond&#x27;s is definitely my favorite. For me, it wasn&#x27;t greasy and didn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell. It blended evenly and matched my skin tone perfectly!</li>
    <li> I received this BB Cream in an Influenster box as a sample to try. They sent me both the light and the medium shade.  I gave my 16 year old daughter the light tube and decided to give the medium a try for myself.  I must admit that I have pretty much given up on make up, per se, the last 2 or 3 years, only wearing it when I was going out to a function, which was not that often.  This BB cream has changed that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent years trying to find the right foundation that would cover the dark spots caused by two pregnancies as well as give me a flawless finish without making it look like I had an inch of spackle on my face!  This BB cream is thick and luxurious coming out of the tube.  It moisturizes and glides on in just the right way.  I doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face or on your hands and when you use powder to set everything, you don&#x27;t look like you just threw flour on your wet face!  I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I can see that my coverage has lasted and even though I don&#x27;t wear that much makeup, I wear this BB cream along with a little liner and mascara and I feel pulled together and fresh faced.  If you are looking for a great alternative to mineral powder foundations, liquid foundations and heavy cake foundations, you should really consider this product.  You get a lot of bang for your buck and it is certainly a value in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where we can pay a lot for just a little, when it comes to beauty products, Ponds has given us an option where we get the best of both, quality and value!</li>
    <li> I have light skin and am very sun sensitive. The SPF in Pond&#x27;s BB cream protected me and the cream evened out my skin tone in less than two weeks. It has become a permanent fixture in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different brands of BB creams, mostly samples thrown in my bag at sephora. Some I love, some I like, some...not so much. I was hopeful that this brand would be one of my favorites since it is cheaper than some \\&quot;premium\\&quot; type brands. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the color was off. I didn&#x27;t take any stars away for that, since i may have just used the wrong one. I did take one away for the way it left my skin. Some BB creams are more like moisturizing foundation, and some lean more towards tinted moisturizer. I like the ones that leave my skin soft, yes, but also the tone evened out and a more matte finish. This one seemed to sink in more like moisturizer, and didn&#x27;t cover very much of my reddish areas or freckles. It also left sort of a shine (which I fixed with pressed powder...and needed to touch up throughout the workday.) No BB cream IS a foundation, but I don&#x27;t want to spend money on something that needs too many additional products. I did like the light feeling of it and the moisturizing benefits, but I still prefer the Tarte and Smashbox ones over this. They are about double or more the price though. Still, I seem to save a little on the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use as much concealer under those or powder over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a bad product at all. Nice price for a different type of product. I may try it again as the weather gets colder. Sometimes I need more moisture that time of year and this may be a good choice for then.</li>
    <li> The medium shade matched my tan complexion better than many BB Creams without looking ghostly. I like that the SPF is included but I&#x27;m not sure what a \\&quot;luminous finish\\&quot; really is. This is thicker than anticipated, leaving my skin dry looking, fine lines emphasized with a matte finish.. nothing luminous to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this would do better in warm weather when my skin tends to be oily. I didn&#x27;t use 14 days straight to see if it really faded spots.</li>
    <li> I recently recieved 2 bottles of this BB+ Cream thanks to Influenster! It feels great on my skin and leaves a really pretty.  It is not as much coverage as I would like but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the point of it.  I will be replacing my regular moisturizer with this!</li>
    <li> I have used many tinted moisturizers. I am very pleased with this. It is a light coverage but I use a concealer in areas of dark spots or blemishes then apply this. It&#x27;s thicker viscosity than most but still applies well and a minimal amount is needed. I am surprised how well it blends. There is no line at the jawline. It also feels like a powder finish you could go without wearing a finishing powder. It&#x27;s comparable to some very expensive brands I have used. Absolutely worth the price. I will continue to reorder</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very dark and as for luminous – well, not by my definition of luminous. Don&#x27;t really like anything about it but I acknowledge it&#x27;s a matter of taste</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay... I didn&#x27;t love it.  I&#x27;m usually right in the middle of medium with most other cosmetic brands, but this one was awfully dark on me still.  Also, it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing or smoothing.  It was a pretty mediocre finish.  Pond&#x27;s usually has better makeup products.  I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing about it was it didn&#x27;t seem to cause any breakouts after wearing for a few weeks.  But it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything positive for my skin, either.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  It wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I use this under my bare minerals powder and I get a beautiful airbrushed finish while taking great care of my skin. Just shared my secret with you all lol use it well.</li>
    <li> Great coverage with a nice sheen.  Feels light on the face.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Got it as a sample from Influensters MamaVoxBox. The medium shade blends in perfectly with my skin tone and is lightweight. This is a new part of my daily routine in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I covers well, feels light on your skin and smells amazing. Its now an everyday part of my beauty routine. Everyone has commented on how natural it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the medium coverage BB+ Cream (courtesy of Influenster) and it&#x27;s been amazing!  My skin looks even and smooth and the cream has blended my darker spots in so they are barely noticeable.  This cream has a perfect texture and applies evenly with a brush or makeup sponge.  It also has SPF 15 which is great for me since I live in south Florida! All in all - I will be sticking with this BB+ Cream from Pond&#x27;s - simply because it makes me look &amp; feel more beautiful.  :)</li>
    <li> I use this product. I really like the thickness of it. It covers really well, but it has to be re-applied very often. I use it with another cover up. All and all though I am pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> I loved the look and feel of this product! Unfortunately my skin is so sensitive 5 minutes was all I could bear to have it on. The scent is lovely!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I AM SOOOOO GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it! I was seriously a die hard fan for Smashbox&#x27;s BB Cream, until I TRIED THIS and hello! Awesome coverage, affordable, lightweight, and has a pleasant smell to it too! (Not too strong either)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, would definitely purchase!</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying I am not a makeup person, but I have been using the bb cream daily and love the way it makes my skin feel. I would have given it 5 stars but it does not seem to be doing anything to dark spots</li>
    <li> ponds bb cream is amazing it really light weight on the skin so it not so heavy like other bb creams i used in the past love this product i have dry skin and it works great</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about trying Ponds BB cream due to my Olive toned skin color. I was actually quite surprised at how well it blended into my skin. I normally have a very hard time at matching any foundation of concealer. If I used to much, it did have more of a red tint, so I just went light and even then was pleased with the coverage to my dark under eye circles. I also noticed that it did give my skin a nice smooth effect and made it in my opinion glow. I would recommend this to anyone that would like good coverage and hard to match skin tones.</li>
    <li> **I received a full-size container of this from @Influenster, but the opinions are my own!**  I have fair-to-medium skin tone and after having four kids, I have some ruddy spots that bother me. I&#x27;ve tried so many products to cover them and even my skin tone and either they are greasy, too expensive, or they irritate my skin. Ponds BB+ to the rescue! It&#x27;s non-greasy, does the job it should, my skin feels light and not greasy, and the product is affordable. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not only does it work great in actually improving my skin over the course of using it, but it provides me with a flawless finish when I&#x27;m wearing it. I can dump all of my overpriced foundations because this does the trick and provides sun protection on top of it! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great way to stay safe in the sun and look great while doing it!</li>
    <li> I tried out the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+ Cream with SPF 15 in Medium. At first I thought it would be too dark for my skin tone, I am usually a light beige in foundation, but it blended in easily and wasn&#x27;t noticeable. It stayed in place and I did touch up a little - the product says to keep reapplying - but I didn&#x27;t want my skin to feel too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 35 and don&#x27;t have any overly noticeable age spots or dark marks so I am not sure that the product lightened any of these areas, but it did leave my skin looking more even and smooth. Overall I enjoyed the product and will purchase it again for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review purposes but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my skin, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I used high end Bb cream and will continue using it. But on those days I don&#x27;t this will be what I wear</li>
    <li> I tried this product as part of the Influenster VoxBox. I was eager to try it as I&#x27;m not that familiar with BB creams; I&#x27;m more of a tinted moisturizer gal. When I squeezed the medium shade onto my finger, I did notice that it seemed very dark, especially considering how light the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade is, but when I blended it onto my face, the color wasn&#x27;t quite as dark as I feared. I do, however, agree with another reviewer that a medium-light shade would be nice. I like that the cream has an SPF in it as sunscreen is the one thing I always put on my face in the morning. Being new to the whole BB cream phenomena, I would have appreciated clearer directions; i.e. is this supposed to act as a moisturizer or do I still wash and moisturize my face as usual and then apply the cream? I applied it without my usual moisturizer and my skin did feel somewhat dry after the BB cream application dried. Next time I will try a light day cream with time to absorb before applying the BB cream to see if that helps. All in all, I did like that it gave me better coverage than most tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used while still not feeling like a heavy foundation.</li>
    <li> I received both the medium and light shades free from Influenster for testing purposes and in turn I provide honest feedback regarding the product.  That being said, I really like this cream.  It provides light all over coverage and it has visibly reduced the appearance of dark spots on my face over the last two weeks.  I have fair skin but tan well in the summer.  The medium color worked alone or with powder bronzer when I first started using the product.  Since the weather is cooling off and my tan is fading, I am mixing light with medium.  I assume that when I am full on pale in the winter, the light will be all I need.  Finally, and what I like best, is the luminous finish somehow makes my skin look better in pictures.  I will definitely be purchasing this over the holidays!</li>
    <li> i recieved this from @influenster in my #mamavoxbox i have to admit i really like this one! i usually just wear daily spf moisturizer, but since the winter is coming i was ready for a little color as well. well, this stuff really does smooth right in and feels like moisture all day!</li>
    <li> I was sent tbis product to review as a compliment from Influenster. I love  how it felt on my skin unfortunately I was sent the incorrect color. I am more of a dark than a medium, so it didnt blend well with my skin bjt I would love to try the dark to see if it works as good as it feels.</li>
    <li> As a person with very oily skin it is hard for me to find products that are lightweight yet offers a good amount of coverage; this bb cream has been the only thing I have found in the drugstore that fills those requirements. It is lightweight, creamy, blends into the skin very well, and wears like a dream. The color match for me is perfect, I wear the shade medium. I do feel that it does not wear for a long period of time, but I have gotten used to blotting and powdering so for me it was not an issue. It is a great BB Cream and I recommend it to not only young people with dry or oily skin,but also older people with aging skin; it will give you the best finish and you will look natural all day long.</li>
    <li> I have always had large pores, until i recieved a free trial of Ponds bB from Influenster for testing I had never been able to find a foundation to cover smoothly. I have had no breakouts or blemishes from using this cream and the medium matched my skin the closest any ever has. I really like the Ponds BB and will continue buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> I received Pond&#x27;s BB Cream from Influenster and immediately fell in love! It hydrates and conceals perfectly. My skin looks and feels amazing! I will never go back to regular foundation again!</li>
    <li> Good bb cream for a male up free look.  I&#x27;m 70 gasp and i.wear this almost every day.  It looks healthy clean and gives me enough polish and finisj to feel confident.  I like it better than the new bare minerals rescue cream and it&#x27;s one third the price.  Ponds is an old trusted name in cosmetics.  I recommend my most recent beauty secret.  One more thing I sometimes mix the medium and light together for a more made up non makeup kind of face.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and works great.  If you are looking for a BB cream I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a product to try out from INfluenster and am so happy I got it!! I used the medium seeing as I am of darker complexion and it is almost a perfect match. It felt light weight and evened out my skin coloring. All in all Im very happy with this product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Evens out my redness, feels light and powdery. Leaves my skin glowing all day. Works great highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I must say I love it! It gives great coverage with hardly any blending required on my part. It is quick and easy to apply. Would I buy this product? Absolutely. It is not very expensive compared to my MAC and and very convenient!</li>
    <li> I love this product. it goes on very smooth and covers great. I have oily skin and this holds up fairly well compared to other products and the price is right as well. Go get some now!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my new BFF Ponds Luminous Finish BB+! I was never one to use any type of liquid or cream foundations on my skin. I received a complementary tube of this magic and haven&#x27;t looked back since! It is the most wonderful product out there. BB+ is versatile and compliments my skin so well! I don&#x27;t ever have to leave the house again looking like a zombie! With five children and a chaotic morning I can apply BB+ and go! It moisturizes and gives me an even skin tone without streaking! I can also apply some mineral powder for an added touch! Just love that mornings are so quick and easy, thanks to Ponds BB+! I love it! Thank you! #PONDSBB @InfluensterVox&lt;br /&gt;Like ·</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+Cream is another BB cream (beauty balm) in my opinion. I use BB creams when I want a natural look on a daily basis. I usually use a BB cream when I am in a hurry to put on my makeup in 20 min or less. I like that the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+Cream is SPF 15 to help protect against everyday sun damage. I was discouraged that a dark color is not available and still don&#x27;t understand why. Because of this I was a bit hesitant to try even the medium color. But when I did I was pleasantly surprised. The medium tint was ok for my skin tone. I was able to easily blend the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+Cream, but only use a thin layer. If I applied too much, the medium tint was too light for me. I even tried the light color and came to the conclusion that I can use the light tint for slight highlighting. You have seen videos and pictures of me and my skin tone, I am not dark at all so if you are dark this would not be the BB cream for you. But if you are medium or olive to light skin tones, you can try the medium and light tints.</li>
    <li> Very seldom do I wear foundation for the simple reason I like to look nature as possible. At first I was reluctant to try Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15, medium shade. I applied a little to my skin and I was truly surprise!! It does not feel caked on like some expensive foundation I tried in the past and I love how it made my skin feel. I will definitely be wearing this product!!</li>
    <li> Ponds BB+ Cream is amazing. It matches my skin perfectly. (which is light by the way) It goes on smooth and light. It didnt dry out my skin. It doesnt leave not different color lines on you face. And it protects my skin from the sun. What more can you ask for in a compact. I love it. So I dont see myself using anyother brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using the new Ponds Luminous Finish BB+ cream for about 10 days, and am really liking it.  The medium shade is not too dark for my fair-ish skin tone.  It reduces the redness and gives me a more finished appearance.  I simply apply it over my everyday moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go!  Ponds BB+ is lightweight, absorbs quickly and provides SPF 15 for everyday sun protection. I&#x27;ll come back at a later time and update on whether my dark spots are fading.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product at a great price, and I&#x27;ve trusted the Ponds brand for years.  I grew up watching all the original \\&quot;Ponds Cold Cream\\&quot; commercials - it&#x27;s been around my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for testing from Influentser.com.  The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I purchased many other BB creams, and foundations in general and none of them have the coverage as this one. This PONDS BB cream blended in with my skin tone perfectly, and left it with a great shine. The color is true to what it is and works perfectly with sensitive skin, or even normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and it&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It does everything a bb is supposed to do for your skin.  It gives my skin a youthful glowy filter and feels so good when applied.  But just like many BB creams, it doesn&#x27;t not last long and I need to reapply.</li>
    <li> This BB cream has a very strong perfume scent to me. I don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s too overwhelming. The scent reminds me of an old lady&#x27;s perfume. Also, I find that this cream is thicker and heavier than my other BB cream that I use, L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and love that it&#x27;s not as greasy as other BB creams. Evens the tone of my face, takes away the red spots I may have but the coverage could be better, again not the worst. Worth a try and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love my new ponds bb cream medium that I received complimentary from influenster for testing. It goes on so smooth and works great with my regular face makeup. I definitely recommend this product to anyone. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am loving Pond&#x27;s BB cream! Tinted moisturizer and has an spf 15. My skin is even toned without all the heavy makeup. I received a sample free from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I received the light and medium in an Influenster box. My daughter and I both are using the medium to see how it works for us both.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an exact match to her skin tone, but a tad bit to light for me (we are African American) but I did manage to get it to blend in.&lt;br /&gt;We love it. My daughter had a few scars from acne when she was a teen and you could hardly see them. I have some discoloration and it was hardly noticeable. We have been using this for about a week now and the results are great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light...so it feels like you don&#x27;t have anything on but the results are great. I will continue to buy this because its working wonders for us both.</li>
    <li> I received the Pond&#x27;s Luminous BB Cream in the light and medium shade free through the Influenster vox box program. I tried them and I love the way they apply. This BB cream is easy to apply and has significant coverage for blemishes and over all tone correction. I also am pleased that it is spf 15. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great BB cream!</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s BB Cream has the right kind of feel. It gives me adequate coverage without the heavy feel of other makeups. My skin feels so smooth when I apply Pond&#x27;s Bb Cream. I have also noticed that after a long day I dont feel like my makeup is sliding off of my face.I have recieved so many comments about how smooth my skin looks! Love love love this product! It is always a plus that this includes SPF. Total package!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for the first time via testing, thanks to Influenster and Ponds! I can be picky when it comes to BB cream because i hate the feel of thick products. I was afraid I&#x27;d go around with my face sagging and oily. In fact the product is light and comes with special traits other then giving your skin a smooth even tone. I have as all older women do at this point in their life; aging skin. Which comes with dark spots, wrinkles, enlarged pores. Basically the package I never ordered, but can&#x27;t return! Then I recently discovered something from my daughter. Dark spots give off a more aged appearance than wrinkles. Why am I taking about dark spots again? Well it actually aided in treating my dark spots. Not only is it balancing my skin. It&#x27;s correcting other problems I thought I another product for. So many secrets in a small tube, It&#x27;s worth the five stars i&#x27;m giving it!</li>
    <li> i have used this product for just over a week and i have noticed a few different good changes, my skin tone is more even, i really needed that, i also noticed i have more moisture to my skin, i have had such dry skin on my face forever and my skin is getting more healthy, this product goes on so smooth and you dont have to use alot. i love it and plan on using it from now on</li>
    <li> I got this product to try and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by how well it seems to work (for me anyway). I use a mix of the light and medium to get the shade that works best for me. It goes on light and I barely feel it there. The sunscreen feature is a nice bonus too! Over all I am very happy with this cream and can&#x27;t wait to see what long term use will do for my skin :)</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with Pond&#x27;s new BB Cream in medium! It is amazing! The coverage is flawless and lasts all day. It is light weight and I really don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing makeup when i have it on. Run and get this!</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+Cream is the best bb creme for the money in my opinion. goes on smoothly and smells nice. I use BB creams when I want a natural look. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. I usually use a BB cream when I am in a hurry. I like that the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+Cream is SPF 15. That was a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> When trying this product I was looking for minimal coverage while still getting an airbrush look. Unfortunately I did not get those results. There was little airbrush effect and no coverage in an odd bad way.  The luminous effects it claims just came across rather oily to me. A few hours later my face was definitely oil looking and powder just made a goopy cakey mess.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like there is much to improve on at this point.</li>
    <li> I was using another brand (Garnier), but recieved this one in my #voxbox this month.  I have switched as the results were visible within a few days and this cream feels more light on my skin.  Texture is perfect and the packaging is slim.  Love, love this cream!</li>
    <li> Normally I get a Korean bb cream,which I love but there is only on color and it takes a while to ship it to me. I got this bb cream in a voxbox and fell in love! It&#x27;s thicker, it smells good and the coverage is perfect for me. I found my new daily make up!</li>
    <li> Influential sent me two colors of this wonderful BB product to sample.  I was surprisingly pleased!  I prefer my &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; cosmetics to be a very light finish and this definitely was as promised.  It wasn&#x27;t heavy, didn&#x27;t clog my pores or start a breakout.  After wearing it out in sun, I can confirm that the SPF works very well without feeling greasy.  My recommendation would be to get the light and medium shades for &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; complexions.  I mixed the two in the palm of my hand and it blended wonderfully.  With the price on this product and it&#x27;s performance abilities, I would highly recommend this for women of all ages.</li>
    <li> easy to apply, great scent, nice design for the bottle. I like the texture and color of the product. I love the feel of my skin after each use. Nice product to try.</li>
    <li> For most of my life I&#x27;ve fought oily skin and looked for makeup that would tone down a shiny nose, chin and forehead and give them a matt finish. I used to tell people that if I wore moisturizer at night my head would slide off the pillow! Then, what seemed like overnight, I reached \\&quot;a certain age\\&quot; and my skin became dry and I was suddenly seeking out moisturizers to make it look dewey and more youthful. I&#x27;ve tried a few other BB creams and some were better than others. What I like about this Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15 is that it has nice light and even coverage and is easy to apply. I wasn&#x27;t sure if the medium color would be too dark since I have fair skin, but it worked out fine, adding just a hint of color that looks natural. I think the light color might give my skin a pastry look like another brand did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wear a moisturizer under this cream or my skin feels too dry as is often the case with makeup that contains sunscreen. I like that this one has sunscreens added. I love the packaging and that the cream squeezes out of a tiny tip that makes it easy to regulate the amount of product used. I really dislike some of the other brands that have a brush built into the top. I think the brush collects bacteria if it isn&#x27;t washed out after each use and washing it wastes a lot of the product. (You don&#x27;t even want to think about what it looks like after a plane trip in with pressurized luggage.) Thank you, Ponds, for not using one of those brush tops! I really like the looks of the packaging. Good job, design team!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this cream is that it leaves my skin with a matt finish which looks a little dull. Since I like the product otherwise, I solved that problem with just a light dusting of a pink shimmery powder by Milani which is actually an eyeshadow. (It only takes a tiny amount on my cheeks and temples.) Oh, and I do use a cream blush with this makeup. I wish it had a more luminous finish, but there are enough other good things about it that I&#x27;ll purchase more when this tube is gone.ut there are enough other good things about it that I&#x27;ll purchase more when this tube is gone.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product. I am a regular purchaser.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 4 days, my skin looked great at first, but it was kind of itchy (too drying I assume).  On the fourth day I noticed 2 knots on my cheek.  I discontinued use and got a few more before they all cleared up.  I have learned to stick with hypoallergenic formulas.  If you have sensitive skin I&#x27;d suggest you find another bb cream.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15 is creamy and feels so silky. It is very easy to apply and goes on evenly. I think it looks great alone and don&#x27;t feel the need to apply powder over it. It feels great on my skin and think it is so much better than using most liquid foundations even if I do apply a moisturizer before hand. Perfect for everyday wear!</li>
    <li> Covers evenly and thicker than other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. Which means I&#x27;m using less product! Nice size tube of product too. Only wish this would reduce shine on my face. After some time, it makes my face very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product from Influenster to test</li>
    <li> I mean, it just glides onto my skin. So smooth and leaves my oily skin pretty nifty. Another good feature is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the shiny look. If anything, it removes it. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I remember the first time I heard about BB Cream and thinking, \\&quot;I need to try that!\\&quot; Then I did and it did absolutely nothing except make me break out. Buuuuut I still decided to give Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Cream a chance and I am so happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pond&#x27;s BB Cream is light enough that I can wear it when it&#x27;s warm out and moisturizes, so I can wear it when it&#x27;s cold as well. It blends well and covers most of red spots and the occasional odd skin discoloration that always seems to happen at the most inopportune time. I still use powder over the BB cream, but I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer or foundation (which always seems to make me break out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this product, as it works well with my finnicky skin and is a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a whole lot of makeup any more (did in my younger days), but I love this BB+ cream.  And the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cost three arms and two legs (like many BB creams I&#x27;ve seen) makes it fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the medium shade, just perfect for my skin.  The cream doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my facial skin and actually smooths out many of the imperfections.  So for me, this means that this will be a product on my make-up table from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shade to those who have very fair skin, I can find nothing wrong with this affordable product.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a cream of this type before and I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try one out.  This is just wonderful for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly and makes my face look so fresh and it glows.  I use a pressed powder over this and I find I don&#x27;t need to reapply my powder as much during the day.  My face stays looking great longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light, which is important to me as I seem to be a bit sensitive to overly scented things on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin and the medium shade works well.  I was afraid it might be too dark, but it blends in very well and looks great.  Overall, a very good product.</li>
    <li> Love, love!! Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Smooth and doesn&#x27;t cake-up. I have to mix the light and medium shades to get my color, but so worth it. The only down side is the it can not be locally for me. I have to order then pay shipping.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at a BB cream and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It went on like a light foundation and my skin did not react negatively to it.  Was happy I purchased!</li>
    <li> This skin cream is luminous, as it says, however this is the first medium that I have put on my face and it has been noticeably darker than my skin tone, even after rubbing it in. I have a reddish age spot on my face and this has done nothing to tone it down. In fact that spot and some others are not hidden as well as when I have used regular foundation. This also seems heavier /thicker than my regular foundation and it shows that heaviness when I am finished applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF protection seems to work well on moderately sunny days.&lt;br /&gt;The container itself seems a bit flimsy and thin.&lt;br /&gt;For those that like a thicker look to their makeup, this might serve them well.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. After reading the reviews, I thought it sounded great -- a bit more coverage, a bit creamier than other BB creams. I ordered the medium -- I am pretty fair being Irish and German with a little French in there for good measure. The Irish/German makes me quite fair with light blue eyes, the French gives me my medium dark brown hair and allows me to tan easily. At least that&#x27;s what I like to think. Anyway, the medium appeared dark, but blended in just fine with no line of demarcation at my harline or jawline. Other&#x27;s have said it was &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;. I found it a little greasy looking. I&#x27;m at the age where using powder over foundation does not make me look &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. It makes me look &amp;#34;embalmed&amp;#34;, so I did not powder over the BB cream. Probably a big mistake. I used a nice cream blush and I looked great when I left the house, and for about 2 hours after. Then, when I was at work, I looked in the bathroom mirror -- harsh lighting to be sure -- and boy did I look scary. The makeup was pretty blotchy looking and had a somewhat orangish cast to the parts that were still stuck to my face--basically on the jaw and upper cheekbones or the dryer areas of my skin. Let me say that my skin is not flakey-dry, its just that those areas aren&#x27;t as oily as my T-zone. The makeup did stay a bit in the T-zone, but did not look fresh just 2 hours later. I tried to blend it in with my fingers, but to no avail. Anything left had disappeared, so I managed to wipe away the blotches, but then I was left with just bare skin. Now the bare skin wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me, but the orangish blotches do. Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to make this work for me. I have tried many BB creams -- 2 Korean ones (too greyish in color for my complexion), The Body Shop (only comes in one color, works pretty good, lasts 4 to 6 hours) and Rimmel (my current favorite -- good color, good coverage, even wear for about 8 to 10 hrs.) So, another 11 bucks down the beautyhole for me.</li>
    <li> Too thick and hard to apply evenly. Returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several BB creams, from very inexpensive (Garnier, Missha) to higher end products.  This one is my favorite. It does what you expect a BB cream to do - provide SPF, moisturizer, and a slight tint. This color is arguably a bit too dark for me, I add a touch of moisturizer and the color is perfect. I use self-tanners in the summer time, so this shade will be perfect without the dilution of moisturizer. I am in my mid-50&#x27;s with very good skin - I attribute that to both genetics (I hit the genetic lottery!) and also absolutely FAITHFUL use of sunscreens due to my concern about both skin cancer and premature aging. The finish of this product is velvety, and although not perfectly matte, it&#x27;s pretty darned close. I have not been using this cream long enough to determine its &amp;#34;spot reduction&amp;#34; efficacy, and in truth, I doubt it does a good job at that - very few OTC products do. But I think my quest for finding the perfect daytime skin care product has come to an end.  This is **IT**!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this BB cream because the price is so reasonable in comparison to many others but I greatly disliked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an olive complexion with oily skin and I tend to break out easily.  This BB cream made my skin very oily and didn&#x27;t provide any type of coverage like other BB creams I have used.  It also smells like the old fashioned sunless tanning creams I used years ago.  I&#x27;m wondering if this would tan your skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin I would highly recommend the Tarte brand of BB tinted treatment 12 hour primer.  It keeps my skin matte and has no obnoxious smell.  If only the Tarte brand were as inexpensive as the Pond&#x27;s brand, I would be living the dream.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the medium shade first. It worked well, but I wanted to try the light too. I purchased it, and now just mix the two. If you do this, you can&#x27;t go wrong, color-wise, because you can just mix to any shade you like, which is perfect for the color changing needs of winter-to-summer skin. The product seems quite forgiving, honestly, so I think either color would work on many shades of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a full-coverage look, this is&#x27;n&#x27;t it, but if you are just looking for something to even out your skin tone a bit without a real \\&quot;made up\\&quot; look, this is perfect! It has a smooth consistency...goes on nicely and blends evenly, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and is just a very good product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if the \\&quot;dark spot corrector\\&quot; claim works or not, as I have not used it long enough to tell, but I figure, in addition to the above-mentioned attributes, it enhances the look of my skin, has sunscreen in it, and doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to breakout...anything else is pretty much a bonus. :)</li>
    <li> prefer loreal youyh bb crème</li>
    <li> Very nice b&amp;b cream. One of the best ones I used. Is not making my face oily, and this is a good thing. I have very dry skin, and most of the foundations are making my ski flake, but not this b&amp;b cream</li>
    <li> I received bb+ cream from @Influenster via their #mamavoxbox I have been using it now for almost a month and love it! It blends with my skin so well you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing it! I would highly recommend if your looking for an awesome foundation try Ponds BB+ cream!</li>
    <li> The best pond Luminous Finish BB Cream and love that it has SPF 15  i have used leaves skin soft and shinny love it.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised when I first tried the product. It was so light on my face it was like I was not wearing anything. I really love Ponds bb cream &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I had the great pleasure of being able to try and review Pond&#x27;s Lumious Finish BB+ Cream.  They claim it provides instant Luminous Coverage + Visible Dark Spot Reduction, with Tone Perfecting Complex and Broad Spectrum SPF 15 Sunscreen.  I tried the shade Medium.  The only cons I found were that it has a bit of a peachy tone to it instead of just a tan, and that it dries very quickly so you have to apply it fast!  Please keep in mind that I normally use powders so maybe I am just a bit too slow since I was a bit out of my realm.  I believe if I had applied it immediately after putting on my moisturizer it would have been fine.  The pros way out do the cons though!  As for the scent, it was very pleasant!  Coverage, very nice!!!! I have freckles and it covered them flawlessly without looking like you had an inch of foundation on trying to cover up something.  It blended in nicely and didn&#x27;t \\&quot;sit\\&quot; in any of my wrinkles.  It also gave my pores the appearance of being smaller.  It wasn&#x27;t greasy or drying.  It felt very light, and once dried you didn&#x27;t even feel like you were wearing a liquid foundation.  I give it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars due to the shade.  Unless you are a Umpa-Lumpa, I don&#x27;t think this is a natural color you will find on a human.  :)  Hint: To make it look less peachy I applied a light ivory shade of mineral powder over it and it fixed the shade nicely!!!  Plus it helped to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the foundation for an all day and all night flawless look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for the past couple of weeks. Very nice product, and feel great going on. Smooth and silky like when applying. It has decent coverage, especially for someone who doesn&#x27;t have dark acne blemishes. I, on the otherhand, do have oily skin and acne and shortly after applying I could feel that oily caky feeling... Its really hard to find something for oily skin types that covers blemishes and doesn&#x27;t feel thick and cake like. Needless to say, I still like the product but it has been thrown into my purse for those mornings I don&#x27;t have time to do a traditional makeup routine and just need to look presentable in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I hate foundations. BB Creams is an alternative for me. When Influenster sent me this Ponds BB Cream I immediately fell in love. It left my skin feeling and looking amazing. Everyone complimented me on how flawless my skin looked. The great thing about this product is its buildable. I didn&#x27;t even need to add a highlight. It was naturally luminescent. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a product that makes their skin look amazing. Oh btw I have dry skin, And this didnt show any of my patches!!</li>
    <li> I received Ponds BB Plus cream for free as part of a product box from Influenster.  I had never tried any BB Cream before so I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what it was going to be like.  I wear make up every day and I have to say I loved how light the BB cream was.  It covered my face and evened my skin tone but didn&#x27;t feel heavy like my normal foundation.  The coverage is flawless.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I have only worn it a handful of times.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of Western BB Creams and tend to think most are a waste of money. If you&#x27;re young and have great skin and only need a touch of color, they might be for you, but I&#x27;m approaching 40 and need a bit more from my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was somewhat shocked at how good this was. For a drugstore BB Cream, I was amazed. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much more than I&#x27;ve seen in other drugstore brands but the coverage and consistency are notably more substantial. This product also doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny or greasy like many other BB Creams do. I actually tested this against my Too Faced BB Cream (one on each side of my face) which sells for over 30 dollars and the coverage of the Pond&#x27;s was better! That&#x27;s impressive.</li>
    <li> I received this in my Mama VoxBox and really enjoyed the product.  It helps brighten up my face in the cold months.  While it doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage compared to other BB&#x27;s I have tried, for the price I think this is a win!</li>
    <li> I had never tried BB Cream before, but I was very excited to try it.  I had heard so many good things about it.  When I received a complementary Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15 for free from Influenster I was very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies very easily, and isn&#x27;t non greasy.  My ski tone is evening out very nicely.  It covers blemishes very well, and I&#x27;m a very happy with this product.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this bb cream. I have tried 2 others and this is the creamist and fits the best to my skin tone. I&#x27;m a light skinned black women and It does&#x27;nt my me look pale like other i have tried. great product!</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15 did an outstanding job of moisturizing, as well as evening out my skin tone without feeling greasy or sticky.  I would definitely use this as a daily product in my skincare regimen.  It is like a very lightweight foundation with plenty of moisturizing appeal.</li>
    <li> I received this in my MamaVoxBox from Influenster to try. It&#x27;s very light weight and blend out easy. No greasy feeling and nice smell. I used this as more of a highlight because it only comes in lighter shades. Wish it came in darker shades to cover different skin tones.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is phenomenal!! I have replaced my Mary Kay foundation with this product. It is inexpensive and has a pretty smell to it. It completely covers all of my blemishes and any imperfections that I may have. I usually finish it off with some loose Mary Kay powder and it finishes nicely. I will continue to use this product again and again. I love it so much!!!!! Thank you Influenster for providing me with this free product!!</li>
    <li> I take it that &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; stands for &amp;#34;beauty balm,&amp;#34; but whatever it stands for, this is a great idea.  It&#x27;s a combination product - sunscreen, mild cover-up, moisturizer, and spot reducer.  It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all, and results in smoother looking skin.  I had my family test it, and they report that they love the light feel of it, and think it&#x27;s great for going out in the sun, when you might not want to wear heavy makeup, but just want a combination of sunscreen and the smooth polished look that this cream produces.  (We weren&#x27;t able to test the spot reduction, but the product also advertises that it reduces dark spots over the course a few weeks.)  Strongly recommended by our whole family.</li>
    <li> I wear this every day.  It works great and offers good sun protection.</li>
    <li> Shade: (1-5) 1; &amp;#34;Darker&amp;#34; than normal medium shade&lt;br /&gt;Oiliness: (1-5) 3; takes a bit more effort to get it off&lt;br /&gt;Weight: (1-5) 1; a bit heavier than I&#x27;d hope it to be&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts (1-5) 1; Had lots of breakouts when I first started using this brand so... not for sensitive skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;s for both BB and CC creams.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m personally using this as a shadowing or sculpturing before I put other medium shade on; under the cheek bone both sides of the nose and such. (did not want to waste by throwing it away.)&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal tan all over your body, this would be a fine shade but I would not use this alone or as a finishing BB cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff would probably fly off shelves if it were sold at mainstream drug stores and Pond&#x27;s did some marketing. It&#x27;s a great BB cream, especially for summer time when you don&#x27;t want to layer on makeup. It leaves a great dewy finish, but it probably needs touch ups after about 6-8 hours of wear. The color match is pretty good and it&#x27;s very blendable. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of it on my skin and is as good quality wise as some more expensive ones that I&#x27;ve purchased. The only problem is that it is one shade too dark on my skin, so I will have to go a shade lighter than I normally do. Otherwise the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and covers minor imperfections,  skin feels great.  Great for normal skin.  Not oily. It does have a little scent to it.</li>
    <li> Blended on skin very well, pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, makes my skin glow. Just wish it would last longer.</li>
    <li> GREATEST BB CREAM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. It leaves the skin so soft and so natural looking with great coverage</li>
    <li> My biggest gripe about this product is that it comes in only 2 shades and doesn&#x27;t blend to match your skin (like many bb/cc creams that are made in Asia). I am a NC30-35 and find the Medium too dark and Light too light. I had to return these. Otherwise, I love Ponds and have been a consumer for almost 4 years now. The cream itself is very light and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I have oily skin, sensitive, and prone to breakouts. Like all Ponds items, this one does have a scent that lingers with the product. The tint is medium coverage as oppose to the usual sheer tone of many American bb creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, unfortunately, I returned these before I could see results. I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to walk around with a too bronzed face or a ghost face. However, the coverage is good for a bb cream and it makes your skin look dewy and and feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you are accustomed to Ponds, like the scent, and have matching skin tone. Otherwise, you should purchase Japanese or Korean brands online and hope that they have your skin tone.</li>
    <li> This caused me to break out immediately so I stopped using.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Not as much matte as I expected.</li>
    <li> This goes on smoothly and evenly. Has a pleasant light sent. I used the medium. Is enough coverage to get out o the house fast. I got it as a free sample from influenster and i will be buying it again soon!&lt;br /&gt;#influenester</li>
    <li> I love using my Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+ Cream on a daily basis! It gives me the flawless finish I love! I also love the fact that it also tightens my skin! (I&#x27;m not quite 30 yet, but I&#x27;ve had dramatic weightloss/gain with pregnacies)Another reason to love Pond&#x27;s BB+ cream is that it gives you a controlled squirt-the product doesn&#x27;t squirt out all over the place and the dispensing hole is small to help you control how much you need.</li>
    <li> When I received this tester from Influenster in my MamaVoxBox, I didn&#x27;t even know what BB cream was! BB cream is supposed to eliminate steps out of your daily routine by replacing moisturizer, concealer and foundation. As a working mom with two small children, I can always use more time and fewer steps!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Ponds BB+ was how smooth and creamy it was. It felt great and blended very nicely. I did need powder over the top to make it feel like a finished product, but I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cover as completely as concealer with foundation, but is very good light coverage and wonderful at making skin appear to be an even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this daily in the morning and then after my lunch time workout. I am a huge fan and will be purchasing Ponds BB+ cream in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be alarmed by how dark the medium cream appears, it goes on lighter and blends really well. The light was too light for my complexion, but the medium is perfect (and normally I range on the lighter side of makeup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Covers well, blends, feels great on skin, versatile, easy to take on the go, SAVES TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Needs a powder to look finished, appears darker in tube which could make someone by a shade that is too light.</li>
    <li> I received Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Cream in Medium in an Influenster VoxBox to test out for free.  I was pretty impressed with the coverage.  At first I was worried the medium would be too dark, but it was a really awesome shade for me, as it blends right in with my skin.  The cream itself isn&#x27;t heavy feeling and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, which is important.  It adds a nice glow to my skin, and covered up the redness I tend to get on my cheeks.  The only con I have is that the cream is fragranced, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of makeup but when I received the #PondsBB cream in the @InfluensterVox Box I thought I would give it s shot.  I love how light it feels and how easy it is to apply.  I also love the fact that it has SPF 15 in it!  The one thing I dislike about this product is the smell...reminds me of a tanning bed smell..</li>
    <li> POND&#x27;S Luminous Finish BB+ provides my skin with a refreshing feeling as well as a more evenly toned skin balance. Imperfections are concealed and the cream works to target dark spots on the skin&#x27;s surface by fading them over time.</li>
    <li> I have had the worst luck with anything on my face for years and years and now with #pondsBB I can actually use something that does not break out my face and helps cover the imperfections that I do have.  It is light and not greasy. A must have for daily routine!</li>
    <li> I have never used any type of foundation in my daily makeup routine but when o received this from Influenster (strictly for reviewing purposes) I was excited to try! The creamy texture fully covers and instantly hides my blemishes. I love the light weight feel and it last all day.</li>
    <li> I recently tested Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream in a medium shade as a sample from Influenster.  I had heard of BB Creams, but wasn&#x27;t familiar with them.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item if it weren&#x27;t for receiving the complementary sample, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I am hooked!  Unlike other foundations, Pond&#x27;s BB Cream is easy to apply (similar to a lotion and doesn&#x27;t streak) and I love that it has SPF 15 in it.  No need to apply a secondary sunscreen!  I highly recommend this item</li>
    <li> I  received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I used this cream the first day I got it, right after I washed my face. I used this in place of my normal foundation and I found it to be a nice substitute. I did need to use a setting powder over the top, only to minimize the oiliness. Overall, it blended well and hid most flaws. I will definately be using this product often.</li>
    <li> Goes great with my skin tone. Light weight and easy to apply. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up but this is my go-to BB cream to make my skin look flawless and glowing.</li>
    <li> I have been using the medium shade, and I find the product to be okay.  I do wear foundation, and on days that I don&#x27;t want to wear it, using this cream does an okay job of not making look bleak!! I like putting it on under my make up, but I wouldn&#x27;t really use it alone.</li>
    <li> I received the Ponds BB cream from #influenster in their #mamavoxbox as a sample. I was a little hesitant to try it but when I did it was pretty amazing. It covered pretty well and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to put on extra make up. I really enjoy using this product. The medium shade is good when you have a slight tan. I recommend this product for the uva and uvb coverage.</li>
    <li> She said it made her face feel oily and unclean after using this product several times. Our bathroom has too many face and hair products to even get into. Half is junk that we need to go through and dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the first on the list.</li>
    <li> I am a make up NUT and bb creams are some of my favorite because they are combining a ton of things I use anyway in one - which saves me time and money.  Ponds has outdone themselves - just when I think ponds is not keeping up with the latest and greatest - they come up with this . . . I love ponds products but was waiting for the new beauty obsessions to be produce by one of the top classic skin care producers - and they did not let me down!!!  MUST have for all ages . . . MUST try - will definitely buy over and over!  Thank you ponds for an awesome product.  I got my sample from mamavox which ROX!!!  Love Influenster - its the best!!!</li>
    <li> The only thing that I like about this product is the packaging. Other than that, I don&#x27;t like it. It doesn&#x27;t remove the dark spots like it said, and it made my face look dull and dry. I was not impressed and wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Save time and money with Pond&#x27;s BB Cream, it contains  4 beauty products in 1 easy to apply cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains:&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURIZER- Brightens and hydrates with lightweight moisture&lt;br /&gt;COVERAGE-  coverage of imperfections and superior* visible dark spot reduction&lt;br /&gt;LUMINATION - designed to immediately conceal imperfections ,  gives airbrushed look&lt;br /&gt;SUNSCREEN- SPF 15 protects against harmful UVA/UVB rays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic ( will not block pores)&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for young ladies delicate complection</li>
    <li> I thought this product worked great. It felt thick when it first came out of the tube when applied to a smooth finish. I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had it on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product through Influenster but have since become an avid user.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster, I was able to try Pond&#x27;s BB+Cream. I was a little skeptical since they only offer a light and medium shade, and I&#x27;m African-American. I tried the medium and thought that it was okay. I wish it was a little darker though. I liked the fact that it contained an SPF since I usually don&#x27;t put on a sunscreen. The coverage was ok. It did even out the tone some. Since I tend not to wear alot of makeup, this is something easy that I can apply everyday and it has a nice, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Very blendable - mix the medium and the light together to get the perfect shade.</li>
    <li> The color match is perfect for me. Medium color coverage. However, it hardly covers any imperfections. It could serve as a moisturizer though. Even though it&#x27;s tinted, it didn&#x27;t even serve as a fair coverage for me. I would much rather use another, less oilier, and healthy facial moisturizer than this BB cream to moisturize my face. If this was used as a moisturizer, it would be too oily for me. I have combination, T-zone, skin. After applying this, I would have to wear make-up to have any coverage. Compared to my other BB/CC creams, this is by far, the lowest ranked of the bunch. The tube is nicely shaped, thin enough to nicely carry it for travel. It squeezes out a thin nice noodle-like shape. Its cap closes nicely with just a half-twist. The exterior is nicely made with sleek colors. Those are the pluses to my review of this product.</li>
    <li> I have the medium shade and it covers beautifully for a reasonable price.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> Does not suit my type of skin it makes me break out. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture. Smell not so much. Cream is medium thick. I am already dark skinned. So. Tinting is not so noticeable difference. Made my face soft. I didn&#x27;t have to apply it much often because, weather was gloomy in Northwest pretty much everyday except sunrise and sunset.</li>
    <li> I really do love this cream, I don&#x27;t have alot of things to cover up so this is a nice lightweight cover cream. It has a smooth feel to it and goes on well. I would recommend it highly but then again I don&#x27;t think I have ever had a bad product from Ponds.</li>
    <li> The medium shade is too dark for my skin.  I ended up discarding it.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try in Walmart to see if the light shade would work</li>
    <li> My favorite so far and I&#x27;m 44 so I&#x27;ve been far!</li>
    <li> I bought the medium shade like I always buy other BB creams. This &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; is so dark that look ridiculous to have it on. I used only once. waste my $$</li>
    <li> Meets expectations very much satisfied</li>
    <li> This my favorite BB cream. I goes on like liquid silk. The color is great, lightweight, blends great and looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Good coverage for me.  Lasts about 8 hours.  Bonus is that it is so cheap!  Just doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  Goodbye Tarte BB cream.</li>
    <li> Color matched well however after two days of use my skin broke out. Unsure if I will repurchase item.</li>
    <li> I tried this BB cream since the two I use in the summer on my combination to oily skin are great in the summer when you sweat. But in the winter, they don&#x27;t have enough moisture for the heat being on. So I though this would be great for me with all the reviews. I am like another user that broke out badly around the jawline, as well as with a welt on my chin and acne on my right cheek within 2 uses. My skin is clearing up with not using this any longer. The color (medium) comes out very dark but it seemed to blend ok on my light (but not super light) skin.  All in all, I would never use again due to the breakouts, but with the ratings, it still would be worth a try for you.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product and was disappointed in the overall texture, blending ability (how well absorbed into skin), and the overall shade (medium) was 2 shades darker than expected.  I am a combination skin type (oily, neutral, and dry) and usually wear a fair-medium shade but in the summer I have darker skin that requires a darker, medium color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Avon&#x27;s BB cream much better because it is the correct shade, it blends into the skin easier, and it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> BB creams are notorious for giving me acne, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it. I never broke out from it after months of use! I do agree with others that the color is a bit too dark so I mixed it with a lighter shade. I wear it almost every day when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing make up!</li>
    <li> The product is ok but why does&#x27;nt Ponds offer more shades? I&#x27;m a cinnamon toned woman and though your product is ok it&#x27;s still to light for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> definitely one of the better foundation/bb creams i have ever used, ESPECIALLY for medium or tanned skin tones.</li>
    <li> I use this over moisturizer and has a nice tint that helps to cover  blemishes on the skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product complimentary for testing through Influenster in my MamaVoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon squeezing out, the product appears to be a bit darker than I am used to (I have medium skin, Asian descent). As I blended it in though, it provided nice coverage, had a nice scent, evened out my skin tone, and dried matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried BB cream but ever since they came out I have been wanting to try it. I guess I am impressed by this, and am considering ditching my foundation to wear this on a day to day basis instead.</li>
    <li> I the type of person oh needs a good amount of coverage because I have a lot of redness and bb creams don&#x27;t really cut it for me, however this bb cream was the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  I still need a little foundation and concealer to help with coverage but this cream makes a perfect base, really smooths everything out and helps so I don&#x27;t have to use as much foundation.  I also love the skin benefits, it suppose to help reduce dark spots over time and I really do trust the ponds brand so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing results!  I received this from Influenster for trying and giving my honest opinion!</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive/combination skin. I&#x27;ve been testing out a few BB cream brands for quite some time now. I was a little hesitant when I opened the Ponds BB cream product as to the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; shade seem quite darker than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried and it also seemed a bit thick. Although after face application I noticed how it blended so well w/my complexion &amp; wasn&#x27;t as thick as it appeared from a bottle swatch. In fact it was very smooth, had decent coverage, a light pleasant scent, long-lasting &amp; gave me such a beautiful glow. To top it off the fiancé (w/no information given) complimented me on how I seemed to be glowing &amp; how I looked like I was ready to take on the world! Trust me when I say he&#x27;s never noticed a change when I&#x27;d use other BB creams so this was an amazing discovery. I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time now &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed any break-outs, excessive oiliness (through-out the day) or sensitivity. If it continues to give me such wonderful results this may just be my holy grail item! I highly recommend this product for anyone in the market for a close to natural everyday look! I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received a complementary Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+ Cream from Influenster and have used it for a little over two weeks. I have never used any other BB cream, but I like using this product for multiple reasons. First, it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t require a lot for good coverage of my face. Second, when I&#x27;ve used it my skin tone looks even (without darker spots). It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking \\&quot;made up\\&quot; - it simply looks even in tone. Third, I love that there is SPF in a product that provides good coverage. I definitely suggest that others try this product, and I will be purchasing more when my complementary product runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this! It goes on light and creamy, I can feel my skin just soaking up the moisture it provides, and added bonus SPF 15! Perfect light makeup!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Sometimes i dont feel like putting on makeup but i just put this on and its all i need. Love the little bit of color it gives you</li>
    <li> I love the creamy consistency of this BB Cream! It is creamier than most of the drug store brands and leaves the skin with a radiant finish. This is sold in shades and the cream is actually colored unlike others that start off white and than change color on your face. This one does blend in well, I would not recommend this to those with oilier skin as it doesn&#x27;t have a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and it works great. This is a nice smooth cream that for me, works very well under my face powder. It leaves my skin nice and smooth and works great with my other make-up products. The medium shade is a little dark but it does blend well enough not to be a noticeable difference with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products as a base make-up under my regular face powder and this works as well as some of the better ones I have tried. I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time putting on make-up and I&#x27;ve found that this with my powder and regular blush works very well for me for a quick and easy make-up routine. I&#x27;ve not had any break outs from this BB cream and it does even out my skin tone very well. The Luminous Finish also contains SPF 15 making it a good choice for daytime wear.</li>
    <li> this is my new must have and go to product... being A MOM of teens and living in the dessert I need a product that is both effective and easy to use and I have found it, plus its so light weight that its like having nothing at all  making me fell so natural ...thanks to influester for sending me this aawesome product  with my MomaVoBox</li>
    <li> I got this item from an influester box and it was my favorite product in the box!! I&#x27;ve already blown through the tube they sent me and bought more! It leave a smooth clean feeling on my face versus the sticky sometimes makeupy feel other products do. I like that this product is so easy to apply I just rub it on like any face lotion and go I&#x27;m done! it gives just enough to even out tone but doesn&#x27;t cover heavy if you are one that has lots of scars or acne.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. I was lucky enough to receive it through influenster to try for free. It covers evenly, looks great, and matches my skin perfect! I have told ever girl I know to try it out!</li>
    <li> I recently received this courtesy of influenster in my MamaVoxBox and now use it in my everyday make up regiment. it goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and helps my face look smooth and flawless. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of drug store makeup products I figured you get what you pay for but after using this for the past 3 weeks I have formed a new opinion especially about ponds products, low on price high on quality.[[ASIN:B00D6EDGZI Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15, Medium Shade, 1.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> recieved the ponds luminous finish bb+ cream..like it in the medium tone..shared the light with my mother and she loved it</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in my Mama Vox Box from influenster and I actually like it as much as if not more than th current BB Cream I use I also love the smell and how easy and smooth it is to apply.</li>
    <li> I never used BB Cream despite my best friend telling me I should!  I am not much for make or skin care (although I should be doing better with the latter).  I got two of these Ponds BB Cream products complementary in my #MamaVoxBox and I gave them a try.  The medium was better for my skin tone but I have to say that this is a great product.  I did not have to use much, had great coverage and felt light and barely there!  I would recommend this product to others looking for a quality BB Cream!  Thank you Influenster and Ponds for the chance to test and review this product!</li>
    <li> For context, I have dry flaky skin that is also sensitive acne prone so I tend to look for foundations that are oil free and provide medium coverage.  This is my first experience with a BB Cream.  Similarly, I tried [[ASIN:B00BY56U7C Smashbox Camera Ready CC Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Dark Spot Correcting Light/Medium 1 oz]] but wasn&#x27;t a fan because it felt a little heavy for my taste and was difficult to blend into my skin unless I used primer first, defeating the purpose of a cream that is all-in-one.  I also didn&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t quite blend into the skin and made it way too obvious I was wearing makeup.  I much preferred this product.  With my acne prone skin I love that it is non-comedogenic and hypo-allergenic and that it claims to improve the quality of your skin.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed any improvements in the quality of my skin but it didn&#x27;t exacerbate my acne or redness, which was a plus.  I also found the amount of coverage sufficient.  It seemed to cover subtle skin imperfections though I still need to use concealer for acne scars and blemishes, but this is true when I use regular foundation as well.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the texture of this product.  It is very cream-like and I tend to prefer something that feels thinner like a lightweight moisturizer.  (Texture-wise, [[ASIN:B007XCCGWS Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20 Nude 1 oz]] is my favorite and on-par with the level of coverage.)  It just felt too creamy to me and not as hydrating as tinted moisturizers.  However, this is a personal preference and I could see this texture being very appealing to someone else.  Overall, though I think it is a good product and would be well liked by someone who likes a creamier foundational alternative.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has raved about BB creams for the last year, so when this product came up for review I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. My expectations were pretty conservative: basically I just wanted a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen so I could apply one product instead of my usual two (moisturizer plus foundation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to use a greater volume than I would moisturizer to get the same moisturizing effects. This makes sense, I guess, given the extra ingredients that supply color, but the amount I need to feel moisturized leaves me with a bit more coverage than I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More seriously, this doesn&#x27;t feel good on my skin. While, admittedly, I have difficult skin (sensitive and at times oily, at times dry), no product should cause redness. I&#x27;m not exaggerating; I don&#x27;t need blush when I wear this because my cheeks are so pink from the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, not the product for me, and anyone else with sensitive skin should stay away.</li>
    <li> I like using it when I run because it is lightweight, moisturizes and protects from the sun. The only problem I have with it is that it smells like when you are by a person who smokes electronic cigarettes.</li>
    <li> I am not a die-hard makeup user. I really only wear it occasionally. I loved that with the BB+ Cream, it acts like a concealer while moisturizing your skin. It is long-lasting and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I can wear this with some eye liner, mascara, and it&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup feeling heavy. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Great acne scar coverage, and it is moisturizing, but still a shade too light for my skin tone.  Overall I would recommend it for the correct skin tone.  It&#x27;s great.  I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> My grandmother swore by Pond&#x27;s products.  They still make a great product.</li>
    <li> The coverage is good if you already have nice skin.  I found this product to be semi oily.  Never fully drying.  Feels a little slippery.  I don&#x27;t like that.  May work if you have very dry skin.  The color adjusts nicely.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again though because of the oily texture.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and so affordable. It goes on smoothly and has sun protection.</li>
    <li> This is my first BB cream so I cannot compare to other products, but review on the internet lead me to this. I have a light complexion but got the medium shade because I had tried on a light shade of another brand and it was way too light so I was afraid of the same situation. This is perfect. It is a good substitution for your other foundation because of it&#x27;s light coverage for summer heat (less melting), it contains sunscreen, and it is luminous but not in a shimmery way. I guess I have not used it long enough to see my sun or age spots vanish or substantially lighten. A little goes a long way. You can use you fingertips or a foundation brush and get the same result. If you are trying to cover a lot of flaws, I would not recommend a BB cream. It is nice for light coverage or use is hot weather. I am glad I got this one - I like it.</li>
    <li> Amazing BB cream! I finally found what I was looking for. Good coverage. I use a little of concealer on my dark spots and that&#x27;s it. Very natural look. Doesn&#x27;t sit on fine lines unlike foundations. Mate finish. Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up often but this is very light weight. It also fit my skin perfectly. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using BB cream. For the price, this is great stuff! I usually only wear makeup 2-3 times a week. To add lotion, sometimes concealer, then foundation, then powder and maybe blush seems like a lot! With Pond&#x27;s BB cream - it eliminates all those steps to 1. Feels great on my face and provides sunscreen plus just enough coverage. A+ in my book!</li>
    <li> Ponds BB+ Cream has replaced my moisturizer, foundation and powder.  I only need to use this one product for all three of the other products.  I have sensitive skin too, and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all .  I use it every day. Ponds BB+ Cream was sent to me complimentary from influenster for review purposes.  But I love it and would never endorse anything I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup/lotion user. I loved how evenly this product applied (even though the tint scared me). If I were more of a beauty product user, I&#x27;d be all over this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I used to wear foundation daily and just got so tired of applying it and wearing it. As a busy mom, I need something that can moisturize, provide coverage, and includes sunscreen. This is the product I&#x27;ve been waiting for! I received this complimentary sample in my Influenster MamaVoxBox and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now. I have definitely noticed a change in my skin. Even without anything on my face it appears more clear and even toned. I think the coverage is great for everyday, although I still need a touch of concealer here and there for more special occasions. The medium color is perfect for my end-of-summer fading tan. I will be switching to the light in a few weeks, most likely. I even love the scent of this product. It&#x27;s light and fresh. I love this stuff and I would definitely purchase it in the future!</li>
    <li> I received this BB cream as well as the light complimentary from Influenster and I was skeptical at first because I have not been a fan of too many BB creams so far. This has changed my mind. Most bb creams are essentially a tinted moisturizer. Not this. This smoothed my complexion and provided enough coverage that I felt comfortable running errands with minimal makeup. It was very natural looking with a beautiful finish. I did mix it with the light a bit as I am too dark for light but too light for medium. I highly recommend this BB cream and will purchase. In fact, I did purchase for my mother. Try it!</li>
    <li> I got the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB+ 15 SPF in both light and medium free from the Influenster Program. I like it for how good it was when it came to moisturizing. I preferred the light one to the medium because the medium made my face look too dark. The cream helped moisturize but not something I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other BB creams but this one by far is my favorite. It covers well and feels great. I have found my new BB cream!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for something to make my make up application a bit faster and a little better. I have to say that I&#x27;m one step closer with this BB+ Cream. Not only is it easy to apply but it&#x27;s a quick process. The cream blends out nicely though it doesn&#x27;t cover much. But it still gives me a nice smooth surface to work with. It also doesn&#x27;t accentuate the problem dry patches that I have. This really does moisturize. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with this product! I never buy into gimiky (sp) stuff and rarely branch out and try a new product but thanks to Influenster I got a complementary bottle! I will never need aanother facial base. It literally makes me glow but I don&#x27;t look oily. I had a light brush of powder over top for when I&#x27;m at work and I look like a porcelain doll. MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> One thing I LOVE about this is the matte finish. Any girl with an oil control problem out there should at least give it a try if they don&#x27;t like the shiny look. Now despite my love of the matte finish, the reason I took off one star is because it definitely does not last all day. However, compared to the usual 30 minutes that anything matte lasts on my face - including foundation, it does a wonderful job. I would say that indoors/in cool weather it lasts 3-4 hours. In the heat it pretty much doesn&#x27;t stand a chance and fades after an hour or two. However even on days I have gone a full 8 hours or more without re-applying, it is very noticeable when I wash my face that it still provides a little bit of coverage even when it is not \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;. Also, when I set it with pressed powder it lasts an hour or two longer in all weather \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love how perfect the coverage is when I used my Medium toned PONDS BB Luminous finish cream.  It&#x27;s lightweight, nomgreasy, and even has a pleasant odor.  I received it in my MamaVoxBox from Influenster and I must say, it is my favorite item.  Try it and see for yourself :)</li>
    <li> I have used Pond&#x27;s BB+ for two weeks and I love it!  My skin is protected and my makeup looks more even and better than ever before!  The product does not feel heavy or greasy at all.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and I have to say that I genuinely like it. It provides a light, luminous coverage which I like since I hate having a heavy, greasy cream on my face. The shade looks dark when it comes out of the tube but applies evenly and blends in with your skin. It actually evens out my skin tone too (which is normally splotchy). I haven&#x27;t noticed that my dark spots have exactly faded but I haven&#x27;t really been using it long enough to tell if it is having any effect. The fact that it also contains UVA/UVB SPF 15 sunscreen is a great plus. Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty good BB cream compared to others that I have tried before.</li>
    <li> this BB cream is definitely worth buying, and here&#x27;s why: 1) Neutral undertone. Even though there&#x27;s only two colors, I feel it would blend in to many skin tones of the same range. 2) Blends like a flawless dream, I kid you not. 3) Very faint, but great smell. Not irritating at all. 4) Lovely, and very hygienic packaging. 5) Very natural, but good coverage. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s nearly medium coverage. 6) Good for dry skin applied over a moisturizer, and I can see it being great for oily skin without moisturizer underneath. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of BB creams over the past couple of years, and find that I really like the moisturizing and minimal coverage they provide on days when I&#x27;m not up for foundation and full makeup.  This is one of the best.  It goes on very smoothly and provides a little more coverage than some of the other BBs.  Other BB creams have left my skin a little too moist-looking, a little shiny, but this did not, and the matte finished seems to last throughout the day.  Although it may seem odd, I also particularly like the shape and quality of the tube.  The tube is flat and rather substantial, and it seems like it will be easier to get most of the product out of the tube.  I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster to try for free and i must say i love it... I can see my skin tone evening out already... It is much lighter then foundation and still gets the job done... I will def recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I really loved this BB cream! I like the smooth feeling to it and it was a snap to apply. It dried and blended quickly, leaving no signs I was wearing makeup behind. It felt natural to the touch and did not rub off on my clothes. I usually opt for products without spf in them because I don&#x27;t like the feeling of sunscreen in my makeup, but this was light without much of a scent at all. It lasted all day and did not irritate my sensitive skin. There is a lot of product and a little bit goes a long way. I imagine this will last a month with daily use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!  The color matched great it went on so smoothly and has amazing coverage. My only complaint was my skin became quite oily however I used a little finishing powder the second time i used  it and problem solved. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a nice mix of day cream and foundation. It blends well and feels light. The cream looked a bit dark, but when I applied it it was a perfect match. I love the fact,  that I only have to use one product. I have not noticed any difference in my dark spots. It covers them well, but they have not been disappearing. I would recommend this to anyone. It gives you a nice cover-up and has a light feel. Not too greasy. Matte finish. Slight sent. I also have not had any problems breaking out(some creams were to greasy with the added SPF). Great product. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about BB creams for a while and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this one. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but I really like it for what it is. My skin feels good when I use it, it feel softer and it looks smoother. It doesn&#x27;t offer coverage because it&#x27;s very sheer, but it still makes my skin look more even. The medium shade isn&#x27;t as dark on the skin as it appears when I squeeze it from the tube. However, it was still a little too dark for me. I liked the way it felt so I bought the lighter shade and am using it now. My skin almost glows when i wear it and I really like how it makes me look. I&#x27;m getting older, but I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage. This works perfectly for my casual days when I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup. However, it doesn&#x27;t take the place of a good foundation when better coverage or more professional appearance is important. Still, it&#x27;s very good for what it is and I&#x27;m glad that I tried it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I like this very low cost face cream - makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It covers nicely and protects from the sun.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t a product that worked for me.  I have sensitive skin and I started to break out with it.  I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if the claims of dark spot reductions were true because of that issue I had with it.</li>
    <li> I have never tried a BB cream so I was excited to see what all the hype was about. This Pond&#x27;s version provides great coverage and dries to a nice matte finish. I was impressed with how long it stayed on too. The medium shade was a bit darker than I was expecting, it gave me almost a bronze look. It went on smoothly but I did feel like it was a bit heavy on my skin. It also had a funny smell that lasted almost the whole day. I think I would try this again in a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, and i love the finish of this foundation my skin does not look shiny or oily for a long time. I use it every day in my makeup routine, and it works very well under my face powder!! It is very smooth, blends very well.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick product. I have combination skin and felt that this product was not easy to spread on my face, especially in the dry areas. To get even coverage I ended up using too much product and too much pigment was applied. I washed it off and tried again, this time diluting it 1:1 with regular face lotion. I had much better results doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These “all-in-one” products are good in theory, but in reality they fall short. To get adequate sun protection you need to use this product every 2 hours as directed.  If I used this product every 2, I would end up with WAY too much pigment on my face.</li>
    <li> I have a brown complexion and was looking for a BB cream. I read reviews for this product and thought of giving it a try. Though I bought the cream at a drug store ($9.47, realized Amazon is slightly cheaper), I wanted to write a review here. I really like how it blends with my complexion. My face doesn&#x27;t look like it is overdone and it looks smooth and bright. I used the cream for the first time today and I&#x27;m impressed by the results. I&#x27;ll update of any changes in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite B&amp; B cream and I&#x27;ve tried several! Goes on smooth, does what it&#x27;s supposed to...love it!</li>
    <li> Best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and truly believe that it has improved my skin.  The coverage is the best of any BB creams I&#x27;ve tried and I love the smooth, dewy finish it gives.</li>
    <li> Feels like the ponds moisturizer in the tub,  just with pigment. Also, luminous is a very good description.  It is not dewey or greasy looking at all,  but just the slightest bit of shimmer in the best way. Melted right into my skin immediately. I mix the medium and light shades together to get my color.  Love it :) and I&#x27;ve tried SO many bb creams.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the purchase. Medium is kinda dark.</li>
    <li> So great for the price. I love this product and it doesn&#x27;t cause zits (for me at least).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this BB Cream! It Keeps my face soft and very moisturized and it helps me with the dryness of my skin. I honestly recommend this product for anyone looking to get moisture plus a little tint!</li>
    <li> My skin tone is N3 to N4 type. I got the medium color, it looks so dark but it is not that dark when I applied it on my face. It&#x27;s a little bit thick than the other BB cream. Next time I will try light color in winter.</li>
    <li> I have never worn much foundation preferring simple tinted moisturizers just to provide some evening of skin tone.  With the advent of BB creams, true tinted moisturizers are vanishing.  I&#x27;ve tried regular BB creams but always found the finish too matte and powdery for older skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to have big discount coupons for Olay CC [[ASIN:B007M81A6Q Olay Cc Cream - Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 15 Light To Medium 1.7 Fl Oz]] and Ponds BB+ so picked up both at a discount store.  Olay was around $20 (before coupon) for 1.7 FL ounces and Ponds around $10 fo 1.5 oz.  Both have broad spectrum SPF 15 and promise \\&quot;tone correcting\\&quot;.  Picked Olay light to medium shade and Ponds medium.  Olay comes out of the bottle silkier and a lighter color than the Ponds.  Ponds was much darker with a gray undertone which worried me.  However, I applied each to one side of my face with a makeup sponge and was unable to tell the difference between the two even in bright sunlight with a magnifying mirror.  Ifyou don&#x27;t use a sponge and apply heavier it might be different but both seemed to blend well with my skin.  I didn&#x27;t find either to be particularly \\&quot;luminous\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these are not foundations, there is just skin evening, not coverage.  You would still need to use concealer and/or foundation for that.  Whether either delivers on the promise of dark spot reduction I can&#x27;t say since I don&#x27;t have much in the way of dark spots and any lasting effect would take several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either of these work for me.  I am giving only four stars since neither provides enough moisture or SPF to replace my regular moisturizer and sunscreen.  If you don&#x27;t live in a dry environment or spend much time outdoors you might be able to get away with just these products.</li>
    <li> Mistake. Too dark for me. My skin is normal asian.</li>
    <li> Its a good BB cream. but its oily and give you a lighter cover comparison from other BB. i recommend this for who don&#x27;t need so much cover.  update..  it is a little bet darker then the color of my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage, but it made me break out. I have light olive skin and had to combine the light and medium. I wish I had not broken out since it covered well, was light and non greasy. Hopefully it works better for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing liquid foundation for the past 15 years almost everyday, because i have a bad case of broken capillaries all over my face, so the face looks red. Needless to say, I definitely need products with great coverage to be able to hide all that.&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought I&#x27;d give a try to this BB cream and see what what the fuss is all about.....I was soooo skeptical, but ultimately i was proven wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I put some concealer on target spots where the broken capillaries look the worst and then I buffer the whole face with this cream. It takes a smaller amount than the foundation, almost 40% less, and I think this tube is gonna last me well over a month,if not 2, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really, really like is that it looks more natural- without that cakey, powdery finish of the foundation. It almost looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing on my skin, and oh boy, I can&#x27;t tell you how happy that makes me!&lt;br /&gt;I use a medium tone - i have a medium skin with pink undertones and use &amp;#34;sandy beige&amp;#34; in foundation. The medium is perfect- there&#x27;s no clash in colors.&lt;br /&gt;What else can i say...now I&#x27;m sold to this product for life.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream has SPF 15 which is definitely a plus for when you are going out and it is sunny. I also LOVE how well the BB Cream blends into my skin, the cream is lighter than my skin complexion, but it does not have my skin looking ashy and white. The cream is great with flash photography,too. I have used this BB Cream about 5 or 6 times and I am impressed with it. Plus it gives my face a glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received these products from Influenster for FREE!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15, Medium shade and really like it. The cream blends in with my olive skin immediately and very nicely. It barely shows, that&#x27;s how good it goes on my skin. It also feels very silky, which I love. It doesn&#x27;t clog the pores and adds a layer of glow to my skin. And to top it off, it has SPF 15 which is great for protecting my skin from sun damage, even on the winter months. I&#x27;m happy with the full size sample I received as compliments from Influenster for testing purposes and I recommend it to my family, friends and all the ladies that want to lok fabulous, like myself!</li>
    <li> When I received my Pond&#x27;s BB Cream samples from Influenster, I wasn&#x27;t really very interested. I have never been a fan of liquid makeup, always seemed too thick and cakey, didn&#x27;t like the feel on my skin. I had seen BB creams, but assumed they were just another form of foundation. Upon opening the medium tint, it looked very dark. However as I applied the cream, it was the perfect shade for my end of summer skin tone. I think the light shade will be perfect for winter. I really liked the light feel and minimal,natural look. It gave me a perfect amount of color to even out my skin tone. I also appreciate the addition of SPF coverage of 15. All together I found it to be a very nice product that I will now add to my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I received both the light and medium from Influenster. I was a little weary about using this as I have extremely sensitive skin! Just about everything breaks it out! I decided to give this a try and have loved it! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a week and haven&#x27;t had a breakout! It gives an all over luminous finish that you can wear just as a light foundation by itself, or I like to use it as a primer just on my cheeks to give a highlight glow! Since I got two samples and the light fit my skin best, I gave the medium to my friend and she loved it as well! Overall a great product!!</li>
    <li> I just recently tried this product and I love it.  I am usually very picky about foundations, it is hard for me to match my skintone so when I find one I stick with it.  I also have very sensitive skin making my choices limited.  This product matches my skin and makes it feel smooth.  It covers without making it feel like I have stuff caked on.  Excellent coverage highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Influenster blessed me with this wonderful bb cream in my last voxbox and I fell in love. I love everything about this cream from how light it goes on to how great it makes my skin look. If you are looking for a great bbcream this is the one.</li>
    <li> I never wear makeup because it always looks dry and powdery on me, but this is so different I received it for free in my VoxBox from Influenster, and it works great! Goes on smooth and evens out my skintone. #PONDSBB #mamavoxbox @InfuensterVox</li>
    <li> the color fit perfect it felt great on my skin and left my skin glowing I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and was reluctant to try this product. But... I got it free in an Influenster box for review, so I thought I would give it a try.  I don&#x27;t know what I was waiting for.  I LOVE IT.  It is very smooth and the color is great on it.  It blends nicely with my skin tone as I still have a bit of color from the summer.  I also received the Light tone in my freebie box, so I will look forward to trying that one in the winter.</li>
    <li> I received Ponds BB Cream from Influenster to review, I don&#x27;t often wear foundation makeup but I found the Ponds BB Cream to be much more lightweight alternative to other foundation like products I have tried. I often forget to put on sunscreen before my make up routine so this product has me covered. Not only do I love the coverage and sunscreen I love the smell of this product too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a lightweight product to even out your skin tone while protecting your face from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays this is it.</li>
    <li> I really fail to see the benefit of this product.  It&#x27;s like makeup with sunscreen.  The coverage is about medium on me, but the shade looks greyish on me.  It&#x27;s tool cool or something.  It dries my skin out.  I could tell as soon as I put it on that my skin felt like I had a clay masque on it.  Most products don&#x27;t do that, so it surprised me.  I thought maybe it was for younger people that get blemishes, but I need moisture, which I was expecting from a Pond&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;Younger women with acne prone skin might love it though - it won&#x27;t clog pores and is supposed to help reduce dark spots.  It&#x27;s also got a SPF 15 in it, so I suspect it would be product that might be best enjoyed in warmer, more humid weather.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally wear make-up, but I received Pond&#x27;s BB Plus Cream in Medium and Light to try out free from Influenster. Both shades blended well with my skin tone, but I prefer the medium slightly because it gives me more of a tanned post-summer look. I&#x27;ll switch to light later in the winter. I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I do actually feel that my skin tone is more even, even when I don&#x27;t have the BB+ Cream on. (When I have it on, I can definitely tell how it evens out my skin tone!) It goes on easily and has a light pleasant scent. I love that it&#x27;s part light foundation and part SPF 15. I find it very easy to remember to apply it in the morning (though it does say to reapply every couple hours, which I do not do), and I intend to continue using it after this tube runs out. It&#x27;s a quick way to protect my skin and get a fresh look. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different tinted moisturizers in the past and this fits the bill perfectly.  Not greasy, has SPF and gives you super subtle coverage without being heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite moisturizer is actually a cream that doesn&#x27;t have an SPF, so I use this in conjunction with it - especially in the winter with super dry skin - and it&#x27;s the perfect addition to my skin care routine!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best BB cream I have used especially considering the low price.  I still have trouble with clogged pores and rosacea in my 50&#x27;s and this product does not cause or aggravate either condition.  It really makes my skin look more finished as well as protecting it from the sun.  I will now be buying this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I received Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Cream compliments of Influenster program for testing purposes. I must say I was very impressed! I have tried many American BB creams and they seem to be nothing more than slightly tinted moisturizers. I resorted to purchasing Korean BB creams around a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB cream provides me with just the right amount of cverage. More than a tinted moisturizer, and comperable to the Korean brand I purchase regularly. The Pond&#x27;s didn&#x27;t leave my face looking too dry or too dewey. It was perfect! As for tone improvement, I have not noticed a significant change. I did love how my face felt almost baby soft while wearing and after removal. Added bonus...SPF 15! Will definitly purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> Great BB cream, the color matches my complexion &amp; i luv that it has a mosterizer+spf+foundation all in one. I&#x27;m ordering another one for my mother.</li>
    <li> This is a good BB cream.  I was looking for something to replace my holy grail that was discontinued, but this does not compare.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on days i don&#x27;t want full coverage becaus eit gives a nice tint but still looks like skin.  i think it blends best with a stippling brush.</li>
    <li> I guess this cream just wasn&#x27;t for my skin. Reading the reviews I got very excited to try this. First of all, the medium shade was too dark for my skin. I&#x27;m usually a Natural Beige color in foundations, but I do know for good coverage its best to try a shade darker than your own-this was just too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shades apart, because that is up to us to determine the correct one, I received no good coverage. This may be because I have a few break-outs on my skin, but other BB creams have helped me with better coverage. This came on smoothly, darkened my skin, and did nothing to hide my imperfections. I would have used it just to finish the bottle, but even the shade is too dark. Wasted a bottle and money, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This is the best Pond&#x27;s cream I&#x27;ve tried. It has a light scent, caused no problems with my skin (I have very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s rare to find a product that doesn&#x27;t have an adverse affect), the inclusion of sunscreen was terrific, and it made my skin brighter and clearer. I saw reduction in fine lines, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to blend this cream with my regular foundation. I have a difficult skin tone for general &amp;#34;fair, medium, dark&amp;#34; products (gold-toned pale), but blending the recommended amount of this cream in with slightly more of my usual foundation (L&#x27;Oreal TrueBlend, for reference) did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the results were very good for the price, and I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive - there are a lot of products I can not use on my face.  This is important to know because my experience may not be yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on then headed off to work.  By 9 am my skin was burning and I was in the bathroom taking it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked how this product went on - a nice thin layer with a little bit of color to even the tone and SPF to protect.  But then it started to irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to wear a lot of concealer or foundation as my skin has always been pretty clear, but I do like something just to even out my skin tone. The Ponds Luminous Finish BB Cream does a great job of doing just that it&#x27;s not heavy on my skin. I found a little goes a long way with this cream, so even with the small container size it should last for quite a while. This medium tone works well for me during the summer when I&#x27;ve had a little color from the sun, but I can see that during the winter when my skin is a bit more fair I&#x27;ll have to go to a lighter shade. Overall its a good product at a reasonable price and I would recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this product after trying several other BB creams that were not a good fit for my skin. I have combination skin as well as dark spots and this gives me a nice dewy fresh look without being overdone. Great for summer or a light coverage day</li>
    <li> Almost flawless finish on my skin, great price, thanks Amazon for a good deal. I have found best results when this cream is finished with a BB powder; this color goes well with the Physician&#x27;s Formula BB powder (medium/dark). When this runs out I will probably try the PF BB cream. If it&#x27;s half as good as the powder, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> Best bb cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> If you have oily/acne prone skin DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  I tried this product once because I had received a free sample, and the very next morning my face was COVERED in pimples. I mean there has to be over 100 little zits completely covering my face.  It looks like I fell face first into some poison ivy or have a bad case of chicken pox. I will be avoiding Ponds products like the plague from now on.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. I think it&#x27;s better than my mAC foundation- no kidding.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every day, but when I want to have a more &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; look on my face I always turn to this BB cream. It is light and covers a lot. You have to be careful that you are blending it in evenly, especially near your hair line and between your jaw line and your neck. It feels very light when applied and does not clog my pores or cause any break outs. It helps with evening everything out and I love that it has SPF in it. Even after applying a face powder on top of it it still feels light and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> This is the right shade for my skin tone light/medium olive.  It is not oily or greasy of course my skin is older now so not as oily as when younger.  In fact I have to use extra moisturizer with this product.  My daughter swears byt this product. She uses the light and she said in about 2 weeks she did see her tone and dark blotches evening out.</li>
    <li> Love this make-up.  Gives your complexion an even, glowing look without being over done.  Receive many compliments on the youthful look..</li>
    <li> This Caused the worse breakout in my life. It ceased after stopping using the product.   That&#x27;s bad caused I liked the coverage.    Do not wear this in hot/humid weather, it will feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Smooth and expected amount of coverage</li>
    <li> . This is my first Pond&#x27;s product.Non drying, feels and looks naturally,  like your second skin; blends very well. Glad I found it.Use every day.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite BB plus cream, you cannot find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> l really enjoy this BB cream. It looks very natural and feels very good on the skin. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works great and a little goes  a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this as a primer under my make-up. Glad that it has SPF that seems to really work. Gentle on skin. Purchased due to suggestion from Environmental Working Group that this product contains safe ingredients. I wear mineral make-up on top of this product and this gives a more matte look to my make-up than a previous primer only (no tint) product. The medium color is olive toned, so I may order the lighter shade next time in hopes that it will work better with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very good seller. I reccomended.</li>
    <li> I read reviews that said this product had good coverage, but I very much disagree. No coverage. But what I dislike most about this product is that my skin broke out like never before.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, as it covers up most dark spots.</li>
    <li> Have to mix medium and light to get it right but quality can&#x27;t be beat. Long lasting, light but complete coverage.</li>
