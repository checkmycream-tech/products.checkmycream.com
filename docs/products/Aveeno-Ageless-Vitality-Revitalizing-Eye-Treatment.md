### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But Aveeno is an excellent brand</li>
      <li>Very happy with product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>However, I just add my own if I&#x27;m going to be out in a lot of sun.</li>
      <li>I have unusually good skin for my age and rarely find a product that gives me the kind of visible results that others sometimes rave about.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>My eyes look more youthful and</li>
      <li>I love it, it gives my eyes an ageless look.</li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t believe such a great product fell off the map!</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with it when I was using it daily.</li>
      <li>Yes, you can trust Aveeno to not irritate your skin, but this isn&#x27;t much more than moisturizer if you&#x27;re 40 or over.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and have decided I don&#x27;t want to use it on my eyelids or lips any more.</li>
      <li>I can even use them with the occassional retin-a treatment as they do not contain retinol which together could cause more irritation to the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aveeno makes great products and they&#x27;re reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I am glad that it was available through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have no idea of its effect on dark circles however because that is not my affliction, but for sagging and wrinkles, this has been the best product for me!  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fine, package as described.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed as no difference at all, used as directed.  </li>
      <li>can already see a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and makes my eyes look smooth when I use it under makeup.</li>
      <li>I originally read a review about the product in a women&#x27;s magazine a couple of years ago; the review mentioned the product&#x27;s ability to stimulate collagen production.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this product, it doesn&#x27;t smell, my eyes seem to be \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; &amp; the dark circles seemed more diminished.</li>
      <li>and it gives my eyes a fresh look.</li>
      <li>The Positively Ageless cleanser leaves my skin squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>My skin needs lots of help right now.</li>
      <li>Smooth &amp; easy to use, like the fact that this is an entire eye product.  </li>
      <li>thanks for quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I believe it hides somewhat fine lines and wrinkles more than other products that I have used.</li>
      <li>Also, it makes makeup just  glide on, lessening the pulling and tugging in the gentle eye area!  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a first time use thing.  </li>
      <li>Then I wash my face with the Positively Ageless cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was saving for the job hunting time and started using it before I ordered the Positively Ageless system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t cause additional wrinkles but didn&#x27;t really help as well.  </li>
      <li>Ageless Vitality Elasticity Recharging System really works.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any improvement around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>and she loves it so much</li>
      <li>I wanted something that would tighten up that upper skin and smooth things out.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel like my eyes were being moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I know a few reviewers didn&#x27;t think much of this product, however I love it.</li>
      <li>They are so soft &amp; smooth for the entire face!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using the 2 Aveeno products together takes a little more time, but as I said, my skin needs lots of help.</li>
      <li>It might take a while to get used to the two-step process and applying the right amount of each tube to suit your skin, but it definitely works.  </li>
      <li>I use the entire Positively Ageless line from Aveeno and really like it.</li>
      <li>I love the little tubes!  </li>
      <li>skin is very soft now</li>
      <li>I do find that if you use the eye cream and are outside during a hot day, you eyes will burn from perspiration mixing with it.</li>
      <li>Now, in my opinion, I feel like I am coating the skin with the first product so that the second product (which is a cream) cannot even penetrate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this product for a few weeks and have not noticed a big difference, but it feels good on my face.</li>
      <li>ordered both Ageless Vitality (eye and night time systems) and Positively Ageless at the same time.</li>
      <li>The smaller tubes seemed ok, but the contents of the larger tube had separated into a watery liquid and a strange sludge.</li>
      <li>It seemed just like the clear silicone stuff I use in my hair.</li>
      <li>(maybe an old leftover product?)</li>
      <li>I am 40 years old.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to be looking for a job and don&#x27;t want to have old lady skin.</li>
      <li>I have always had sagging eyelids as an adult, but this product has lifted the skin above my eyes so much that I look years younger than my age.</li>
      <li>My pores are smaller and the wrinkles under my eyes that have been driving me crazy are greatly reduced already.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, you are supposed to apply the small tube of \\&quot;biomedical concentrate,\\&quot; which is just a high amount of silicone.</li>
      <li>+ year old Mom&#x27;s and the lower lids were starting to look quite crepey (sp?).  </li>
      <li>I threw it away while making a mental note to avoid this particular vendor and of course, check for expiration dates in the future.</li>

<li> Really works and if you get it on Amazon, it&#x27;s half price!</li>
<li> I read all other reviews before writing mine in order to confirm that the eye cream (second step of the process was supposed to be creamy) in my case it was a see through liquid that would completely slide off my finger.  </li>
<li> Several hours later, the skin around my eyes is dry and crepe-like.</li>
<li> I like how soft the little tube stuff feels on my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m on my second pack and although it didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles that I&#x27;ve lived with all my life, the smoothness around my eyes is unbelievable.  </li>
<li> I have a touch of eczema and get dry patches on my face.</li>
<li> My oily t-zone and dry patches are gone.</li>
<li> this was a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> Huge disappointment.  </li>
<li> It seems a waste and the smaller ones always have air in them that causes unwanted spurts; plus, you can&#x27;t get all the lotion out by squeezing the tube.</li>
<li> I just love it and hate when I have to go without and the sagging starts to creep back in.  </li>
<li> it makes those tiny lines around my eyes less noticeable, and lessens dark spots, as well.  </li>
<li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little does go a long way</li>
<li> only oil comes out, then some half dried out moisturizer.  </li>
<li> My eyes are very sensitive to fragrance and other irritating ingredients, but I have no problems with eye redness when using it.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> and half the time when I squeeze the tube</li>
<li> Otherwise, it has helped keep the skin around my eyes softer and less wrinkled.</li>
<li> I can see no difference in the ingredients of the little tubes in either of the three products (day, night or eye)</li>
<li> Tried this for a few weeks.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that it can/does, but at minimum, it appears to have imitated that process.  </li>
<li> I usually put it after 12hr working</li>
<li> so I am not sure if I will bother buying it again.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why the base lotion is packaged in small tubes rather than one larger one.</li>
<li> Too bad the larger moisturizer is all separated</li>
<li> After 4 weeks the skin under my eyes looked worse than when I started using it.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong no matter which one you choose.</li>
<li> That being said $40 per month just for the eye cream gets a bit expensive!  </li>
<li> Too bad it has been discontinued.</li>
<li> very disappointed that it has been discontinued.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> thanks for quick delivery. i can&#x27;t be without this eye serum combination. works for me to keep crepy eye lids at bay.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my Mom and she loves it so much, she made me buy another set.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and makes my eyes look smooth when I use it under makeup. I would recommend</li>
    <li> First, you are supposed to apply the small tube of \\&quot;biomedical concentrate,\\&quot; which is just a high amount of silicone. It seemed just like the clear silicone stuff I use in my hair. Next, you are directed to apply the moisturizing cream. Now, in my opinion, I feel like I am coating the skin with the first product so that the second product (which is a cream) cannot even penetrate my skin. Several hours later, the skin around my eyes is dry and crepe-like. Definitely did NOT work for me.</li>
    <li> I know a few reviewers didn&#x27;t think much of this product, however I love it. I&#x27;m on my second pack and although it didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles that I&#x27;ve lived with all my life, the smoothness around my eyes is unbelievable.  My eyes look more youthful and no lines for my concealer to settle in.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I love it, it gives my eyes an ageless look. I usually put it after 12hr working and it gives my eyes a fresh look.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it doesn&#x27;t smell, my eyes seem to be \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; &amp; the dark circles seemed more diminished. Smooth &amp; easy to use, like the fact that this is an entire eye product.  Would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using 2 Aveeno products together. My skin needs lots of help right now. I finally saved enough money to splurge and decided to see what Aveeno product I could find at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered both Ageless Vitality (eye and night time systems) and Positively Ageless at the same time. The Positively Ageless cleanser leaves my skin squeaky clean. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and have decided I don&#x27;t want to use it on my eyelids or lips any more. I read the instructions and they say it can be used to remove makeup, but I have a different cleanser I&#x27;m going to continue to use to remove my mascara with. Then I wash my face with the Positively Ageless cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can already see a huge improvement in my skin. My pores are smaller and the wrinkles under my eyes that have been driving me crazy are greatly reduced already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the 2 Aveeno products together takes a little more time, but as I said, my skin needs lots of help. I&#x27;m going to be looking for a job and don&#x27;t want to have old lady skin. Ageless Vitality Elasticity Recharging System really works. I was very impressed with it when I was using it daily. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it helped my skin. Then suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it at any retail store in my area. I ordered it once from Amazon and then I couldn&#x27;t find it here either. I just couldn&#x27;t believe such a great product fell off the map! I still had some (daytime treatment) I was saving for the job hunting time and started using it before I ordered the Positively Ageless system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very soft now and I don&#x27;t have my troublesome combination skin. I have a touch of eczema and get dry patches on my face. My oily t-zone and dry patches are gone. I wear a matte finish foundation and don&#x27;t have a shinny face when it&#x27;s time to wash up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno makes great products and they&#x27;re reasonably priced. You can&#x27;t go wrong no matter which one you choose.</li>
    <li> It might take a while to get used to the two-step process and applying the right amount of each tube to suit your skin, but it definitely works.  I have always had sagging eyelids as an adult, but this product has lifted the skin above my eyes so much that I look years younger than my age. I originally read a review about the product in a women&#x27;s magazine a couple of years ago; the review mentioned the product&#x27;s ability to stimulate collagen production.  I&#x27;m not sure that it can/does, but at minimum, it appears to have imitated that process.  An additional bonus is that it is fragrance-free.  My eyes are very sensitive to fragrance and other irritating ingredients, but I have no problems with eye redness when using it. My only criticism is that I wish it incorporated an SPF within the topical cream. However, I just add my own if I&#x27;m going to be out in a lot of sun. I will miss this product if it stops being manufactured.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.  I believe it hides somewhat fine lines and wrinkles more than other products that I have used. Too bad it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  it makes those tiny lines around my eyes less noticeable, and lessens dark spots, as well.  Also, it makes makeup just  glide on, lessening the pulling and tugging in the gentle eye area!  I have used it for a couple of years and will continue!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fine, package as described.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed as no difference at all, used as directed.  I am on to the next thing to try.</li>
    <li> Huge disappointment.  After 4 weeks the skin under my eyes looked worse than when I started using it.  Think it was an experiment that Aveeno was trying because it was not on their web site.  I use the entire Positively Ageless line from Aveeno and really like it. this was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I should have checked for an expiration date on the box. The smaller tubes seemed ok, but the contents of the larger tube had separated into a watery liquid and a strange sludge. No amount of shaking the tube could coax the two back together. I threw it away while making a mental note to avoid this particular vendor and of course, check for expiration dates in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and have even occassionally tried to go back to something cheaper, but always return.  I am 40 years old.  My upper eyelids were starting to sag like my 60+ year old Mom&#x27;s and the lower lids were starting to look quite crepey (sp?).  I wanted something that would tighten up that upper skin and smooth things out.  This did the trick!  It isn&#x27;t a first time use thing.  You must be persistent, but believe me, you will see results.  I use it day and night.  A little does go a long way so one bottle should last a month.  That being said $40 per month just for the eye cream gets a bit expensive!  I truly wish they would lower the price on this product.  I keep searching to find it cheaper or find coupons.  I just love it and hate when I have to go without and the sagging starts to creep back in.  I have no idea of its effect on dark circles however because that is not my affliction, but for sagging and wrinkles, this has been the best product for me!  Also, the day and night face creams have helped with my neck and jawline and they are the only creams I have used in recent years that don&#x27;t cause me breakouts.  I can even use them with the occassional retin-a treatment as they do not contain retinol which together could cause more irritation to the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use for my eyes. It&#x27;s great &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I don&#x27;t need to get plastic sugery!  Really works and if you get it on Amazon, it&#x27;s half price!</li>
    <li> I have unusually good skin for my age and rarely find a product that gives me the kind of visible results that others sometimes rave about.  This product, howerver, does produce visible results for me.  I wonder why it seems that Aveeno has stopped making it?  I am glad that it was available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yes, you can trust Aveeno to not irritate your skin, but this isn&#x27;t much more than moisturizer if you&#x27;re 40 or over.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Aveeno series for a while and like it. I can see no difference in the ingredients of the little tubes in either of the three products (day, night or eye) so I buy which ever is on sale. I do find that if you use the eye cream and are outside during a hot day, you eyes will burn from perspiration mixing with it. Otherwise, it has helped keep the skin around my eyes softer and less wrinkled. I&#x27;m not sure why the base lotion is packaged in small tubes rather than one larger one. It seems a waste and the smaller ones always have air in them that causes unwanted spurts; plus, you can&#x27;t get all the lotion out by squeezing the tube. I will still buy it, however, as it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This works well. Starting to see results</li>
    <li> I like how soft the little tube stuff feels on my skin. Too bad the larger moisturizer is all separated (maybe an old leftover product?) and half the time when I squeeze the tube only oil comes out, then some half dried out moisturizer.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I read all other reviews before writing mine in order to confirm that the eye cream (second step of the process was supposed to be creamy) in my case it was a see through liquid that would completely slide off my finger.  Through reading the reviews I also realized that the product has been discontinued confirming that it probably has expired</li>
    <li> Tried this for a few weeks. Didn&#x27;t really feel like my eyes were being moisturized.  Didn&#x27;t really notice any improvement around my eyes.  Didn&#x27;t cause additional wrinkles but didn&#x27;t really help as well.  I still have my stash so maybe I&#x27;ll give it another shot and try it out for a longer period.</li>
    <li> I love the little tubes!  They are so soft &amp; smooth for the entire face!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks and have not noticed a big difference, but it feels good on my face. And a little goes a long way. But I read that it was discontinued...so I am not sure if I will bother buying it again. But Aveeno is an excellent brand and I do like all of their lotions/ moisturizers.</li>
    <li> love this product.  it feels so silky going on and keeps the eye area hydrated.  very disappointed that it has been discontinued.</li>
