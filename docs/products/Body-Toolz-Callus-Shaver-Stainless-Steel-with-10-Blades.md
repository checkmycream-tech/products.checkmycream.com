      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>A great buy.</li>
      <li>This tool works great.</li>
      <li>Works amazing!</li>
      <li>Being so sturdy, it would&#x27;ve  been awesome with better design.</li>
      <li>but they needn&#x27;t have been because GOOD GRACIOUS does this thing work.</li>
      <li>Without soaking, these are fairly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works good.</li>
      <li>Good quality, sturdy construction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead I have started using using a callus stone and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>but this beautiful stainless steel callus shaver is beautiful to look at and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it comes with additional blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good, worth the money :)</li>
      <li>The callus shaver itself is great, but the blades are cheap, so replace them with better quality blades.</li>
      <li>The blade seems to break very easily but the replacements are very cheap.</li>
      <li>I have used these type blades many times before</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t be able to stop.</li>
      <li>and I was in love.</li>
      <li>This thing works terrifically and I am quite pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Bought a cheaper, plastic one at Walmart that worked better.</li>
      <li>LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Works so much better and sturdier than the dept store versions.  </li>
      <li>So, I would love to use it, but can&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many I&#x27;ve bought that broke</li>
      <li>ALWAYS SOAK SKIN FIRST!!!</li>
      <li>These are pretty good.</li>
      <li>Just what I expected .. PERFECT !!!</li>
      <li>but it almost seems you&#x27;d be better off buying cheap razors.</li>
      <li>Easy to exchange the razors, works well in the shower or after, doesn&#x27;t over-dig.  </li>
      <li>You can be easily hobbled.</li>
      <li>It shaves my callus easily.  </li>
      <li>But if you have \\&quot;cow hooves\\&quot;, then this is PERFECT!</li>
      <li>but I was able to adjust quickly and it hasn’t happened again.</li>
      <li>This little gem is awesome.</li>
      <li>Nice stainless steal handle.</li>
      <li>Cheap, bends when using.</li>
      <li>Glide lightly.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the product and would recommend to others who want to avoid blisters from crossfit style workouts.</li>
      <li>Baby smooth hands.</li>
      <li>I originally thought I had the blade reversed.</li>
      <li>This seems to hold the blade too far from the edge so that it doesn&#x27;t shave anything but the very top off a callus.</li>
      <li>somewhat continuous clean peel is what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
      <li>This arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  </li>
      <li>This one has a very strong stainless handle but works just as great as my previous model.  </li>
      <li>This works very nicely on calluses and rough skin on your feet.</li>
      <li>I would NOT have purchased this product to begin with, but I now have a ton of replacement blades to last many, many calluses for years to come.</li>
      <li>I have had other shavers that have been more effective.</li>
      <li>and that isn&#x27;t ideal when you finally reveal lovely fresh pink skin.</li>
      <li>This is a must have for any avid CrossFitter!</li>
      <li>WOW!!!!!  </li>
      <li>free to ignore my review because I&#x27;m really a novice at this.</li>
      <li>Clearly, you can&#x27;t just go to town on your foot with this, but if used properly it works great.</li>
      <li>Make sure that your foot is well soak and soft.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the right touch for this thing.  </li>
      <li>The one piece steel handle is well built, the blade has the right amount of bend and clearance.  </li>
      <li>Did not even work right</li>
      <li>Just make sure you dry it off after every use, if you keep in the shower it will rust quickly</li>
      <li>But you HAVE TO soak your feet first.</li>
      <li>Make sure to switch out the blade regularly or the blade will break.</li>
      <li>Love the extra blades...</li>
      <li>i was a bit intimidated at first</li>
      <li>After reading reviews for this product I decided to purchase it, all the reviews seemed pretty informative.</li>
      <li>This happened to me the first time using it</li>
      <li>First time I used it I sliced myself</li>
      <li>First try cut my finger, nothing done to callus.</li>
      <li>I noticed that this is exactly what they uses in shaving callous.</li>
      <li>The first one deserves 10 stars.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this shaver and most likely will be returning it.</li>
      <li>My hands were consistently torn up from pull ups, lifts, ect...</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a try and sure enough it works.</li>
      <li>It was first used on my foot at my salon</li>
      <li>I wish had read the most recent reviews for this product, as most people have the same issue I am.</li>
      <li>The razor needs to be changed often, as it does dull easy, but I&#x27;m thrilled with it for the price.</li>
      <li>10 extra blades and am still on the first blade, more than four months now, still very shape.</li>
      <li>Do be careful, it would be easy to cut yourself!</li>
      <li>I want a shaver that will really shave off large ribbons of callus.</li>
      <li>Great for tough calluses.  </li>
      <li>I could not get any of the blades on and went through all 10 since the broke very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had to remove the blade from the metal handle and really dig in to try to even chip away at my callus.</li>
      <li>It works very well...</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t figure out how to use this.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it took off the skin very well on my heels.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stainless steel and works very well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the stainless steel that really lets you go to work on your feet</li>
      <li>I bought this item despite reading a review that said it leaves too much space between the tool and the razor, allowing it to slice you.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
      <li>Good for removing thick, stubborn calluses on your feet.</li>
      <li>I recently moved to Japan where a pedicure can cost 50$ to start which is way too rich for my blood</li>
      <li>My heals look normal now!</li>
      <li>Maybe my callousness places are just not bad enough for it to work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to exchange the razors, works well in the shower or after, doesn&#x27;t over-dig.  Only reason I gave it a 4 is it doesn&#x27;t work on the edges of certain patches, or if you have cracks in your skin already.</li>
    <li> I have really bad cracked heels, to the point that my family calls my feet, cow hooves. This is great at removing really troubled skin, but it cuts deeper than the other brands. If you have feet that need a little TLC, this may be too much of a removing tool. But if you have \\&quot;cow hooves\\&quot;, then this is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Takes off callouses with ease.</li>
    <li> 10 extra blades and am still on the first blade, more than four months now, still very shape. Very good, worth the money :)</li>
    <li> I bought this item despite reading a review that said it leaves too much space between the tool and the razor, allowing it to slice you. I had never cut myself with my Tweezerman callus shaver so I assumed the person didn&#x27;t know what they were doing. The joke is on me. First time I used it I sliced myself pretty badly- there was lots of blood. The next day I woke up and instead of feeling like I had smooth, soft feet, they stung from random nicks from this razor. Not worth it :/</li>
    <li> I give it two stars because the thin space between the blade is too narrow to get any callous off. You would have to bare down with it too hard to get anything to scrape off and it ends up being too much  of a hassle and possibly even more dangerous than if it just had a wider space. Not sure if that makes sense but it&#x27;s hard to describe what I am trying to say.</li>
    <li> This thing is dangerous. There is too much space between the tool and the razor, resulting in cuts that are way too deep. I hurt myself several times with it. Buy something else, mine went in the trash. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Used correctly, this thing will gross you out. You won&#x27;t be able to stop. But stop. You can be easily hobbled. Still - temporary incapacity might be worth it for shaving off enough disgusting callous to go down a shoe size.</li>
    <li> Be VERY careful. It woks well but very sharp. I cut my foot BIG TIME!</li>
    <li> My callus shaver was received promptly...I have been satisfied with my product ...had previously bought a similar product with a plastic handle and it broke...do not forsee this occuring with this product.</li>
    <li> The blades are exceptionally sharp and cuts through dead skin, but be careful it is extremely easy to cut yourself if you use it with dry skin. ALWAYS SOAK SKIN FIRST!!!</li>
    <li> My previous callus shaver had a very strong plastic handle that finally broke after 25 years.  That model is much more expensive than this one.  This one has a very strong stainless handle but works just as great as my previous model.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> Was NOT impressed with my purchase. Did not even work right</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Make sure to switch out the blade regularly or the blade will break. This is the best one yet and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected .. PERFECT !!!</li>
    <li> The callus shaver itself is great, but the blades are cheap, so replace them with better quality blades.</li>
    <li> Great for tough calluses.  Took off a callus on the outside of my foot which nothing else could get rid of.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality version of the plastic-handled callus shavers I&#x27;ve bought from drug stores.  The one piece steel handle is well built, the blade has the right amount of bend and clearance.  Clearly, you can&#x27;t just go to town on your foot with this, but if used properly it works great.</li>
    <li> Not quality. The &amp;#34;razors&amp;#34; are nothing like the ones used in nail salons.</li>
    <li> The quality exceeded my expections for the price. Nice stainless steal handle.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love the extra blades...</li>
    <li> I was careful using this tool after reading other reviews, not wanting to use six band aids after trying it out. It works well and not one oops occurred. This is a tool everyone needs for a great pedicure.</li>
    <li> It is very good: good price and good product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it took off the skin very well on my heels. It worked well on the side of my toe but it almost seems you&#x27;d be better off buying cheap razors. Yes, I soaked my feet and they were soft. It&#x27;s a hefty little thing. Seems durable. Probably won&#x27;t rebuy the blades though once I&#x27;ve used them all.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was missing a piece or something because it cut my foot the first time I used it. I have used these type blades many times before so I do have a reference to go off of, but this one is NOT good and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool. I am on my feet a lot for work and during school so I tend to get hard skin build up on the pads of my feet. I use this in between my professional pedicures so they don&#x27;t hurt my feet. The blade seems to break very easily but the replacements are very cheap.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything like this again.  Tried to remove several calluses on my feet and always cut too deep and draw blood.  Then I end up with bandages or little cuts on my feet for a week or so until it heals.  Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched how-to videos and followed them closely.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t have the right touch for this thing.  Ended up throwing it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I have started using using a callus stone and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> must have item if u taking care abt your feet. U might need it often or occasionally. I personally found it easy to use on washed, dried feet. Start slightly to enter &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; level.. and depend on you needs. Makes a big different! Moisturize feet after.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t figure out how to use this. I have tried wet and dry. Maybe my callousness places are just not bad enough for it to work. I only managed to removed some tiny skin flicks.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased a Revlon shaver (at Walgreens) and I couldn&#x27;t get that blasted thing to do much but shave my patience down to next to nothing and it didn&#x27;t matter if my feet were dry, soaked and then dried, damp, wet, or sopping wet - that blade just wouldn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my previous experience and the low price of this item, my expectations were pretty low but they needn&#x27;t have been because GOOD GRACIOUS does this thing work. I soaked my feet, well, I soaked myself in a tub but my feet came along for the ride and then dried them well and went to town. My callouses are now a thing of the past and my feet are sandal ready for the Summer.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I sometimes think I don&#x27;t need shoes outside. The blade on this unit is not sharp enough to so much as nick away at my THICK CALLUS. The only upside with this purchase is the durability of the metal handle, as plastic will inevitably break.  June 12, 2015 update: I bought a new set of very sharp replacement blades and the unit works better, but the blade holder does not correctly set the blades on the handle and sometimes slips off when in use. I would NOT have purchased this product to begin with, but I now have a ton of replacement blades to last many, many calluses for years to come.</li>
    <li> Good for removing thick, stubborn calluses on your feet. Razor blades will need to be replaced with time, however, and don&#x27;t forget to sanitize the tool when you&#x27;re finished using it.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. Maybe I do not know how to use it. Wasted my money on this. I look at it every day wondering how they got a patent. Maybe I need my callus to be about 2 inches thick or more for this to work</li>
    <li> Works so much better and sturdier than the dept store versions.  You will need to watch it or you&#x27;ll have a bloody mess!  This will last a lifetime.  Get the replacement blades with it as well.</li>
    <li> When I told my doctor I was about to use this, he urged me not to.  As a diabetic, and a clumsy one at that, he would prefer to take care of my feet himself.  So, I would love to use it, but can&#x27;t.  However, I would recommend it to any non-clumsy diabetic</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take off any skin. No room between the blade and the tool. Tried turning the blade over, upside down, and even changed the blade. Nothing. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Baby smooth hands. I use this to about every two weeks to clear calluses from lifting.</li>
    <li> I was looking to get refill blades for my other shaver and came across this deal with the handle too. It has a tight angle to prevent cutting into the skin too deeply. But I like my other handle a bit better; as far as the angle goes. It works good.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a 5 star rating but the blades that are included are so flimsy that they break in half.  Fortunately, I had blades left over from a previous one that was plastic and those blades are sturdier.  It&#x27;s stainless steel and works very well.  Be careful, this is a professional tool.  Glide lightly.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for this product I decided to purchase it, all the reviews seemed pretty informative. I recently moved to Japan where a pedicure can cost 50$ to start which is way too rich for my blood so I purchased this to tame my foot calluses, I soaked my feet in preparation to shave down the hard rough spots but could not get this shaver to work for the life of me. I tried replacing the blade and positioning it differently, re reading reviews to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just ignorant about how to properly use it, but it simply would not catch the skin. I would not recommend this shaver and most likely will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This thing works terrifically and I am quite pleased with it. I did however accidentally pop the blade off at the start while fiddling with it and I had quite a time figuring out how to put it back on which was simply a pop the blade in the slot, snap it on, and slide by pushing up on the small bar on the back that protrudes. Hope this helps anyone with issues.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this. I have had other shavers that have been more effective. This seems to hold the blade too far from the edge so that it doesn&#x27;t shave anything but the very top off a callus. I&#x27;ll be looking to buy another.</li>
    <li> Since moving abroad, I cannot get this treatment anymore at my local spa.  Nothing works on my tough old feet like this does.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> If you just have a few rough spots in the summer the cheese grater is probably okay, but for those of us with \\&quot;elephant skin\\&quot; feet, this tool is a lifesaver.  No more painful cracks in my heels! I&#x27;m buying one for my dad, who sometimes can&#x27;t walk because of cracks in his feet.  Only drawback is that its a little difficult for me to remove the blades, but I&#x27;m glad they are on there tight when I&#x27;m using the product.</li>
    <li> hard to change blades, blades not sharp, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I do not like to leave negative product reviews, but ufortunately, this item was not up to par. It just wouldn&#x27;t remove anything with a pass. I thought perhaps that the original blade was dull, but even after a switcheroo, the tool did not remove anything - even with extra pressure.  I wish had read the most recent reviews for this product, as most people have the same issue I am. I returned the item and am going to give another a try.</li>
    <li> This arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  It looks just like the picture and does everything that it said it would do.  I don&#x27;t know how to write a review for a product like this - it was like the time Amazon asked me to write a review for a hammer that I purchased, I mean, it was a hammer!  Anyway, it&#x27;s just like the razors that the nail salons uses to get all that nasty stuff off your feet when you&#x27;re getting a pedicure.  It comes with 10 extra razor blades.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Works really well, the trick is to use it after a shower when your heals are soft. But, you need to know when to stop. I got a little carried away my first time using it and ended up cutting myself (which I knew would happen if I tried to take anymore off). My heals look normal now! No more nasty cracks or thick scaly callous. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use a lot of products but I always develop cracked heels. The only way to clear it up by going to the salon. I noticed that this is exactly what they uses in shaving callous. I decided to give it a try and sure enough it works. Make sure that your foot is well soak and soft. Use it gently and slowly until you feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> This works very nicely on calluses and rough skin on your feet. Sturdy simple to use, handle has a non-slip grip,</li>
    <li> I have one word for this product...WOW!!!!!  I have purchased a lot of these tools and while they&#x27;ve all worked, none of them have worked as well as this one has.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the stainless steel that really lets you go to work on your feet or if these blades are just extra sharp. Whatever it is, this one most definitely gets rid of all the dead callousy skin on my feet.  Be careful, if you don&#x27;t let it &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; it will skip and that will cause leftovers that you have to go over again and that isn&#x27;t ideal when you finally reveal lovely fresh pink skin.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to change blades.</li>
    <li> Not worth the extra money, get one at sallys for $3.  This one doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard ... Or the dead skin off your feet for that matter.</li>
    <li> Sucks!  There is absolutely no room between the blade on the holder, regardless of how it is put together.  Being so sturdy, it would&#x27;ve  been awesome with better design.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp.  I had to remove the blade from the metal handle and really dig in to try to even chip away at my callus.</li>
    <li> Sent it back.  First try cut my finger, nothing done to callus.</li>
    <li> This will be the last callus shaver you&#x27;ll ever need in your lifetime. I don&#x27;t know how many I&#x27;ve bought that broke but this beautiful stainless steel callus shaver is beautiful to look at and very easy to use. One blade lasts and lasts, unlike the plastic ones that won&#x27;t use a blade twice. Use with care!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of brands of these. I&#x27;ve bought them from walmart, target, walgreens, cvs and fred&#x27;s (probably other places) in hope I would find one that WORKS. This is funny, but the only reason I gave this one a try was because of a negative review I saw. A girl posted about how she hated it and she sliced herself good because the space between the blade and the tool was &amp;#34;too large&amp;#34;.... I thought to myself, well...that&#x27;s what I NEED!!! All the previous ones I bought had a space too small and never got much off. Only buying this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> LOVE it.  Wish I had found out about these sooner !!</li>
    <li> It shaves my callus easily.  I tried every single shaver sold at the drug store, walmart, and target and they don&#x27;t shave deep enough.  However, this one shaves the way I like it.  I like to shave my callus off like peeling a potato or a carrot.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave callus as thick as a potato peel but somewhat continuous clean peel is what I&#x27;m looking for.  This was great for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this BECAUSE people said it was too sharpin reviews. I want a shaver that will really shave off large ribbons of callus. I could barely get ANY skin to come off. I even tried changing blades twice. Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cut it\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> You can remove dead skin with this. You can also make a bloody mess of yourself if not careful. BE CAREFUL</li>
    <li> It does not work. Do not buy it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Solid shaver. used by a crossfitter. I have never used a callous remover so was not sure what to expect but for the price and quality it was what i expected and read in similar reviews. I enjoy the product and would recommend to others who want to avoid blisters from crossfit style workouts.</li>
    <li> I use this on my heels and sides of my foot. It works great. The razor needs to be changed often, as it does dull easy, but I&#x27;m thrilled with it for the price.Do be careful, it would be easy to cut yourself!</li>
    <li> Bought a cheaper, plastic one at Walmart that worked better.</li>
    <li> This tool stays sharp longer, is sturdy and won&#x27;t break when you drop it, and can get wet without rusting.  It&#x27;s also nice that it comes with additional blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an avid Crossfitter I use this frequently and have never been disappointed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this callus shaver.</li>
    <li> Package came with tool only no razor and no replacement razors !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had my feet &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; before. Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. These are pretty good. But you HAVE TO soak your feet first. Without soaking, these are fairly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ignore my review because I&#x27;m really a novice at this. But if you are a novice too, soak your feet and give these a try.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all, it is hard to hold on to and for some reason it does not remove callus, it was a mistake to buy this one</li>
    <li> Good quality, sturdy construction. Included blades are sharp but look proprietary. Will need to reorder for this specific model.</li>
    <li> Awesome callus shaver - i was a bit intimidated at first but once you get going its as simple as it gets.  works great.</li>
    <li> Cheap, bends when using. A waste of money</li>
    <li> This tool doesn&#x27;t work at all. There is no instructions to show how to use it. I tried several times, and no results. Not sure how people are cutting themselves, I couldn&#x27;t&#x27; even get it shave the hair on my arm.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for any avid CrossFitter! My hands were consistently torn up from pull ups, lifts, ect... Now I can remove the calluses before they tear. My only complaint is that it can shave too deep which will result in a cut. This happened to me the first time using it but I was able to adjust quickly and it hasn’t happened again.</li>
    <li> I have started doing various bar work (toes to bar, pull ups) and when I do more than a few, I quickly develop calluses which then rip off my palms and oh my they hurt when I have to wash my hair that day.  So, needless to say, I have been trying everything to take care of my hands and avoid the ripped palms.  Pumice didn&#x27;t work well enough, fancy creams and moisturizers didn&#x27;t get rid of them, one of those little cheese grater things took forever and didn&#x27;t get close enough to the callus.  But the shaver?  Those calluses are off in a flash.  This totally saved my hands, I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> This razor worked one time and never again.  I even changed the blade and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> This tool works great. Well made. Just make sure you dry it off after every use, if you keep in the shower it will rust quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it four starts because it didn&#x27;t come with instructions and I took the blade out without paying attention and it took me some time to figure out how to put it back in. This little gem is awesome. It was first used on my foot at my salon and I was in love. It is simple to use (make sure your feet are wet first) and it really works.</li>
    <li> This is just what my husband has been looking for.  It works very well...you just have to be careful of the sharpness of the blade. But it does the job.</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this was because it is cheaper than Tweezerman. Since they look similar, I thought it would perform the same job. This thing doesn&#x27;t shave anything at all. I originally thought I had the blade reversed. So I turned it around, upside down, inside out, etc. Nope, it didn&#x27;t work. Then I thought may be it was just THAT blade which went dull. So I replaced a new blade which came with the product. Nope, it didn&#x27;t work at all!!! I have no other choice but to throw it away since this is completely useless. I am going to order Tweezerman instead. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Do not buy does not work!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item three times. The first one deserves 10 stars. I loved it, it was sharp and I was amazed with what I can do with my terrible heels at home. Unfortunately, I left it beside the water and it got oxidized. I threw it away and now I regret. When I bought a replacement, exactly the same item for the exactly the same price but 6-8 month later, it sucked it would not cut at all. I don&#x27;t think it is due to the blade not being sharp, but rather something changed about the position of the blade withing the thingy. I though I was just unlucky to get a defective item, and bought a new one. It was exactly the same as the second one, useless. Today I am ordering a shaver from tweezerman</li>
    <li> doesnt work for me&lt;br /&gt;the one that my pedicure lady down the street uses is much better.</li>
    <li> This product is crap. I could not get any of the blades on and went through all 10 since the broke very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I never did get one on and I sliced open my finger in the process dispute being careful.</li>
    <li> works really well, very sharp</li>
    <li> I sliced my feet open on this. Please use extreme caution.</li>
