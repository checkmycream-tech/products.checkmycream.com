      <li>It hides my tattoos great and the logo is inside the sleeve so nothing to worried about.</li>
      <li>Fits great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for work since it covers everything.  </li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>There is exposed elastic which is great to keep the sleeve in place</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I got the medium size for my calve area and it works great.  </li>
      <li>this tat jacket is great, i wear scrubs at work</li>
      <li>:) Very satisfied!!</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>longer version wanted, otherwise good product.</li>
      <li>Perfect for work on a hot day</li>
      <li>Kind of defeats the purpose, esp.</li>
      <li>The material was nice and did hide the tattoos</li>
      <li>and it just gives a nice layered look.</li>
      <li>Nice color.</li>
      <li>The sleeve is very comfortable</li>
      <li>My tattoos are bold and bright.</li>
      <li>The elastic around the top that suppose to hold it up around your arm stretches out after about one use...</li>
      <li>This is perfect for covering my upper arm while I&#x27;m at the hospital for school.</li>
      <li>I use it for my upper arm and it stays perfectly.</li>
      <li>The fit is good and the material seems of adequate quality.</li>
      <li>I had to tape the top of it to my shoulder with a single piece of bandage tape, and sometimes have to replace the tape throughout the day, but even still it worked perfectly for what I needed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be in search of a better, more comfortable, full coverage product elsewhere because this is just not sufficient for my job.</li>
      <li>and I can easily wear it all day.</li>
      <li>Color is decent and material is good for coverage.</li>
      <li>They cover my tattoos just fine, and stay in place.</li>
      <li>this blends well with clothing and fits great as long as you make sure you get the size for your arm or leg thickness.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and works well.</li>
      <li>If you dont move at all, its great, but im a waitress and constantly running around.</li>
      <li>The tatjacket is comfortable and stays in place.</li>
      <li>Great, need to order smaller size</li>
      <li>It stays on comfortably.</li>
      <li>So when I found tat-jacket I was so happy to find something that wont make me wear long sleeves.</li>
      <li>I was so excited for these bc</li>
      <li>I received it within two days so was excited considering I&#x27;m 7+ months pregnant</li>
      <li>The stitching comes out of these pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Fit great, stay in place, not overly tight like those sport compression sleeves....</li>
      <li>needed a quick tattoo cover for my job</li>
      <li>Absolutely 5 stars!!</li>
      <li>The product fit very well.</li>
      <li>WHERE NEAR form fitting.</li>
      <li>would not advise anyone with a fresh tattoo to use these.</li>
      <li>received the product very quickly the product just didn&#x27;t fit right, is too big for me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more obvious than the tattoo itself!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what my daughter needed to cover her lower leg tatoo.</li>
      <li>I have went to several plastic surgeons trying to get it removed most</li>
      <li>You should wait a bit first.</li>
      <li>but its much better then wearing long sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have a large tattoo on my forearm</li>
      <li>My tattoos are also too big, and higher up on my arms, so the sleeve just needs to cover a little more of the top of your shoulder.</li>
      <li>First off, this is a decent product.</li>
      <li>I have a half sleeve on my right arm and used this for work as a vet tech every day that I wore a scrub top that didn&#x27;t cover it up.</li>
      <li>Slides down my arm very easily.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already much happier.</li>
      <li>The sleeve has a wide rubber band at the top.</li>
      <li>Ordered a pair of these for sunbathing, and although they fit snugly around my bicep they are obviously not designed to go around shoulders.</li>
      <li>Also, if I wore it w/a short sleeve shirt like the girl in the picture and as I thought I  may do, people could read the \\&quot;tat jacket\\&quot; printed on the exterior of the arm band (it&#x27;s at the top) unless I turned the sleeve to put the seam on the top/exterior of my arm and printed words underneath near my armpit.  </li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be the most annoying thing to wear but its actually pretty comfortable and matches my skin tone well, most people dont even notice unless i point it out!</li>
      <li>I have a half sleeve that starts on my shoulder and this product DOES NOT COVER  a good 2 inches of my upper arm between the end of my shoulder cap tank and where the tatjacket sleeve starts.</li>
      <li>To be honest I&#x27;m a small person, but this was NO</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t scooch down and are really comfortable!</li>
      <li>, i highly recommend it..</li>
      <li>but I can see it pulling harshly at a new tattoo.</li>
      <li>I LIVE IN TEXAS.</li>
      <li>Also, shipping for this item is too high considering how light weight and small this item is to ship; I&#x27;m aware of what things cost to ship them via various postal methods.</li>
      <li>White or Black looks more like you&#x27;re wearing an undershirt.</li>
      <li>The problem I have with Tat Jacket is that it is now NOT plain.</li>
      <li>and when I wear short sleeves this sleeve covers it very well.  </li>
      <li>Well I ordered the medium and although it fit, it constantly fell down my arm.</li>
      <li>I have slender arms, there wasn&#x27;t a smaller size avail other than S/M. I had to alter the top elastic to keep it from sliding down.</li>
      <li>say because of the colors it wont remove completely therefore I never wear short skirts or dresses.</li>
      <li>I still have to be wearing a short sleeve shirt to cover tattoos completely.  </li>
      <li>It does what it says, but the elastic band at the top is thick and rough, and not sure if it would be comfortable enough to wear all day.  </li>
      <li>The logo is printed on the outside, but is pretty subdued, and hidden under my short-sleeve uniform.</li>

<li> I got the half sleeves and they cover from about mid bicep to upper-mid forearm, and u can adjust slightly up or down from there.</li>
<li> under a pair of tan stockings this cover up is discreet not completely invisible but much less attention grabbing than my tattoo.</li>
<li> Did not fit properly and kept sliding down.</li>
<li> To big for my small arms</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little itchy after wearing it for more than 6 hours but not too bad.</li>
<li> other than that i recommend this accessory for everyone with half sleeves.</li>
<li> this sleeve is a life saver but it tends to slip down my arm after a while.</li>
<li> No more long sleeve shirts!</li>
<li> Slightly wider at one end/</li>
<li> I recently ordered the small and I am already tired of long sleeves at work</li>
<li> It kept falling down every five minutes!</li>
<li> but did not fit me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The sleeve has a wide rubber band at the top. I found it uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these bc I&#x27;ve worked at my job for over two years and always had to wear sweaters or sleeve shirts to cover my tattoos.... even in summer. I LIVE IN TEXAS. Well I was very disappointed. These things don&#x27;t stay up on your arm. I was constantly having to reposition it throughout the day. It kept falling, and rolling.... uh. Very unhappy. I do not recommend this specific brand.</li>
    <li> To big for my small arms</li>
    <li> The elastic around the top that suppose to hold it up around your arm stretches out after about one use... I got skinny arms so I constantly feel the struggle to keep adjusting it under my sleeve while I&#x27;m working. And I&#x27;m only wearing it a couple hours at a time! I found it easier just to throw a jacket on.</li>
    <li> Ordered a pair of these for sunbathing, and although they fit snugly around my bicep they are obviously not designed to go around shoulders. Slightly wider at one end/longer version wanted, otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> Did not fit properly and kept sliding down. I guess i chose a bad color to since you could see the tattoo through it and defeated the purpose of it any way.</li>
    <li> As a woman, I thought medium would cover my medium size arms but I should have gotten large or X-large and it still doesnt go up to shoulder, so I am disappointed.  I still have to be wearing a short sleeve shirt to cover tattoos completely.  Color is decent and material is good for coverage.</li>
    <li> this sleeve is a life saver but it tends to slip down my arm after a while. other than that i recommend this accessory for everyone with half sleeves.</li>
    <li> I have went to several plastic surgeons trying to get it removed most say because of the colors it wont remove completely therefore I never wear short skirts or dresses. However. under a pair of tan stockings this cover up is discreet not completely invisible but much less attention grabbing than my tattoo.</li>
    <li> The product fit very well. It is comfortable and works well.</li>
    <li> I got this to cover my tattoo at work. If you dont move at all, its great, but im a waitress and constantly running around. It kept falling down every five minutes! So annoying!</li>
    <li> My tattoos are bold and bright. This product isn&#x27;t designed to &amp;#34;fool&amp;#34; anyone butnit lets me wear short sleeve shirts and dressses to work and wherever I like... People who have never seen my ink don&#x27;t think twice and it just gives a nice layered look. They don&#x27;t scooch down and are really comfortable! Absolutely 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Way too big for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> My new employer didn&#x27;t even know I have a half sleeve</li>
    <li> Great product but did not fit me.</li>
    <li> This sleeves forearm and lower bicep.  I work for an agency that does not allow visible tattoos.  I have a large tattoo on my forearm and when I wear short sleeves this sleeve covers it very well.  The sleeve is very comfortable and I can easily wear it all day.</li>
    <li> needed a quick tattoo cover for my job this blends well with clothing and fits great as long as you make sure you get the size for your arm or leg thickness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for work since it covers everything.  The only problem I had was that with just moderate amount of movement it would slide down my arm. Sizing runs big.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my daughter needed to cover her lower leg tatoo. Fits great. Now she can wear short dresses to work. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Had to have something to please my in-laws so it works but I hate covering my tattoos</li>
    <li> First off, this is a decent product. Yeah, it does it&#x27;s job. But I hate the fact I have to wear this in our judgmental, hypocritical society.</li>
    <li> Slides down my arm very easily. Totally useless. It&#x27;s more obvious than the tattoo itself!</li>
    <li> It stays on comfortably.</li>
    <li> I work in a hospital and got sick of wearing long sleeve undershirts to cover my tattoos, I found these cover ups and they work as expected. I got the half sleeves and they cover from about mid bicep to upper-mid forearm, and u can adjust slightly up or down from there. Fit great, stay in place, not overly tight like those sport compression sleeves....definitely recommend if you need to cover up for work.</li>
    <li> The material was nice and did hide the tattoos but it was to small so I returned it and exchanged for a larger size.</li>
    <li> Item is as described, but for something marketed as \\&quot;tat jacket\\&quot; not sure why they decided to print their name on the exterior of the arm sleeve! Kind of defeats the purpose, esp. since  I am using it to cover scars, not tats.  It does what it says, but the elastic band at the top is thick and rough, and not sure if it would be comfortable enough to wear all day.  Also, if I wore it w/a short sleeve shirt like the girl in the picture and as I thought I  may do, people could read the \\&quot;tat jacket\\&quot; printed on the exterior of the arm band (it&#x27;s at the top) unless I turned the sleeve to put the seam on the top/exterior of my arm and printed words underneath near my armpit.  Also, shipping for this item is too high considering how light weight and small this item is to ship; I&#x27;m aware of what things cost to ship them via various postal methods.</li>
    <li> The tatjacket is comfortable and stays in place. I think I pull it up once or twice in a 12 hour shift. The logo is printed on the outside, but is pretty subdued, and hidden under my short-sleeve uniform. I only need one at a time, so the two pack works well when I need to throw one in the wash.</li>
    <li> Shipping time was great!! I received it within two days so was excited considering I&#x27;m 7+ months pregnant and it&#x27;s been in the 90s here which is very uncommon for the pnw! I have a half sleeve that starts on my shoulder and this product DOES NOT COVER  a good 2 inches of my upper arm between the end of my shoulder cap tank and where the tatjacket sleeve starts. I work at a busy coffee stand and it is constantly rolling down even further and sliding out of place. The &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; are insanely irritating on my skin, enough so it&#x27;s leaving an ugly red mark and bumps on my skin. I suggest the company makes a product that can FULLY cover upper arm sleeves (including shoulders!!) without having to wear a men&#x27;s 6 pack of Hanes tshirts along with it. I&#x27;ll be in search of a better, more comfortable, full coverage product elsewhere because this is just not sufficient for my job.</li>
    <li> To be honest I&#x27;m a small person, but this was NO WHERE NEAR form fitting. it was very loose on my skin, and was difficult to get to stay in place. My tattoos are also too big, and higher up on my arms, so the sleeve just needs to cover a little more of the top of your shoulder.</li>
    <li> I have slender arms, there wasn&#x27;t a smaller size avail other than S/M. I had to alter the top elastic to keep it from sliding down. I would probably get White or Black next time. People always ask if you hurt your arm when you have the Nude color covers on.  White or Black looks more like you&#x27;re wearing an undershirt. Otherwise, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I got the medium size for my calve area and it works great.  It&#x27;s a little itchy after wearing it for more than 6 hours but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Perfect for work on a hot day</li>
    <li> These tat cover up sleeves are really great. I have a half sleeve on my right arm and used this for work as a vet tech every day that I wore a scrub top that didn&#x27;t cover it up. I had to tape the top of it to my shoulder with a single piece of bandage tape, and sometimes have to replace the tape throughout the day, but even still it worked perfectly for what I needed :) Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be the most annoying thing to wear but its actually pretty comfortable and matches my skin tone well, most people dont even notice unless i point it out!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for covering my upper arm while I&#x27;m at the hospital for school. No more long sleeve shirts! Yay!</li>
    <li> Good product. Works great. Nice color. Showed up on time. Would recommend to anyone wanting to cover up tattoo.</li>
    <li> I got these to wear on my upper arms while at work.  They cover my tattoos just fine, and stay in place.</li>
    <li> This sleeve is incredibly short. It doesn&#x27;t come fully to the elbow as shown in the picture here. If you have a half sleeve, this will not cover it completely which defeats the purpose of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working at my job for years and finally decided to finally get my half sleeve done despite the no tattoo guidelines. So when I found tat-jacket I was so happy to find something that wont make me wear long sleeves. Well I ordered the medium and although it fit, it constantly fell down my arm. I recently ordered the small and I am already tired of long sleeves at work and I&#x27;m already much happier. Its a bit snug, i&#x27;ll probably have to take it off durring breaks but its much better then wearing long sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise anyone with a fresh tattoo to use these. You should wait a bit first. There is exposed elastic which is great to keep the sleeve in place but I can see it pulling harshly at a new tattoo.</li>
    <li> received the product very quickly the product just didn&#x27;t fit right, is too big for me</li>
    <li> this tat jacket is great, i wear scrubs at work so it covers my tats perfectly, i highly recommend it..</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase of this cover up sleeve. I use it for my upper arm and it stays perfectly. It hides my tattoos great and the logo is inside the sleeve so nothing to worried about.</li>
    <li> I think the title explains itself. The fit is good and the material seems of adequate quality. The logo is a poor choice - IMO.</li>
    <li> Great, need to order smaller size</li>
    <li> Works well. Keeps people from work giving me grief about seeing my tattoo below the sleeve.</li>
    <li> Yes it works. It covers tattoos. The problem I have with Tat Jacket is that it is now NOT plain. It has the TatJacket logo on ALL of their products. This, to me, defeats the purpose. I just wear long sleeves now. The stitching comes out of these pretty easily. I&#x27;d say mine last about a month of daily use before they are destroyed. I hand wash these and air dry them so there is no reasont hey should be falling apart.</li>
