      <li>/&gt;Second time doing this one by itself and very happy.  </li>
      <li>Color picture is perfect.</li>
      <li>BEST RATING FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with great hair after all I&#x27;ve done to it.  </li>
      <li>I have had great luck with Garnier Nutrisse.  </li>
      <li>A friend who is a beauty stylist recommended Excellence or Superior Preference</li>
      <li>This is a good color.</li>
      <li>still as good as it was 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>I got good gray coverage.</li>
      <li>I wish I were younger and did not have to color my hair, but Loreal makes the best hair color and lightest auburn is the best color for me.</li>
      <li>I love it and my hair feels great after coloiing.</li>
      <li>This most be a popular color as I have great difficulty finding in when I am in need.</li>
      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>The scent is overwhelming!</li>
      <li>The Lightest Auburn is a nice option because it still lightens and brightens quite a bit--</li>
      <li>Good color, favorite brand.</li>
      <li>Loreal Preference did a stunning job with the brunette portion of my hair, turning it a gorgeous auburn.  </li>
      <li>FRESH, AND JUST WHAT i WANTED, WITH A GOOD PRICE!</li>
      <li>This product is a perfect match for my wife&#x27;s natural color.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner provided is excellent and after using, the newly-dyed smell was completely gone from my hair.</li>
      <li>but all in all, hair is in great shape, very healthy, natural looking color.  </li>
      <li>It does have a chemical smell, but in a room with no vent or window, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I love my hair color and get lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>All I want is a medium auburn or medium reddish brown (mostly reddish).</li>
      <li>:) After a couple of times at the salon, it was time to give it a go.  </li>
      <li>Love experimenting with my hair.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good results, just wanted lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buying several on-line has become my way to do it, it keeps me stocked for a couple of months, and the price is so good here that even with postage I&#x27;m not paying much more than if I did pick it up at Target or Wally World.</li>
      <li>It is so nice to find exactly the right color on line and not have to go to 3 stores to get it.</li>
      <li>This is getting returned first thing tomorrow!</li>
      <li>developed gray at the temples and one spot at the above the forehead - covers those areas nicely, while providing additional body to my very fine but plentiful</li>
      <li>but the undertones are more natural.</li>
      <li>The dye also successfully lightened the slightly darker pre-dyed ends of my hair evenly.</li>
      <li>I will pay a little more and go back to John Freida foam, a bit more money but a much better product!</li>
      <li>Hair is soft and easy to manage</li>
      <li>The rest of my hair was mostly a medium brunette previously dyed with Garnier Nutrisse 63 (Light Golden Brown).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this dye for people with lighter brown or pre-dyed reddish hair within two or three shades of the dye color, looking to achieve a nice natural-looking red color-</li>
      <li>: Made my hair feel smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m aware there will be an odor</li>
      <li>People think this is my real hair!</li>
      <li>and I gave in to dying my hair for the first time in a year with this,</li>
      <li>It is closest to my natural color, but for some reason, this shade is rarely found in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>I should have know better than to order it since the price was so much lower than any other offers.</li>
      <li>I normally buy this in the stores, but everytime I went in to buy it, it was not there.</li>
      <li>I had been using Preference Intense Red Copper, but as I&#x27;ve passed 40, that looks a bit too orangey and Crayola-ish on my medium brown hair (less than 5% gray, but my face can&#x27;t handle such bright colors right next to it).</li>
      <li>So now when I go to the store, I&#x27;ll look for the new picture.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions for new color and applied to gray, then roots, then through the ends.</li>
      <li>However, my final haircolor was exactly the color on the box.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and cheaper than my local drug store, assuming they have this color.  </li>
      <li>Would prefer a little more red in it.  </li>
      <li>Darkened it and gradually began going into the reds, professionally.  </li>
      <li>The color looked very Crayola red while setting.</li>
      <li>This brightened up my dark hair very well, and I will definitely be ordering this light auburn shade again in the future.</li>
      <li>Looks like the actual color of my hair, very natural.</li>
      <li>My natural color is a sandy brown/blonde with some grey in front, which was dyed a medium ginger red/brown.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, it has continued to color my hair (including white roots) too dark.  </li>
<li> I had been using a more expensive box dye kit with highlights and base color for a few years, but wanted to try this one to save a few dollars.</li>
<li> I was afraid to even try to use the product lest if be old and out of date for safety reasons.  </li>
<li> I have very thick curly hair, past shoulder length, so I purchased two boxes.&lt;br</li>

<li> but sadly I must cancel.</li>

<li> So bad, my eyes watered and it took my breath away.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m VERY disappointed.</li>
<li> Probably one of the worst smelling hair dyes I have ever used (and I have been dying my hair for 20</li>
<li> The worst hair color product I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
<li> And it smells awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is the same hair color I have been using for years. Exactly as described and cheaper than my local drug store, assuming they have this color.  This most be a popular color as I have great difficulty finding in when I am in need.</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect match for my wife&#x27;s natural color.  Preparation and application is standard for hair coloring.</li>
    <li> The only color I order.  I love it and my hair feels great after coloiing.</li>
    <li> Good color, favorite brand. Looks like the actual color of my hair, very natural.</li>
    <li> Love experimenting with my hair.  Thank G-d I&#x27;ve been blessed with great hair after all I&#x27;ve done to it.  Before this color, Lightest Auburn, I had platinum blonde.  Darkened it and gradually began going into the reds, professionally.  Really chicken at the thought of having pink hair at 60 :) After a couple of times at the salon, it was time to give it a go.  Began with RA (think that&#x27;s the number), found it too dark for me then next time mixed that one and 7LA.  Pretty good results, just wanted lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second time doing this one by itself and very happy.  Would prefer a little more red in it.  My hair comes out lighter than the box but all in all, hair is in great shape, very healthy, natural looking color.  I would go for 4 1/2 stars review, just not available.  Again only because I would like a little deeper shade than what I get.</li>
    <li> I had been using Preference Intense Red Copper, but as I&#x27;ve passed 40, that looks a bit too orangey and Crayola-ish on my medium brown hair (less than 5% gray, but my face can&#x27;t handle such bright colors right next to it). The Lightest Auburn is a nice option because it still lightens and brightens quite a bit-- it&#x27;s definitely a red, not a reddish-brown-- but the undertones are more natural. People think this is my real hair!</li>
    <li> I had been using a more expensive box dye kit with highlights and base color for a few years, but wanted to try this one to save a few dollars. My natural color is a sandy brown/blonde with some grey in front, which was dyed a medium ginger red/brown. I have very thick curly hair, past shoulder length, so I purchased two boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye is slightly drippier than the kit I had used previously, but not super runny. It does have a chemical smell, but in a room with no vent or window, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming. I followed the instructions for new color and applied to gray, then roots, then through the ends. Even with a lot of hair to cover, I had about half a bottle left over. I started the 25 minute wait as soon as I had finished applying. The color looked very Crayola red while setting. When I rinsed, the rinsewater was pink. However, my final haircolor was exactly the color on the box. There was no purple-y tone, which I&#x27;ve had with auburn dyes before and the roots were not &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; or any redder/ oranger/ brassier than the rest of my hair. I got good gray coverage. The dye also successfully lightened the slightly darker pre-dyed ends of my hair evenly. The conditioner provided is excellent and after using, the newly-dyed smell was completely gone from my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any damaged feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this dye for people with lighter brown or pre-dyed reddish hair within two or three shades of the dye color, looking to achieve a nice natural-looking red color- my hair is close to it&#x27;s reddish/ strawberry blonde from childood after use.</li>
    <li> I tried Loreal Preference 7LA today.  I had white roots.  The rest of my hair was mostly a medium brunette previously dyed with Garnier Nutrisse 63 (Light Golden Brown).  Loreal Preference did a stunning job with the brunette portion of my hair, turning it a gorgeous auburn.  Alas, it turned my white roots pink.  If you have brunette hair, this will work well.  If your hair is white or grey, I would not recommend it at all.  I have had great luck with Garnier Nutrisse.  It is a lot easier on my hair.  Unfortunately, it has continued to color my hair (including white roots) too dark.  That&#x27;s why I decided to try this Loreal Preference 7LA (Lightest Auburn).  A friend who is a beauty stylist recommended Excellence or Superior Preference 6R.  I will try that next.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll be back to Garnier Nutrisse.  However, the Garnier is A LOT easier on your hair than Loreal.  But even if I only do my roots, for some reason Garnier bleeds into the rest of my hair when I&#x27;m trying to wash it out and I end up with really dark hair.  All I want is a medium auburn or medium reddish brown (mostly reddish).</li>
    <li> I normally buy this in the stores, but everytime I went in to buy it, it was not there. When I purchased this from Amazon, I thought they sent me the wrong color. They just changed the picture on the box. So now when I go to the store, I&#x27;ll look for the new picture.</li>
    <li> I wish I were younger and did not have to color my hair, but Loreal makes the best hair color and lightest auburn is the best color for me. I hope they never stop making this color because I don&#x27;t think a similar color is on the market.</li>
    <li> BEST RATING FOR A GREAT PRODUCT. FRESH, AND JUST WHAT i WANTED, WITH A GOOD PRICE! Color picture is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the shade I prefer, and for whatever reason none of the stores carry it around my area.  Buying several on-line has become my way to do it, it keeps me stocked for a couple of months, and the price is so good here that even with postage I&#x27;m not paying much more than if I did pick it up at Target or Wally World.</li>
    <li> It is closest to my natural color, but for some reason, this shade is rarely found in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have developed gray at the temples and one spot at the above the forehead - covers those areas nicely, while providing additional body to my very fine but plentiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered five or six, arrived carefully wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerry Gennace</li>
    <li> Pros: Made my hair feel smooth and soft. Looks shiny. I do like the color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Did NOT cover my grays at all! And it smells awful. Probably one of the worst smelling hair dyes I have ever used (and I have been dying my hair for 20+ years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had subscribed to save but sadly I must cancel. Going back to Garnier products.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Hair is soft and easy to manage</li>
    <li> I love my hair color and get lots of compliments. I just wish it would stay for a longer time on my grey hairs.</li>
    <li> The boxes were opened, torn and faded.  I was afraid to even try to use the product lest if be old and out of date for safety reasons.  I should have know better than to order it since the price was so much lower than any other offers.</li>
    <li> The worst hair color product I&#x27;ve ever used!! This didn&#x27;t cover any of my grey, and I only have a little at my hairline and by my temples. The scent is overwhelming! So bad, my eyes watered and it took my breath away. I color regularly so I&#x27;m aware there will be an odor but this is unreal. It was also difficult to saturate all my hair. I will pay a little more and go back to John Freida foam, a bit more money but a much better product!</li>
    <li> It is so nice to find exactly the right color on line and not have to go to 3 stores to get it.</li>
    <li> This brightened up my dark hair very well, and I will definitely be ordering this light auburn shade again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a good color.</li>
    <li> Love it.  One of the very few natural looking reds.</li>
    <li> still as good as it was 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> It just turned my hair a darker shade of blonde and gave it ZERO hint of red. It looks nothing like on the box. This is getting returned first thing tomorrow! Not only did I waste time and money, but my hair is VERY sensitive to chemicals and I gave in to dying my hair for the first time in a year with this, and now I have a hair color I don&#x27;t want with all of the stress of chemicals on my hair, all for nothing. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed.</li>
