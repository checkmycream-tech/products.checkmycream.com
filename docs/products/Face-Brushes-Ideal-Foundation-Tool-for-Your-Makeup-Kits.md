      <li>It is easy to clean too.</li>

      <li>It is a good size for gripping, not too long or short.</li>
      <li>It was nothing to really get excited about.</li>
      <li>Not only would you get a better finish, but you&#x27;d get a super soft, dense, easy to use, and overall amazing brush.</li>
      <li>It is soft enough to blend my liquid foundation.evenly, smoothly and lovely.</li>
      <li>It is a pretty pearl handle.  </li>

      <li>This brush is not dense enough for me, so I feel like I have to blend more than I would with the F80.</li>
      <li>It is so soft and smooth application.</li>
      <li>I am going to order the second one :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush and will consider purchasing again!</li>
      <li>The price is also reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to test it for Miqqi.  </li>

      <li>Makes my makeup seem professionally done!</li>

    <li> I had no problem with the brush, but see very little difference in the way my foundation looks after applying it with this brush.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes.It is soft enough to blend my liquid foundation.evenly, smoothly and lovely. I am going to order the second one :)</li>
    <li> I choose it for the price.  I brought two.  One for me and the other for my daughter in law.  She loves it.  You can put blush on perfectly.</li>
    <li> So impressed! My foundation comes out flawless and the packaging was adorable! Definitely would be purchasing another one some time soon!</li>
    <li> Just received mine today and I am impressed with the quality. Soft hair and very easy to clean, and it has an elegant look about it. Feels much more expensive than what I paid for it!</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  I very rarely put on makeup, but this brush has made it so easy to blend my foundation, that I think I will be putting on makeup much more often.  I would rate this with 5 Stars. Thank you for a great product.  Pat</li>
    <li> I am in love with Miqqi&#x27;s Kabuki Brush.  I was lucky enough to test it for Miqqi.  I tested this brush by using it to apply a mineral foundation followed by a translucent powder.  Then finished with a blush.  I was amazed by the ease of using this brush.  I received amazing coverage.  The bristles on the bottom of the brush are somewhat coarse and firm, but the top of the brush is very soft. I will be recommending Miqqi&#x27;s Kabuki Brush to everyone I know! Thanks Miqqi!</li>
    <li> I received this brush the other day and I have to say that I am absolutely delighted !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this brush, I have found that the foundation application is distributed evenly all over my face!  The liquid&lt;br /&gt;looks smooth and perfectly applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder the professionals use these brushes on their clients&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If 10 stars were possible...I would give this brush every one of them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush online.  It is a pretty pearl handle.  I use it for powder finish foundation, and it works nicely. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush for mineral makeup.  It is very soft and the price was excellant,,</li>
    <li> Beautiful and high quality brush. Works wonders when applying my makeup. Fantastic service! Great followup on your purchase.  Cannot ask for more.</li>
    <li> I love this brush i use it every day. This brush is easy to clean and very soft and the bristles don&#x27;t shed easily. Great product I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ecellent brush, delivers the foundation evenly.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend insists on wearing makeup, even though she&#x27;s a natural beauty. Of course, perhaps I&#x27;m biased (and maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be admitting that), but I think she&#x27;s stunning. Her old brush was looking a bit worn out, so I gave her this brush. She also has sensitive skin and this brush, or bristles, is softer than her last brush. And while she doesn&#x27;t need makeup, she certainly looks beautiful with it as well and perhaps the brush has some magical qualities about it, because she looked magnificent on our date night last night.</li>
    <li> This brush, in my opinion, is not fantastic, but decent. Let&#x27;s start with the cons. If you, like me, are looking to buy this brush as a dupe for Sigma&#x27;s F80, you will be disappointed. This brush is not dense enough for me, so I feel like I have to blend more than I would with the F80. The hairs on this brush also come off easily. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brush I received, but the hairs just were not secure and I feel if I wash the brush, a lot more hairs will come out. The bristles are also not very soft. They&#x27;re not scratchy, but not super cuddly either. Though you have to work more to blend it out and work with the brush a little, the finish it gives is very nice. It made my foundation look nice and blended and smooth. I also loved the packaging and the fact that it came with a brush guard! However, since this brush is only $8 cheaper than the F80, I would spend the extra money and get the F80. Not only would you get a better finish, but you&#x27;d get a super soft, dense, easy to use, and overall amazing brush.</li>
    <li> The brush works well for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like other brushes like this one.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great look, very soft, and nice quality.  The price is also reasonable.  I highly recommend this brush and will consider purchasing again!</li>
    <li> It was nothing to really get excited about. It was not like when you order something &amp; you get it &amp; it&#x27;s like WOW THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing work! Makes my makeup seem professionally done!</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive brush but surprisingly, it is excellent for foundation application. The bristles are soft enough to spread color evenly and only minimal use of product is needed. The brush needs to be cleaned after each application to avoid bacteria build-up and hardening. It is a good size for gripping, not too long or short. I would buy it again and seek out  other products of this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend was unimpressed, but said for the money it was good enough.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! It is so soft and smooth application. It is easy to clean too. It reminds me of the Kabuki Flat top brush from Sigma but at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Brush is smaller than I thought. Does the job though.</li>
