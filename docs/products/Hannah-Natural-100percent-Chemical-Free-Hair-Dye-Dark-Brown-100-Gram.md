      <li>My hair is healthy and the exact color I wanted.</li>
      <li>I noticed that the hair that is covered stays moist and absorbs the dye better, but if it dries out too fast it does not color as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really rub my scalp to make sure I get all the henna off.</li>
      <li>and I found this to be true.</li>

      <li>I put one package of henna and one of indigo into a 4 cup glass measure and add 2 cups of very warm, almost hot, distilled water with a couple drops of essential oil added.</li>

      <li>Love this all natural dye!</li>
      <li>Great color, a bit messy and smelly</li>
      <li>It mixed up nicely and went on well/</li>
      <li>while on and right after-</li>
      <li>My healthy hair shines and the color is natural, consistent, and those that are very close to me have told me that my hair is pretty and shiny.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly like Henna</li>
      <li>It is no longer frizzy but soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>but it goes away after the first wash.</li>
      <li>Results are- great, dark silky color that softened and added shine to my already soft and shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>Pretty color</li>
      <li>first time I did it</li>
      <li>I left the henna in my hair for more than 2 hours and NOTHING changed.</li>
      <li>Works REALLY well!</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it my grays were covered pretty well</li>
      <li>It is no longer frizzy but soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>A week later I colored it the 2nd time as the directions say the 2nd coloring will be the best</li>
      <li>Today I used it for the second time and the color is even more darker.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even work and this is not my first time working with henna.</li>
      <li>My hair color is a beautiful dark brown...not too dark or light.</li>
      <li>Very smooth consistency covers the grey parts well.  </li>
      <li>The second time I tried this product I was more patient while rinsing and didn&#x27;t have as much breakage</li>
      <li>or I&#x27;ll be pretty much hairless.</li>
      <li>I have used other natural hair dyes and this is superior quality.</li>
      <li>but I got a big headache from the strong smell.</li>
      <li>certainly won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here but my hair is really not doing well. I noticed the breakage as I was rinsing my hair and now its even worse as it&#x27;s drying. I&#x27;ve used about 3 hennah/indigo based dyes before this and have never had this result. On the contrary, I was shocked at how healthy my hair had gotten. My hair feels the way it did BEFORE I started using henna/indigo based dyes. Pretty horrible. I&#x27;m half convinced this isn&#x27;t chemical free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t even work and this is not my first time working with henna. I originally wanted to dye the blonde highlights of my hair dark brown to match the rest of my hair. I left the henna in my hair for more than 2 hours and NOTHING changed. Blonde hair is still blonde. I&#x27;m gong to try the second packet again tomorrow and leave it in longer, but after my first attempt I&#x27;m not expecting any significant results. Only good thing about this product is your hair will feel healthier after.</li>
    <li> Will reorder.  Great color, a bit messy and smelly while on and right after-but what it does is worth the time,slight mess, and slight lingering herbal smell.  My healthy hair shines and the color is natural, consistent, and those that are very close to me have told me that my hair is pretty and shiny.  I appreciate something so good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the color because I got the dark brown &amp; that could mean anything from light brown or black knowing hair coloring as I do. This is exactly like Henna and that&#x27;s a good thing. My hair was dark brown but I&#x27;ve been covering up an old highlight I had for about a year so you could see the blonde pieces of hair underneath the semi-permanent coloring. I&#x27;ve been waiting to have it cut off but my hair grows super slow &amp; I can&#x27;t trim very much off at a time or I&#x27;ll be pretty much hairless. Anyway, the hair color is great....You just mix it with warm water &amp; stir it until the lumps are gone. It&#x27;s the consistency of ketchup... Or it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I covered it with a plastic bag and left it on for an hour. Washing it out took a long time but it was totally worth it! My hair color is a beautiful dark brown...not too dark or light. It&#x27;s shiny and look very healthy. I&#x27;ll get this again.</li>
    <li> My hair was blonde and I was sick of it and wanted to get my hair back to brown (my original color is auburn, but brown was close enough for me). I bought this because I&#x27;m from Seattle and am health conscious and like organic things that don&#x27;t harm the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions and it says to pour the contents into a bowl and add water until correct consistency. I&#x27;m a broke college student so I&#x27;m like &#x27;dude, I don&#x27;t have a bowl,&#x27; but I have a big cup and a fork so I make do. However, as I mix it, my nose is assaulted by the smell. I know that some people like strong scents (like marijuana, I suppose?) but I can&#x27;t stand them and I think it actually smells horrible. I&#x27;m a trooper, though, so I mix it and start coating my hair. It feels horrible in my hair, smells horrible, and my hair is green and I&#x27;m annoyed and uncomfortable but I put the shower cap on and wait for about an hour and a half before stepping into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely difficult to rinse out, it feels like I have sand in my hair (which took a long time to get the majority out, and yet, I still feel like there is dirt collected at the roots), and I just go with it. I have to condition a LOT because it&#x27;s so hard to get out! I&#x27;m annoyed again and I work at it and step out of the shower. There was no residue left behind on my towel and that&#x27;s good (sometimes colors do that) and I walk up to the mirror and notice 1) that my hair is a terrible mixture of colors but is not consistent nor can it really be considered &#x27;brown&#x27;, 2) my hair is green, 3) the smell has finally turned my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a new dye by Clairol without ammonia and then started to deal with this mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues after dying: Everything smells like it. My head smelled bad and I had classes and people kept asking what that &#x27;god awful&#x27; smell was, to which I promptly apologized for and suffered embarrassment over. My hair also felt disgusting and was difficult to brush, I actually had to leave in my conditioner in order to brush this disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy to know that my dye came in the mail today and my hair has promptly been corrected and feels significantly better and doesn&#x27;t smell like rotting compost.leave in my conditioner in order to brush this disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy to know that my dye came in the mail today and my hair has promptly been corrected and feels significantly better and doesn&#x27;t smell like rotting compost.</li>
    <li> Love it! The color stays in longer than most other products. I use a tsp of salt as it is suggested and also use strong black tea instead of just hot water  in its preparation. Today I used it for the second time and the color is even more darker. And the best thing I liked about this product is that it is much easier to rinse off! Great product!</li>
    <li> Works REALLY well! Excellent chemical-free coloring. Followed the recommendation and added salt. Color came out a very pretty dark brown. I have tried other brands but this deposited color the best.</li>
    <li> My hair is healthy and the exact color I wanted. I have ordered this several times now, and haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it yet. There is a strong smell of the green tea that is in the dye but it goes away after the first wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this product and will be using it from now on.  I thought it was very easy to apply and it covered all my gray.&lt;br /&gt;I left my hair wet when applying the product even though the directions say to wash and dry hair first.  I think this is a super discovery I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
    <li> Great way to naturally color your hair</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on white hair, or doesn&#x27;t color my hair at all.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the kind of quick results that you would get from a chemical dye, you probably won&#x27;t like this product. It works best when you use it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks. I leave the product on for several hours and apply heat for 15 minutes or so during that time. It will dry out if it isn&#x27;t covered well--a 2 dollar shower cap rather than the one in the package works well, especially if you have very long hair as I do. To wash it out easily, I work in a large amount of conditioner before getting in the shower.</li>
    <li> Not at all effective.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for those who want to try natural hair color!! The color does not stay on too long, but the box says that you have to apply a few times before it will start showing up all the way, but I saw the color right away.  Can&#x27;t wait for my next application !!</li>
    <li> This product is not made for my scalp. I have an extremely sensitive scalp. I have yet to find a hair dye that has not caused me to have an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for many years with a permanent hair color. I recently decided to try something a little more natural, as my hair was getting thin and breaking off in small pieces. I did some research online and decided to go with Hannah Natural. I have used this product for a couple of months and I am pleased with it. My hair has regained its health, becoming thick, full, and shiny again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are not real specific, but with trial and error, I have come up with a system that works for me. The dark brown  henna leaves a reddish hue on my hair, so I mix it with Hannah Indigo. There are two packages of powder in each box. I put one package of henna and one of indigo into a 4 cup glass measure and add 2 cups of very warm, almost hot, distilled water with a couple drops of essential oil added. I stir it until all the lumps are gone and let it cool about 15 minutes. While the mixture is cooling, I prepare for coloring by gathering towels, cotton balls, a plastic grocery bag, a squeeze bottle, a comb, and a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fasten a dark hand towel around my neck. Then I pour half of the mixture into the squeeze bottle (I cut the opening a little larger so that the mixture can come out). I part my hair with a comb and squeeze the mixture out, just like I would do for regular hair coloring, parting and squeezing color in sections. When all of the roots have been saturated, I take the remaining mixture and pour it slowly over the rest of my hair, rubbing it evenly through to the ends. I take a plastic grocery bag and cover the whole mess, twisting it in the front so that it is closed tightly. I twist a dark bath towel over the bag, then poke cotton balls around the hairline. This is important, as the mixture will run and go everywhere if you don&#x27;t. I still get the occasional drip, so I keep a dark wash cloth handy, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two hours, I get in the shower and thoroughly wet my hair, getting as much of the mixture out as possible. My hair is a little stiff and brittle feeling at this point, so I put a palm full of conditioner into my hair, starting at the roots and working through to the ends. I let it sit while I shower. I rinse my hair again, until the water runs clear. I condition for a second time, using less this time, rubbing it through and rinsing immediately. I really rub my scalp to make sure I get all the henna off. My hair is soft and smelling pretty good at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! I dry and style as usual. My hair is soft and full and just the color I want it without harsh dyes or chemicals. My hair is longish, so I use two packages, but you can use less if your hair is shorter.</li>
    <li> Aweful. Just tried it yesterday. Left it on for 1 hour and a half as suggested and color did not stay. I tried to get a refund, however, it was past the refund window since I bought it about a month ago.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> What a horrible mess. Pretty color but I will never purchase again. This color comes with two packages of dry mix, one shower cap and one pair of gloves. It is extremely messy to mix. It says to add water to the consistency of ketchup and salt to darken. Then it says to apply with a comb (not included). My comb pulled my hair out and I couldn&#x27;t apply more than 2\\&quot; of color to my hair that way so I spread it with the gloves. It was such a mess and so hard to spread I had to use both packages to get my medium length hair colored. Directions say for best results leave on for 2 hours...whaaaa! I did this and by the time I rinsed it was drying in my hair and I could not rinse it all out. I conditioned and rinsed 3 times. Not only did the dye get all over my towel, I was picking out dried green paste the next day. It has been 10 days since I have used this product and dye is still coming off onto my towels. I have gotten a couple of complements on my color, and it does look very nice but it is absolutely not worth it to me. The only suggestion I have is to mix in a squeeze bottle and use dark towels that you do not care about, and be prepared for a long couple of hours!</li>
    <li> Works very well. I have used other natural hair dyes and this is superior quality. It mixed up nicely and went on well/ The color was great and has only deepened with time.</li>
    <li> Difficult to get in your hair but I used one pack. (Comes with two) (I waited for a over a month to try it out.) because I was unsure about it. Mixed it with water, a little salt, put it in my long hair which is brown and put on with gloves.  I put the cap on over my that I clipped up.  I waited over two hours and took a long shower washing three times and conditioning 3 times.  Results are- great, dark silky color that softened and added shine to my already soft and shiny hair.  Very happy. Will reorder when back in stock.</li>
    <li> Great quality henna.  Very smooth consistency covers the grey parts well.  Will get another to enhance the color as directed.  Very healthy for the hair!</li>
    <li> You need to learn how to use it .It take me  a couple of times to understand that it needs to be keep moist.so far so good.</li>
    <li> I received  my package soon, I couldn&#x27;t wait until i use it,I followed direction they provided with the product; sadly nothing happened anything?.my hair color didn&#x27;t change.To be honest it was bad hair color i ever used. I would not  buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great - all natural and easy. I read the reviews, and thought I would try it. If you use very little water, dry hair, (as instructed on the package) and mix the powder to a thick clay , there is no need for cotton, baggies, caps, no mess, no  drips, it dries and you can  do other things. I left it on a few hours, and then used warm water with the shower, and just let the water soften the henna until I could rinse it out. My hair feels soft and thick. Ive used it twice now, and notice the differenc ein texture and color. I wish Id have used this years ago!  It is supposed to saturate more with each use. I am using it as a treatment weekly now, and it really helps cover the grey.  I llike the smell. Its potent, yes, a woodsy, grassy, earthy, farmlike, forest, fresh, alive smell...  way better than the chemical dyes Ive ben using.  Update 7.7.17 I have been using this for months now, my hair is noticably thicker and healthier, and the dark color remains longer as well.</li>
    <li> Worked well, color is very natural.  Comes with two applications.  Didn&#x27;t stain everything in my bathroom like chemical dyes do. I left it on for an hour and a half and it covered my greys well.  Will use again.  This was my first try at a natural product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  True to the color,  easier to remove then others,  and left my hair feeling nice.</li>
    <li> For me at least, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Once you wash your hair, the color goes with it.  Complete waste of time, I just threw the whole thing away after one use.</li>
    <li> Worked great. It had a funky smell....but it beats chemicals. Will definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> I used this product for two months with three applications to cover up my gray hair. I wanted to try something more natural and less harsh on my hair. I have curly fine hair that frizzes and breaks off easily. The first time I tried it my grays were covered pretty well but I got a big headache from the strong smell. Everyone in my family wrinkled their noses at me during the four hour development process. It was really tough getting this stuff out and the mud like texture of the product caked to my roots. I ended up with a lot of breakage while trying to remove the henna and brushing was tough too. The second time I tried this product I was more patient while rinsing and didn&#x27;t have as much breakage but it didn&#x27;t cover my grays as well as before. I added ground cloves to the mixture which helped with the smell so I didn&#x27;t get a headache. After the third try with this product my hair color seemed uneven and my roots were salt/pepper. I bought some ammonia free hair color the following week and evened it all out. My henna experiment is over!</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit tedious to have to use a brush to apply and leave in for 2 hours but I loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;My hair came out a nice, even brown - even though it has been chemically processed A LOT over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It was also great that there was no chemical smell to stink out the bathroom and if I spilt the dye on the counter or myself it easily came clean.</li>
    <li> Love this all natural dye!</li>
    <li> Good, bu needs longer time to dye.</li>
    <li> I think is so massy! color was very nice ,gray coveredge 3%</li>
    <li> Did not dye at all !!! I even did it a second time and left it on for double the recommended 60 minutes !! I want a refund</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve done everything to it in every shade of the rainbow. Recently I have been paying my stylist an exorbitant amount of money to color my hair, cover the gray, etc. and my hair was crazy dry/frizzy. I decided to give henna a try. I admit I was a little nervous to try this. It sat in my cabinet for at least a month or more. I have a lot of gray and my husband was trying to convince me to just let it grow out natural (he&#x27;s super cheap and money is his motivation), but I just don&#x27;t look good with gray hair. My skin is so pale it just washes me out. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this, but as I had read the longer you keep it on your hair the darker and better the results, I pretty much just left it on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did it I just did it myself and it is difficult to work with - like putting very thick mud on your hair and as it coats and dries in your hair it is nearly impossible to comb and green. I coated my hair the best I could and put on a shower cap. The smell is not unpleasant (especially if you are used to using chemical dyes); it smells herbaceous, tea-like. Oh, and it was a greenish in color. It looked like I had coated my hair in greenish mud. The second time I applied it I had my husband help and this was much better as he was able to really make sure it covered up the grays. I wore 2 shower caps to make sure none of the hair was exposed to air. I noticed that the hair that is covered stays moist and absorbs the dye better, but if it dries out too fast it does not color as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I rinsed it out of my hair I was quite worried as my hair didn&#x27;t feel very good. I loaded it up with conditioner, rinsed, and dried it as usual. I was shocked. My hair was glossy, dark, and looked like my natural color (I kinda sorta  remember what that looked like). A week later I colored it the 2nd time as the directions say the 2nd coloring will be the best and I found this to be true. I am thrilled with the color and feel of my hair. It is no longer frizzy but soft and smooth. Its been a long time since my hair felt this way. I am absolutely thrilled with this product. The fact that I can color my hair and make it feel and look its healthiest is just fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product so long as you are willing to spend a little (or a lot depending on the color you want) more time coloring than you would with a chemical dye. I just picked a weekend day where I had no plans and lounged around the house, put a mask on my face, painted my nails, and just enjoyed my day. You cannot expect this to work in 20 minutes like a chemical dye. I should mention too that its been about 2 weeks since I colored my hair and I personally think it looks just as good. If there is fading, I have yet to notice it. However, I will update this review if I do have any problems. Also, my hair is wavy, fine, dark brown, just past my shoulders and about 50% or more gray. One packet was perfectly adequate, although I did use it all. If you had longer hair you may need more, but there are 2 packets in the box.am thrilled with the color and feel of my hair.
