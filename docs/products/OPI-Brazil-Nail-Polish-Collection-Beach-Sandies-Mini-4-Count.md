      <li>I really hope they come out with the regular sized bottles of these.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to get it on smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the yellow but the other colors are very pretty.</li>
      <li>The rough sand texture means that you can fix mistakes without having to remove all of the polish and redoing the whole nail.</li>
      <li>I like a smooth, shiny finish and this is dull and rough.</li>

<li> Not normal OPI quality at all!</li>
<li> - haven&#x27;t tried the pink yet.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s rough and clumpy.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t normally finish an entire bottle of polish before I get bored with the color</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very rough.</li>
<li> but they were very small.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with opi.</li>

    <li> I love OPI nail polish but it can be a bit pricey so when I saw this cute little set I had to have it. I love that I got 4 different colors for the price of one. I don&#x27;t normally finish an entire bottle of polish before I get bored with the color so this was perfect. The texure of the polish feels like sand...I really like that. The quality is excellent (as always). I do my nails on Sunday evening and I&#x27;m good to go for a week..even without a primer &amp; top coat. I will definitely be purchasing more of these tiny gems!</li>
    <li> Nice bright colors but they were very small.  Wife was happy tho, so I&#x27;m happy. You can&#x27;t go wrong with opi.</li>
    <li> Love Item! Great Item!!! Works Great!&amp;#34;</li>

    <li> Pretty colors but the sand texture isn&#x27;t nice. It&#x27;s very rough. I like a smooth, shiny finish and this is dull and rough.</li>
    <li> great colors long lasting polish!</li>
    <li> I am very surprised that the reviews are so high. Not normal OPI quality at all! Very gritty and it&#x27;s hard to get it on smooth, this nail polish is nothing like OPI&#x27;s sparkly polishes. It&#x27;s rough and clumpy. I don&#x27;t see how anyone is getting smooth coats.</li>
    <li> love the colors of the sands&lt;br /&gt;but not the texture/ lasting ability&lt;br /&gt;tried with and without top coat&lt;br /&gt;doesnt last like regular OPI</li>
    <li> them are nice, pretty colors, but them aren&#x27;t bright!</li>
    <li> I got those for the End of the School Year. The teachers of my children&#x27;s school loved it!!</li>
    <li> dull coloring, only one of the colors looks nice, weird texture</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; fast service!!!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, and OPI is very good.</li>

    <li> Wow! Vibrant colors. Goes on smoothly and even. Best part is because of their size you dont have to choose what colors to pack. You can take them all. Ready for all life&#x27;s surprises.</li>
    <li> Exactly as they look. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> good mini sizes for a kids gift!</li>
    <li> Love the texture and colors. The rough sand texture means that you can fix mistakes without having to remove all of the polish and redoing the whole nail. Stays on well and is removed easily with OPI polish remover.</li>
    <li> This collection has sand in the polish which gives it a very cool look on your nails! I can&#x27;t describe it, but I loved how my nails looked. The only thing that was a little dissapointing, but not a deal-breaker, was that the sand wore down as you use your hands and they became more dull looking.

    <li> Takes too many coats to get good color but ok.</li>
