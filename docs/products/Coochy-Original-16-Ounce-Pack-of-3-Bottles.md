      <li>First I want to say the product I received is not like product shown.</li>
      <li>I only use this for shaving &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas and it always leaves me smooth!</li>
      <li>It conditions and softens hair so much more than standard shaving cream</li>
      <li>Leaves your body feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>We thought we were buying &amp;#34;coochy&amp;#34; from Pure Romance.</li>
      <li>but the particular scent has something in it that makes me break out! ....</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.</li>

      <li>whatever is in this new package but suppose to be the same is not!</li>
      <li>It does say on the bottle  new packaging but same product.</li>
      <li>The new and improved version is not exactly the same but pretty damn close.</li>
      <li>However I really feel that you should take down the old pictures and put up</li>
      <li>I had already bought the new package with the same writing about same product and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> We thought we were buying &amp;#34;coochy&amp;#34; from Pure Romance. This IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!!!!!!!!. The smell is terrible! It&#x27;s almost to the point of not usable. I&#x27;ve put a few drops of essential oil in the bottle to try and at least make it bearable. If you are looking for Coochy from Pure Romance, we will be VERY disappointed this this. I would avoid</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a really good item I&#x27;ve been buying it for a long time now</li>
    <li> Love it have used for years</li>
    <li> I received the new bottles and was not happy. It is not what is in the picture. I was looking for the old type and thought that was what I ordered.</li>
    <li> First I want to say the product I received is not like product shown. I purchased this because it showed the original Coochy package so there for thought it would contain the original Coochy shaving cream. However it came in its new packaging and with an altered product inside it( in my opinion). It does say on the bottle  new packaging but same product. I had already bought the new package with the same writing about same product and didn&#x27;t like it. I know it&#x27;s suppose to be the same but I don&#x27;t feel this is true. I have used the original for a few years and loved it! Nothing but praise. Sense using this new packaged product (that is not the same in my opinion) I have had nothing but problems. Itchy skin, raised red bumps and razor rash.(yes I changed my razor to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the problem)  The true original none of this was ever problem. whatever is in this new package but suppose to be the same is not! The true original is a thinner silkier creamy feeling to it. This new package but original is thicker and less silky feeling. It also has a slight fragrance where as the true original did not have any. I would hope i am not the only one who this feels way about it. Please give me back true original product which I use to love!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a bottle at a party and just loved this product.  I was so excited to see that I could buy the same product online.  Leaves your body feeling so soft and smooth.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Been using it for years! The best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, but the pump dispenser is a little difficult to use.  It shoots a very small stream at an odd angle, making it more difficult to use.  Overall, still a good product.</li>
    <li> Product was perfect and so was shipping thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Skin stays soft with no breakouts! Nice smell!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this ever so I order three to four bottles at a time.I did like the old bottle type.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t possible say enough good about this product!!</li>
    <li> My husband shaves his head every other, product leaves his skin super soft.  A little product goes a long way.  Original smells nice too.</li>
    <li> The bottles pictured are not what I received, it came in the new bottles and I hate the pump on them but fortunately I had kept an old bottle, so I&#x27;m good until that pump wears out. The new and improved version is not exactly the same but pretty damn close. However I really feel that you should take down the old pictures and put up the new so one knows what to expect.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described</li>
    <li> Love the product. It is in the newer style bottle with the less desirable pump but that is how things go. I will say that the packaging wasn&#x27;t great which is why the missing star. The plastic wrapped all 3 bottles together then put it into a padded mailing envelope. Nothing leaked but all the caps on the bottles were broken. Doesn&#x27;t effect product or function just not ideal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for at least ten years, and love it!  It feels like you&#x27;re shaving with conditioner and lotion in one. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I am very mad that the picture and description says its the oh so original... and I got the pear berry I purposely did not order the pear berry because I am not fond of the scent I bought it last time and I think that it made me break out...I have been using these products for forever and love them...but the particular scent has something in it that makes me break out! ....so beware it is not the same product that is in the picture.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Even my husband uses it on his beard.</li>
    <li> Great product,great price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years. It conditions and softens hair so much more than standard shaving cream</li>
    <li> Great!! Different styled bottle but same product. Delivery was fast. Second time buyer. Will be back!!!</li>
    <li> I only use this for shaving &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas and it always leaves me smooth!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time. I like the way it smooths your skin for shaving. Will keep buying this as long as I can keep getting it</li>
    <li> my husband refuses to shave his face with anything else since the first time i bought this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves his face incredibly smooth, no razor bumps, no redness, etc.  either he loves the results or the name! Lol!! Either way, he wont use anything else. Oh yeah. Obviously its excellent for its intended purpose as well!! Sorry :-)</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, this is my daily shave cream.</li>
    <li> the picture is wrong for this item. they sent me &amp;#34;pear berry&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> The pictures are not correct in what i received....&lt;br /&gt;The pump does not work on any of them... I was extremely disappoited!</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it says: &amp;#34;No Razor Rash&amp;#34;!  Packaged as needed &amp; super fast ship!</li>
