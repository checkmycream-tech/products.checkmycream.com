      <li>The Axe Shower Gel, Cool Metal goes on cool and clean with a strong scent that stays with you for a while.</li>
      <li>what I do know is the smell is quite unique.</li>
      <li>Ooh, the menthol gives a nice refreshing tingle, especially to one&#x27;s axilla  and groin regions.</li>
      <li>For \\&quot;Cool Metal\\&quot; there is Zinc and Quarts ground up into powder and blended in with the soap.</li>

      <li>This is probably my least favorite when it comes to scent but does leave the skin feeling good</li>

      <li>I use several of these scents, doesnt break me out even with my sensitive skin and smells great.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unique and doesn&#x27;t really resemble any well-known scent I can think of.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some might be sensitive to the strong scent at first, but it mellows out after you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Like product very much can no longer find in stores</li>

      <li>The high minty feel it brings off</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>less hassle for me to smell good after a day spent underneath the car.</li>
      <li>and you can always try something new.</li>
      <li>Those with sensitive skin use with caution.</li>
      <li>As far as the benefits of this I dont know, but</li>
      <li>Only detected by those very close to you, as it should be.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the scent, although that&#x27;s a personal preference.  </li>
      <li>So thats when my doctor told me to stop using it because i have sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>Good stuff to get you back in the game.  </li>

<li> My only complaint of Cool Metal Body spray is it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the menthol and citric acid or the zinc and quartz, but there is something in this product that really irritates the skin....</li>
<li> only objective thing I can add to this review is that this gel does not contain any of the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; texture like some of the other Axe shower gels.  </li>
<li> this is a bit different smell then other gels, stronger than others, lasted longer after shower.</li>
<li> Not as long as some of the other scents.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used all the other AXE scents with no issue.</li>
<li> Some days I am in the mood for it, and other days I am not.</li>
<li> You are either going to love it or hate it, plain and simple.</li>
<li> Scent was dull and the gel left a greasy feel on my skin.</li>
<li> but like I read here,either you will love it or hate it.</li>
<li> What ever you do, DO NOT clean your face with this.</li>
<li> It would be unfair for me to give this anything less than 5 stars because I never smelled it prior to ordering it on Amazon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe the scent -</li>
<li> The only Axe shower gel that has ever disappointed me.</li>
<li> eff this crap</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, good price</li>
    <li> Hubbies favorite of all the scents but it is the hardest to find.  So glad Amazon had it so I can keep it around for him.</li>
    <li> My grandsons love Axe.</li>
    <li> Always have love the smell and the cooling/menthol feel if this axe product. Great buy all the way!!</li>
    <li> Like product very much can no longer find in stores</li>
    <li> I bought one of these because i figured hey its a body wash and cologne combined, less hassle for me to smell good after a day spent underneath the car. But nope, after a week of use i started breaking out and my doctor told me to switch my body wash and see it clears up. sure enough, it did... but just to make sure i went ahead and used it for another two days and yep, i started breaking out again. So thats when my doctor told me to stop using it because i have sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> I love Axe, I even use my husbands own. Smells nice and lathers well, so I will be buying more. Only issue with this one is that it will burn the lady parts. The high minty feel it brings off feels burnish</li>
    <li> Ooh, the menthol gives a nice refreshing tingle, especially to one&#x27;s axilla  and groin regions. Now I look forward to my showers Haha.</li>
    <li> this is a bit different smell then other gels, stronger than others, lasted longer after shower. i like it. maybe will get another like this one when this runs out.</li>
    <li> The only Axe shower gel that has ever disappointed me. Scent was dull and the gel left a greasy feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> A &#x27;gritty&#x27; shower gel.  Not as gritty as say, pumice based soap, but gritty enough to scrub pine sap out of my arm hair.  Also, it&#x27;s infused with menthol, so you feel nice and cool after working on a hot day.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> has a nice mild smell to it</li>
    <li> I love Axe Products and use shampoo,soap body sprays by Axe. Different scents as well.Deep Space is a close second to this,Phoenix is nice but like I read here,either you will love it or hate it.I do love the smell of Cool Metal.I cannot find it in town though.My only complaint of Cool Metal Body spray is it doesn&#x27;t last long.Not as long as some of the other scents.I still give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells really nice, very refreshing and invigorating smell. And it feels very fresh and clean after the shower.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use this s***!!! it causes intense itching and feels like a rash...eff this crap</li>
    <li> After two or three days I had red splotches all over my body. A good deal of itching followed. Stopped using it and it went away within one shower. I&#x27;ve used all the other AXE scents with no issue. Not sure if it&#x27;s the menthol and citric acid or the zinc and quartz, but there is something in this product that really irritates the skin....</li>
    <li> I like axe but this one is not there for me, the smell is fair, it&#x27;s the intense burning feeling, especially in &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas. Maybe it&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s experience, but this one isn&#x27;t for me. Those with sensitive skin use with caution.</li>
    <li> Bought this as part of a gift set for my brother. I was really surprised about the actual size of the product, for the price I paid for it. This is a great bargain, I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of axe products.</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s packaging claims &amp;#34;UNLIMITED FEMALE ATTENTION&amp;#34; in all caps. I&#x27;m here to tell you that claim is a 100% true fact.</li>
    <li> Axe Shower Gel, Cool Metal, 16 Fluid Ounce is an awesome shower gel.  I use several of these scents, doesnt break me out even with my sensitive skin and smells great.  This is probably my least favorite when it comes to scent but does leave the skin feeling good</li>
    <li> Not the best from Axe, but it works</li>
    <li> Good stuff to get you back in the game.  Good fragrance and not too powerful.  Only detected by those very close to you, as it should be.  Stop filling up the elevator with your scent.  Fragrance is for two, and only two.  Okay, maybe three, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. What ever you do, DO NOT clean your face with this. My husband played a trick on me and I listened to him and washed my face with it and It burned my eyes. lol</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this scent anywhere locally so I purchased it here as an add-on item.  I didn&#x27;t really care for the scent, although that&#x27;s a personal preference.  I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe the scent - it&#x27;s unique and doesn&#x27;t really resemble any well-known scent I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only objective thing I can add to this review is that this gel does not contain any of the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; texture like some of the other Axe shower gels.  I personally prefer the ones with the gritty texture, but again that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of cool on my skin. Menthol soap is something that may be an acquired feeling, but if you like it as I do, then this is the body-wash for you! I would buy it and have without hesitation. I think that the man in your life will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I like how AXE uses different ingrediants to compliment their body washes. It makes me feel like I am not just using soap on my body. For \\&quot;Cool Metal\\&quot; there is Zinc and Quarts ground up into powder and blended in with the soap. As far as the benefits of this I dont know, but what I do know is the smell is quite unique. You are either going to love it or hate it, plain and simple. I am sort of on the fence with it. Some days I am in the mood for it, and other days I am not. It would be unfair for me to give this anything less than 5 stars because I never smelled it prior to ordering it on Amazon. The way I see it is that it&#x27;s soap, and it will run out sooner or later and you can always try something new. I would roll the dice on this if you are up to it.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash on the market today.  It smells great.  It does a great job cleaning you, and helping to keep you clean feeling/smelling.  The cool feeling is great if you shower after you shave.  It also works as a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This shower gel lathers and smells great! It comes in a good size and is a true value for the money.</li>
    <li> The Axe Shower Gel, Cool Metal goes on cool and clean with a strong scent that stays with you for a while. Some might be sensitive to the strong scent at first, but it mellows out after you get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> great for the summer makes me feel cooler in hot weather</li>
    <li> wow definitely worth the money this is a big bottle and a great value,, smells nice and works great this is a must buy</li>
</ol>
