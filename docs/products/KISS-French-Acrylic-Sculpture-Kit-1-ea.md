      <li>Including a longer brush, more acrylic powder, primer, and a nice plastic case for all of it.</li>
      <li>Overall, this was a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>These were okay not quit what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>everytime we want to feel cute.</li>
      <li>I prefer being able to redo it myself if something happens than getting it done and not being able to match nail polish or anything like that,...</li>
      <li>I found a kit there for 5 dollars more than this one that included much more that was also Kiss brand.</li>
      <li>Safer and cheaper but more upkeep.</li>
      <li>This Is Okay</li>
      <li>I got  this at wal mart I love it, it comes with everything I need.</li>
      <li>I love this kit.</li>
      <li>The brush is okay ish.</li>
      <li>But the instructions were very clear and can be beautiful if you follow directions.</li>
      <li>pretty good.</li>
      <li>My very first ever doing and using acrylic on my own.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be nice to try and do my nails at home to save some money, and I thought it would be fun.</li>
      <li>this product is sooo easy to use yes</li>
      <li>Practice makes perfect and I&#x27;m sure youll get the hang of it after a few applications!</li>
      <li>Great overall</li>
      <li>Too much of a challenge for me to do my own nails.</li>
      <li>totally worth the money!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still new at doing my own nails, but I still like it.</li>
      <li>was also not screwed on right!</li>
      <li>I now use full acrylics and just carry nail glue with me.</li>
      <li>The product is great though, just like every other Kiss product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>but you can work your own little magic for a little happy and</li>
      <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
      <li>right,....</li>
      <li>I have gel nails on right now</li>
      <li>So really my complaint is that the glue is too good and the nails are too strong.</li>
      <li>The only thing that could make it better for me is if it came with more french tips.</li>
      <li>worked pretty well, but takes practice,....</li>
      <li>this is your first time-</li>
      <li>, this was my first time with a nail kit.</li>
      <li>really simple instructin to follow, has most of what says is there.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the first nail I did</li>
      <li>think I would consider is getting another brush, mine didnt hold up-I ended up tossing it after my first set was on.</li>
      <li>Nail tips have clear part and look more natural.</li>
      <li>but I feel I got a good use out of it since it is just a small kit.</li>
      <li>This is good for beginner acrylic users (like myself), however the brush I received was small and the bristles were messed up.</li>
      <li>Smells like the real deal, including primer.</li>
      <li>One should make sure to read carefully because it does not come with nail primer.</li>
      <li>I went through them really fast.</li>
      <li>The whole thing is really made me upset.</li>
      <li>put too much</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;nails did come off faster than anticipated, but this glue is a lot better and stronger than what comes with some other kits,...</li>
      <li>It was pretty fun to try, but I&#x27;ve made a decision that this product is not for me as I simply don&#x27;t have the dexterity to do my non-dominant hand, it took forever, and I do not like the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
      <li>but i like the cheap pink glue for first timers.</li>
      <li>proved to be a worthy buy and definitely something that keeps giving as my supply has yet to be completed.</li>
      <li>, they look like a salon did them (for the most part I could use a little practice around the sides, but you can&#x27;t tell just by looking at them)&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Just make sure the brush is wet enough because this acrylic dries FAST</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to do my very own acrylics because it&#x27;s so expensive to get them done</li>
      <li>If you are new too nails</li>
      <li>I ended up having to order a new brush.</li>
      <li>but ok yes ur able to do ur nails thwy look good for t he first day because by the second day they start to chip from the base up to the point that it looks worse than if a rwgular refill is  needed.</li>
      <li>Just wanted to make that clear :</li>
      <li>but it takes a professional to do the acrylic until now</li>
      <li>its in complete if you ask me</li>
      <li>This product is cheap and a waste of time.</li>
      <li>instruction says the file in it has a buffer to make buff up your nails for a &#x27;natural shine&#x27;</li>
      <li>The clean up was a mess though.</li>
      <li>definitely be looking into some higher quality stuff that might last me longer!</li>
      <li>It may just take some practice, and I will probably try again with the clear nails just to see the difference between the white and the clear.</li>
      <li>Only use if you&#x27;re a professional who went to beauty school and knows how to do both dominant and non-dominant hand.</li>

<li> I would starts with another set of full acrylics to get the hang of false nails,and then move on to these.&lt;br /&gt;The nail glue dried so fast</li>
<li> Then, I did not get enough of the acrylic product on my nails, so they are a little too thin, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
<li> The acrylic liquid wasn&#x27;t properly screwed on so my entire package was wet with the liquid and the powder</li>
<li> The nail glue bottle is empty and there isn&#x27;t really enough nails....</li>
<li> Definitely be careful of getting the acrylic on your skin because even if it&#x27;s a tiny bit, it&#x27;ll hurt like hell when it lifts.</li>
<li> Worse yet after I finished and wore my new nails for a week I hit my hand on a shopping cart and took off half of my natural nail.</li>
<li> I cut the nails a little too short.</li>
<li> This product was a huge disappointment for me.</li>
<li> I always thought acrylic would be harder to do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> my only problem with this product was that the glue had dried in the tube before I ever used it.</li>
<li> It was very rough and just not cooperative.</li>
<li> and it will be chunky and will take forever to file down.</li>
<li> The nails lasted less then a day before one broke off</li>
<li> I had the acrylic powder sealed tight in the jar so this should not happen.</li>
<li> this was a waste of my money, how can I try this product if half the stuff needed for it is ruined when I receive it??</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> worked pretty well, but takes practice,....&lt;br /&gt;I put too much and then you have to file it off forever, but at the same time you can keep working on it applying and filling till you got it right,....&lt;br /&gt;nails did come off faster than anticipated, but this glue is a lot better and stronger than what comes with some other kits,...&lt;br /&gt;and I prefer being able to redo it myself if something happens than getting it done and not being able to match nail polish or anything like that,...</li>
    <li> Did not stay on at all</li>
    <li> It worked amazing! But unfortunately, the nail liquid and powder would not close and spilled inside the plastic kit; I taped both shut but it did not work, they still spilled. Now every time I get it out of my nail box, the smell of acrylics stinks up my room. They stayed on about 9 days and then fell off. Truth be told, I didn&#x27;t follow instructions and put on 3 coats so that may be why, I&#x27;m not sure, this was my first time with a nail kit. But the instructions were very clear and can be beautiful if you follow directions. The clean up was a mess though.</li>
    <li> The nail glue bottle is empty and there isn&#x27;t really enough nails....The whole thing is really made me upset. If there was enoguh of nails and glue this would&#x27;ve been a great buy....</li>
    <li> My wife wanted these. Just wanted to make that clear :D. She likes these because it&#x27;s cheaper than going to a salon. She&#x27;s very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> We all cant afford to pay anywhere from 15-50 dollars everytime we want to feel cute. Its just not always possible. This kit however for just...I think 10 bucks? proved to be a worthy buy and definitely something that keeps giving as my supply has yet to be completed. It cant give you the same pampering feeling as going into a nail salon but you can work your own little magic for a little happy and thats just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only think I would consider is getting another brush, mine didnt hold up-I ended up tossing it after my first set was on. So thats something to consider...</li>
    <li> My very first ever doing and using acrylic on my own. Awesome and easy,  never thought I&#x27;d be able to save money and do it all by myself!  Love this!</li>
    <li> The brush was the worst thing about it ! It was very rough and just not cooperative. The acrylic powder hardened after about a week. I had the acrylic powder sealed tight in the jar so this should not happen.</li>
    <li> When I recieved it the nail glue was dried out! The acrylic liquid wasn&#x27;t properly screwed on so my entire package was wet with the liquid and the powder was also not screwed on right! I am do mad this was a waste of my money, how can I try this product if half the stuff needed for it is ruined when I receive it??</li>
    <li> When I order this I had order arcylic sculpture kit and had type of french tips in it but all of a sudden wen im checking on my order it pop up arcylic sculpture kit french tip I will never order from this company again because what I order I didnt recieve the actually type</li>
    <li> This product was a huge disappointment for me. They came off after a week. I will stick to the Nail Salon.</li>
    <li> Honestly I think the product is great for home acrylic sculptures and it saves a lot of money too. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nail kit.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this item yet, I plan on using it when I break a nail.  I have gel nails on right now and I wish to switch back to acrylic and I am hoping that this item is similar to the Lee Nails I used to buy back in the &#x27;80&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I got  this at wal mart I love it, it comes with everything I need. Smells like the real deal, including primer.</li>
    <li> Very easy to do. Definitely be careful of getting the acrylic on your skin because even if it&#x27;s a tiny bit, it&#x27;ll hurt like hell when it lifts. The product is great though, just like every other Kiss product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This Is Okay But If You Buy This You Also Need To Buy Nail Primer Or The Nails Wont Stay On. I Was Not Happy That It Didnt Come With It.</li>
    <li> I ordered two.The bottle of nail glue in the package arrived in one package solid as a rock. The nail glue in the second package&#x27;s bottle had exploded. This was very disappointing. I should have just bought it from the grocery store instead.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very easy to use</li>
    <li> Great for beginners! I&#x27;ve always wanted to do my very own acrylics because it&#x27;s so expensive to get them done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time- they wont look perfect. Practice makes perfect and I&#x27;m sure youll get the hang of it after a few applications! (: My nails look great (for a first timer) and my friends keep asking where i got them done! totally worth the money! Great!</li>
    <li> When I recieved the product; the products had already been used. Nail tips were missing, the acrylic liquid had waste on the product and everything was messy. The powder had already been opened, so I disgarded the product and I will not purchase another product because the one that I recieved was not in the condition that it should&#x27;ve been in. Which means it was shipped that way.</li>
    <li> pretty good. i like it. really simple instructin to follow, has most of what says is there. instruction says the file in it has a buffer to make buff up your nails for a &#x27;natural shine&#x27; but it&#x27;s not so my nails ended up lookin like poo</li>
    <li> These were okay not quit what I was expecting. Too much of a challenge for me to do my own nails.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product! I ordered the regular unpolished salon nails with the acrylic kit &amp; went I went to track my order, the picture &amp; item changed from what I already paid for, to this! I&#x27;d better get what I paid for or I&#x27;m going to raise all types of hell! I&#x27;ll be back to let you guys know!</li>
    <li> Though the brush was horrible quality i ended up using a qtip.&lt;br /&gt;i also didn&#x27;t think the tips would be so short.&lt;br /&gt;the acrylic powder and liquid were perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always gone to the nail shop to do my nails, well no more nail shop for me this product is sooo easy to use yes anyone can glue nails but it takes a professional to do the acrylic until now this is exceptionaly great. Everyone thought I got my nails done. I will always use this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product, just a bit powdery appearence when it dries. Not for people who&#x27;s never done acrylic before. Great overall</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. Only use if you&#x27;re a professional who went to beauty school and knows how to do both dominant and non-dominant hand. It&#x27;s not rocket science but it&#x27;s just a little too difficult and time consuming for me.</li>
    <li> I will only go to a salon from now on because of this product. The nails lasted less then a day before one broke off and they looked cloudy. I&#x27;ve done my own nails before with professional products and they came out perfect. This product is cheap and a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to do acrylic nails on my self. The kit includes everything you need and everything in it is up to my standards. However, after purchasing it, I went to Wal-Mart in search of a similar kit to compare the prices. I found a kit there for 5 dollars more than this one that included much more that was also Kiss brand. Including a longer brush, more acrylic powder, primer, and a nice plastic case for all of it. I would have rather paid the extra bucks. Overall, this was a wonderful product. I have done 3 sets of nails and a fill in and still have a bit left. Wonderful Product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this kit. I&#x27;m still new at doing my own nails, but I still like it. The only thing that could make it better for me is if it came with more french tips. I went through them really fast.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be nice to try and do my nails at home to save some money, and I thought it would be fun. It was pretty fun to try, but I&#x27;ve made a decision that this product is not for me as I simply don&#x27;t have the dexterity to do my non-dominant hand, it took forever, and I do not like the results I&#x27;ve gotten. For one, I glued a couple of the nails a little off kilter. I also should have bought artificial nail trimmers, instead of just using my home nail clippers. I cut the nails a little too short. Then, I did not get enough of the acrylic product on my nails, so they are a little too thin, but it&#x27;s not terrible.  It may just take some practice, and I will probably try again with the clear nails just to see the difference between the white and the clear. It&#x27;s still a great product, and I enjoyed experimenting with it. Simply a matter of operator error.</li>
    <li> this is a horrible product I don&#x27;t know what about it or why but ok yes ur able to do ur nails thwy look good for t he first day because by the second day they start to chip from the base up to the point that it looks worse than if a rwgular refill is  needed. I would think twice before getting this garbage again</li>
    <li> I like the nail tips, does not come with primer. Nail tips have clear part and look more natural. I was missing a #10 nail tip. The brush is okay ish.</li>
    <li> Received the item on time. It came with everything as described in the detail box. One should make sure to read carefully because it does not come with nail primer. I&#x27;ve used it twice on myself and my friend and it&#x27;s about gone now but I feel I got a good use out of it since it is just a small kit. Only reason I gave it four stars is because it did not include primer. Other than that, I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
    <li> my only problem with this product was that the glue had dried in the tube before I ever used it.</li>
    <li> If you are new too nails (like I was) I would starts with another set of full acrylics to get the hang of false nails,and then move on to these.&lt;br /&gt;The nail glue dried so fast there was not time to fix mistakes. Great if you know what you are doing but i like the cheap pink glue for first timers. Worse yet after I finished and wore my new nails for a week I hit my hand on a shopping cart and took off half of my natural nail. OUCH!  So really my complaint is that the glue is too good and the nails are too strong. I now use full acrylics and just carry nail glue with me. Safer and cheaper but more upkeep.</li>
    <li> This is good for beginner acrylic users (like myself), however the brush I received was small and the bristles were messed up. I ended up having to order a new brush. Everything else in the kit works properly. Just make sure the brush is wet enough because this acrylic dries FAST and it will be chunky and will take forever to file down.</li>
    <li> the kit is ok but it doesnt have primer wtf how can i do my nails without primer...its in complete if you ask me</li>
    <li> I had just used the Lightless Gel Kit and didn&#x27;t have too good of results. I always thought acrylic would be harder to do.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong, and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the first nail I did, they look like a salon did them (for the most part I could use a little practice around the sides, but you can&#x27;t tell just by looking at them)&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be looking into some higher quality stuff that might last me longer! Just so I can buy in bulk ;P</li>
