      <li>I still use this amazing shampoo.</li>
      <li>I really liked the amount of lather it produced as well.</li>
      <li>The smell is good and strong.  </li>
      <li>Gee, I loved this shampoo and it does a super job!  </li>
      <li>So I try this, and can tell you that the smell is similar, but there is not tinkling sensation on your scalp nor do the smell remain on you after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a suave product, it smells good during wash and was ok with it, but the price is perfect.</li>
      <li>good stuff for cheap price.</li>
      <li>so many other great shampoos on the market that are awesome for hair care</li>
      <li>The first week it looks and feels great</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo is another brand and 10x the price.  </li>
      <li>I love Suave products.</li>
      <li>but I love it!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I think it leaves my hair softer and more nourished than Aveda even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even my hairstylist is suprised how healthy my hair has become.</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>The mint is so overwhelming that it reminds me of hospital soap.  </li>
      <li>and I really am glad,  </li>
      <li>And it feels refreshing on your head too.</li>
      <li>I like the Suave all in one shampoo way better and wish it came in more scents than just one.</li>
      <li>I like the Aveda brand better</li>
      <li>Silky smooth, with no split ends!</li>
      <li>Its my favorite shampoo/conditioner I have ever used</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all I have to say :)</li>
      <li>I love smell</li>
      <li>Silky smooth, with no split ends!</li>
      <li>I had to get used to this smell at first, but it is a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>So I want to do my best to keep it clean and healthy, because it is intended to last another person quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is SO good (like spearmint, which I really like), and it didn&#x27;t cause my asthma to flare up this time as well.</li>
      <li>We have a huge rosemary plant in our kitchen</li>
      <li>even though the smell does not last all day - it is a great product.</li>
      <li>but than it their cheap wax starts to pile up and build up on your hair and scalp, causing all those problems.</li>
      <li>There is definitely some sort of chemical component of this that isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>but this is a cheap alternative.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy mint.</li>
      <li>scent is quite nice and it certainly gets my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>I love it soooooooooooooooooo much!</li>
      <li>Well first of all, it&#x27;s cheap, and you get a lot of it!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a lovely scent very invigorating!  </li>
      <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Aveda Rosemary Mint --</li>
      <li>It smells just like the Aveda version and gets my hair just as clean.</li>
      <li>My husband and I do not have special needs in a shampoo</li>
      <li>Normally, I prefer unscented products, but this rosemary-mint combination smells good and really wakes you up in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are allergy prone, have sensitive skin, or eczema of any kind, you might want to avoid this product.</li>
      <li>I even got my sister stuck on this its wonder full</li>
      <li>this smells wonderful and makes my hair feel very slick after I use it.  </li>
      <li>Great scent and such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I paid $3 for this huge bottle, and that&#x27;s exactly what I get, $3 shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with Suave in the past, but this is not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>This happens far too many times.</li>
      <li>The product - I&#x27;m sure is good - but one doesn&#x27;t find out until the very end of all the process for a purchase that it is not available for shipping to Canada.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m switching back to the coconut scented kind.</li>
      <li>My hair is also very long so it often tended to look damaged, but now it&#x27;s shiny, smooth, full of soft volume and super HEALTHY looking!</li>
      <li>If you wanted to, you could also use the conditioner right after the shampoo.</li>
      <li>If you wanted to, you could also use the conditioner right after the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Frankly, I think a lot of shampoos are pretty similar, so a product that&#x27;s inexpensive, smells nice and works</li>
      <li>It makes my hair smell and look pretty good, but it&#x27;s no professional salon product, it is most definitely a Walmart quality shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is the best, closest, and lest expensive option for comparison.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile since 365 shampoo is not yet available on Amazon at the time of this review, we also use [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl oz]] or [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Suave knows how to make a real shampoo!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft and feeling clean</li>
      <li>It now only smells great, but it lathers really well and makes my hair feel cleaner than any other shampoo product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The only con is that this isn&#x27;t the best shampoo for dry hair, so I tend to avoid it, although other family members with different hair types love it.  </li>
      <li>You can barely smell the rosemary and mint in this and it also doesnt clean as well.</li>
      <li>As for the product it is close to the real Aveda product but does not have the minty smell and coolness, so I bought a $9.00 bottle of pure mint oil on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The whole bathroom smells of the aroma of rosemary and mint</li>
      <li>It lathers very well</li>
      <li>Would still highly recommend it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good stuff for cheap price.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells like how a robot might imagine rosemary and mint smells like.  Not a good substitute for fans of the more expensive product.</li>
    <li> This is a staple in my house.  The whole bathroom smells of the aroma of rosemary and mint, it&#x27;s a lovely scent very invigorating!  I am very impressed with the quality of Suave Professionals shampoos.  The only con is that this isn&#x27;t the best shampoo for dry hair, so I tend to avoid it, although other family members with different hair types love it.  This isn&#x27;t really a con, as i believe the bottle says &amp;#34;for normal to oily hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This was a great shampoo. Smell soooooooooo good. Love it. And for the price paid you get a big bottle. I love it soooooooooooooooooo much!</li>
    <li> Okay im black and usually spend alot on shampoo and conditioners. Ive tried wen,creme of nature,pantene for women of color everything and I always end up going back to this. It leaves your hair soft and feeling clean I even got my sister stuck on this its wonder full and you can get to giant bottles for like 5 bucks there isnt anything bad I can think to say.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I get a great price and it is delivered automatically. My wife likes the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like to rotate shampoos and I&#x27;ve found myself repurchasing this one for months now! It now only smells great, but it lathers really well and makes my hair feel cleaner than any other shampoo product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Great scent and such a reasonable price. The after effect is smooth, silky hair and a long lasting scent. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I me it, now2 are gifts. I love smell I use before.going.to work wake u up.&lt;br /&gt;I fill my camping shampoo bottles, traveling bottles too.</li>
    <li> I use to use Aveda  but I can&#x27;t justify spending that much on shampoo/conditioner. Suave does a great job and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I see almost the same results as Aveda.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to get a product thats comparable to Aveda (just like Suave advertises on their packaging). Its not. You can barely smell the rosemary and mint in this and it also doesnt clean as well. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> After stay at a hotel that had the aveda rosemary mint shampoo, I wanted for home use. But I also found out that was going to cost me an arm and a leg. So I try this, and can tell you that the smell is similar, but there is not tinkling sensation on your scalp nor do the smell remain on you after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a suave product, it smells good during wash and was ok with it, but the price is perfect. Will use this occasionally.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a great minty scent and is also great at moisturizing my hair. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells divine.  Was s great price with s &amp; s. Sad no longer on subscribe and save. A b c</li>
    <li> I bought Suave Professionals Shampoo for very little money and an Amazon coupon helped even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is quite nice and it certainly gets my hair clean.  Frankly, I think a lot of shampoos are pretty similar, so a product that&#x27;s inexpensive, smells nice and works well gets my vote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.  Recommended product!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Smell is subtle but nice.  Leaves my coarse long hair feeling soft.  I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with Suave in the past, but this is not my favorite.  The smell is good and strong.  It was usable, but left my hair too dry for everyday use.  I much prefer the Suave Professional Sleek Shampoo (compares to Matrix) for my dry, curly hair.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not gluten free, skip the next few sentences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are, keep reading: Suave has a thing.  They label gluten-ingredients from the ingredient source.  If it comes from wheat or barley or oats, they&#x27;ll say, \\&quot;From wheat.\\&quot;  They don&#x27;t hide gluten-containing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, apparently the entire gluten-free community has decided to participate in human trials for Suave products.  People recommend Suave as being gluten-free with very few exceptions, and they have for years.  If what is available online is any evidence, there is almost no evidence of anyone ever getting glutened from Suave products in the last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For fun, I pull up product names and type in the words, \\&quot;gluten, sick, and product name\\&quot;.)  Well, not exactly for fun, but everyone needs a hobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I actually like about the product itself, safety issues aside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like a moisturizing version of the Aveda shampoo.  The bottle is huge--28 ounces is slightly more than half a six pack, if that helps with the visualization.  I almost prefer it to the Aveda version, because it doesn&#x27;t require a conditioner afterwards. It smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.  Standing ovation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, after getting tired of being ripped off by &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; shampoos.  It works just as well as the expensive brands.  Normally, I prefer unscented products, but this rosemary-mint combination smells good and really wakes you up in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just really annoyed that Amazon has removed it from their subscription delivery list.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Mmmmm. And it feels refreshing on your head too. I really liked the amount of lather it produced as well.</li>
    <li> I adore the smell of rosemary. We have a huge rosemary plant in our kitchen and I run my hands through it every morning before I do yoga. I also enjoy mint. So I was really looking forward to using this Suave rosemary and mint shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll note my hair is fairly long - nearly to my waist. I grow it out for charity, chop it all off, and then grow it again. So I want to do my best to keep it clean and healthy, because it is intended to last another person quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, every time I try this Suave shampoo (and I&#x27;ve tried it a number of times over the years) it just doesn&#x27;t work well. It is almost sticky. My hair tangles like anything after I wash with it, even if I use a conditioner. And it causes allergic reactions, too. My face often gets red and my scalp just feels uncomfortable. There is definitely some sort of chemical component of this that isn&#x27;t great. And I&#x27;ve heard this from other people too so I know it&#x27;s not just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many other great shampoos on the market that are awesome for hair care, I just can&#x27;t recommend this one. And what&#x27;s funny is that I keep forgetting after a few years and going back to try it again, because the rosemary-mint combination seems so appealing. And then I have issues again, and remember why I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love Suave products. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. I bought the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint shampoo because it smells so good, but I ended up having a horrible allergic reaction to it. The first time I used the shampoo, I thought it was something else making me itchy, but the second time I used the shampoo, there was no mistaking that this product was the culprit. I ended up with welts on my scalp and terrible itching. If you are allergy prone, have sensitive skin, or eczema of any kind, you might want to avoid this product. Suave has so many other kinds of shampoo to choose from, better to switch and be safe rather than sorry. I&#x27;m switching back to the coconut scented kind. It never broke me out like this.</li>
    <li> this smells wonderful and makes my hair feel very slick after I use it.  Pair this with the conditioner and you are good to goQ Smells wonderful - even though the smell does not last all day - it is a great product.</li>
    <li> 2-star for the price...this is $2.75 from Target or Walmart. As for the product it is close to the real Aveda product but does not have the minty smell and coolness, so I bought a $9.00 bottle of pure mint oil on Amazon. I added 8 drops of the mint to the shampoo and voila! Just like the $20 bought of Aveda. 3 times the product for about $3 total. I still have enough mint left to use for another 25 bottles of the Suave shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Rosemary Mint shampoos and was very disappointed in this one, as you could not smell any scent.</li>
    <li> I used to only use the salon brand shampoos &amp; conditioners - but they are so expensive. Thinking that I could definitely use the extra money, I switched to Suave Professionals. The shampoo works great, smells great, and is a fantastic price. Can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ll never go back to the $30/bottle brands.</li>
    <li> Great price for the money. Recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not good. It makes my hair very dry. I don&#x27;t like it. I will never buy it again. Not recommend.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the value of this shampoo. It smells great and works on my kids&#x27; hair without making tangles.</li>
    <li> I am fourteen years old, and I was trying to find the right shampoo for my hair. I have tried every product out there from Garnier, Tressemme, Pantene and Matrix. I even went all out and totally spent all of my $60.00 of birthday money on stupid Wen. All of these shampoos that I have listed here made my hair overly oily/greasy, flat, and dull. I also have severe asthma combined with severe, chronic bronchitis and sinus disease and, all of these shampoos (including Wen)made me burst into full-blown wheezing in the shower. Then, I found Suave Naturals shampoos and this one (Suave Rosemary Mint). I decided to try this one, along with the Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo when I was in the store, one again, looking like the idiot trying to choose the right shampoo as usual. Anyways, when I got home and was applying the Suave Rosemary Mint in my hair, it felt different...I don&#x27;t know...nice for once! The smell is SO good (like spearmint, which I really like), and it didn&#x27;t cause my asthma to flare up this time as well. When I was rinsing it out, it didn&#x27;t feel oily either, like the Tressemme, Garnier, or Wen did either. I was so suprised when my hair dried. All the gunk left behind from all the months of using Garnier and Wen had been all stripped from my hair...in just one use! And the shine..unbelievable. When I used the Suave Daily Clarifying, the same result happened..shiny and sleek. Now, my friends (who use Wen) ask me &amp;#34;what shampoo do you use on your hair? It looks so healthy&amp;#34; I say, &amp;#34;I just use Suave&amp;#34;, and they all look at me, dumbfounded. Even strangers ask me the same, &amp;#34;what do you use on your hair? It looks so shiny!&amp;#34;, and I say the same answer. Even my hairstylist is suprised how healthy my hair has become. Suave will save your hair! just give it a chance, like I did! I would highly recommend this product to people who have had the same struggles as me! Suave knows how to make a real shampoo! That&#x27;s all I have to say :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;m now 19-years-old, and guess what? I still use this amazing shampoo. It has been working greatly on my hair for years. Would still highly recommend it! Also, buy the Suave Rosemary Mint Conditioner to go along with this product. I use the Suave Rosemary Mint Conditioner as a overnight treatment, along with a little Argan Oil mixed in with it once a week. My hair turns out wonderful! Silky smooth, with no split ends! If you wanted to, you could also use the conditioner right after the shampoo. But as an overnight treatment with a little Argan or Olive Oil, it works absolute wonders (in my opinion) for hair.years-old, and guess what? I still use this amazing shampoo.

    <li> My favorite shampoo is another brand and 10x the price.  This is the best, closest, and lest expensive option for comparison.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo and I really am glad,  it is thick and luxurious for an inexpensive shampoo.  My husband and I do not have special needs in a shampoo so this one is great!</li>
    <li> What can I say about Suave? Well first of all, it&#x27;s cheap, and you get a lot of it! So that&#x27;s a start... It makes my hair smell and look pretty good, but it&#x27;s no professional salon product, it is most definitely a Walmart quality shampoo. Not that Walmart quality is bad, but you&#x27;re getting what you pay for. I paid $3 for this huge bottle, and that&#x27;s exactly what I get, $3 shampoo. So thank you Suave for being some of the best $3 shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had to get used to this smell at first, but it is a good shampoo. I like the Suave all in one shampoo way better and wish it came in more scents than just one.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist *whispered* to me about this stuff, with a \\&quot;don&#x27;t tell anyone or I will get in trouble, but you got to try it!\\&quot;, and so I gave it a shot. At the time my hear was dyyyying, it was coming out in handfuls, dry and always a tangy mess, could not brush it out enough. I was using Pantene again (I don&#x27;t know why I keep falling for their commercials), and again my hair was falling out like crazy and looking like junk. The first week it looks and feels great but than it their cheap wax starts to pile up and build up on your hair and scalp, causing all those problems. Anyways, so I decided to give Suave Professionals a try, bought this stuff at just about $2 a bottle, not expecting much since I was pretty used to $20+ a bottle brands back in the day when I could afford them. And WOW, both mine and my husband&#x27;s hair stopped falling out that same week! He came up to me at the end of that week and said something along the lines of \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know what that stuff is but I love it!\\&quot;, I didn&#x27;t know the man ever cared about shampoo at all! Ever since my hair did a complete turn around, and within a couple weeks I was getting complements on my hair and had so far at least five different people ask me what shampoo I was using! Everywhere from the doctor&#x27;s office, to the gas station, to the salon everyone wants to know and is shocked to find out that it&#x27;s the Suave Professional&#x27;s $2 bottle stuff! My hair is also very long so it often tended to look damaged, but now it&#x27;s shiny, smooth, full of soft volume and super HEALTHY looking! From the week I started and to this day, which is about two years since. Its my favorite shampoo/conditioner I have ever used and I will continue to use it until the day they stopped making it (at which point I hope to stock up in time!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I LOVE the smell! It smells like Mojitos in the morning! ;)</li>
    <li> This stuff made bubbles and I warshed my hair with it. It was some good warshin&#x27; going on. you bet</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo, but the price on amazon is about 3x what it is at the grocery store.  It has increased a ton since I bought it, so I no longer buy this item from amazon.  It reminds me somewhat of Aveda&#x27;s volumizing shampoo, although it&#x27;s not the same.  I like the Aveda brand better but this is a cheap alternative.</li>
    <li> Suave has done a great job of making affordable, yet good quality hair products. It smells just like the Aveda version and gets my hair just as clean. I think it leaves my hair softer and more nourished than Aveda even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely reccommend this shampoo, just get a different conditioner to go with it if you have dry-ish hair. The matching conditioner didnt give me enough moisture.</li>
    <li> I *love* the scent of this shampoo, but after awhile I developed itchy crusty scabs on my scalp, neck and under, behind and in my ears.  My husband (late 50s) was complaining of acne and one sore in particular lingered for many weeks.  We switched to 365 herbal mint, over time our problems went away.  We hadn&#x27;t made the connection and one day we were low on shampoo so picked up another bottle of Suave Rosemary Mint.  Within a couple weeks I again had crusty scabs on my scalp and my husband again developed itchy \\&quot;acne\\&quot; scabs on his face. We quickly went back to 365 and our problems again cleared up.  I mentioned this observation on Facebook, my step-daughter reports she uses Suave Rosemary Mint but said her fiance uses another shampoo since anytime he uses her Suave he also develops crusty scabs on his scalp.  A few others reported noticing acne when they were using Suave Rosemary Mint.  Lesson learned, we no longer run out of 365 Herbal Mint!  Meanwhile since 365 shampoo is not yet available on Amazon at the time of this review, we also use [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl oz]] or [[ASIN:B000FGC99Y JASON Natural Cosmetics Everyday Hair Care- Natural Biotin Shampoo, Ginseng &amp; Chamomile, 16 Ounces]] with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to find out which ingredient in Suave is causing this crusty scalp issue and/or acne so we can avoid that chemical in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the expensive Aveda brand and was skeptical about this working as well.  Considering how expensive Aveda is, I figured it was worth a try.  I love it!  The fragrance is slightly different, but the texture of my hair is the same after using it.  I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> The product - I&#x27;m sure is good - but one doesn&#x27;t find out until the very end of all the process for a purchase that it is not available for shipping to Canada.  This happens far too many times.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and cleaning power of rosemary mint shampoo based on use of the competition&#x27;s product in hotels.  When I discovered that Suave sells a similar product, I decided to try it.  While the scent isn&#x27;t as aromatic as the competition, it&#x27;s close enough.  The cleaning power is just as good.  And the price of the Suave shampoo can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> The mint is so overwhelming that it reminds me of hospital soap.  It lathers very well and you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Gee, I loved this shampoo and it does a super job!  Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the Aveda Rosemary Mint -- the fragrance is more subtle.  But I get similar results and I can&#x27;t beat the price.  Definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
