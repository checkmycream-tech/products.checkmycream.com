<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream. I haven&#x27;t notice a big change on my cellulite but the skin on my belly looks more firm and smooth. I like the smell and the texture. I put this on every morning right after shower and I been using a waist cincher. It feels a warm feeling but it is super good.</li>
    <li> This item is the best that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many. It really heats up. It&#x27;s best to use when working out.</li>
    <li> Just received package....fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Just put some on and literally in 5min it started to tingle (with water) ...I put it on some dry spots and it hasn&#x27;t yet tingled yet. Will return soon to review after a while</li>
    <li> Omg! I&#x27;ve used several firming gels and I have to say this one works wonders! I exfoliate my skin before I apply it into my skin and even if I don&#x27;t work out, while doing errands I can feel the BURN! I had this extra skiing in my back by the waist and after using it for 2 weeks is gone! I also eat clean 70% of the time and try to work out at least 3 times a week but the Cell lab cream has helped me a lot I totally recommend it and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I read the reviews before using this product. It definitely helps reduce the look of cellulite(it&#x27;s not a cure all but great for when you need a little extra help in a short dress).  It also burns on damp skin! Let your body dry out completely before applying. I applied once after a shower and the burning woke me up in the middle of the night! I still use it cuz it&#x27;s worth it, just a good watch-out to be aware of!</li>
    <li> My mom had been complaining about rough skin on her legs and was frustrated with her jowls. A friend recommended Cel-Lab and I noticed the jar is 6.7 ounces (bigger than most brands), so I bought it and gave it to my mother. She&#x27;s been using it a few weeks and says the cream smells good and is great at removing skin-tags. She showed me the results: her legs are smoother and her jowls look tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was inspired so I gave it a shot on my stubborn and gross back fat. I applied before going to the gym. I could feel it working while lifting weight. It has been a week and I can see the cellulite is receding.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this cream for over a week now, and it is working great!&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells absolutely wonderful - you&#x27;ll be tempted to lick your skin, but don&#x27;t do it! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;2) It is thick and creamy, and absorbs quickly, leaving a slightly warm and tingling sensation, but we have experienced no discomfort, even though we both have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;3) Our skin feels much smoother and tighter with just two small applications a day, and our cellulite \\&quot;dimples\\&quot; are gradually disappearing - woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;4) The cream comes in a nice-looking container and very attractive packaging - always a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;5) We&#x27;re already looking and feeling 10X better - daily exercise has helped a lot too, as we&#x27;re trying to get in shape as quickly as possible before heading to the beautiful beaches of Thailand for our winter vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the extra boost, Cel-Lab Slim!</li>
    <li> Did not see a change I my skin.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been working great. Doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and I received it super fast...as soon as I used it I felt my skin smooth the next day. I haven&#x27;t used it as much BUT I AM SEEING IMPROVEMENTS!</li>
    <li> 4 or 5 stars - I have put this on my upper legs and bottom several times after taking a bath. It reacts with water somehow. If you put it on after taking a bath or shower and then try to go to sleep you may just wake up feeling like you set yourself on fire. No, I&#x27;m not kidding or exaggerating in any way. For those of you who live in a cold climate (I live in Florida but have visited cold climates), it feels like when you go outside in the cold or snow and then when you come inside if you have ever tried warming your frozen hands in hot water it burns. Same feeling. This stuff burns and stings. Now, if you use it in the morning (and don&#x27;t take a shower, or even if you take a quick one) and then go about your day, you&#x27;ll still feel the heat and your pants will stick to you all day but it will be tolerable. When I&#x27;ve tried to do it at night (tried it three times) there were two times when I just couldn&#x27;t sleep because the pain was so intense and it just gets worse and worse. The second nighttime failure, I tried to just deal with it and get some sleep... By the time I gave up I had red splotches on my legs that looked someone hit me. These results make me wonder if this stuff is actually dissolving the fat in some way. I think it&#x27;s doing a better job when it hurts more but sometimes it&#x27;s intolerable. Maybe it&#x27;s relevant to note that I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and 103lbs so there&#x27;s not a whole lot of cellulite I&#x27;m trying to remove... Could it be burning into the muscle??</li>
    <li> Being a healthy individual who engages in healthy living I&#x27;m, unfortunately, cursed with some cellulite. I am glad I was offered to receive this product for evaluation purpose in return for an honest and unbiased review. As soon as I opened the jar, I fall in love with this product! Smells amazing. I love the roses scent; this scent is not overpowering, it is very soothing and relaxing. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and can see it’s slowly helping. I only use it during the day, putting it on my stomach, legs and upper arms after my morning shower and massaging it in for a minute or so.  This cream is very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion.  I can feel the tingle once I apply the product. My skin smells good; it is hydrated, not greasy, and just &#x27;tightened up&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy, once again my skin looks smooth, and the appearance of cellulite is less noticeable. I had stretch marks on my stomach and this cream made them fade. I didn&#x27;t think that was possible any more. This product is doing a fairly good job and the improvement can be seen. I think as time progresses and a few more weeks I&#x27;ll be able to notice more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In combination with working out and eating right it really is a miracle product for firming that last bit of loose skin. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one jar doesn&#x27;t give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different. Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one jar while others need to buy more than one. Regardless of how long it takes, this stuff does actually work and with consistency, you can get to where you want to be.</li>
    <li> Apparently I am allergic to something in the product because I broke out in a rash.  Very disappointed but not the fault of the product.  Really wished it would have worked.  Didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; fragrance . . . smells like old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> This arrived timely. It smells wonderful and my skin feels softer. I have only been using it for a week and have not noticed a difference in the cellulite but I will keep trying. I run and try to eat healthy but I&#x27;m just &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; enough to have cellulite even though I am not large. It does burn a lot so I&#x27;m hoping it will work. I am not giving up yet.  I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I no longer feel the burn. My skin is really soft but I have not noticed a reduction in cellulite. I bought two jars and will continue to use it and I am hoping that prolonged use will make a difference.</li>
    <li> I am waiting for the product&#x27;s effect!! hopefully, it will work</li>
    <li> This cream will help keep the cellulite at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to one of my female relatives that wanted to test the cream, and was used twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week she started to see some improvement on the \\&quot;Cottage Cheese\\&quot; look on the underside of her arm and the inner thigh. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in a much smoother appearance on her skin. Her skin had a smoother youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this cream. This cream is no substitute for working out, but will definitely give you a head start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really makes me sweat when I&#x27;m working out. Haven&#x27;t seen any results but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I have been using it for several weeks and my thighs are most definitely smoother. I like the warmth it gives when working out- it works!!</li>
    <li> I must have spent a small fortune trying to eliminate my ugly cellulite. I tried every cream on the planet... exercised like a madwoman...&lt;br /&gt;Of course, none of it worked. I eventually thought I&#x27;d just have to live with my cellulite, and say goodbye to wearing dresses and skirts forever.&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, I gave up too soon. Cosmetics companies have made big advances in cellulite creams, and there are now options out there that can give big results. i had a chance to try cel-lab slim cellulite cream and i was amazed by the results. i have been using it just for a week or so and i already see the difference. my skin is more elastic and smoother. i use it twice a day in the morning and in the evening for best results and iam very happy with what i see so far. it takes time but iam optimistic. i would recommend to all my friends. i received a free sample to try and review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review when you haven&#x27;t had time to try a product,  but i will say that the customer service is excellent. The first day I noticed the warm tingling,  so hoping to see some tone action soon. From the other reviews I&#x27;d say I will probably be pleased, and back to finish an even better review. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the ingredients&#x27; ability to burn calories or to even burn when sweating or wet, but I will say that their claims are right. I kinda like the burning sensation because it pushes me to keep moving in order to sweat more to burn more :) I probably would not have purchased this bottle again if it had not been for its amazingly divine scent. I would love to bottle the smell of roses from this jar and wear it as a perfume. All in all, I think it helps to burn calories, which smooths the skin ie stomach and thighs and reduce the appearance of cellulite. So I will give this product all the stars because I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think it does anything except burn and feel hot!  I have to use rubber gloves to apply it because even after washing with soap and water, it still can get moved to other parts of my face or body where I do not want it.  For example, it has burned my eyes, around my mouth and other parts of my face.  I want it for my jowls, which are not horrible,  but have to be so very careful and really do not think there is any change!  The fragrance makes me sneeze as well.</li>
    <li> I really love  it because it  make the abdominal  smooth and smell good.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me.  I did not notice any change in my skin&#x27;s firmness or smoothness.  I don&#x27;t have much of a cellulite issue but I thought it might help with making my skin appear firmer.  It did not.  I have used other products that have worked better.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> I really do like this cream! I use it before workouts and after I shower. I do think I&#x27;m seeing change in my skin. I just wish I would of taken pics to show progress of it. I&#x27;m sure I will be making another purchase of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product it works great I lost 2inches in 3 weeks and skin is more firmer and I am gonna reorder this again !</li>
    <li> Love it and it works very good I&#x27;m seeing results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just been using it for 3 days and I love it so far. I think it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> I really REALLY like this stuff! I got it shipped to me really quick and the container that it comes in is very pretty!  I apply it twice daily and after a week I have softened skin and it appears that my scar and stretch marks are a little more lighter! I can&#x27;t wait to see my results with continued use! I am really impressed with it! This product is a MUST have if you&#x27;re looking for something for scaring or stretch marks in my opinion! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> The order came in the mail quickly which was great.  I have been using the product now for about 3 weeks, I am pretty active doing something everyday whether it is cardio workouts or playing volleyball, and cellulite has been a problem since I hit the late 30&#x27;s (now I&#x27;m almost 50)... does this product work?  Yes / No ... I exfoliate every morning in the shower, then I put this on afterwards, perhaps I should change up my routine and put it on before I workout/exercise to get better results.  It does have a burning/tingling sensation when applied on my inner thighs, butt cheeks, outer thighs, stomach ... I don&#x27;t notice a obvious change other than slightly smoother skin yet I&#x27;m not convinced it is any different than the lotions/creams I use from the store/over the counter.  Will change up my routine and put it on before exercising and see if that makes any difference.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first; never having used a cellulite cream. Didn&#x27;t want to invest energy or time on hype. First order I purchased 1; second order, I&#x27;m buying 4. GREAT when used with a waist trainer. Love the fresh rose scent and slight tingle. Worth the money ladies. Word to the wise: BUY MORE THAN ONE! You will purchase again. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I bought this after reading reviews. I say, &amp;#34;buy it&amp;#34;! I saw results  3-days. You don&#x27;t need much a dime to quarter size. I apply it in an upward motion, dries fast. Seems to moisturize, too!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  Sometimes it feels hotter than other times.  It has improved the bumpy look to my thighs!  I also use coffee grounds in the shower to exfoliate the skin.  Then I apply the cream after towel drying. I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for Cel-Lab Slimming cream. The reviews were positive so I was confident this was money lost. Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I tried to return it but it was out of the 30 day time frame so that is even more disappointing (so if its not working for you after 2 or 3 weeks, return it). I kept forgetting to use the product so I didn&#x27;t use it the moment I received it. But once I did...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;The cream is smooth, like lotion and smells like rose (not like roses. More like a rose scented candle maybe). That was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used it:&lt;br /&gt;I massaged the cream on my most &amp;#34;troubled areas&amp;#34; mid section and thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I purchased it:&lt;br /&gt;Because I have lost weight. I wanted to lose a few more and hoped this burned some extra fat around my belly. I also wanted to reduce the cellulite on my thighs- it&#x27;s not a horrible case of cellulite but I have thick thighs so it is noticeable. I was hoping Cel-Lab would assist with firming, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it:&lt;br /&gt;I used it once a day. A few minutes before my workout. If I wasn&#x27;t working out that day, I&#x27;d use it at work (non-sedentary).... One time I used a slimmer belt (makes you sweat around your mid section) all morning then used the Cel-Lab Slim cream. Another time I smeared the cream on then put the slimmer belt on (see below for what happened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened when I used it:&lt;br /&gt;I want to say I could &amp;#34;feel it&amp;#34; working. My mid-section, in particular, had a burning sensation- as if I had applied Icy Hot or something. After my workout, I showered and the burning sensation heightened. Wasn&#x27;t sure how to feel about that. After about 30 to 45 minutes, the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; was over completely. A few times (not every time) My mid-section was really red! I have pretty fair skin. I still used the product to give it the benefit of the doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I used a slimmer belt all morning then used the cream, the burning sensation was no more or less &amp;#34;hotter&amp;#34; than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I smeared the cream on then put the slimmer belt on the burning sensation was much worse! Not completely unbearable but enough to let out a yelp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed what after a few uses the burning sensation, during my workout, was less and less. So after my workouts (if I didn&#x27;t shower immediately) I&#x27;d wear my slimmer belt over top of my shirt and the let the burn begin. I did this because I am under the impression that if you don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; then its not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;None. Still have cellulite on my thighs. Tummy is still the same. Will I finish the bottle? Maybe. I can&#x27;t get my money back anyway. IF things change later, I will change my review and rating. Until then....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 2 stars??&lt;br /&gt;Because it did not work and the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; is not unbearable but uncomfortable. Also, the scent is pleasant but strong. Whatever you are wearing will smell like it.</li>
    <li> This product is very different from other products I&#x27;ve tried, and by far the best one I  have tried so far.This product has a very soft rose scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily like most products. I&#x27;ve been using cel-lab slim for about 2 weeks now and noticed my skin is softer. I use it twice a day but discovered it&#x27;s very intense after showering or a bath. The first time I used it I actually showered first in order to get  a deeper penetration on my skin. Bad idea!! After 10 minutes of applying this cream the burning sensation was so intense I had to wash it off. It definitely felt like it was working. So, I tried it again after showering and waiting approximately 4 hours later. The burning wasn&#x27;t as intense and uncomfortable.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product and hope for great results.</li>
    <li> So far great cellulite cream with one con that other reviewers have complained of, which is the burning sensation it can give you which can or may be overwhelming to some. I personally, didn&#x27;t think it was too bad or that terrible to freak out or wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning it made my skin feel softer, hydrated and smoother but that came after a week or so of use, do not expect immediate results, this isn&#x27;t performing surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on easily and cleanly. I do recommend you wash your hands after applying however, so your hands to get any sort of burning sensation. In combination with working out and eating a healthy diet it really is a better product than most expect for firming that last bit of loose skin. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one jar doesn&#x27;t give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> I used this as the directions dictated, and noticed, in about 2 weeks of use, that there was a &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; to my skin. This stuff gets HOT the more your body temp rides, I kinda like that sensation to be honest. I use this before working out and the warm sensation stays the whole time. I think this is a winner for sure if you, (1) eat right, (2) exercise, and (3) use as directed. It&#x27;s also important for people to know that this cream, and other cellulite products aren&#x27;t going to work well if you have a real serious cellulite/skin issue. If you&#x27;ve got some small areas that need a little work, this stuff can actually help, but you can&#x27;t be like those people on &amp;#34;My 600lb. Life&amp;#34; and expect a jar of cellulite cream to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; body fat off.</li>
    <li> Best cream for stubborn fat and cellulite</li>
    <li> i love the feeling of hot and wet&lt;br /&gt;but i didnt notice the differences&lt;br /&gt;idontknow if its working slowly or much cellulite</li>
    <li> So far the product is working. It arrived on time and I applied the cream the day after I received it and headed for the gym. I didn&#x27;t feel anything. About 30 minutes into my workout, I could feel the burn. I never really sweat but after my workout I was very sweaty and the cream was burning. I kept checking to see if my seat warmer was on in my car. This is only the second day so I&#x27;ll post again once I begin to see progress. I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle overnight but I will be applying the cream everyday. So far it&#x27;s working and it works all day.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Like the heat.</li>
    <li> Love this product it works it&#x27;s great before you work out</li>
    <li> The cell lab slimming cream smells like roses love it. It does burn some but it is bearable. I don&#x27;t know about inches yet we will see.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Works well with my workout !</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase....works as advertised. I will be purchasing again soon!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> This is my second jar, and honestly I really don&#x27;t see a difference. I told myself when i purchased the product I would give it a few months to be fair. I am still hopeful.</li>
    <li> Cellulite and skin firming properties of this product is really attractive as I just gave birth to a baby 5 months ago. I&#x27;m trying to regain my tone, elasticity, and appearance. Along with tons of water, good nutrition, and regular exercise....I&#x27;ve also been applying this cream to my bottom, thighs, and belly. Love the natural ingredients. Light fresh scent. I do notice my skin feel firmer and more hydrated. I&#x27;m excited about the results of continued use.</li>
    <li> Amazing. COmbined with moderate exercise, definitely reduced the appearance cellulite. Tingles, so you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> good product, just isn&#x27;t enough</li>
    <li> not thrilled about the rose scent but ok. have been using daily and noticed a lot less ripples and dimples; good! it has not melted any fat off but definitely smoother, non-dimpled look to all area applied so looks to be working. goes on very greasy but then dries to more matte finish and feeling. later skin feels hydrated but not greasy. does not contain caffeine as most others doe so not sure how it works?  quite oddly, it is not until i&#x27;m working out,  hours later, that I start to feel a heating sensation that does not occur when applied;  but IF IT WORKS, and it does, that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> It really Does work! Definitely Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I have just received it but very disappointed at how small it is. Let&#x27;s hope it is effective, I review again after using</li>
    <li> Although this is no miracle over night product I have noticed it is working! And yes it does tingle!! Idk what it is but the pink jelly is taking out the jiggle in my jelly!!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS LIKE MOST CELLULITE CREAMS I HAVE TRIED. THE SCENT ISN&#x27;T TOO STRONG. THE CONSISTENCY ISN&#x27;T TOO THICK OR STICKY LIKE SOME CAN BE. I FIND THT I DON&#x27;T NEED A WHOLE HAND FULL TO GET THE RESULTS THAT I AM LOOKING FOR. THIS ISN&#x27;T AN OVERNIGHT PROCESS, AND I THINK THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN A MONTH TO SEE THE DESIRED EFFECTS. BUT SINCE THE COMPANY IS LOOKING FOR MY REVIEW RIGHT NOW THIS IS IT. I GOT THIS AT A DISCOUNTED/FREE PRICE TO GIVE MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a total of 21 days and I saw somewhat of an improvement in the tone of my legs. I did notice that my skin was smoother and there was some cellulite reduction. I noticed this product began to work during the last week as I began to do mild excersice.</li>
    <li> I does work . I could see the difference in a week or so. The bad part is that burns like hell. Using suggestions? Put it on in the morning get dress and hit the gym. I&#x27;ll start burning in about half an hour then gets even hotter for a while. If you&#x27;re working out it will help not paying attention to it. And make sure you don&#x27;t touch your face or eyes. I think it&#x27;s got cayenne pepper or something very spicy in it. If you don&#x27;t believe just touch your tongue with it you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Other wise,  works if you can bear. And don&#x27;t put it at night not if you want to sleep. I scrub myself really good and put some other kind of milder anticellulite serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about its quality. Cream is sticky and has horror smell. I totally do not like the smell. I will try one week and then update review</li>
    <li> I have a friend that was raving about this cream so I thought I would try it for myself. I was skeptical at first but after a week of use I began to notice a big difference, especially on my thighs. My skin overall is smoother and firmer and the cream has a great smell to it. I am really happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> CEL-LAB is offering a product that many people will want to try, Women who have embarrassing cellulite, men and women with little stubborn fat collections at the belt line (aka muffin top), and skin that is sagging beneath the chin - yes, there are other areas, but for starters these targets are not bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice smelling cream contains all natural ingredients (note the ingredients are not listed but are purported to firm skin, reduce fat with cellulite reduction and body firming) and the proof is in the use of it. For those with dry sagging skin a few days use of this smooth and relaxing cream massaged into the skin gets rid of the dry flaky epidermis and plums the skin and actually begins to tighten it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No side effects from this user - but definite improvement in the quality of skin and firming on the parts used. Seems like a very fine product, for not a lot of money. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
    <li> it is a remarkable product so far so good</li>
    <li> I got this about two weeks ago.  It seems  be making changes  my thighs since I&#x27;ve used  it.  You can tell something is working by  warm tingle  you get when  have applied it.  I will continue  use and maybe buy more  to continue the process.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have been using this daily (morning) I feel a strong burn mid morning and it keeps me moving.  When I run or start to sweat its instant. Love this product. Also firms skin. Only down is I&#x27;m not into smelling like a rose but all well it works the ways I need it to and keeps me going</li>
    <li> This stuff is HORRIBLE!!!  It burns and you have to wash your hands for HOURS to get it off, I put my contacts on after and my eyes were buring, it was terrible.  Never again!!!</li>
    <li> Seller was very prompt and product precisely matched the description. I will deal with this seller again. As for the cream, it really seems like a miracle product! After using it as prescribed, much of my girlfriend&#x27;s ugly cellulite simply melted away! Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
    <li> By Far my favorite Cellulite Cream! This cream has a wonderful floral scent as a smooth silky consistency. It absorbed easily and left my skin feeling wonderful. I have noticed a definite firming of my arms and thighs. I really enjoy this product and look forward to spring ready skin.</li>
    <li> Very good product and conforms to specifications and seller fast handling and confident and very suitable prices</li>
    <li> There is so much I love about this cellulite slimming cream it&#x27;s light weight and absorbs very quickly. This cream also smells like roses; the scent fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with your cologne or perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cream is almost like a jelly, it’s a perfect pink color and has a great scent too.  I use the slimming cream on my upper arms and thighs; it dries completely with no greasy feeling and dries completely invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I massaged the slimming cream into skin for my first application; straight out of the shower; then I crawled into bed. About 15 minutes later I was back in the bathroom looking at my skin! I was certain that I was having a reaction. I was positive I was going to be bright RED. Nope. Nothing looked different on me. ANYWHERE! The jar says there will be a tingling sensation. Tingling? I felt like I was on fire! Ohhhh okay; I’m being a little over dramatic… but ummmm it was intense. Apparently the more moisture on your skin the more intensity of the heat you’ll feel, lesson learned use on very dry skin. Once the slimming cream is fully dried you will feel your skin tighten!&lt;br /&gt;Using this cream along with working out or even adding a daily walk will help you see noticeable results!&lt;br /&gt;This slimming cream helps my skin feel soft and moisturized, and I am seeing a reduction in cellulite. This cream is awesome for firming! Now is all my cellulite gone? No. But it is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION&lt;br /&gt;Now I want to add if you are a contact lens wearer take your contacts out FIRST!!! Then WASH YOUR HANDS like you are a surgical nurse. Then wash them AGAIN! With a LOT of soap and water. This was a rough lesson learned!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cream. Just be sure to wash your hands REALLY well before touching your eyes. Even the day after this cream stays on your skin. So scrub your hands with plenty of soap!!</li>
    <li> When I open the package to the cell lab slim all natural cellulite cream I was a little surprised I didn&#x27;t expect to see such a pretty little packaging with pink cream inside. They had a safety seal which is really nice I was like to see that and you can smell the rose scented cream immediately upon opening. I have had other rose scented creams and they&#x27;re a bit overwhelming and overpowering but this one is not very strong and nice. The cream is very very light, smooth and easy to apply and smooth out onto the skin. It is not sticky or thick where you have to work really hard to get it into the skin as with other cellulite creams. I&#x27;m actually surprised that it feels so nice on the skin and has that warmth after application since it is such a light cream. You did not immediately feel any warmth or tingling or any of those things right away after a couple of minutes of application you&#x27;ll start to feel the warmth. I&#x27;m actually using it right now and it&#x27;s been on for a couple of hours and I can still feel the warmth of the cream when I sit down. My cellulite to my thighs are not gone of course but I feel like my skin is a bit smoother if that makes any sense. I exercise several times a week and I noticed if I put this on before I exercise the warmth is obviously a bit more intense and it feels like it&#x27;s working a lot better. Now I just have to remember to apply it before working out versus after working out. I received this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or unbiased opinions</li>
    <li> This cream works and it&#x27;s not expensive.  I only used 2 tubs and already have results.  I used it on thighs, tummy and upper arms and it&#x27;s definitely tone my areas.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review but after using the creme for about a month I have to. Firstly I was so skeptical about buying this, I didn&#x27;t know if it would actually work or a waste of my money. But I can tell ya it deff isn&#x27;t a waste of money. I have had cellulite ever since I was small(just runs in the family) I have always been so embarrassed about wearing a swimming suit since I have it all on the back of my legs and yes my butt lol. But I cannot believe the drastic change, there still is some but it has reduced it so much! It does get warm so deff don&#x27;t put it on a night big mistake I had to run to the bathroom to wash it off. But I am so happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
