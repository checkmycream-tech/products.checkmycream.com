      <li>Product came quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my face looks any better, but it&#x27;s fun to use, very moisturizing, feels really good and did not break out my sensitive skin :)</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this.</li>

      <li>One of the main ingredients listed is ALCOHOL, which causes dryness, irritation, and deterioration of the skin.</li>

      <li>This particular mask I do not recommend.</li>
      <li>*newest batch I received feels a bit different, sticky almost once absorbed...  </li>
      <li>Absorbed instantly!</li>
      <li>The one that I bought from Amazon did not make my skin feel good at all, instead it left a layer of oily residue that none of any other sheet masks has ever done before and it was gross.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 90% sure this particular product is not authentic.</li>
      <li>Just for clarity, my skin is very sensitive and dry with an mildly oily t-zone.  </li>
      <li>Came very early.</li>
      <li>I put the mask on right before bed and felt instant soft skin after</li>
      <li>The sheet is big enough to cover my face and more if needed and there was lots of left over product too for my neck area.</li>
      <li>My skin felt refreshed and extremely soft!</li>

      <li>It leaves it &#x27;plump&#x27; and really soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the real one before, the ones that my cousin brought back from Korea.</li>

<li> and I have been using it twice weekly for the past 3 weeks.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, with this product that is not the case.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> really good honestly very good i recommend the really moist ur face&lt;br /&gt;for 2 days hope they do more than that with the use.&lt;br /&gt;very happy with the delivery too. and the seller!!!</li>
    <li> I put mine in the fridge before using it to get that cooling sensation. My skin felt refreshed and extremely soft! Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Came very early. Felt great going on.  And left my skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I keep these in the fridge and put them on in the morning for a cool wake up. I rub the excess product when I put the mask on into my hands, and I don&#x27;t get a greasy or gritty feeling after. The product absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one once and loved it. I decided to buy a different brand because I thought that any collagen mask would be the same. Well three different brands later I bought this one again. It&#x27;s definitely the best one. It really does moisturize my skin. It leaves it &#x27;plump&#x27; and really soft. I use it once a week after a Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar scrub, followed by Pore Strips, then the toner, then this mask! It really does help.</li>
    <li> I love these types of face masks (very popular in Asia). While the professional verdict appears to be mixed on how beneficial they truly are to the face, overall they are very fun and soothing. This particular mask I do not recommend. One of the main ingredients listed is ALCOHOL, which causes dryness, irritation, and deterioration of the skin. Check ingredients when considering paper/cloth face masks. Some forms of alcohol are not harmful and used as emollients. Unfortunately, with this product that is not the case.</li>
    <li> I really love this. It&#x27;s the best collagen mask I ever tryed. I would reccomend this all day.</li>
    <li> Feels cooling when you put it on! I put the mask on right before bed and felt instant soft skin after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is a little hard to put on though.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my face feel all plump and moisturized after! Its very cheap too, and fun to use once in a while! Its definitely good for windy or more drying days.</li>
    <li> This product is a good deal but I think there&#x27;s a better collagen masks out there.</li>
    <li> I am not disappointed at all. Came faster than I expected and work like magic. I&#x27;m already about to order more. My skin is clearing up and just feels so much more hydrated.</li>
    <li> *newest batch I received feels a bit different, sticky almost once absorbed...  Product came quickly.  I&#x27;m not sure if my face looks any better, but it&#x27;s fun to use, very moisturizing, feels really good and did not break out my sensitive skin :)</li>
    <li> I love Etude products and can&#x27;t get to Korea to buy them.  These face packs keep me from needing Botox and get me compliments on my skin! Love it! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great sheet masks, pretty standard. Left my skin nice and plump temporarily erasing fine lines.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin due to my acne cream that is prescribed from my dermatologist. This masks makes my skin feel so hydrated and smooth afterward. It also helps with my redness. I love it! Will repurchase again in the future. (:</li>
    <li> made my skin itch at the end which a lot of masks do, but i found out that the newer masks dont have that itch anymore. overall i did enjoy this product at the time, probably still would if someone gave me it.</li>
    <li> After 2 uses, I can say it is moist-full but it was too big for my face. I prefer the size of the but, Becky masks. I will use the mask until they are done and then use another collagen type mask that fits my face better. Good masks if you have the right face type. Some of the mask gel may be stuck inside, make sure to squeeze it all out and use it.</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft, plumped, and hydrated after using this mask the first time. I have oily to combination sensitive skin and usually I break out in rashes to anything I put on my face. However this product didn&#x27;t cause any reaction at all, thank goodness! The sheet is big enough to cover my face and more if needed and there was lots of left over product too for my neck area. Left it on for 30 minutes and took it off and massaged the rest of the product on my face. Absorbed instantly! This product has a light fragrance in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Would buy these again. Love this face mask. Great customer service, fast delivery, great price!</li>
    <li> Moist for 2 days after using. My daughter brought me some of these from South Korea after she&#x27;d lived there for 18 months - and I fell in love with them.  Yes, the masks are super funky looking, but my skin stayed moist for 2 days following. I found myself squeezing out whatever moisture was left in the package and using after. Love these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 90% sure this particular product is not authentic. I&#x27;ve used the real one before, the ones that my cousin brought back from Korea. The gel texture was totally different and my face felt so good after using it. The one that I bought from Amazon did not make my skin feel good at all, instead it left a layer of oily residue that none of any other sheet masks has ever done before and it was gross. I don&#x27;t think I can return the rest since I already used one sheet but I&#x27;ll toss the others away. Update: just to be clear, the one I ordered was sold by World Wide Ware, but I&#x27;m not comfortable ordering from other sellers anymore.</li>
    <li> This thing works like margic</li>
    <li> it always meet my expectations, not a single complain about it for i am a regular user of this product.</li>
    <li> This mask makes my skin feel so soft, and look so healthy! My skin was practically glowing after one use! It also was really good at color correction. Just for clarity, my skin is very sensitive and dry with an mildly oily t-zone.  I will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> So far so good at first use... It didn&#x27;t break me out and it doesn&#x27;t leave greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing but I like to try different kinds as I do not notice any difference and I have been using it twice weekly for the past 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister and she is in love! Because of that, I&#x27;d buy it as soon as my other Korean Sheet Mask are almost gone. I ordered a bunch of these types of Mask. I love, love this product.</li>
    <li> I used this and it made my skin so soft!!!! Really recommend this product for combination skin! :)</li>
