    <li> I have only used once but love it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my GD, since her hair is fine and tangles easily. Makes the comb out much easier.</li>
    <li> This is another hair product I love to use just before I set my hair with curling Iron. Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a much bigger size but actually received the travel size.  Not too bad though because a very small amount does go a long way.  The product itself is GREAT!</li>
    <li> Love this product- leaves hair silky an soft a promised.  Do wish it helped against frizz a little more- I find I still need another product on top for that. Otherwise great and definitely seems to make hair healthier.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight virgin hair. This is awesome because my hair stays curled which never happens with a product, but still feels shiny and smooth with no stickiness.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I don&#x27;t feel any product in my hair, it feels soft and silky even second or third day feels clean. Will repurchase for sure.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Rather buy what they have at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Love all Kerastase products esp this one!</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit, and I love to use this product in this size for convenience when I am traveling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this smaller packaged version of this product for travelling as it is easier than decanting from the larger version which I use at home. I really like this product as it leaves my hair much more manageable and smelling lovely.</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> I received the shipment quickly and the product is great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kerastase for years.  I don&#x27;t use but a small amount and have found it to work very well on my hair - I am 70 years young and have thinning hair - this conditioner works great for me.</li>
    <li> I like it but kinda small not enough for travel case</li>
    <li> Didnt really work on my hair.</li>
    <li> I tried the 2 oz to be sure it worked- it does, very silky hair, much shine- great when styled- no frizzies with no build up at all. I use all the way to the roots as I wash daily, so why not condition? I color all the way to the roots so that hair needs a little extra attention.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again-</li>
    <li> Dry, curly hair? Have already tried many other brands that make your hair dryer the next day? This won&#x27;t. One of the few products that leaves my hair soft and looking good even the next day. After washing, apply to damp hair and style. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair smoother and shinier than any other product I have ever used when I blow my hair straight.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have been using after washing and before blow drying my hair.  I would highly recommend for anyone with fine, tangled hair.  Wish it was not so expensive though.</li>
    <li> Great leave-in conditioner.</li>
