<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was a very beautiful set, sadly I can&#x27;t use them for the children&#x27;s fun day but my little dancers will love them</li>
    <li> I received my order way before I was supposed to I LOVE all my Polish colors even the scented thanks for the nail flies also I just wish it had the clear &amp;&amp; French pink Polish other than that I love it will recommended it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤</li>
    <li> Verrrrrry upset! Nail polish chipped off within the first day!</li>
    <li> Wow! In-friggin-credible! Fantastic set and not a single duplicate or dry bottle! I bought it as a gift set to give to my girlfriend and i can confidently say that she will not be disappointed. Packaging was great and it arrived on time.Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I am starting to build my nail polish collection and these polishes are a great start! I can&#x27;t wait to use these polishes in my nail designs. None of my bottles were broken, but a couple of them had leaked from not being closed all the way, they were packaged great and I recieved them a week ahead of the delivery date.</li>
    <li> We were pleasantly surprised when our nail polish set came. Thought their would be some broken bottle or dried out bottles, not the case everything looked good. It was packaged nicely no damage. It even came earlier than expected. The price for this is amazing around a dollar a bottle you cant beat that.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 star because I haven&#x27;t used the nail polishes yet but I received everything. No repeated colors and they all look great, oh and no busted nail polishes. I am so ready to try them but since I bought them for a girl&#x27;s get together I have to wait. Shipping was very quick. When I am out of nail polishes I will definitely buy here again!</li>
    <li> i ordered these so that i would not have to worry about buying new nail polishes every week. it came late. It is horrible quality and came all spilled and broken. never buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> So many colors. They all look nice. So excited to try them all.</li>
    <li> These polishes take forever to dry and when they finally do they are extremely dull! I have had to purchase expensive base and top coat to endure this. I would have done better simply buying one good bottle of polish at a time.</li>
    <li> This went well for the 12 year old in my life.. She loves doing nails and has become my personal nail painter, along with her sisters.... We have spa night every weekend now..</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping. I had no broken bottles and everything was safely packaged.The item says 48 nail polishes with 5 free nail filers. I actually got the 48 nail polishes with 3 containers of nail polish removal pads. No complains here though. The colors are great, I got a little bit of everything. Got glitters, mattes, neons, metallics, opaques, etc. Love it!! So excited :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase!! Got it a week early and the packaging was great! Colors are vibrant and good variety! Very happy :-)</li>
    <li> I was expecting all the vibrate colors as pictured not the case too many dark blues. Two bottles came half full along with one cracked top. The free files were the best part of my order.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife for valentine&#x27;s day - she&#x27;s new to nail polish but wanted to just try whatever.  I read lots of reviews and decided on these.  They all showed up perfectly - nothing cracked or leaked, nicely packed, no duplicates - it was very exciting to open them all.  She is now blown away by all the choices she has.  There are lots of what I call &amp;#34;base colors&amp;#34; and then there are &amp;#34;enhancements&amp;#34; where it is clear or slightly tined but has glitter or sparkles or little stars/moons so you can make many different combinations of styles.  We had fun one day just trying a different combination on each nail, feet and toes!  Well, as for durability, I think it&#x27;s about as good as any other nail polish - it&#x27;ll last a few days easily, but would start chipping when you smack your fingers around.  Here&#x27;s a tip to prevent chipping, just flash your pretty nails at the nearest guy and ask him to do the heavy lifting for you  ;)</li>
    <li> First, I hate writing reviews but, i had to on this purchase.  I love this product.  The colors are awesome!  Since I have ordered polish online before I was prepared for a few broken bottles and a few duplicates.  The items were packaged perfect.  There were no broken bottles and only one duplicate.  It is a great color though so I definitely don&#x27;t mind the extra. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife because she loves doing her nails. The colors are very pretty.She loves the one with the stars in it. I am happy because she is happy it was a birthday gift for her. #happywifehappylife 😊</li>
    <li> when i recived this it looked ok but about 4 or 5 of the polishes where dryed out and it really expensive</li>
    <li> Great in the aspect of Quantity but horrible as regards to Quality. My clients went to go wash their hands and 9/10 the nail polish would come off. By the next day all of it would be off.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and was packaged great</li>
    <li> great variety and was delivered as promised</li>
    <li> It sucks. I have had them for a long time and you can&#x27;t even wear it. You are lucky if it lasts 24 hours without chipping. It&#x27;s very sad because I love the colors</li>
    <li> paint your nails 2 hours later it chips off its cheap and it doesn&#x27;t come with the case I gave the polishes to my little girls very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Okay let me first say that I started off excited about this 48 piece nail polish set! I loved all the colors and you cant beat the price,however my order was placed on 3/21/12 and my order was stated to arrive on 3/26/12.... Here Easter has passed yet when I track the order it states that my order is in transit??? I&#x27;am still shaking my damn head cause it should of been here by now! I have even been to the post office yet they claim there is nothing there for me or under my name. Not sure whom to point the finger at? THIS IS A EPIC FAIL. Ladiesssssssss don&#x27;t waste your time you would be better off geting nail polish from you neighborhood super market! Messing with Amazon and their procrastinating behinds! By time I get my order if I ever do it will be X-mas and the ish will prolly be broken from all the WAIT FOR IT....TRANSIT!!! The P.O. MEEEEEEEEEEEE!{(U,n)}</li>
    <li> i loooooooovvvveee these!! They are cheap, but they are good quality and fit the price!</li>
    <li> The paint chips after one day.</li>
    <li> I received my product on time and there was no product damage. There were 8 boxes of 6 polishes in my package. I&#x27;m very happy with my color selection. I also recieved a base and top coat. There were 2 repeat of colors but for the price of this product I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the product it peels off very easy I think I may return them.</li>
    <li> WIDE variety of colors.  Love the selection.</li>
    <li> I was completely in love with this!!! Super fast shipping, even during the holidays. Every bottle came in, there were no repeats and only one of the bottles had a tiny chip in it. (Good thing it was an ugly color) lol. I highly recommend buying this product. It is completely worth every penny!! As far as the actual polish goes, it is amazing! Very thin (but not too thin) Applies very evenly, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and all of the colors I received were quite opaque besides the neon and pastel colors. Doesn&#x27;t stain your nails. It&#x27;s just amazing &amp;#60;3  Definitely going to buy more from this seller!</li>
    <li> Colors were beautiful . Quality of the nail polish was horrible . I had it for 3 days and the polish was already extremely thick and sticky .( like how nail polish gets after you&#x27;ve had it for too long) only reason I have it three stars was because of the color .</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors with a nice selection!! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Good price for the quality.  The polishes are thin liquid requiring more than 1 coat applied to really see the color.  I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Colors were beautiful!</li>
    <li> Arrived in 4 days, a day earlier than it was estimated.  None were broken and there were no multiple colors.  All except 2 or 3 were clean and only a few had dried polish around the edges.  There were two packs of 32 polish remover wipes that came with it for free.  They were very pretty colors and seem to be bright enough with 1-2 coats.  Haven&#x27;t tried them all yet though.  Would have given 5 stars but they are kind of thick and could use a drop or two of paint thinner and need to be shaken a lot.  I think it&#x27;s a great product, especially for the price.  I would definitely recommend this product!! Packaging was pretty decent too.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors! After getting this pack there&#x27;s no need for more nail polishes lol. They look nice and are Not cheap quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got 3 daughters who are really into their nail polish so I got this as a treat. I don&#x27;t know anything about nail polish and was buying this basically so they would have a lot of colors to fool around with. My wife was very impressed and said that the quality is comparable to the bottles they buy at Walmart for around $4.</li>
    <li> Love the entire set..no double colors and came fast!!!</li>
    <li> I loved opening these packages when they arrived.  It was like Christmas morning all over again.  The color choices are phenomenal...  The polish goes on smooth and dries pretty quickly too.  If you love polish and want to have a different color everyday then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  Need to order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to use nail polish too often, but whenever I do I like to have a lot of variety in colors and designs. This set was perfect for that versatility, as the sheer number of colors were great to choose from! All very pretty colors from the darkest to the lightest to the most neonest one you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as many reviewers have already mentioned, this nail polish is not meant to last. Base coat, double/triple coat and a China Glaze top coat only held the color on my nails for no more than two days before it started chipping. Some colors just peeled off whole while I was in the shower. So if you&#x27;re looking for a temporary fix and like to change your nails frequently, this may be the polish for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the polish varied for me from color to color, but a lot were pretty thick/dry to me. I haven&#x27;t tried mixing any thinners with them, but I can see that it may be of use to put a few drops in the bottle to even the consistency. Those damned brush strokes were always present because of this. The brush itself seems standard, if a little cheaply made. But for less than a dollar per color, it&#x27;s not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time and in good condition, no broken bottles, and I live all the way up here in Alaska. Some complained about the bottles not being full, but I didn&#x27;t find this to be a problem. Cute nail files were also included (different designs than shown) and no color duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt I&#x27;d buy again, as I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever finish using this set... haha. But the product overall was not too bad if you&#x27;re not looking for OPI or China Glaze quality.</li>
    <li> Ordered the nail polishes about 2 weeks ago, got to say the colors were great, the packaging was good and the delivery was perfect!! I will definitely use them again..</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;3 sooo many lovely colors :D</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and they loved it</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to do her nails. I never liked doing my nails but she does &amp; she was gagging over this set.</li>
    <li> It was estimated that I receive my order between August 1 - August 15, and I received it today July 21, so I&#x27;m VERY happy about that! Even though I painted my nails yesterday thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be here until next week! lol Anyway, it was packaged very well, in an appropriate sized box, with bubble wrap and every nail polish bottle was covered in a plastic netting. There weren&#x27;t any broken bottles, so that was VERY nice!! I received 48 bottles and 5 nail files as advertised. Each nail file was different, so that is fun! All of the nail polish is different, so no duplicates, and the nail polish it&#x27;s self is as it should be. My only complaint about this purchase, is that I wrote the seller BEFORE purchasing this order, and I never got a response. I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t need to contact them right now because I have the feeling that they still wouldn&#x27;t respond to me. I just read a review that says they purchased this order, and another one with different colors under a different name, and I just did the same thing. They claim that it&#x27;s the same seller and the received the exact same colors even though both sales are advertised differently. I REALLY hope this is not the case, and I will be sure to come back and update my review when I receive my second order, which states it should be here between August 2 - August 16, so we&#x27;ll see! I hope that is not the case and that I actually get another 48 bottles that are different! Other than that stuff, the actual product IS as advertised! :-)&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: July 31, 2012 -  I just realized that the products that I received are NOT the products shown or advertized in this sale from this seller name. Instead the products that I received were the \\&quot;Rainbow\\&quot; colors advertized in the other sale that I bought by a different user name. There also was NOT an invoice in my box. I&#x27;m afraid that the two sales I bought ARE From the same user, even though they are not advertized as being so. I took pictures and put them up for everyone to see on this sale. I will update again when I receive my other order that SHOULD have been the \\&quot;Rainbow\\&quot; colors, but better be the \\&quot;Trendy\\&quot; colors instead since I already have the rainbow colors now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: August 2, 2012 - My second package of nail polish just showed up, and while the packaging and return label where different, I believe that these two sales ARE in fact the same person. Now that I&#x27;ve looked at the sales again, this sellers name is now on BOTH sales, and they didn&#x27;t have the same name when I purchased these two orders. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, the packaging of this box SUCKED! I liked the blue netting better, and it also protected the bottles better. This second box had one broken bottle, and that is better than more, but one broken bottle is still not good when I&#x27;ve paid for that bottle. This set should have been the \\&quot;Trendy\\&quot; nail set sold by this seller, but was instead labeled with the other sellers name and address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now getting down to the colors. Out of 96 bottles, I had 1 broken bottle, and 15 color doubles. I had expected two completely different sets of colors, just like most of the other buyers for these products, and for the most part, that is what I got. There are pros and cons to this fact, pros: the polish is great and the colors are nice; Cons: there are 15 bottles that are the same, for a total of 30 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the doubles aren&#x27;t that bad. The colors are pretty, the polish works great, and most of us like to have doubles of our favorite color anyway! So you just might end up with some new favorite colors! As for me, I&#x27;m going to send some of the doubles to my sister and my mom, and give a couple to my daughter.eryone to see on this sale. I will update again when I receive my other order that SHOULD have been the \\&quot;Rainbow\\&quot; colors, but better be the \\&quot;Trendy\\&quot; colors instead since I already have the rainbow colors now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: August 2, 2012 - My second package of nail polish just showed up, and while the packaging and return label where different, I believe that these two sales ARE in fact the same person.

    <li> I got this a couple days ago and absolutely love it. I just started Cosmo school so I wanted to start my collection up and this was the perfect start. My daughter also loves it because of all the colors haha. Really good way to start up a collection of that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I received this item today and I totally love the colors. The reason I rated this 3 stars is because I got two sets of the same colors and I didn&#x27;t received any nail files instead I received 3 nail polish remover pads. None of my bottles was broken so the packaging was great. Overall I love it! I got my package  within the delivery date.</li>
    <li> I love to paint my nails.  I do it almost daily.  The polish isn&#x27;t quick to dry but it stays on great and doesn&#x27;t peel too quickly.  If you&#x27;re looking for a lot of nail polish at a low price, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a amazing products! I like it very much!  I ordered this on 4th April, 15. And I received it on yesterday 10th April.  It come with nice packing,  no broken,  no repeat color and well quality!  I mean it just around $40something after tax.  It&#x27;s a really good price &amp;nice stuffs tho!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> They come off really easily, they don&#x27;t last a long time</li>
    <li> This is quite a collection of nail colors.  My only problem is that a great many of the polishes include glitter which is hard to spread and remove.</li>
    <li> Okay so let me start of by saying that you shouldn&#x27;t always make your decision on just reviews. I was a little scared buying this because of the reviews, some said they received clones of the nail polishes, or they arrived broken to their homes, some didn&#x27;t have the brushes inside or they didn&#x27;t receive different nails filers.  But everyone&#x27;s shipping is different. For me i received all nails polishes perfectly fine all of them had brushes and non came broken or leaking. They came packed with a little bit of bubble wrap on the bottom and a little on the top. They came in boxes of 6. And i received all nail filers different but even if i didn&#x27;t received them different i wouldn&#x27;t care because i still had nail filers. But the point is i made a good buy. I live in a dorm school and it takes extra shipping because it doesn&#x27;t go directly to my school is goes to the post office and then to my school. At the end of the day i think its a good buy. 48 nail polish for just 30 something dollars.  and theyre pretty good. They last a long time and they are unique. Its a matter how good you take of things and how you value them. Buy the product its really good.</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied and will be a returning customer, fits in with my budget. i love that i got a wide variety, which allows me to be creative in recreating as well as creating my own nail looks, none were spilled, package arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> i love the colors that came there was such great variety out of 48 bottles there was only one color i didnt like the the rest were awsome havent  worn them yet will update that at a later date.</li>
    <li> So many colors but they chip VERY easily, even with a top coat. Also, the metallic colors water marble pretty well.</li>
    <li> Most of the polish was dried up..two bottles were broken..the brushes in ten were disfigured.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The colors that were sent to me wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I thought I was going to receive spring colors as well.</li>
    <li> after reading some of the reviews i almost didnt buy these. but i am glad i did. the polishes were in boxes of six. packaged perfectly! none were broke or dry. no repeats. a great selection of styles. and it goes on nice and smooth. i will be buying the other color selections ASAP!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery package came in 4 days ordered on 6/22 got it 6/26 only one polish was half empty and not able to be used cause it was sticky besides that I am happy with all the polish and there were no duplicates and I love the nail files since I was in need of them. And I saved a ton of money vs buying 48 at the store even for 1.99 a piece I would havespent over $95!!</li>
    <li> Just got mine in the mail and I love them! No broken bottles and no duplicates! Great range of colors! So excited to paint my nails!</li>
    <li> This shouldn&#x27;t even get one star, but is amazons lowest rating.  I purchased this set even though it had mixed reviews. As soon as I placed my order I contacted the seller saying specifically that I DO NOT want ANY glitter polishes. I ended up getting 12!!! I also asked to get a bottle of the holo chrome everyone says was great, did not get that. It arrived two days late. The only good thing I can say is that there were no duplicates and also no broken bottles.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for me. I was so amazed that none of the colors were repeated!there was glitter colors,and metallic. I have had it for a month now and still havent used half. Also some colors do chip quickly but that can be fixed with a clear base coat. Other colors stay on for 5-8 days . You learn as you go.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the picture! I was pretty disappointed by the variety. They promise no two the same but I got half a dozen shades of silver. No actual sets of anything. Seems like a lot of reject colors. Probably less than a dozen that I would actually use. Pointless to get a good deal if most will just sit in a drawer and never be used:( if I were to if again I would just go to the store and pick colors I liked and pay way less in the end. You should too!!!</li>
    <li> it has lots of colors, lots of options, didn&#x27;t need to purchase any more polish i like the texture and the bottles that it comes in</li>
    <li> Unfortunately they are not as great as they seem to be three of the bottles of polish that my daughter got out of these 48 you try to twist them open in the bottle literally breaks in half her birthday was June 6th I&#x27;ve only had these for a little over a month and three bottles so far have broken in half would not recommend buying this product</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product it applies smoothly some require 2 coats to get a richer color but I don&#x27;t mind that because most nail polish requires 2 coats..great for nail art too!</li>
    <li> Ordered for my girlfriend. Had a huge mix of different colors, and ones with just glitter.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this.  Arrived with two bottles broken and leaked all over the place.  so two bottles not useable and both of those two boxes  (6 bottles in each box) with dried polish all over bottles- may try and clean later but may not.  Only duplicate of two colors but a lot of glitter ones so if you don&#x27;t like that type ....I would say 40% of the bottles estimating are glitter ones.  Tried one of the colors I did like and its very cheap  polish you can tell by the way it goes on and by the way it doesn&#x27;t stay on  (chips) quickly.  Only situation where these might work would be for a child or teen just playing dress up and such.</li>
    <li> There was a lot of variety and they were all in perfect condition. These were the perfect favors for the baby shower I threw.</li>
    <li> thank&#x27;s  will order more</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POLISH I USE THEM MORE THAN I GO TO THE SALON NOW I FIND IT EASIER TO GRAB MY BOX OF POLISH AND GO TO WORK!! SO MANY COLORS I USE MY POLISH NOT ONLY ON MY FEET BUT I PAINT KEYS AND OTHER THINGS TOO!! love it thank you again</li>
    <li> We were really happy with this purchase.  It was just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> Got a nice selection of colors</li>
    <li> Only one was broken , BUT  , by they way they were packaged I wouldnt blame the seller.I believe the one got damaged in shipping since they were like 3 in a box and many boxes to fit all of them . other then that they were all different colors no 2 matching and just as described</li>
    <li> Great buy! Might purchase again soon.</li>
    <li> LOVE it, it was a quick start up for my shop. Bottles came in tack and many colors to choose from. will recommend.</li>
    <li> daughter will enjoy them for a long time, wonderful colors,nice size bottles,larger than i thought,great price,thanks a lot,buying again later.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter who paints her nails probably twice a week. When I bought this, it was $47.50 so I mean, a dollar a bottle isn&#x27;t bad at all, but you get what you pay for. Probably 10+ polishes are too think to use properly, she complained that a lot of the polishes are clear with colored glitters in them and they are very similar. One of the tops came cracked. She had a salon-type top coat that is $8 and the polish still chips within HOURS. It peels off very easily, so not great for those who bite their nails. It&#x27;s okay for younger girls but not professional by any means.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: colorful&lt;br /&gt;  Pigmented&lt;br /&gt;  Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: consistency&lt;br /&gt;  Duplicate glitters&lt;br /&gt;  Chips quickly&lt;br /&gt;  Peels easy&lt;br /&gt;  Cheap packaging</li>
    <li> I just bought this item a little under a week ago, and I received it today. I have not tried every color, just one as a sample and from what I can tell this item is fabulous! None of the bottle were broken, the colors are phenomenal, the packaging is great, and I only received one duplicate but it was a barbie pink color so two couldn&#x27;t hurt ha ha. I was a little hesitant to buy this product because I had never tried this brand and some of the reviews weren&#x27;t great but I am glad i did! Definatly recomend</li>
    <li> This is great I bought this cause I needed some new nail polish and all my friends were jealous i love the colors all arrived perfect nothing was broken or missing I recommend!</li>
    <li> LOVE the nail polishes I received.  They were wrapped in bunches tightly in bubble wrap then in plastic...all 48 were accounted for and none broken.  I received 48 different colors along with the 5 nail files and could not be happier.  I did receive 3 red that are similar but they are different so I cannot complain.  Unsure which ones to use first...it is going to be some fun weeks ahead choosing from the new colors and glitters.</li>
    <li> False advertising they don&#x27;t send you the same colors in this pic I was looking forward to getting the dark green and light green and they only sent a regular green and they sent me two of the same color yellow and on the description it specifically says none of the polishes are the same color but I love the polishes but I wanted the ones shown in the picture</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled about receiving my package! Everything I received was packed well, and I had no casualties. The variety of colors that came are amazing! Everything you&#x27;d need for starting out was here. There&#x27;s a good variety of glitter, cream, jelly, and pearl polishes all included. The 5 free nail filers that I received were so cute too! I am so very pleased with my purchase! I was worried about the quality of the polishes, but they are FANTASTIC! Every polish I&#x27;ve tried so far have been true one coat coverage polishes. I cannot stress this enough; You need to buy these polishes!</li>
    <li> I got all the colors and everything i ordered...i love all the colors and the GREAT price for them all cant beat that no where else</li>
    <li> I got this set for my daughter for Christmas because she loves painting her nails and doing different designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s using it, but she&#x27;s not happy with it.  She has to re-do her nails every day with how bad this stuff peels off.  It cracks within hours of putting it on, even using a good base coat and by the end of the next day it&#x27;s chipping off so bad you really do have to re-do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s complained a bit, but I think she&#x27;s getting used to just spending an hour a day after school re-doing her nails.  I won&#x27;t buy this brand again, but the amount she got will keep her busy for awhile.</li>
    <li> Are all of them glitter? not all of them are glitter</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive all these nail polishes. I love the variety of colors they came in. Nothing was broken, it was packed very well. I had one double color out of the 48. My only complaint is that the nail polishes chip the next day, even with an expensive top coat. But, I also do a lot of house work, dishes seem to be the worst on nail polish.</li>
    <li> A lot of the polishes are really thick and don&#x27;t apply smoothly.</li>
    <li> This was a great product! I just got this delivered today, and it came before the expected date. Although the packaging was REALLY dirty and banged up everything inside was fine and nothing was broken. I didnt have any of the same colors and they are all beautiful. I would absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> The colors are beautifull, but the quality is not good</li>
    <li> I got them today and I&#x27;m happy but no nail filers</li>
    <li> Very happy with these, and the ladies at the Women&#x27;s Retreat had a ton of fun painting each others&#x27; nails.We allowed each woman to take one home.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a present to my lovely aunt, who is in love with nail polish!!! Let&#x27;s just say she was beyond freakin excited when she open the packets. Every girl in the family has their nail did lol</li>
    <li> Felt like I waited forever for these but really I was just so excited to receive them! Showed up right on time, some looked like they had been sitting for a while but with a little mixing up they were decent. Some colors are more of a tint than anything, received many duplicates and the polish chips very quickly after drying even with a top coat. But if you&#x27;re looking for a unique alternative to &amp;#34;thank you gifts&amp;#34; definitely try these out!</li>
    <li> Love all the polishes that came in the set. I didn&#x27;t get any doubles and that&#x27;s a plus. I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> No duplicates! great color variety</li>
    <li> Wow what a great collection</li>
    <li> First, I recieved a broken purple, number 166. It covered the polish bottles it was with in the box. Also, I recieved  a duplicate color number 140 &amp;#34;pastel purple&amp;#34;. Then, a clear coat i received leaks. I know this because there is dried clumped clear coat on the top of the bottle. Finally, I didnt receive the nail filers as pictured in the add they are just black. Also I received 6 filers not 5, but thats not really a complaint I assume. Other wise, I am pleased with the rest of the polish, though i have not tried it so i do not know the quality. I have emailed the seller of my problems, I&#x27;m now waiting on a reply. Will update once they fix this.</li>
    <li> Has Sought in Venezuela and can be sold at a good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality product and good finishing recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other vendors and customers. excellent product</li>
    <li> I love the options I have now! Got them fast and safe! Got a free gift of nail polish remover pads. Do not like it. The pad damaged my remote and now smells like burnt plastic</li>
    <li> I was so happy with the nail polish. 15 of them were matte but I put a shiny top coaton it and it was so gorgeous. One thing I was very sad about was I didnt get the colors in the pic. I really wanted the neon green. But lThe colors you get are really cute</li>
    <li> They were all different colors, I had no broken bottles and they were all full. Half of them were glitter. Love them!</li>
    <li> Love my nail polish thank you nothing is broken it&#x27;s all here thanks :)(:</li>
    <li> When I got the box it was a bit beat up which I attribute to my postal lady but when I opened it I noticed that there were a few that had not managed to stay in the box. None were broken but I will say these colors must have been sitting in a old dusty room because I had to wipe all the bottles off with a damp cloth. No duplicates only one was missing a brush but overall really great color variety!</li>
    <li> Great buy,  fast shipping,tight fit package, my only complaint is there are not too many red tones</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!!! Shipped and delivered the next day!!!! I love love love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good. I like them. A few of them repeated.</li>
    <li> Assortment of colors, no duplicates. I only received 47, but it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m pleased with the selection. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Dont buy!!!! Cant beleive any good reviews! Most shades of green, only 3 shades of pink, no reds, nothing worth buying. No response from seller at all! Sucked sucked sucked!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. I bought these to give out to my nieces (after taking the ones I really loved out) and it was perfect becuase they came in boxes of 6 polishes. I have to say I sort of expected really thin cheap nail polish - which is fine for little girls that want to play and change the color every other day. However, after using a couple of the ones i kept for myself I have to say I am really impressed by the quality of the polish. I could compare them to even some of my pricier bottles in my collection. Im really glad I purchased these! Def. worth the $$</li>
    <li> The nail polish isn&#x27;t as durable as I would have liked it to be. It only lasts on your fingers for about a day unless you paint several layers and then put a clear coat over it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, polish stays on very well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors are bright and they are all different. I&#x27;m a nail technician and I loved the glaze. The size is very good. The 5 files are spectacular gift. The mailing was fast and secure everything arrived fine. I recommend this product and the company is very efficient. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this nailpolish kit for my girls . WARNING ! Products arrived damaged and one was already used,some duplicate colors. Seller would not give me a refund .. Nail polish smell is very strong, I would seriously put it on outside, my girls (14) could not take the smell and they have tons of polishes. When applied ,each coat took 30 minutes to dry .&lt;br /&gt;The quality is poor , my girls won&#x27;t use this product, who wants to spend that long to do nails?&lt;br /&gt;What do you expect for $1 a bottle, I would rather get known brands , pay a little more, at least they will be used.&lt;br /&gt;I Noticed the price has gone up for Christmas!!  I will never buy such poor quality here again.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift.  I love the kit.  Great gift and large assortment of colors and quality nail polish!</li>
    <li> No special colors, but a wide range.&lt;br /&gt;not so good in terms of the chipping that are produced by the daily activity.</li>
    <li> people like it in my store,its my 3rd order.................................................my customers really enjoy it alot.maybe price it down  alittle to get it to where its affordable,since it is new in this market</li>
    <li> I like it but it does not come with the acrylic stand and some colors are very similar but in all a good item for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Paints were ok but I did not receive any shades of yellow or any white paints in my order. I did get tons of glitter polish which wasnt necessary but the order arrived with great timing.</li>
    <li> Lots and lots of various colors! My daugter will love all the options-</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors and textures.  (Glitter, sparkles, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;They smell very strong, but most nail polishes do.  But these seem to just smell a little bit more than some others I have had.</li>
    <li> I really loved the colors I got but my order was incomplete I was missing 30 nail polishes and didn&#x27;t get the filers</li>
    <li> Received my nails polishes yesterday! omg this is for real a very very good product! NO BOTTLES BROKEN OR COLORS REPEATED!&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend to buy this product the packaging was really good so the bottles did not break!!</li>
    <li> I am not a professional nail lady but I do love my nail polish.  I got all of the colors, no duplicates, plus they came really fast.  The actual nail polish chips easy but that is nothing a good top coat can&#x27;t fix.  One of my best purchases by far.</li>
    <li> The fingernail polish is beautiful...Came in just a few days..Was packaged great..Using it for a wedding shower favor,so I needed all different colors of pink, they did a great job of picking the colors.. Great job customizing my order..</li>
    <li> You cannot beat this price for the amount of bottles/colors you get. Both my daughter and niece LOVED all of the choices! Its pretty good polish as well. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Happy with the polish. The colors were fun. Did not receive the filers and after emailing them they won&#x27;t send.</li>
    <li> All of the colors are so pretty and I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates. They were also packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail today! Love it! All were accounted for. One bottle had leaked some polish but nothing I can&#x27;t clean up. Price you pay for having something shipped. No biggy. Packaged so it didnt get on any other bottles. They made a good effort to protect the bottles. Thats all you can ask for. The colors are really nice! Great assortment!  Even a top coat and a couple funky polishes (matte, metallic matte). Great start to my collection! If they had an option to buy another pack with different colors i would definitely buy more! Really pleased. Fantastic deal! Would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Missing over 5 nailpolishes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail polish set in hopes to get my 5 nail filers but instead I got a pack of eyebrow shapers...</li>
    <li> Got it today did my nails and my lil ones nails came in time colors are great love them thank you</li>
    <li> Packaged good and worked well, nothing broken  etc def worth it!</li>
    <li> smell is strong but honestly its not that bad once youve used it for a while. just make sure your painting your nails in an open space.&lt;br /&gt;as in, i dont paint my nails in my bedroom i do it in the living room. polish is pretty thick, never need more than 2 coats to get the colors. even for the pastels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t get any doubles. i got glitters, neons, pastels, metalics and just plain.</li>
    <li> There were more glitter polish than regular and the regular colors were pretty ugly</li>
    <li> I received my order in perfect condition with all 48 bottles nicely and individually wrapped as pictured in some of the other customer photos. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 star rating is because I won&#x27;t know the quality of the polish itself since I&#x27;m using all of them for a nail bar for my sisters birthday party. This was the best buy for the purpose in which I was looking to use it for. I&#x27;m sharing some pics of test layout for my nailbar. Thanks MissPinkCat!</li>
    <li> This product is really great! These aren&#x27;t the cheap nail polish brands you buy at Walmart; no, these are up with L.A. Colors and Sally Hansen! I wouldn&#x27;t regret getting these! They are worth the money! My only bug is that white isn&#x27;t in the set, and you use white for a lot of things. But other than that these are great!</li>
    <li> Great set however a couple of bottles was half full.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set from misspinkcat along with the rainbow glitter set. Of 96 total bottles of polish 27 of them were duplicates, 28 if you count one color I got three of. If your only buying one set you will probably be pretty pleased with your purchase, just don&#x27;t bother trying to get 96 different shades by buyin this sellers two DIFFERENT sets. They were packaged in blue netting, no broken bottles though some bottles did have leaked polish on them somehow. Not a bad purchase as long as your not buying both of misspinkcats sets. A yellow light purchase in my opinion. You may or may not like what you get so while the price is nice buy with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish itself is similar in quality to wet n wild or sinful colors nail polish. Not great but not bad either.</li>
    <li> what can I say well got it one day early and def love the colors I got noting broken and so glad I dirent get that dark green first color I wasn&#x27;t liking that one but instead I got really pretty colors n glitters and some are scented witch I thought was cool and got 4 files yep im happy :)</li>
    <li> received the product and I loved it</li>
    <li> Just got this set in the mail today! They packaged it very well in sets of 6 and I&#x27;ve already been swatching these colors and they are so beautiful. I also got some holographic colors and I am so happy no nail polishes came in broken or damaged</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my girlfriend on Christmas. It turned out that all the girls in her family got jealous and started picking out which colors they wanted :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was a huge hit and a great gift idea. 48 pieces is a lot!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these polishes. They were packed well and none were broken. All were different colors, no repeats. They included colors for all the seasons. The polishes arrived on time as promised. Would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, beautiful colors!!!</li>
    <li> It was soo thick and stained my nails</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM ALL PRETTY SO WORTH IT</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I were you I regret buying this product I got it late like 5 bottles were chipped . The nail polish stains your nails supper badly even when you wear a base coat most of theme are metallic and I got like 3 nail polish that were the same :( !!!!! I was supper exited then I got it and I wasn&#x27;t worth it . I spend 40 something dollars for nothing I ended throwing  away like 10/ 15 bottles</li>
    <li> the colors are very nice but as soon as you wash your hands it just comes off...it maybe nice for little girls cause they like to color their nails everyday so this way they dont have to use polish remover every time</li>
    <li> Okay so I read all these reviews to make sure I would receiving something worth the money and out of 50 something reviews there were only like 7 bad ones so I took the chance and ordered. This package was great none of the bottles came broken and all of them were beautiful out of the 48 though one polish seemed to have been half used or either it leaked but other than that it was great I received beautiful colors and types and they were packaged nicely. I didnt recieve any duplicates. I also received my package earlier  than the estimated delivery time. I say buy it!</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loved it</li>
    <li> They are okay ,3 of the same colors</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that there were several color duplicates—especially since the product description specifically stated no color duplicates.</li>
    <li> I received my polishes today and I am very happy with them. They were packed nicely in individual boxes of six nail polished each. Not one was broken. I love the colors they are very rich looking from the view in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Kolorize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like ordering grab bags.  I&#x27;ve done it with Japanese erasers on Amazon and I had terrific luck.  Already have 200 erasers (I get a little obsessive from time to time), I decided to move on to something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived very quickly and safe and sound.  I mean seriously, they shipped it an hour after I ordered, I was amazed. I ran into a small glitch which Kolorize worked with me on, they were awesome and I am thrilled with them.  I would order more right away but my house is filled with Japenese erasers and nail polish (I put in another large order with another company before this one...Like I said, I am obsessive) and I fear my husband may leave me.  I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.  I have not used any of them yet, I bit my nails for 35 years and  am trying to slowly repair them.  Even if I had, I could not testify about how long it lasts because I am very rough on my hands do to typing all day at work and also my nails are kind of warped because of the biting.  Between the two everything chips on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this review is personal preference, your mileage may vary.  It&#x27;s a grab bag though, so I really can&#x27;t complain about these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety was good, but it needed more pastels.  Lots of dark colors and lots of glitter, but most everything is usable except for two or three brown colors, and that&#x27;s just because my skin coloring is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a fun and enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li> Love it. Didn&#x27;t come with the filers but it came with 3 containers of nail polish remover pads and cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> I just received my polish today so have not used any of them yet. I got a little bit of everythin i think. I have metallics sheer neons and glitters and only 1 clear. I seemed to get more purples &amp; oranges then any other color, but all in all I&#x27;m happy with what i got.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase.  I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates. They were packaged nicely and all the covers were on tight. I got some matte colors, mettalic, duochrome, and of course normal nail polish! They are all beautiful! I love how they go on,  and the mattes are great! I see a lot of people complaining about chipping, my nails will chip the next day even with OPI and China glaze. Base and top coats are super important. These polishes are great,  and if gets thick add some polish remover to it. Just a couple drops.</li>
    <li> Colors where not repeated.&lt;br /&gt;Variety of shades.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping, I ordered it September 26th received it on the 29th. I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I orderd these for my daughters party goddie bags and i loved them, they were packed nice, none were broke and they came in 3 days early there were a couple not so cute colors but there was enough for each girl to get two so i just put the not so cute colors with sparkles!</li>
    <li> It is good but go a way so faster</li>
    <li> Pretty cool gift for girls. Got it really quick and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product, and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Bought with the plexi display unit and makes for a pretty impressive display for all my teen daughter&#x27;s nail polish.  The polish is smooth and great quality. My daughter re-paints her nails ALL THE TIME and she loves the variety of colors. This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I loved this package. The nail polishes are simply amazing. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with any. The nail filers were very cute and not the cheap kind! Beware though, there is no red, only red glitter nail polish.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was so suprised to open this.  The shipping was sooner than anticipated.  Lots of beautiful colors.  Might order for myself.  Highly recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> 48 colors of nail polish cheap what&#x27;s not to like....goes on perfect and does get all nasty like most</li>
    <li> The children at the orphanage absolutely loved this!  I purchased for my daughter to take with her on a mission trip and the children loved all the bright colors!</li>
