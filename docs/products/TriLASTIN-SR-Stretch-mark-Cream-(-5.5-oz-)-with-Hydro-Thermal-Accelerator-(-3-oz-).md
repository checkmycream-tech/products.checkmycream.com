      <li>Extremely satisfied with this amazing product!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m an honest customer who is not getting compensated in anyway for this review.</li>
      <li>I did my research and found this to be the most effective according to reviews.</li>
      <li>Received it very quickly!</li>
      <li>So make sure to have a healthy diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the cost I would have thought it was better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!</li>
      <li>have been using it religiously for about five weeks now and the difference is remarkable.</li>
      <li>so just learn early to accept the way you were born and be grateful :)</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice to finally have found a noninvasive way to get rid of them.</li>
      <li>product is hands down AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>Delivery was super fast.</li>
      <li>, the newer ones really went away quickly ..</li>
      <li>They were dark red and Incredibly noticeable if I took my shirt off.</li>
      <li>I recommend to use the product consistently and to follow the intstructions.</li>
      <li>But this really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2xs a day, and the accelerator 1x a day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m beyond excited, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and update later on.</li>
      <li>I just had a baby and my beatiful creature left me with a stomach full of strech marks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so so many different products for stretch marks wishing they would work but only Trilastin has worked for me.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical but I used this product all the way through the first bottle and saw a great decline in visibility of stretch marks on my lower back.</li>
      <li>My stretch marks have faded in size and color and the deep ruts in my skin  have actually started to smooth out.</li>
      <li>If they fade completely I will be forever grateful!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is related at all, but once I started taking my new multi vitamin, I really started seeing results.  </li>
      <li>The only reasonable change is in the smoothness of my skin textute..</li>
      <li>Have old stretch marks from my pregnancy (17 yrs ago)</li>
      <li>I have been struggling with these marks for years now, and tried various different creams etc, with zero success.  </li>
      <li>guess expensive not always means its good.</li>
      <li>I used it all up and didn&#x27;t notice any major changes.</li>
      <li>I bought this and used for 2 months and so far it looks the same</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of these creams and this is the first system that showed results.  </li>

<li> the ones that are taking a little longer to improve are the older darker Stretch marks.</li>
<li> Im african American, and  my scars were dark n deeply furrowed.</li>
<li> The marks have not completely vanished but the results are noticeable.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t care what it cost as long as it worked.</li>
<li> and I ended up getting some pretty bad stretch marks right in the front of my stomach all around my belly button.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a black American female w/ a lot of stretch marks on my stomach and</li>
<li> but I actually started seeing a slight difference.</li>
<li> /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t try any other cream.  </li>
<li> There a still a few days that they are a little red, so I will continue to use this for some time.  </li>
<li> I have been using Trilastin sr with the hydro thermal accelerator for the past three weeks on both my upper thighs and calves and so far...very little change has happened.</li>
<li> other than that its quite a lot of hype over little to no result...</li>
<li> Not even a slight.</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t so don&#x27;t waste your money purchasing this product.</li>
<li> Twice a day everyday after six weeks</li>
<li> im not sure if it worked or not, stopped using it after a while</li>
<li> Gets rid of those small wrinkles</li>
<li> I am thus far disappointed and have seen very little improvement, but I am hopeful that maybe it will work if I keep trying.</li>
<li> but there was a dramatic improvement in just a few days.  </li>
<li> and it was expensive too&lt;</li>
<li> So let me give you some background, I&#x27;m a 25yo guy who has always had the worst stretch marks on belly, sides, and arms due to weight lifting and weight gain.  </li>
<li> it been 4 days and you may call me crazy</li>
<li> It is very expensive and not what I was expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> and I buy a ton of crap from Amazon....</li>
<li> rubbed this product on me twice a day faithfully and I am very disappointed! :(</li>
<li> This product (Tri-Lastin SR and the Accelerator) is very expensive for zero results!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is great! Have old stretch marks from my pregnancy (17 yrs ago) and it&#x27;s nice to finally have found a noninvasive way to get rid of them. This product makes softens your skin and smooths out the stretch marks. I only started using it about 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m impressed with my results....can&#x27;t wait to see my results from continued use!</li>
    <li> Purchased my Trilastin SR and HT and I saw NO improvements in my deep stretch marks!...Turning to laser surgery NEXT</li>
    <li> I have used this after both pregnancies and have had an 80% reduction in stretch marks after twice daily used for only 1 month each time.  The best stretch mark reducer on the market in my view.  Quite pricey but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and used for 2 months and so far it looks the same, i dont see any&lt;br /&gt;difference on my skin...very upset with this product and it was expensive too&lt;br /&gt;I guess expensive not always means its good.</li>
    <li> 5 months, twice a day... Zero results!</li>
    <li> I do not like it. It is very expensive and not what I was expected.&lt;br /&gt;I want recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;:(((((((</li>
    <li> Going on my 3rd mth 3 supply and I can truly see a difference! I wish I would have used this year&#x27;s ago!  Im african American, and  my scars were dark n deeply furrowed. ....I see them lighting up and thinning out...I will continue this for the next 2 yrs plus!  If they fade completely I will be forever grateful!</li>
    <li> I have been using Trilastin sr with the hydro thermal accelerator for the past three weeks on both my upper thighs and calves and so far...very little change has happened.The only reasonable change is in the smoothness of my skin textute..other than that its quite a lot of hype over little to no result...but I purchased a two month supply so Im still being hopeful and  wish for atleast some fading ...sigh</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money and time. I&#x27;m still waiting on my refund. Smh</li>
    <li> Gets rid of those small wrinkles</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a black American female w/ a lot of stretch marks on my stomach and hips.&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed this product on me twice a day faithfully and I am very disappointed! :(</li>
    <li> Received it very quickly! Great price and I look forward to using this and seeing results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these creams and this is the first system that showed results.  Not only did they fade the appearance of my stretch marks but there was a dramatic improvement in just a few days.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with this amazing product! I&#x27;ve used so so many different products for stretch marks wishing they would work but only Trilastin has worked for me. I started getting tons of stretchmarks around my glutes as soon as I hit puberty and I&#x27;m now 19, this is the only product that has gotten rid of them. I never review products but Im recommending this to you guys because I know the struggle..!</li>
    <li> I tried both products as as directed. Twice a day everyday after six weeks no changes. Not even a slight. This product (Tri-Lastin SR and the Accelerator) is very expensive for zero results!! VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!</li>
    <li> Thought maybe this was the product that would finally take away my deep white stretch marks...it doesn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t so don&#x27;t waste your money purchasing this product. Skin damaged deeply through will never be the same so this is my last attempt after 20yrs of trying to find \\&quot;the product\\&quot;. There is no miracle or cure so just learn early to accept the way you were born and be grateful :)</li>
    <li> I used it all up and didn&#x27;t notice any major changes.</li>
    <li> The skin ligning isn&#x27;t as deep of the stretch mark as it was before anymore, the newer ones really went away quickly .. the ones that are taking a little longer to improve are the older darker Stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I just had a baby and my beatiful creature left me with a stomach full of strech marks. I did my research and found this to be the most effective according to reviews. Baby is already 7 months so strech marks are newish...  Delivery was super fast. And I began my treatment... it been 4 days and you may call me crazy but I actually started seeing a slight difference. I&#x27;m beyond excited, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and update later on. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I used this product all the way through the first bottle and saw a great decline in visibility of stretch marks on my lower back. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before and I buy a ton of crap from Amazon....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is hands down AMAZING!  So let me give you some background, I&#x27;m a 25yo guy who has always had the worst stretch marks on belly, sides, and arms due to weight lifting and weight gain.  I have been struggling with these marks for years now, and tried various different creams etc, with zero success.  I had practically given up on the possibility of taking my shirt off ever again... basically a &amp;#34;never nude&amp;#34;  THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this cream about a month ago. I can&#x27;t believe the results.  They are practically invisible now. There a still a few days that they are a little red, so I will continue to use this for some time.  But this really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2xs a day, and the accelerator 1x a day.  I don&#x27;t know if this is related at all, but once I started taking my new multi vitamin, I really started seeing results.  So make sure to have a healthy diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t try any other cream.  This product works.</li>
    <li> im not sure if it worked or not, stopped using it after a while</li>
    <li> I had both of my daughters back to back and I ended up getting some pretty bad stretch marks right in the front of my stomach all around my belly button. They were dark red and Incredibly noticeable if I took my shirt off. I decided to research and find the best product on the market. I didn&#x27;t care what it cost as long as it worked. After about two weeks of researching and scouring the internet, I decided to give Trilastin a try because it had some of the best reviews I could find and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it religiously for about five weeks now and the difference is remarkable.

This product works. I recommend to use the product consistently and to follow the intstructions. I purchased the stretch mark cream and the thermal accelerator so I suggest ordering both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an honest customer who is not getting compensated in anyway for this review.</li>
    <li> I am thus far disappointed and have seen very little improvement, but I am hopeful that maybe it will work if I keep trying. For the cost I would have thought it was better.</li>
