    <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to work! I use less than a quarter sized dollop for long hair. It leaves your hair soft and brings out the natural shine. I have normal to oily hair and use it sparingly. The product that arrived was the true thing, not a copy or fake as what happened to one reviewer.</li>
    <li> I am unsure... Doesn&#x27;t smell quite right. That could be because thisis a discontinued product &amp; it is old?</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon and I did not receive genuine Redken conditioner.  I did receive the correct bottle, however this is a conditioner I use from my salon and the product in the bottle was clearly not Redken Blonde Glam.  This product, if genuine,is a fabulous product.  The product I received was clearly non Redken conditioner put into a Redken conditioner bottle. I would recommend only buying this product directly from a salon where they can guarantee the product is genuine after this experience.</li>
    <li> I have really fine blonde hair, like little kid hair, so most products weigh down my hair and seem like a &#x27;coating&#x27;.  This conditioner is not only light, but it smells wonderful and this is the healthiest my hair has ever been - it feels like pure silk.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  So happy that I can purchase it from here!!  Plus I get the shampoo too!!</li>
    <li> Love Redken.  Love this conditioner.  I try other things, but always go back to this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price from Amazon.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have long blonde hair that dries out and tangles easily in the winter. This conditioner leaves my hair silky, smooth and easy to brush out. I can&#x27;t say that I notice any difference in hair color or appearance of my highlights, but I love this product as a conditioner and having using it for 2-3 years now.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner for my highlighted blonde hair. This is the best price I can find it.</li>
    <li> This product softens my hair and makes it easy to comb through after conditioning.</li>
    <li> ...and she couldn&#x27;t be happier with my mistake.  She loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, it´s perfect for my hair. I always get Redken products, and am never disappointed. Try the smooth down family as well</li>
    <li> Only conditioner I&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve used for about 8 years. I was buying at Ulta when they went on sale. Overall, this is as good a deal. I will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have found for color treated blonde hair that needs alot of care. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my hair soft and touchable as well as help with the brassy look of bleached hair. I have been using this product for sometime and I will continue to buy. I was one of those girls that would have 6 different bottles of half used product in them, not with this. Package arrived on time without any issues/damage.</li>
    <li> This is the thickest and most effective conditioner I have ever used.  Keeps my blonde highlighted hair from drying out.  I highly recommend it.  Also, its hard to find in stores.  Cheapest on Amazon!</li>
    <li> this makes my gray hair much lighter and a little golden</li>
    <li> Best volume of this stuff for the money. I&#x27;m a low-maintenance girl who does NOT use extra hair product, but I value the health and texture of my hair so I&#x27;ve been using the oddly-named Blonde Glam conditioner for years. Every time I try to switch (usually because I couldn&#x27;t find BG) I go right back, so the volume makes sense for me.</li>
    <li> I used to be a blonde but have recently let my natural gray grow out. I have used the usual blue shampoo but then decided to try my blonde shampoo by Redken. It makes my hair look good and the conditioner is great. I use both regularly. I am very sensitive to chemicals and this shampoo and conditioner does not make me itch - a great feature for me. If you&#x27;re blonde or gray - I bet you&#x27;ll like this shampoo (and conditioner), too.</li>
    <li> Love it and would like more if you have it</li>
    <li> I love this Product! Great scent and my hair feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Bought the shampoo and conditioner and love them both.Hair is silky smooth.  Hairdresser recommended it and it actually works</li>
