### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these purchase ☆</li>
      <li>Otherwise I think it&#x27;d be best to get more than 6</li>
      <li>I have just receive this rollers being at a good price I ordered three of them.</li>
      <li>Good for the price.</li>
      <li>Very cute and all</li>
      <li>However very cute</li>
      <li>Very cute, look just like the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cute and comes in 6.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>If it worked for her, it has to work for me! :)</li>
      <li>Short hair fits best, I think.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to use them properly which you can look up online</li>
      <li>Also there&#x27;s is really tangy smell, not as great as it says it would be.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and spongy like, and it&#x27;s sold at a reasonable price! :D</li>
      <li>I bought these sponge rollers because they were cheap and the strawberries were adorable</li>
      <li>It looks cute but cheap.</li>
      <li>This product is so cool !</li>
      <li>They came with a strong chemical?</li>
      <li>I am super satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
      <li>but this works best for about at the longest a little over shoulder length.</li>
      <li>Comfy to sleep in with a cap on to keep them secure.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made, but they work.</li>
      <li>Worked great on my long hair for easy and relaxed curls.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I got this in the mail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cute, but it doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that doesnt hold much curl.</li>
      <li>They are very cute but be aware if you have long hair..</li>
      <li>As I pulled them out I was able to get them back into a roundish shape, however some of the dots have wore off or looked like they were quickly painted on.</li>
      <li>I thought these curlers were cute and a nice change to the traditional pink foam and plastic clip</li>
      <li>I would love to see them in a regular box so they wouldn&#x27;t be all squeezed.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply on my hair, dry or not !</li>
      <li>I think though that if your hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine, if you don&#x27;t try to put huge chunks of hair in them, and if you wait until your hair is almost dry to put them in, they&#x27;ll work great.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought other strawberry foam rollers that were much better quality.</li>
      <li>I love them,they make my her curly in less than 20 minutes and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair...</li>
      <li>These are more suited for little a girl&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>one normally sold at a Walmart.</li>
      <li>Which this shouldn&#x27;t be the case if they are new.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to the strawberry rollers, there was also a Korean Aloe Face Mask for me to try out!</li>
      <li>The gaps are actually pretty big</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d read about these in a paper a while back, an article by a woman with hair like mine, i.e. fine and thick and so straight it&#x27;s almost slippery.</li>
      <li>If you have thin, fine, or short hair they will probably work for you, but if not I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>

<li> If you have thin, fine, or short hair they will probably work for you, but if not I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re about the size of an large apricot or small plum.</li>
<li> so they don&#x27;t stay on the hair for too long, so</li>
<li> These are very flimsy and I have thick hair</li>
<li> Honestly it just sloppy work and poor packaging.</li>
<li> Gave some out as stocking stuffers to friends who spent Xmas with us.</li>
<li> After struggling to put them in ONE time I found them to be bulky and hard to handle and then the next day when I was unrolling my hair it got tangled in them to the point I had to rip one apart just to get my hair out of it.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that they get a little tangled in your hair</li>
<li> When they arrived they were all squeezed into this little package.</li>
<li> also because even with slightly thin hair i ended up having to grab larger locks of hair together to prevent it from falling out</li>
<li> I have thick hair, so when i tried rolling my hair up, it kept falling down...</li>
<li> My only problem with them is that they take forever to curl hair, so I have to leave them in overnight, which is uncomfortable.</li>
<li> If you have thin hair, it may work, but if you have thick hair like me, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
<li> Not successful in using these rollers.</li>
<li> They also smell really bad and while the smell goes away after a while they are unusable for a couple of weeks.</li>
<li> it does get tangled which stinks!</li>

    <li> It looks cute but cheap.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, but they work. They had some glue stuck on the outside of them and couldn&#x27;t remove it without damaging them. Good for the price. They&#x27;re about the size of an large apricot or small plum.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cute, but it doesn&#x27;t really work well. I have thick hair, so when i tried rolling my hair up, it kept falling down...If you have thin hair, it may work, but if you have thick hair like me, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that doesnt hold much curl. I thought these curlers were cute and a nice change to the traditional pink foam and plastic clip one normally sold at a Walmart. After struggling to put them in ONE time I found them to be bulky and hard to handle and then the next day when I was unrolling my hair it got tangled in them to the point I had to rip one apart just to get my hair out of it. Overnight the middle core that you wrap your hair around misshaped and after one use I was left with 3.5 usable curlers. Also they reek of paint fumes so be prepared to have your hair smell like you showered with paint.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my long hair for easy and relaxed curls. Comfy to sleep in with a cap on to keep them secure. Gave some out as stocking stuffers to friends who spent Xmas with us.</li>
    <li> I received it well. It&#x27;s very cute and comes in 6. It&#x27;s nice and I shall soon commence an experiment with it overnight to see results! :) It&#x27;s very soft and spongy like, and it&#x27;s sold at a reasonable price! :D Strawberries are so kawaii~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought other strawberry foam rollers that were much better quality. These are very flimsy and I have thick hair so they just don&#x27;t hold up as well as the others I&#x27;ve used. They also smell really bad and while the smell goes away after a while they are unusable for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Very cute and all but this works best for about at the longest a little over shoulder length. My hair goes to the middle of my torso and it only curled my upper layers which are shorter well. Otherwise I think it&#x27;d be best to get more than 6 also because even with slightly thin hair i ended up having to grab larger locks of hair together to prevent it from falling out but then it wouldn&#x27;t curl as well. It&#x27;s best to use them properly which you can look up online but basically you wrap your hair in the roller and then you have to twist the roller or else it&#x27;ll just fall out.</li>
    <li> They are very cute but be aware if you have long hair.. it does get tangled which stinks! Short hair fits best, I think.</li>
    <li> They came with a strong chemical? like smell. It went away after I washed them.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this in the mail. I was pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to the strawberry rollers, there was also a Korean Aloe Face Mask for me to try out! I am super satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read about these in a paper a while back, an article by a woman with hair like mine, i.e. fine and thick and so straight it&#x27;s almost slippery. I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, but trust me - I will! If it worked for her, it has to work for me! :)</li>
    <li> Not successful in using these rollers.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s alright... The gaps are actually pretty big so they don&#x27;t stay on the hair for too long, so I&#x27;d have to tie the strawberries and my hair together so they can actually stay together.</li>
    <li> This product is so cool ! Very easy to apply on my hair, dry or not ! I really recommend this product</li>
    <li> The paint on the strawberries already. Also there&#x27;s is really tangy smell, not as great as it says it would be. However very cute and yes it does work</li>
    <li> I have just receive this rollers being at a good price I ordered three of them. That was my mistake. I should of only ordered one. When they arrived they were all squeezed into this little package. As I pulled them out I was able to get them back into a roundish shape, however some of the dots have wore off or looked like they were quickly painted on. I can still see the smear marks. Which this shouldn&#x27;t be the case if they are new. Honestly it just sloppy work and poor packaging. I would love to see them in a regular box so they wouldn&#x27;t be all squeezed.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;ve been growing out a pixie and wanted to experiment with some curl without damaging my hair with heat. These guys do the job. My only problem with them is that they take forever to curl hair, so I have to leave them in overnight, which is uncomfortable. I think though that if your hair isn&#x27;t as thick as mine, if you don&#x27;t try to put huge chunks of hair in them, and if you wait until your hair is almost dry to put them in, they&#x27;ll work great.</li>
