      <li>Great price for the size and bottle was intact and full.</li>
      <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Smells nice and teenager love the name ..</li>
      <li>Amazing buy must get more</li>
      <li>The London is also great but, not quite as good as New York.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding price.</li>
      <li>I have been using this brand for many years, did not find my nearby stores, so order it in online.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>I personally love that smell</li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>Playboy Malibu is so much better.</li>
      <li>I would consider it more of a &amp;#34;lucky you&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I really love the Playboy cologne scents, and this is probably one of my favorites of the bunch.  </li>
      <li>I also have bottles of Adidas Moves, Cool Water, and Ecko, but this is a really nice addition to my collection for some variety.  </li>
      <li>and it came very quickly.</li>
      <li>If you love Playboy Malibu or any new age cologne where it has a confident, not over powering, but nice distinct smell that can attract women.</li>
      <li>almost got whole set nice big bottle they also smell great</li>
      <li>I got him both this Christmas and everyone at the Christmas party liked New York over Vegas.</li>
      <li>New York is by far my favorite and smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>quick</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this one (Vegas) actually smells pretty good on my husband.</li>
      <li>In particular, the root beer flavored candies you can buy at cheap candy shops.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>We first smelled this in a WalMart.</li>
      <li>The prodect arrived as described and in a very timely manner!</li>
      <li>pretty much meaning I don&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance on my boyfriend and had been unable to find it locally, so I am very pleased to find it at amazon.</li>
      <li>It came very fast and price is decent...</li>
      <li>can recommend it to my friends and some family thanks</li>
      <li>I like it so much, I let the boyfriend open that gift early :)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice smelling long lasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is a decent smell but, not what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>People actually made fun of me for wearing it.</li>
      <li>He normally wears&lt;br /&gt;either</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t live it.  </li>
      <li>The only reason why I rate it 2 stars is because it was fun throwing it on the ground and watching people die from the 80 year old woman smell....</li>
      <li>All I could figure out was this was a very old bottle and had lost its fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get quite a few compliments as I have!</li>
      <li>they do put offers, we need to buy during that time.</li>
      <li>Vegas was my least favorite.  </li>
      <li>It smells like something and 80 year old woman would wear.</li>
      <li>So with that said Vegas is for everyday but New York is for that special evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars because while I do like Vegas it takes second place to the new Playboy New York.</li>
      <li>You may have to spray a little extra to get the potency of aroma you&#x27;d like, and the fragrance definitely doesn&#x27;t stick around more than a few hours, but I payed $8 for this with $4 shipping, and 3.3oz gives you plenty at that price to do pretty much whatever you like.  </li>
      <li>I ordered 3 different bottles based on reviews: PB New York, PB London, and PB Vegas.  </li>
      <li>if you want a nice scent without spending a ton of money you can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
      <li>From what I&#x27;ve read on the other reviews, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last extremely long, but I usually wear this over some type of lotion (either tanning or after-sun,) and the fragrance is pretty strong even with aromatic lotions.  </li>
      <li>only complaint he has is how quickly it fades.</li>

<li> This product sucks, you could buy the same thing at walmart for $1, or just look inside a sewer tank and swim indide it for a while.</li>
<li> I diddnt want the cologne to go to waste, and she hugged me like 5 min</li>
<li> I know very little about cologne</li>
<li> Overall, the Play Boy brands did not disappoint and for the price, you cannot go wrong.</li>
<li> Smells like an old man. :(</li>
<li> Preferred Stock or Photo, and was looking for something less expensive for wearing to&lt;br /&gt;his</li>
<li> for the price I figured I would prob end up smelling like a bunny store instead, but I was bored and was like what the hell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I know very little about cologne but here&#x27;s my layman&#x27;s opinion of the smell: its smells like root beer. In particular, the root beer flavored candies you can buy at cheap candy shops. I personally love that smell but I can see why people may not.</li>
    <li> This product sucks, you could buy the same thing at walmart for $1, or just look inside a sewer tank and swim indide it for a while. It smells like something and 80 year old woman would wear. People actually made fun of me for wearing it. The only reason why I rate it 2 stars is because it was fun throwing it on the ground and watching people die from the 80 year old woman smell.... Do not buy unless you are a 90 man looking for women in their 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Very sexy! Recommend it</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve read on the other reviews, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last extremely long, but I usually wear this over some type of lotion (either tanning or after-sun,) and the fragrance is pretty strong even with aromatic lotions.

I also have bottles of Adidas Moves, Cool Water, and Ecko, but this is a really nice addition to my collection for some variety.  And the size of the bottle for the price can&#x27;t be beat.  IMO a quality fragrance at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> almost got whole set nice big bottle they also smell great got here quick as well i have no complaints</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance on my boyfriend and had been unable to find it locally, so I am very pleased to find it at amazon. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and teenager love the name .. So a great gift</li>
    <li> I really love the Playboy cologne scents, and this is probably one of my favorites of the bunch.  Fragrance lasts quite a while, and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good I smell!  Definitely give it a try, you can&#x27;t beat the price and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get quite a few compliments as I have!</li>
    <li> We first smelled this in a WalMart. They had the aftershave named after several big cities.&lt;br /&gt;Cute theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this one (Vegas) actually smells pretty good on my husband. He normally wears&lt;br /&gt;either Preferred Stock or Photo, and was looking for something less expensive for wearing to&lt;br /&gt;his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint he has is how quickly it fades. It is gone in a very short amount of time,&lt;br /&gt;and that is for anyone, not just the wearer.</li>
    <li> Awesome job! I will come back in the future when I am looking for cologne. The prodect arrived as described and in a very timely manner!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t live it.  Playboy Malibu is so much better.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 different bottles based on reviews: PB New York, PB London, and PB Vegas.  New York is by far my favorite and smells amazing.  The London is also great but, not quite as good as New York.  I think I will likely wear it to work regularly.  Vegas was my least favorite.  It is not really the style of smell I like, so I will likely give it away to a friend or maybe my nephew.  It is a decent smell but, not what I was looking for.  I would consider it more of a &amp;#34;lucky you&amp;#34; smell as opposed to Aqua Di Gio.  Overall, the Play Boy brands did not disappoint and for the price, you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for many years, did not find my nearby stores, so order it in online. It came very fast and price is decent...they do put offers, we need to buy during that time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad and he said it didn&#x27;t smell like the other bottles he had bought.  All I could figure out was this was a very old bottle and had lost its fragrance.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> the product is very good&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend it to my friends and some family thanks hope to buy again with you bye</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product in stores for a while, cannot beat the price and it was delivered</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery. Very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding price. Great value.</li>
    <li> Great price and it came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size and bottle was intact and full. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Smells like an old man. :(</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Love this scent.</li>
    <li> My son loves this and item was in perfect shape when i got it.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad last Christmas he loves it. It&#x27;s a nice smelling long lasting fragrance. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because while I do like Vegas it takes second place to the new Playboy New York. I got him both this Christmas and everyone at the Christmas party liked New York over Vegas. So with that said Vegas is for everyday but New York is for that special evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fellas if you want a nice scent without spending a ton of money you can&#x27;t go wrong with this or if you want to give a last minute gift it&#x27;s prefect great price and great scent.</li>
    <li> great smell like the cologne</li>
    <li> I like it so much, I let the boyfriend open that gift early :)  I suggest the scent to any male!</li>
    <li> Good man lol tool bitches</li>
    <li> I came across this wanting to smell like bunny for my girl...for the price I figured I would prob end up smelling like a bunny store instead, but I was bored and was like what the hell. So I get home ask her to smell it and she gave me the \\&quot;its ok\\&quot; thing..pretty much meaning I don&#x27;t like it and u suck in girl terms...I put it on like a month later with out her knowing just cause I diddnt want the cologne to go to waste, and she hugged me like 5 min after I put it on and she wa like \\&quot;ooo what&#x27;s that \\&quot; in a kind of voice where I thought she was going to pin me and have her way..so even though it does smell like a grandma, its does the job...u just got to let it sit for a min</li>
    <li> If you love Playboy Malibu or any new age cologne where it has a confident, not over powering, but nice distinct smell that can attract women. Get this cologne. Trust me, you will get a great amount of attention. Playboy colognes are the best cologne series out there</li>
    <li> Amazing buy must get more it&#x27;s all I want and my girlfriend loves it on me so this is a must buy</li>
    <li> This cologne has a great smell to it! One of my favorites from Playboy!</li>
    <li> My husband had been wanting this for awhile and he was very satisfied once it arrived. You cant beat that price either.</li>
