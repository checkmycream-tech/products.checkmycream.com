<ol>
      <li>one of the best body care lines to use when pregnant--check out the Environmental Watch Group ([...])</li>
      <li>This is awesome!</li>
      <li>Although it works perfectly as the under makeup cream</li>
      <li>lol!!</li>
      <li>With a sun screen of SPF 17 and no scent, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>The SPF meant a lot with my fair skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite!</li>
      <li>I react to EVERY kind of makeup and it doesnt cause any reaction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very satisfied, and grateful to Mychelle for putting out a good yet affordable product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve researched the product ingredients extensively &amp; am pleased with their selection, sourcing, sustainability &amp; quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Texture is more like a day cream than a sunscreen, so for me it doubles as both.  </li>
      <li>, I know many women do not, also if overly applied it can rub of so care with making sure, a bit goes a loong way.</li>
      <li>Love Mychelle and will buy more and more and more</li>
      <li>My skin seems to get &amp;#34;bored&amp;#34; with product (OK, maybe I do too)</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this purchase,...</li>
      <li>I appreciate this company&#x27;s attempts to keep their products healthy.</li>
      <li>Mychelle is a safe product.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s more info: http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/nanoparticles-in-sunscreen/</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s magic in a jar.</li>
      <li>I bought it at Sprouts and glad to know it is available here.</li>
      <li>It feels good, affords some sun protection and helps smooth out the night-time wrinkles, but my whole Mychelle routine with serums and polypeptide cream</li>
      <li>feels much more effective much longer.</li>
      <li>I layer it over a serum or moisturizer and it feels fine on my skin, not like</li>
      <li>It is light and non greasy.</li>
      <li>comfortable.</li>
      <li>Love anything from Mychelle, but this is a particular favorite now.</li>
      <li>I love this product, first of all the texture</li>
      <li>I really liked the scent and feel of this lotion, and loved that it&#x27;s natural with no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>Clean.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, and my skin adores it so much I want to keep on reapplying :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;MyChelle founded by Myra Michelle Eby who believes that skincare should be all natural and highly effective, without the use of parabens, urea, EDTA or phthalates.</li>
      <li>I love this whole line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not my new favorite product either, so I&#x27;m still hunting for the perfect natural daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have to say, however for me personally I love scent in creams, and that is a personal pref</li>
      <li>Was really hopeful!</li>
      <li>independent company based out of Colorado, MyChelle&#x27;s website features an ingredient glossary that lists &amp; explains all ingredients (many of which are organic, almost all of which are plant &amp; fruit based).&lt;br</li>
      <li>very basic, great for dryer climates, has the sunscreen protection but doesnt smell like it - and if you have dry skin it will keep you covered.</li>
      <li>I switched to Origins, which is twice the price but lasts more than twice as long.</li>
      <li>I love all of the Mychelle products I&#x27;ve used, but this sunscreen has a bit of a chalky feel and doesn&#x27;t feel soft and smooth on the skin like the other Mychelle face creams.</li>
      <li>I use this 1st thing in the morning after a spritz of Mychelle fruit fiesta toner when I don&#x27;t have time to do my whole face washing thing.</li>
      <li>but there are too much chipping on my face.  </li>
      <li>Light, not greasy, not white, fragrance-free.</li>
      <li>I have many environmental &amp; chemical sensitivities which mean I have to be very careful about using only the best natural, organic ingredients in my food &amp; body care.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without it!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite everyday spf lotion for my face and neck.</li>
      <li>Whenever zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are used in clear sunscreens like this one, they are used at the nano scale.</li>
      <li>This caused me to run through the lotion much quicker than I anticipated, especially for the price of it.</li>
      <li>Even some beauty products claiming to be for sensitive skin irritate my skin or break me out.</li>
      <li>Once putting the finger into the product, I feel its texture like tofu (soft).</li>
      <li>This sun screen, which ranks well with the EWG, is light enough to apply over other skin products without feeling like you&#x27;re smothering every pore in your face.  </li>
      <li>Not oily or sticky, just right for everyday wear.</li>

    <li> Light, not greasy, not white, fragrance-free. Clean. My favorite!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday spf lotion for my face and neck. It is light and non greasy. I layer it over a serum or moisturizer and it feels fine on my skin, not like I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Mychelle products I&#x27;ve used, but this sunscreen has a bit of a chalky feel and doesn&#x27;t feel soft and smooth on the skin like the other Mychelle face creams. It makes my skin feel dry and make up is difficult to apply over it. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not my new favorite product either, so I&#x27;m still hunting for the perfect natural daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So sad that this product made me break out.  Will have to find another spf day cream.  Was really hopeful!</li>

    <li> I love this whole line. I react to EVERY kind of makeup and it doesnt cause any reaction. I even recomend it on my blog!</li>
    <li> With a sun screen of SPF 17 and no scent, this is a great product. Pricey, as this product is, it will doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and is non toxic. Thank you, would buy from this site again. Mychelle is a safe product.</li>
    <li> I use this 1st thing in the morning after a spritz of Mychelle fruit fiesta toner when I don&#x27;t have time to do my whole face washing thing. It feels good, affords some sun protection and helps smooth out the night-time wrinkles, but my whole Mychelle routine with serums and polypeptide cream feels much more effective much longer.</li>
    <li> I hate sunscreen. As a woman with caramel skin, sunscreen makes me look ashen, but not this cream. It&#x27;s magic in a jar. Love it!! Love Mychelle and will buy more and more and more lol!!</li>
    <li> Once putting the finger into the product, I feel its texture like tofu (soft). Spread it out on my face like melting the tofu... comfortable. Zero weight. This product can definitely use as moisturizer and with SPF, a bonus. Just yummy to my skin! Zinc Oxide only! I&#x27;m allergic to Titanium Dioxide.</li>
    <li> Love anything from Mychelle, but this is a particular favorite now. I don&#x27;t think I can live without it!</li>
    <li> Just a warning that this product contains denatured alcohol in it which is not listed in the ingredients on this page.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this purchase,... I love this product, first of all the texture is that of a 500$  moisturizer. It goes on smooth, and my skin adores it so much I want to keep on reapplying :)&lt;br /&gt;it is a matt finish however not drying, brings enough hydration to the skin, and it will not leave it oily or overly dewey. I would trust this cream and repurchase again. I have to say, however for me personally I love scent in creams, and that is a personal pref, I know many women do not, also if overly applied it can rub of so care with making sure, a bit goes a loong way. I bought it at Sprouts and glad to know it is available here.</li>
    <li> Even some beauty products claiming to be for sensitive skin irritate my skin or break me out. This is awesome! Not oily or sticky, just right for everyday wear.</li>

This caused me to run through the lotion much quicker than I anticipated, especially for the price of it. I switched to Origins, which is twice the price but lasts more than twice as long.</li>
    <li> This does the trick. very basic, great for dryer climates, has the sunscreen protection but doesnt smell like it - and if you have dry skin it will keep you covered. will buy again!</li>
    <li> I got chipping from my previous daily cream so I searched and ordered this one.  After I ordered it, the previous one stopped showing chipping till it ran out.  Unfortunately, I am getting chipping from this product every day since day 1.  Although it works perfectly as the under makeup cream but there are too much chipping on my face.  It is so frustrated I have to try another brand again.</li>
    <li> This sun screen, which ranks well with the EWG, is light enough to apply over other skin products without feeling like you&#x27;re smothering every pore in your face.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and doesn&#x27;t have that white zinc-y look.  I appreciate this company&#x27;s attempts to keep their products healthy.</li>
    <li> One of the few day creams I have bought repeatedly.  My skin seems to get &amp;#34;bored&amp;#34; with product (OK, maybe I do too) and I usually only purchase a product 2-3 times before switching to something else.  I have used this cream and other Mychelle products for several years, with no desire or need to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as smelly as other sunscreen products.  Texture is more like a day cream than a sunscreen, so for me it doubles as both.  Not too oily and not too dry.  I have a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; in the medicine cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied, and grateful to Mychelle for putting out a good yet affordable product.</li>
    <li> Whenever zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are used in clear sunscreens like this one, they are used at the nano scale. There&#x27;s some evidence that the particles don&#x27;t cross the skin barrier (and enter the bloodstream), but not a lot of science either way yet. Here&#x27;s more info: http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/nanoparticles-in-sunscreen/</li>
