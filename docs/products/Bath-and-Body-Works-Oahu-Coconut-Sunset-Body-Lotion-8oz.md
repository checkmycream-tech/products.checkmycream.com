    <li> Pineapple, yes. Coconut? Not really. But this scent is light, fresh, very summery. Waikiki Beach Coconut and Kauai Lei Flower are also yummy and lovely, but smell quite similar to this, although this profile is much sweeter, IMO. I suspect they all have the same base. Four stars for not enough coconut. Still looking for that &amp;#34;Hawaiian Tropic&amp;#34; smell from my teenaged years. This is not quite it.</li>
    <li> Tied for my number one with two other scents, the shower gel is even better than this lotion! You will be in a better mood once you use it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SMELL!!!! I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS</li>

    <li> Was open in box and leaked all over but it smells ok</li>
