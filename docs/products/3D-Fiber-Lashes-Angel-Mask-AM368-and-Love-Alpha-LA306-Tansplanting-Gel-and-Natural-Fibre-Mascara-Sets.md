      <li>I have puny lashes and to top it off they&#x27;re blond.  </li>
      <li>the fibers in better.</li>
      <li>I would recommend with something else on top.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this set.  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend this product and the price is amazing.</li>
      <li>Originally I was looking for Younique but came across this one instead.</li>
      <li>My own mascara is a lengthening mascara that I&#x27;m very happy with for regular daytime use, so for evening or special occasions these products really do provide that extra oomph.  </li>
      <li>This product is excellent, easy and fast to use and makes lashes look fuller without making them clumpy and heavy.</li>
      <li>then gel then more fibers more gel than my own blackest black mascara.</li>
      <li>i love it so much</li>
      <li>and I am good to go with thick long beautiful lashes!  </li>
      <li>I usually only do one coat with these products after I apply my own mascara</li>
      <li>Love the fiver lashes work wonders and love the black fiber.</li>
      <li>I just tried these,  and can do better with regular mascara.</li>
      <li>The one that is in the purple tube is even better than the second one that comes with the set</li>
      <li>My work around is to put a coat of regular mascara over the top of these to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>again, it&#x27;s that whole &amp;#34;Effie-thing&amp;#34;)- easiest to do 1 eye at a time;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>I had heard of the brand-named product that sells for $30.00 and just wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much on 1 set.</li>
      <li>I have used similar brands before but this is WAY better than that high dollar housewife selling brand...</li>
      <li>I have very stubby lashes and this product makes them look a mile long and very pretty!!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get the cute little leopard case but who cares when I got double the product :-).</li>
      <li>but I found it seals the whole thing in).</li>
      <li>and they really do amp up the volume and length</li>
      <li>I was a huge fan of Too faced fiber lashes but the price was high and the fibers were white.</li>
      <li>Typically I use a waterproof mascara on top to keep them in place longer and give a fuller appearance</li>
      <li>I like the black fiber to match my mascara better and cover easier.</li>
      <li>Ok this takes a little practice</li>
      <li>I can fine tune it and put as much, or as little, as I need-</li>
      <li>(I use Covergirl Clear-</li>
      <li>I do not like spending a lot of time putting my make up on in the morning because I start early in the day and don&#x27;t want to get up really early.</li>
      <li>It came early.</li>
      <li>So when I saw the offer for 2 sets for half the price, I thought it would be worth the risk.</li>
      <li>- I can tell a real difference when I&#x27;ve done one eye with the Fiber Lashes and then have just my mascara on the other.  </li>

    <li> Falsies make me look like Effie (-from the Hunger Games) and it scares me enough to stay away from lash extensions. Originally I was looking for Younique but came across this one instead. It had an extra set &amp; was 70% cheaper. Other than the fact it didn&#x27;t come with directions- it&#x27;s pretty awesome &amp; I&#x27;m really happy with it. I like that I can fine tune it and put as much, or as little, as I need- to get the look I want. Trial &amp; error.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful Tips: 1) Curl your lashes;&lt;br /&gt;2) 1 coat of YOUR mascara (I use Covergirl Clear- again, it&#x27;s that whole &amp;#34;Effie-thing&amp;#34;)- easiest to do 1 eye at a time;&lt;br /&gt;3) 2 coats of the Transplanting Gel;&lt;br /&gt;4) 2 coats of fiber lashes (I only did 1/2 the length of my lashes (middle-to-end, adds lash length to your lashes). The brush looks dried out- not to worry- it&#x27;s the fiber lashes. They&#x27;ll catch onto the Transplanting Gel you just put on the lash.&lt;br /&gt;5) 1 coat of YOUR mascara (-optional, but I found it seals the whole thing in).</li>
    <li> Disappointed with this brand of false lashes. The primer does not make the lashes stick like it should. I find myself looking in the mirror and see clumps on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I have very stubby lashes and this product makes them look a mile long and very pretty!!  Stays on until you want them to come off easily with warm water and cleanser!!</li>
    <li> The shipping on time.! Poor quality.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in the time promised, but I was disappointed when I opened and used the product. The tubes are made of thin plastic and the bottoms had a sticker with Chinese writing on bottom, initially leading me to believe these are not guinuine name brand products, but rather counterfeited items. This mascara has a smell to it unlike any mascara I have come across and I worry what the actual ingredients are. I would not recommend purchase from this seller as I truly believe it is a knock-off product, and a bad one at that.</li>
    <li> Love the fiver lashes work wonders and love the black fiber. I was a huge fan of Too faced fiber lashes but the price was high and the fibers were white. I like the black fiber to match my mascara better and cover easier. They do shed a lot though. Without that I would give 5 stars. My work around is to put a coat of regular mascara over the top of these to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the fibers in better. Plus it gives a fuller look. I would recommend with something else on top. Typically I use a waterproof mascara on top to keep them in place longer and give a fuller appearance</li>
    <li> Did not do what it say it was going to do</li>
    <li> fantastic!! always getting compliments on my eyes...great price too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use and made my lashes look great</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this set.  I had heard of the brand-named product that sells for $30.00 and just wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much on 1 set. So when I saw the offer for 2 sets for half the price, I thought it would be worth the risk. I do not like spending a lot of time putting my make up on in the morning because I start early in the day and don&#x27;t want to get up really early. Also I have stopped using a eye lash curler because they were breaking of my lashes. This product is excellent, easy and fast to use and makes lashes look fuller without making them clumpy and heavy. I was disappointed to see that they are sold out and don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;ll get more. I use it with a regular mascara to make it go even further. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Ok this takes a little practice but omg my lashes looked great after applying. I curled my lashes then applied the fibers then gel then more fibers more gel than my own blackest black mascara. My lashes were beautiful!!! My husband even noticed...asked what I did to my lashes. He thought I put on individual fake lashes. I highly recommend this product and the price is amazing. I paid 20.00 for two fiber lash builders and two gels. I didn&#x27;t get the cute little leopard case but who cares when I got double the product :-). This costs less then one mascara. I didn&#x27;t even wait long for this either. It came early. I noticed on some reviews that they had flaking of the fibers. I didn&#x27;t and I wear contacts as well. Putting it on u may get some fibers on your face but they easily wipe off. This now is a staple in my makeup case. I will never be without it. I am a very satisfied customer. Thank you Amazon for having this wonderful product on your site. I thank the makers of this wonderful product. It&#x27;s always nice to buy something that says it will do what it does.</li>
    <li> I have used similar brands before but this is WAY better than that high dollar housewife selling brand... Younique.  The one that is in the purple tube is even better than the second one that comes with the set but they are both awesome and the price cannot be beat!  With the expensive brand I would get fibers all over my face by the end of the day.  I apply the gel then the fibers and gel again and I am good to go with thick long beautiful lashes!  I LOVE THIS!!</li>
    <li> Second time ever ordering from Amazon - before I order this item I read the reviews. By reading everyone&#x27;s input was why I bought this product. I was very disappointed. It does not go on as well as everyone was saying it would. And yes it clumps. I wear contacts and the filler part can get into the contacts. I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> I have puny lashes and to top it off they&#x27;re blond.  I usually only do one coat with these products after I apply my own mascara and they really do amp up the volume and length - I can tell a real difference when I&#x27;ve done one eye with the Fiber Lashes and then have just my mascara on the other.  My own mascara is a lengthening mascara that I&#x27;m very happy with for regular daytime use, so for evening or special occasions these products really do provide that extra oomph.  The only issue I have with these is that they do clump a bit, but I comb through them after I&#x27;ve applied the fibers and before I apply the sealer.</li>
    <li> i love it so much im buying more</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all like it&#x27;s represented.</li>
    <li> Not the best. I just tried these,  and can do better with regular mascara.</li>
