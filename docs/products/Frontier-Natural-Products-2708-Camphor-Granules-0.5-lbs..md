      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried different types of camphor  - this one by Frontier is the closest match to the old Sea Breeze smell and is inexpensive, non-toxic, PURE, and the granular crystals dissolve easily in alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>any of you find an economical source for the little camphor blocks, post a comment near this review because the blocks are more convenient to use.</li>

      <li>I started using Sea Breeze astringent at 14 years old (I&#x27;m 60 now), and was dismayed when the original formula was changed some years back.</li>
      <li>you want to try this method for protecting your tools economically, save used plastic and glass jars, such as those you have for jams, jelly, peanut-butter etc.</li>
      <li>WORKS WELL, I BURN SOME ALMOST DAILY ON MY CUTE PLUG INS NIGHTLIGHTS LITTLE LAMPS FROM GENES NAT.</li>
      <li>This is a naturally derived form of camphor as I found on the frontier website.  </li>
      <li>Camphor works well for this purpose, especially if you use enough and the tool containers are sealed reasonably well.</li>
      <li>Although this product is ten times the cost of the old blocks we used to buy, it is still one tenth the cost of commercial corrosion inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> You need only dry them out in an oven for reuse.</li>
<li> I tried to crumble them, crush them, break them into smaller pieces, but it was too wet?  </li>
<li> A little small as I have found larger packages for a lower price, but, shipped fast and was as described.</li>
<li> The general formula is 60/40 alcohol/water with small amounts of camphor, eucalyptus oil (eucalyptus radiate) , clove bud oil (eugenia caryophyllata), and glycerin.</li>
<li> I have used other Camphor products, particularly the ones from India in the small round discs.</li>
<li> If you want to protect your tools inexpensively, save all your desiccant packages from electronic equipment and other items you may have purchased, because they are all re-useable indefinitely.</li>
<li> Beware of other products that have only a small percentage of active camphor.</li>
<li> Beware of other products that have only a small percentage of active camphor.</li>
<li> These look pure and dissolve readily in my sesame oil base.</li>
<li> Place a few tablespoons of granulated camphor in the jar and cover with cheese cloth, held in place by a rubber band.</li>
<li> The shipping was a trifle slow compared to other Amazon orders I have placed, but it came before the estimated delivery date.&lt;br</li>
<li> Placing small quantities of camphor inside tool drawers helps prevent the electro-chemical reaction that causes rust.</li>
<li> I was covered in tiny blisters that itched like crazy after swimming in The Gulf and the camphor got rid of the itch and dried the rash up.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed with this purchase because it was supposed to be in granular form, but it was in clumps that were large like golf balls.  </li>
<li> suggest moving it to an airtight storage container rather than the bag it comes in, though, as the granules like to collect the moisture in the air and turn into a hard clump.</li>
<li> I added them to my lotion by slowly warming it in a pan</li>
<li> the old-days, we could go to the corner drugstore and buy camphor blocks, about 1-inch square and 1/4 inch thick.</li>
<li> For very small drawers, you can skip the jar and just wrap camphor granules in any lightweight porous cloth.</li>
<li> I was never happy with the affect they had in the healing oil in which I use them.</li>
<li> the way, Tiger Balm also uses camphor, eucalyptus and clove as it&#x27;s active ingredients and is used as insect repellent in India.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these granules!</li>
<li> it is just impossible.</li>
<li> I use this all the time for my sick children.  </li>

    <li> I AM GLAD TO HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT, FIRST TIME USER BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT BECAUSE WORKS WELL, I BURN SOME ALMOST DAILY ON MY CUTE PLUG INS NIGHTLIGHTS LITTLE LAMPS FROM GENES NAT. PRODUCTS AND , IS NOT THE GREATEST SMELL BUT KEEP BUGS AWAY, ALSO I MAKE LITTLE SACHETS LITTLE BAGS AND FILL THEM WITH THIS PRODUCT AND PUT THEM ON THE TOP CHELVES OF MY CLOSETS, ENOUGH SO HELP BUT NOT TO LEAVE A STROG SMELL, VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> These camphor granules dissolve fairly quickly in warming herbal oil, and are somewhat mucilagenous while doing so. They are very fragrant, and their camphorous action works wonderfully in pain relief formulas. I will definitely be purchasing these again from this seller. They arrived quickly, did what they were supposed to do, and seem to be very high quality! I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these granules!</li>
    <li> We still find camphor in Mexico, in the pharmacies, but here in the USA it is just impossible. This camphor granules are the closest thing to the camphor I had in my country.</li>
    <li> This is a naturally derived form of camphor as I found on the frontier website.  It&#x27;s working beautifully for my vapor rub/pain relieving ointment.  Very potent, don&#x27;t just stick your nose in and take a deep breath.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I found my local Hy-Vee pharmacy has a couple of boxes&lt;br /&gt;of the squares.I purchased one because the outside&lt;br /&gt;of the box said it inhibited rust, so I am&lt;br /&gt;trying it out in my basement which is damp.</li>
    <li> got this to make pain salve and is perfect for my uses.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma of the Camphor.  Lil pricey for only a 1/2 lb bag.  Wish they sold it in a larger bag.  I bought the product primarily to help control flies, and mosquitos o the patio.  Seems to work ok for this use.</li>
    <li> They Look good. No discoloration. I like them.</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s camphor. Bought it to repel mosquitos in our home, as our windows don&#x27;t have screens. The chunks range in size from large to powder, but that&#x27;s OK for my purposes.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this purchase because it was supposed to be in granular form, but it was in clumps that were large like golf balls.  I tried to crumble them, crush them, break them into smaller pieces, but it was too wet?  The camphor just kept sticking together and wouldn&#x27;t get smaller than about pea sized.  I was going to sprinkle  this around the perimeter of the house, but the pieces were too large.  If it would have been granular and wouldn&#x27;t have clumped together the way it did, I would have rated it 5 stars because the smell is strong and otherwise would have been good.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I added them to my lotion by slowly warming it in a pan and I swear it got rid of the rash I had from thimble jellyfish.  I was covered in tiny blisters that itched like crazy after swimming in The Gulf and the camphor got rid of the itch and dried the rash up.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> waiting for spring to use around flower beds to ward off ants and slugs will let you know how it performs</li>
    <li> I started using Sea Breeze astringent at 14 years old (I&#x27;m 60 now), and was dismayed when the original formula was changed some years back. So I began making my own. The general formula is 60/40 alcohol/water with small amounts of camphor, eucalyptus oil (eucalyptus radiate) , clove bud oil (eugenia caryophyllata), and glycerin.

    <li> I use this all the time for my sick children.  I leave it in a sock out of reach and it seems to purify the air.</li>
    <li> came on time,was exactly what they said it was</li>
    <li> I add this product to the &amp;#34;medicine cup&amp;#34; on top of my humidifier with some essential oils to help with my asthma and sinus issues. The scent is strong and soothing to my irritated airways, but not too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest moving it to an airtight storage container rather than the bag it comes in, though, as the granules like to collect the moisture in the air and turn into a hard clump.

These look pure and dissolve readily in my sesame oil base. I have been very happy with the smell and the colorlessness of these versus the cloudy, metallic smelling ones that I have used before. I will continue to order this brand in both Camphor and Menthol.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - used it to make some pain relief cream/oil.  Worked on clients with the pain relief oil and they loved it.  Came in record time, well priced, and smelled heavenly if you like that smell.  Reminds me of when I was a child and mom used to put camphor on my boo-boos.  Yes, everyone - this is good stuff to buy!</li>
    <li> Great product, I have purchased it 4 times now. I only wish they sold 1 pound bags. The camphor is the best one I have purchased yet anywhere.</li>
    <li> Very good quality as with most Frontier bulk products.</li>
    <li> Good quality, good communication, on time delivery. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I do not know about the medicinal uses for this product. I use camphor for protecting metal tools against rust.&lt;br /&gt;In the old-days, we could go to the corner drugstore and buy camphor blocks, about 1-inch square and 1/4 inch thick. You just slice open the wrapper, peel it back and toss in in your tool box or drawers. The camphor emits a gas that prevent oxygen from attacking metal surfaces of tools like planes, chisels, squares etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem these days is finding the stuff. Modern pharmacies do not typically stock it any more. After searching everywhere, I found this product from this company. The shipping was a trifle slow compared to other Amazon orders I have placed, but it came before the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is good and reasonably priced for my application. If you want to protect your tools inexpensively, save all your desiccant packages from electronic equipment and other items you may have purchased, because they are all re-useable indefinitely. You need only dry them out in an oven for reuse. Placing small quantities of camphor inside tool drawers helps prevent the electro-chemical reaction that causes rust.

Place a few tablespoons of granulated camphor in the jar and cover with cheese cloth, held in place by a rubber band. For very small drawers, you can skip the jar and just wrap camphor granules in any lightweight porous cloth. Secure with a rubber band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method works for your fine silverware or jewelry too! Camphor has salubrious results for any metal that can rust or tarnish. This product, judging by the feel, texture and smell, is the real deal. Beware of other products that have only a small percentage of active camphor. They are not as effective. It takes far more to do the job, so it is no bargain. Real camphor is so potent that it only takes an ounce or two to protect a drawer full of tools and it lasts about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you find an economical source for the little camphor blocks, post a comment near this review because the blocks are more convenient to use. But until I find a better source, this is the best I have found. This bag has enough quality product to protect tools in several woodworking shops for five years or more! That&#x27;s still cheap insurance against rust.metal that can rust or tarnish. This product, judging by the feel, texture and smell, is the real deal.

    <li> this was great and easy yo use worked great</li>
    <li> It is Awesome, I have tried many salts but this is mystical, powerful and relaxing experience of life time. It is even stronger than Epsom salt.</li>
    <li> Is it working??  I think I got the smallest size available and it is a lifetime quantity for me.. Very Fragrant.</li>
    <li> A little small as I have found larger packages for a lower price, but, shipped fast and was as described. I use them in my steam room.</li>
    <li> Love the items from Frontier.  Very good quality and I have had no complaints from anything I have bought.</li>
    <li> Very clean, very fragrant - will be a great addition to my homemade pain cream - will definately buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and just as advertized</li>
    <li> I needed these for a recipe and it was okay to work with.</li>
