<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product keeps the brassiness out of my died blonde hair.  I use it alternately with Axiom which protects it from UV damage.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is just ok.  It tends to leave my scalp a little greasy - I notice that when I use it, I have to wash my hair more often.  However, I have noticed that my color stays put a little longer so I tend to switch it off with another shampoo.  I think I will try a different sulfate free product next time.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Smells great.  Great for getting rid of that bronze color, but if you are blonde use as directed or it will turn your hair gray.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it tones down the yellow in my blonde hair. The violet color does build up over several washes but I just shampoo with another regular product a couple of times and then return to Joico color Endure again.</li>
    <li> Arrived just when I needed it. This product does wonders in one wash (: can&#x27;t wait to use it again next week</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it is supposed to do, but only if your hair is light enough.  I suppose I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair long enough before I dyed it medium blonde, because when I dyed it bits were very light pale yellow and bits were still gold.  I figured it wouldn&#x27;t matter since I wasn&#x27;t planning on dying it a very light blonde.  But even with medium ash dye the gold parts were brassy so I tried this and it ashed out the lighter bits nicely to a beautiful cool shimmering blonde.  But the brassy bits didn&#x27;t change much.  This product is more for maintenance than correction.  It smells nice, unlike some overly flowery purple shampoos.  I have found that it makes my hair quite soft and smooth, unlike some who say it is drying.  It doesn&#x27;t lather fantastically but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t clean.  I am planning on dying my hair red eventually and then I will buy the color endure that is not violet just because I like this formula so much.</li>
    <li> The blue part works well to tone down brassiness. This shampoo claims to be sulfate free but it leaves my hair feeling like straw. I expected a higher end shampoo. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not drying like the other purple shampoo! This is a great product to use to tone out brashness. Makes my hair silvery blonde color!</li>
    <li> i have naturally dark brown hair and get blonde highlights which will get brassy over time even with color safe shampoos. This product (and the conditioner that goes with it) work perfectly to prevent that from happening. BUT, there is A LOT of purple coloring in the shampoo (not the conditioner though) that turns my nail beds greyish purple for like a day. I feel like it would discolor white showers as well not mine is earth tones so I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  I use it with gloves now. And only use 1-2 times a week or your blonde will change color. But that&#x27;s the case with all violate shampoos. Overall it does an amazing job and I will always use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and works perfectly. I leave it on my hair for about three minutes and it significantly decreases the amount of yellowing that would normally happen with my highlights. It keeps my blonde light and near-white if I used it often and for long enough periods per use.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for Blondes it definitely takes the brassiness out of your hair and it is the best purple shampoo out there. It is worth the price and you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> excellent delivery. amazing product, for my blond hair is perfect!!! I&#x27;m so addicted in it. is the best of all. Brazilian consumer :)</li>
    <li> Of all the violet toners, mousses, gels, other shampoos and conditioners, I have found this product to be the best for my newly grey hair.  I wash my hair every day and this gives just enough violet without appearing too blue and brittle.  I did try the Joico Color Endure Violet conditioner along with this, but it was too much and unlike the shampoo, had too much perfume.</li>
    <li> If you have too much red or gold in your blonde locks this stuff is to die for.  Takes them right out.  But don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis or your hair will turn a little shade of khaki green.  Wonderful for one or two uses.  Then skip a week and another use.</li>
    <li> Used this product and it&#x27;s awesome  leaves hair silky and shiny especial for gray or dull hair highly recommended even for colored treated hair works great</li>
    <li> Works so well! I love this shampoo. It is the only violet shampoo I&#x27;ve found that actually takes the brassyness out instantly. I dye my hair bleach blonde and I use this product maybe two or three times a week. Keeps my color bright</li>
    <li> I tried this product in hopes of it being my new favorite purple shampoo since I recently went back to blonde. I was so unbelievably disappointed- this product left my hair feeling like straw and with barely any change in its overall brassiness. Plus, it turns my hands purple. Will continue to use until I can get my hands on some of my favorite Paul Mitchell violet shampoo. That is my go-to and always will be.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. highly pigmented and keeps me blonde. it&#x27;s the only brand I can find in such a big size, very comparable to Schwarzkopf, so if you&#x27;re worried about switching, don&#x27;t! this stuff is just as good if not better. I like that it comes with the easy pump top.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a giant bottle of shampoo. This has helped tone down the red in my balyage treatment - my hair pulls really warm no matter what color is put in, so this helps keep me from looking like a sun baked raggedy Anne doll.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells great and does a fantastic job removing yellow/ brassy tones from blonde hair. My hair is light blonde and I got this because I wanted it to me more ashy than it was after getting it done at the salon. Did the job and you get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo twice per week to tone down the brassiness of my light blonde hair.  Love it!  It does the job!</li>
    <li> Turned my bleached blonde hair gray. Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> This is a good purple shampoo to use every other day to eliminate yellow hues in blonde hair. It&#x27;s not as drying as other purple shampoos I&#x27;ve used, like Shimmer Lights. I can see a difference in my hair color after one shampoo.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair dark blonde and after a few months, my blonde hairs started becoming an orange, brassy color. Instead of spending more to get my hair recolored, my stylist recommended getting purple shampoo. The shampoo itself is bright, violet hue and it was able to cancel out the orange, brassiness of my hair. My hair is now a lovely ashy, dark blonde after a couple of washes. I saved a lot of money using this shampoo instead of going to a stylist to recolor my hair again. Also, I really like how this shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic brassy hair and this has really worked wonders on my dyed blonde hair. Even my stylist has been impressed with the results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This is my third bottle.  My hair finally looks &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; noy yellow.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny but be careful to wash it all out or it will turn light blonde hair gray.</li>
    <li> This came in a zip lock bag, and half the shampoo leaked out because the top was not closed. Very, VERY unprofessional. How hard is it to close the top when all you have to do is twist it? And, they put it in a zip lock bag so they knew it wasn&#x27;t closed. Not happy that I spent $20 on half a product.</li>
    <li> This is a great purple shampoo. It really left my hair ashy. Shipping was fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and good value for this big bottle. Sulphate free &#x3D; big plus. I do leave it on for 10 minutes sometimes to give an extra &amp;#34;anti-brassiness&amp;#34; kick!</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo but when they shipped it It had broke open twice all over the box / so I had to return more was in the box than the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shampoo! It keeps my highlights shiny and not orangey. I have very fine hair, and it&#x27;s really gentle on my locks. No sulfates are a huge bonus! It&#x27;s hard to find a violet shampoo without them. I use it several times a week to keep my highlights fresh and looking natural.</li>
    <li> First of all, the price on this is awesome. I looked into other violet shampoos at 2 or 4 times this price. Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I&#x27;ve had at least 5 friends compliment how bright my hair looks (I have an almost white ombre in my hair). I use it every other shower, massaging it through my entire hair and really focusing on my tips and then let it sit while I shave. I follow up with a conditioner, and my hair stays a really really nice bright blonde with zero brassiness. My only complaint is I always have to clean my tub afterwards, because it really is BRIGHT purple. But I&#x27;ll take it :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair care products that I have ever used. I have fine curly hair that I get professionally dyed red, and this product keeps my red from turning brassy. I have tried many color-safe shampoos and while they have helped to retain the color longer, the shade always seemed to turn an orange hue before it was time to return to my stylist. I have not had that problem once I started using this product. I use it every other time I wash my hair and it has been a big help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo leaves my hair very soft and is gentle for my fine hair (that is already being damaged by the dye!) The scent is on the floral side, but doesn&#x27;t have a distinguishing aroma one way or the other. It is just pleasant.</li>
    <li> I am CRAZY for this Joico shampoo as it is the BEST toning shampoo out there, hands down. I prefer it over Schwartzkopf and FORGET about Clairol Shimmer Lights. Unlike Shimmer Lights, Joico is rich and won&#x27;t strip your color. Joico leaves my hair in great condition, never stiff or gummy or squeaky. Always rinses cleanly, unlike TiGi or Pureology which tend to stay in my hair. If you want a PLATINUM with titanium shine, use this shampoo every time you wash, making sure to leave it in for at least 30 minutes depending on how porous your hair is. If you want the super hot PASTEL blue silver purple look, apply this shampoo to DRY lightest level blonde hair and leave on for several hours and you&#x27;ll be tumblr perfect. YES, you can use it to tone down brass in brunettes, as I have used it to take the brassy spots out of pastel hair. All of my photos are hair maintained with this Joico shampoo.</li>
    <li> this works on my ombre hair to keep the ends from getting too orange and keeping them blonde.  you don&#x27;t get the lather like regular shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel soft, but it works great for the color</li>
    <li> This shampoo may work great on a dark blonde, light brown, or darker, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t on lightest blonde. It turned the lighter streaks in my daughter&#x27;s hair a bluish grey and took 3 shampoos to remove it. We had a problem with a slight reddish tinge to her bleached hair and thought this might help. The red looked better!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! This really is a violet shampoo/conditioner that delivers the EXACT results you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> They seem to help get the grassiness out of the hair color, but they do stain your fingers when using it.  I&#x27;d recommend using gloves...</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended I use a purple shampoo to help me get the cooler color of gray that I prefer for my hair.  I am very pleased with the results!  This violet shampoo is a deep purple.  I use it with every other shampooing, and that is plenty to achieve the look I wanted.  It smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I use it with the Joico Color Endure Violet Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Today was like Christmas! !!!! Not only did I get the awesome joico shampoo that I ordered ( and will be ordering again because its the only tjing that will tone my hair) but the sender put in a bunch of free samples!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Delivered on time! Great!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It tones the silver in my hair, leaving it shiny and soft to the touch.  However, when the product arrived the shampoo had leaked all over the box and the bottle.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. My hair dresser turned me onto Joico and then shared the details about keeping my highlights nice and bright without getting brassy.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shampoo, keeps my color perfect since I use it. I have been using this Shampoo for over 2 years and will not use a different one. The product was delivered as promised. I sure will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is really good for keeping the brassiness at bay. It isn&#x27;t so purple that your hair gets deposits of purple either.  I will say not 5 stars because I use at least 3x as much shampoo because of the sulfate-free formula.  The SF formula doesn&#x27;t spread throughout the hair well. It doesn&#x27;t sud of course.  I have short to medium length hair and have to wash my hair in rounds: Crown, nape, sides.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 big bottles of this shampoo. I had orange hair due to bad bleaching and this shampoo did nothing for my hair. Had used it 4 times, and the last time I had even left it on for an hour, nothing happened. What I did to get rid of the brassiness was to get an demi permanent ash blonde hair dye and it did the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I used it after I got my hair&lt;br /&gt;Colored and I&#x27;m naturally a brunette I put&lt;br /&gt;Some caramel highlights in my hair and this shampoo helps bring out the rich caramel color when my hair starts to look dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love this. It foams perfectly fine, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this shampoo..</li>
    <li> I have gotten an ombre done and was worried that eventually the brassiness/orange tones will show up. After reading through the reviews, I decided to give Joico a try. This shampoo definitely does help with toning with only 1-2 uses a week. Down side to this product is that you really need to use conditioner and hair masks to keep your hair hydrated. Another thing is, the shampoo left a tint of purple on my nails after the wash - nothing a few hand wash can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous.  I ordered a conditioner from a different brand that isn&#x27;t nearly as vibrant and useful as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: If you use play with it too much, you&#x27;ll stain your hands.  I recommend that you wash your hair first thing.  Your hands will turn purple, but by the time I finish showering, they&#x27;re back to normal.  If you wash your hair with this at the end of your shower, then you might walk about with slightly purple/blue hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have very blonde hair, and you leave it in too long, then your hair will have a slightly violet look to it.</li>
    <li> 100%% love this stuff! My hair is white and this shampoo sometimes turns my hair purple which i am ok with, I get complaments on it because people think I colour my hair that way lol.&lt;br /&gt;If this happens to you. It will come out in one other was or put conditioner in and leave in for a few then rinse well.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best toning shampoo ever. I hope they never stop making this! I&#x27;ve tried almost every toning shampoo on the market and nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo that was recommended by my hair stylists and it smells great and does the job of toning down my hair color too.</li>
    <li> I have pastel purple(lavender/lilac) hair with a grey toner underneath, the toner washes out within a couple washes, and let&#x27;s yellow peek through, this shampoo really helps tone the yellow down to a silvery color! I love it! My only complaint is that this seems to dry my hair out a lot, so I try to use it as little as possible, it does take a couple times to get it to cover the yellow. But other than that keeps my bright hair bright looking!!</li>
    <li> I have used it before and I am very satisfied with it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Love this!! Keeps my blonde hair looking great!!!</li>
    <li> I died by hair platinum and this shampoo kept it brass free.  I have more recently changed the color back to a more medium ash blond that is similar to my natural color and still use this shampoo about weekly to keep any signs of brass away.  If you leave it on too long you will get a purplish tint to your hair, but just rewash and it will go way.  I also know someone who uses this shampoo on their salt and pepper hair to keep the whiteness fresh and yellow free.</li>
    <li> I love this sahampoo because is gentle for my hair and put out orange hair highly recommended.Excellent for gray hair or highlighters.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It toned my brassy, buttered-popcorn looking hair to a really nice light platinum color. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is a little difficult to spread throughout the hair and doesn&#x27;t really lather due to the lack of sulfates but I don&#x27;t mind it. It leaves my hair really soft and moisturized after I wash it out. Overall, really good quality product and I would say it&#x27;s necessary to maintain platinum hair. My hair is very curly, a mix between 3b and 3c.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
    <li> It worked the very first day that I got it! Literally! I left it in for about ten minutes and my blondes were at a lighter silvery shade. I was so amazed. Will not try a different brand! Love theM! Get the shampoo though, not the conditioner - shampoo works better and still leaves hair soft!</li>
    <li> Great product, and great service. Thank you...will do business again!</li>
    <li> I love this toning shampoo for keeping my hair a brilliant snow white color. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect without accidentally turning your hair silvery (or if it does, it always washes out easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If perfect platinum blonde (or white) is what you want, this is the shampoo for you.</li>
    <li> I like it for the reason it gives my hair awesome shimmery color. but it also dries out my hair, there goes one star.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely got the yellow tones out of my hair. I left it in about 1:30 and it came out perfect.</li>
    <li> Wow! Brassy tones be gone!!!! I am loving this shampoo! I still have the conditioner to buy but not shire it&#x27;s necessary! I use the Kirkland conditioner and works fabulous with the shampoo!</li>
    <li> Worked instantly on first use, great product!!! pay attention to directions and follow through, it can end up giving your hair a purplish tint to it if overused</li>
    <li> Best blue shampoo I have used. It does dry your hair - so you MUST deep condition post use. But it keeps the blond colour fantastic between salon visits.</li>
    <li> This is a wonder shampoo. It keeps me out of the salon as much for my blonde highlights, and lightens up my hair so nicely! My hair fades fast with our water here, so this has completely changed everything around! I used it a couple days in a row at first and then backed off to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re blonde and you want your yellowing locks back to the bright white, use this once/twice and you&#x27;ll see a huge difference. I get compliments on how great my blonde looks, and everyone is always asking me if I just got my hair done! It&#x27;s amazing, I will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo.  I have silver/white hair and have to be very careful that the environment and products do not turn it yellow.  This shampoo keeps it the right color and does NOT turn it blue.  Not old enough for blue hair yet!!</li>
    <li> This leaves a film on my hair.  It feels gummy no matter how long I rinse.  The Aveda produce rinses more cleanly.</li>
    <li> Best anti brassy shampoo ever. Notice a difference after first wash. My hair was also so soft, instead of being really dry with other purple shampoos</li>
    <li> I got two of these and they were not shampoos they were conditioners so I need my shampoo please?</li>
    <li> In just two washes, this shampoo has turned my brassy highlights into natural-looking blond highlights. I just got the shampoo, and it&#x27;s working fine to tone without the use of the conditioner. To address the reviewer who said she didn&#x27;t get a sulfate-free bottle - I&#x27;m not sure what happened there, as this one is definitely sulfate-free. (Says so on the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t lather at all.) I&#x27;ll probably wait a few more days before using it again to avoid shifting the tone too far to the cool side.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo but don&#x27;t use it too often or it will turn your hair purple. Doesn&#x27;t completely rid my hair of brassiness.</li>
    <li> Very intense violet treatment shampoo that works wonders on my brassy blonde hair.  I use it together with Fabuloso at least once a week to maintain a more natural looking blonde.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The best hands down purple shampoo for bleached blonde/highlighted hair of any kind. It will refresh and tone any orange coppery red tones. I wash first with regular shampoo to remove dirt buildup.I dont feel its a must though.  I follow with this shampoo and leave on for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse off and follow with my preferred conditioner.  This shampoo does not dry out my hair nor make ot unmanageable and hard like Jergens purple shampoo did. But I have naturally curly hair so I need extra conditioning. For those with normal to oily hair, you can skip conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Joico is a great product and I will continue to buy from Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going from black to blonde and I do have to say it was a life savor. If has helped my brassiness go away! I use it 1-2 a week and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I have thicker hair that is almost down to my elbows.</li>
    <li> I needed to take the yellow out of my hair and this did a good job of it.</li>
    <li> The best with keeping my highlights a bright blonde also sulfate free which I&#x27;m able to use with my Brazilian blowout.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it is meant to do: remove gold tones and brassiness from light blond hair. It works so well I don&#x27;t have to go in between colors for an extra toning. I use more than I would regular shampoo and let t sit on my hair while I tend to other things in the shower then rinse. I love the Joico Conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> Picture posted is for the sulfate-free Violet Color Endure.  Product received was regular, SLS color endure.  Disappointed in picture advertised vs what was received.  I absolutely prefer the sulfate-free violet color endure for better color maintenance.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!!! I had checked the ingredients of the shampoo before purchasing it. It does not have dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;(Dimethicone can adhere to your hair and make the hair smooth. However, it does not really nourish the hair but causes hair loss as consistently using it) And it is truly an amino acid surfactant shampoo without SLS &amp; SLES(SLS &amp; SLES are cheap &amp; terrible surfactants) I had used several amino acid shampoos before, like kiehl&#x27;s, burt&#x27;s bee &amp; Kracie from Japan. Joico is obvious the best one ever that it cleans the hair gently while nourishing it. The only thing you have to worry is how to get off the purple color on your hands after using it.</li>
    <li> This product is my new favorite \\&quot;brassiness remover\\&quot; for my blonde hair!  it is so much better than Shimmer Lights in every way!  Even the smell is more like you get from a salon!</li>
