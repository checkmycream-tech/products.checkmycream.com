      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I can show again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to KP Elements for this fabulous product!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;KP Elements is a much more pleasant cream than [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>My arms look and feel amazing</li>
      <li>The company stands by the product and is great about checking in to make sure you are satisfied.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to have all the ingredients on items so</li>
      <li>I tried every kind of wash and lotion and nothing made a difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using one jar of this cream, I am thrilled.</li>
      <li>It has a light, pleasant fragrance, which doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.</li>
      <li>As I have been experimenting with products, I&#x27;ve gotten the best results thus far when coupling the cream with the Glytone exfoliating body wash</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it worked!</li>
      <li>I found it better that KP elements because it reduced the clogging of pores and kept my skin well hydrated.</li>
      <li>To fix it, I apply a scented lotion on top after about 10 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>I love my skin now</li>
      <li>I have tried many things to help my KP and nothing has helped.</li>
      <li>Like I said still somewhat visible but not magnified and prominent as before.</li>
      <li>On its own it&#x27;s a decent product, not overly greasy, pleasant odor.  </li>
      <li>Rather than going for this product would suggest you all to look for something better and cheaper like palmers cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>There are better products out there.</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>the scrub is lovely in the shower.</li>
      <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel and look: smoother and healthier.  </li>
      <li>but it is about 90% better and its not something others notice now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews on this product I was very excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>I’m very pleased and feel the product is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before, so I must be excited about this one :)</li>
      <li>it’s fine.</li>
      <li>Within 3 days I noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>I don’t know if this interrupts the effectiveness of the cream at all, but my smooth skin says  </li>
      <li>I wish it absorbed better.  </li>
      <li>The bumps are completely smooth.</li>
      <li>Good product to try since you get your money back if it doesn&#x27;t work! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a great price and is super easy to apply (no residue left on my arms or on my clothes), so I don&#x27;t plan on giving it up anytime soon.</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference the first time I used it!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as well as coconut oil and noticed a significant decrease in the bumps on my arms.</li>
      <li>months before I saw a significant improvement in my condition.  </li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>However, seeing as my kp is covering my legs and arms this stuff needs to make a significant difference in order for me to continue.</li>
      <li>, I can wear anything I want and not be shame of my skin, I have keratosis pilaris for so many years, it runs in the family and this is the only product that it proves to be effective in treating this conditions,</li>
      <li>This did not help me either, but the company sent s full refund promptly when I told them it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>They returned my e-mail promptly to inform me that my credit card will be refunded for the full amount.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad - smells like lotion.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to work on my skin and the smell is pretty strong</li>
      <li>This cream quickly made a difference in both the feel and appearance.</li>
      <li>I had to re purchase again because I use it up quick.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I was already on a routine of lactic acid lotion in the morning and glycolic acid at night (which are KP Elements&#x27; first two ingredients, after water), so for people who are just starting to notice/manage their KP, this could be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>if you want to have a beautiful, soft skin, buy this product, it works 100%, but remember you have to constantly use it to see results.  </li>
      <li>ok to use as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I have tried that made a noticeable difference!  </li>
      <li>It is quickly absorbed and not sticky, and it has no fragrance.</li>
      <li>Cocunut oil seems to work better, although I haven&#x27;t found anything that gets rid of the bumps completely.</li>
      <li>It was nice to know that I could try this product and that if it did not work I could get my money back and no questions asks.</li>
      <li>I love that the ingredients are not harsh.</li>
      <li>a bit pricey but worth it to me if you want to go sleevless</li>
      <li>you name it without success.</li>
      <li>My skin is  softer which is a nice, but the red and purple marks on my skin are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients</li>
      <li>Very medicine/chemically and pretty strong.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t use it everyday, but once a day, most days, is enough for great results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been battling keratosis pilaris for years, so I was pretty excited that something new came out.</li>
      <li>But first things first.</li>
      <li>my arms were much smoother and the redness had started to disappear!</li>
      <li>I’ll be restocking this very soon!</li>
      <li>I am sure that if I keep using it like I should, my skin will only become softer and healthier.</li>
      <li>Has a funny smell to it and did not coat and conditon</li>
      <li>everything.feels greasy at first,</li>
      <li>But it was worth the effort as my condition is much improved.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 38 and for the first time in over 20 years</li>
      <li>I put off buying this for a long time, mainly because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I got it!  </li>
      <li>and honestly I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised that my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten super dry and itchy in the process.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to say how well this product works on its own, but I&#x27;m sure it is better than others I&#x27;ve tried because I had no luck using the other lotions (Glytone, Amlactin) with the Glytone body wash.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll help dry skin, sure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work on my skin and the smell is pretty strong I couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Has helped my daughters bumps on her face slowly fade away!!</li>
    <li> I will update review as i go. But first things first. IT STINKS!!! Do not use if your about to go out LOL. Just got today, a little goes along way. Good luck to everyone else trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 25th about 10 days in, i use it twice a day. i havnt noticed much if any change. My skin is  softer which is a nice, but the red and purple marks on my skin are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 5th, still no results unfortunately, I did contact the seller for a refund and they are processing it. Good product to try since you get your money back if it doesn&#x27;t work! :)</li>
    <li> Item received as described.</li>
    <li> The backs of my arms have always had red bumps and skin. This cream helped a little, but I still have red bumps and noticeable redness of the backs of my arms. It smells weird and really does the same thing any other lotion has done for me.</li>
    <li> Love. Works really well.</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had red bumps on the back of my arms for as long as I can remember and have tried SO many things, but nothing ever seemed to work. I thought I was doomed. My friend had heard about KP Elements, so I decided to give it a try. After a few weeks of using it, I noticed a huge difference... my arms were much smoother and the redness had started to disappear! I love the fact that it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients and I&#x27;m totally going to recommend it to my other friends. It&#x27;s also a great price and is super easy to apply (no residue left on my arms or on my clothes), so I don&#x27;t plan on giving it up anytime soon. I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before, so I must be excited about this one :)</li>
    <li> Nothing gets rid of this stubborn condition but after having tried a million products over the last 20 years, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that makes any difference at all.</li>
    <li> It does make my skin a little softer, but it is really stinky and burns slightly.  I had hoped to use it on my toddler as she has the same problem, but after trying it on myself first, no way!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had KP since she was 6 months old and I have tried everything, both Rx and OTC.  This is the first product I have tried that made a noticeable difference!  I put it on her last night after her bath (she&#x27;s 2 1/2) and when she got up her skin was already feeling softer and smoother.  Looking forward to her KP disappearing altogether.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying this cream. Since we all have different skin types, and each person&#x27;s skin reacts differently to the same product, there were good reviews and bad reviews; I still bought the cream knowing that it might not work for me, although my case of KP is not that bad. Fortunately, it worked! I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I love it. I can feel the difference as soon as I apply it (to my arms and thighs). Not only are the little red dots/bumps dramatically diminished, but it also makes my skin really soft and gives it a nice smooth texture. I am sure that if I keep using it like I should, my skin will only become softer and healthier. It is quickly absorbed and not sticky, and it has no fragrance. I only wish it came in a tube. I might pour it in a tube myself to make the application easier. I am very happy I found this and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling keratosis pilaris for years, so I was pretty excited that something new came out. But, after 30 days with this...nothing. To be fair, I was already on a routine of lactic acid lotion in the morning and glycolic acid at night (which are KP Elements&#x27; first two ingredients, after water), so for people who are just starting to notice/manage their KP, this could be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KP Elements is a much more pleasant cream than [[ASIN:B000TTPZQ6 AmLactin 12 % Moisturizing Lotion - 500 g / 17.6 oz]] or [[ASIN:B001FB5IRS Eucerin Lotion, Intensive Repair, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] (my previous sources for lactic and glycolic acid). The KP Elements cream is pretty thick, with a mild AmLactin sort of smell, but about an hour after you put it on, the smell is gone, and your arms feel incredibly soft. Close your eyes, and you barely notice your keratosis pilaris at all. The redness is still there, though, despite the aloe vera, green tea, and evening primrose oil that I was hoping would be soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the tub is only 4 ounces, and I easily breezed through it in only a month, with twice-a-day applications on my arms, using as little as possible. I think you&#x27;re usually supposed to try out creams for 2 months before making a decision, but I don&#x27;t want to buy something TWICE before deciding if it works. If this were priced like Eucerin or AmLactin, it&#x27;d be a great replacement, but slightly softer skin and a mellower scent isn&#x27;t enough for me.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this because it was a little pricey but the reviews were pretty good. Within 3 days I noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I have KP on my arms and it has always felt very different from the rest of my skin but after using this product twice a day for 3 days my arms feel soft like the rest of my skin! I&#x27;m thrilled with that! I still have some redness but it is a lot less noticeable since using this product. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from KP!!</li>
    <li> Well, I have a mixed review of this product. It smells horrible, but it did work on my legs. On my arms, I didn&#x27;t have any improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually impressed by this stuff.  I noticed a difference after one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after a month. Sometimes skin care starts out well, but in the end doesn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using one jar of this cream, I am thrilled. It not only clears the bumps, but also heals the redness, and the hyperpigmentation left by the red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use it everyday, but once a day, most days, is enough for great results.</li>
    <li> As someone who&#x27;s had KP ever since I can remember, I&#x27;m really happy to have found this product to treat my KP! I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years - facial cleansers, other OTC products targeted towards KP, even prescription lotions and medicated scratch pads from my dermatologist- and I&#x27;ve had complaints with each and every one. I&#x27;ve never found something that clears up my KP without leaving my skin really dry - which becomes an annoying cycle then because any regular lotion I use clogs my pores again and brings the KP back. I&#x27;ve been using KP elements for a week so far, and I can already see my KP starting to clear up and honestly I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised that my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten super dry and itchy in the process. At the same time it&#x27;s not oily - I just put it on once a day after my shower and don&#x27;t really notice it after that. Also, as someone with sensitive skin I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any fragrance. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a travel size - it would be nice to have a smaller one I could carry around in my purse. Overall though I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has KP!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Going to order  again!</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 months and no result nor improvement. My skin still looks the same..I have wasted so much of money on it. Rather than going for this product would suggest you all to look for something better and cheaper like palmers cocoa butter. I found it better that KP elements because it reduced the clogging of pores and kept my skin well hydrated.</li>
    <li> I had seen this stuff on Facebook, and I&#x27;ve had awful red bumps on my arms and even on my cheeks when it gets dry during the winter. I had tried KP Duty and even some foot creams, but I didn&#x27;t like the results. And I didn&#x27;t want to put foot cream on my face. I don&#x27;t ever write reviews on Amazon, but KP Elements worked great. I am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Although KP elements did not work for me, I would still encourage people to try because of their 100% Guarantee or your money back. I contacted the company after 4 weeks of using the product and seeing no results. They returned my e-mail promptly to inform me that my credit card will be refunded for the full amount. As anyone knows who has Keratosis that it is all trial and error to find something that works. It was nice to know that I could try this product and that if it did not work I could get my money back and no questions asks.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly severe case of KP and have had no luck in finding some relief...until I discovered KP elements.  On its own it&#x27;s a decent product, not overly greasy, pleasant odor.  As I have been experimenting with products, I&#x27;ve gotten the best results thus far when coupling the cream with the Glytone exfoliating body wash [[ASIN:B002D48QRA Glytone Exfoliating Body Wash, 6.7-Ounce Package]].  Unfortunately I did not track my usage very closely...it&#x27;s hard to say how well this product works on its own, but I&#x27;m sure it is better than others I&#x27;ve tried because I had no luck using the other lotions (Glytone, Amlactin) with the Glytone body wash.  You must be patient &amp; religious in applying these products as it took ~2 months before I saw a significant improvement in my condition.  But it was worth the effort as my condition is much improved.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  It worked to cure all the bumps on my arms!  Even bought some for stepmom and she likes as well!  Will continue to purchase.  My arms look and feel amazing</li>
    <li> This product takes a little while to work and you should use it every day, but it really does work. The company stands by the product and is great about checking in to make sure you are satisfied.</li>
    <li> The instructions says to use this morning and at night time. I wish that it came from a bigger case. I&#x27;ve only used a couple of times but I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin especially my legs feel softer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as well as coconut oil and noticed a significant decrease in the bumps on my arms. Woo!</li>
    <li> Seems as though my condition got worse, not better after using this. Has a funny smell to it and did not coat and conditon my skin as with other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> It did make my skin feel softer, however it didn&#x27;t do much in the way of getting rid of the bumps. I will be searching for a different product to use.</li>
    <li> This product did not change my KP. I used it correctly and it only lasted for about two weeks. I know this condition is hard to treat but I saw no difference while using this product.</li>
    <li> I tried so many creams, even the best given by my dermatologist, but nothing worked, until I found this product, I decided to give a try and it worked!! I love my skin now, I can wear anything I want and not be shame of my skin, I have keratosis pilaris for so many years, it runs in the family and this is the only product that it proves to be effective in treating this conditions, if you want to have a beautiful, soft skin, buy this product, it works 100%, but remember you have to constantly use it to see results.  I 100% recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash.so couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I used the product on a regular basis with no real change.  I then got the scrub, which only made the area red.  After a number of comments from coworkers re: the redness, I stopped using both the products.  I sure hope it helps other people.  I wanted to clear up my arms before a trip to Hawaii.  Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for incredibly moist, smooth skin, this is the stuff for you. KP Elements is made up of a lot of natural ingredients (no chemical product!). On regular skin, this stuff is fantastic for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER. If you have Keratosis Pilaris, this stuff is no miracle cure. Heck, it doesn&#x27;t even help. I ordered this KP Elements because I&#x27;ve had Keratosis Pilaris covering my face, arms, and thighs all my life. I used this cream faithfully as instructed, twice a day every day for over a month. My skin condition never improved - if anything, my skin is only redder than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to try this stuff out for yourself, at least you&#x27;re backed with a 100% money back guaranteed. BUT that&#x27;s only if you buy one jar!!! If you buy two jars for the &#x27;reduced price&#x27;, they will only refund one of the jars if it fails and you try to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though, KP Elements is a well-made product. It WILL moisturize, and does that well I might add. But it&#x27;s certainly not a cure for KP. It&#x27;ll help dry skin, sure. Just don&#x27;t buy this for what it&#x27;s advertises.</li>
    <li> KP elements is an all natural exfoliating cream that smoothes my skin and helps keep the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; at bay.  It has a light, pleasant fragrance, which doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
    <li> Made my skin red and irritated. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know yet, i bought it for my family , still waiting for the results.</li>
    <li> It has only been 4 days since I started useing thing product and the KP scrub and I am already seeing a big difference in my skin. After all the products I was given by my dermatologist, nothing works as good as KP Elements!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely.  This is 2nd time I have ordered because the results were what I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I have had keratosis pilaris all my life and have tried a lot of different products but have had no results.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews on this product I was very excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;In the description it says 100% natural ingredients and dermatologist tested and approved so I thought it would&lt;br /&gt;be ok to use as I have very sensitive skin. I was disappointed when I received the cream, opened it and used it, when I realized it&lt;br /&gt;contains sodium benzoate, a preservative I am allergic to. It would be nice to have all the ingredients on items so&lt;br /&gt;people can see what is in it before they buy it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin really soft and reduces redness/bumpiness. Love it!</li>
    <li> Used this cream as directed and the bumps on my thighs actually worsened. Not worth the price or purchase.</li>
    <li> the cream is very good one of the best I have ever tried for kp. a bit pricey but worth it to me if you want to go sleevless</li>
    <li> For years we thought my daughter had eczema. The red bumps on her arms and cheeks became large and inflamed and she was finally correctly diagnosed with KP. I tried every kind of wash and lotion and nothing made a difference. I felt so bad because she is young and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to her but I knew it would become embarrassing as she got older. I am so happy I tried this product!!! This has made a big difference. It&#x27;s not 100% gone but it is about 90% better and its not something others notice now. This was life changing and I will be purchasing it for as long as she continues to have KP (I am hoping it begins to naturally lessen as she gets older). Thank you for making this!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had KP all my life and have not found anything to reduce the appearance of kp at all. I&#x27;ve used Amlactin and did not see an improvement at all. I wanted to buy Derma Doctor but just could not imagine spending so much money on a product that got mixed reviews. My kp has not gotten worse its just stagnant. So they are not red, however, after using this cream I hoping for the improved experience. I will continue to use the cream and see if i do get any improvements.</li>
    <li> I put off buying this for a long time, mainly because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I got it!  I noticed a difference in my arms in just a couple days!  I will definately keep buying this!</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. What worked for me was using a body wash with Salicylic Acid and an exfoliating sponge. Then after I dried off I put on a small amount of unrefined coconut oil (organic). Couple of weeks and it was almost all gone. Do that instead. Costs way less than this few hits and often miss product.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd or 4th day of using this product and so far it&#x27;s just ok. I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes but it&#x27;s still too soon I feel to make a decision. It does however make the skin smoother which is a plus. I will continue using it for at least a couple months in order to give myself a chance to reap the full benefits... # female / 38</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it and I already see a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over a month now so I believe I&#x27;ve given it enough time to see whether it&#x27;ll actually work or not. It doesn&#x27;t. I really wanted a cream that was going to reduce the redness and appearance of my KP on my upper and fore arms. The only positive thing I can say about this cream is that it makes your skin soft and stays on you all day. When I put it on in the morning and shower at night, I can still feel the cream on my skin. Unfortunately, while it stays on your skin all day it isn&#x27;t actually helping solve your KP problem. My redness and bumps are still here and haven&#x27;t budged an inch. It&#x27;s disappointing and not worth spending any money on.</li>
    <li> Finally, there is a product that actually works! My daughter and I have been using KP Elements for about a month and both of us are amazed with the results. My arms have never been this clear. I can finally go sleeveless without embarassment. At my place of employment, I just switched to sleeveless shirts for the summer, so the timing was perfect. And I have already told alot of my friends about your product. I am a customer for life!    Thank you KP Elements!  Brenda Pearson</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me any.... which doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t help you.  Just sharing my opinion.  In its defense, nothing I&#x27;ve really tried has helped my KP (coconut oil, KP Duty, etc.).</li>
    <li> This is the first actual cream/scrub I have bought specifically to treat this pain in the arse skin condition (the dreaded KP!) I have had a mild case since i was a wee little girl (so battling for almost 20 years) I&#x27;m now 28 and it worsened TENFOLD since the birth of my son in February. Thank you Hormones! I have been obsessively trying to find a cure. I tried Amlactin before this but I broke out in a rash and it burned my skin. Anyho, Ive been using this bundle set faithfully morning and night for 2 weeks now. My skin is slightly softer (but the redness/pinprick dots are still VERY much there) I do like the feel of the cream and the scrub is lovely in the shower. The scent is subtle. I love that the ingredients are not harsh. However, seeing as my kp is covering my legs and arms this stuff needs to make a significant difference in order for me to continue. I purchased another set just yesterday and I am going to give it 2 months before I make a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* so Ive been using the cream &amp; scrub for 2 months now as instructed. I had to re purchase again because I use it up quick. The lotion hasn&#x27;t really done much for me, I prefer Uremol 20. This stuff has helped reduce the redness and cleared up the bigger sized kp. I will continue to purchase the scrub by kp elements because I believe it has helped my skin in conjunction with the Urea. Still hoping to find something better, but in the mean time I am happy girl that my skin is less angry looking and I can bare short shorts once again :)</li>
    <li> Does not work. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I was disappointed because I was hoping I could finally find something to get rid of the itchy bumps on my arms and thighs. I used this scrub &amp; cream and noticed no difference at all. Cocunut oil seems to work better, although I haven&#x27;t found anything that gets rid of the bumps completely.</li>
    <li> Saw it on  The View and decided to try it to see if it would help my dry skin - it did</li>
    <li> Junk. This product does nothing but sting. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Save your money. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had little red dots on my upper arms my entire life.  I thought it was just something I couldn&#x27;t do anything about.  But after two weeks they were completely gone.  The results were not instant, which is where I think a lot of the low reviews come from.  Be patient and persistent, the bottle actually has a lot of product that can last for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked exactly as advertised for me, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now...my skin is soft and I&#x27;ve already noticed some of the bumps disappearing. There is a slight smell but it&#x27;s not bad - smells like lotion. I was a little concerned about the price however a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!!  I could tell a difference the first time I used it!!  If I could change anything I would improve the fragrance of this product but other than that ...love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for those that didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it.  We use the moisturizing and exfoliating body scrub but with a different lotion as this one makes my son break out. We have returned this item because of that however the brand is great and it does work to get rid of KP</li>
    <li> I got this to treat KP. I have dark skin so I don’t have the redness, but the rough feel is there. This cream quickly made a difference in both the feel and appearance. I have a scrub that I use along with this. The scrub alone helps a little, but used with the cream, twice a day, most areas I treated cleared completely and looked …new, I guess. Definitely healthier. Other areas, for whatever reason, were stubborn, but the treatment made a significant difference in the feel of those areas. I’m very pleased and feel the product is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a very minor stinging sensation after the 1st couple uses, but now I feel nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the scent of it. Very medicine/chemically and pretty strong. To fix it, I apply a scented lotion on top after about 10 minutes or so. I don’t know if this interrupts the effectiveness of the cream at all, but my smooth skin says  it’s fine. lol  I’ll be restocking this very soon!</li>
    <li> Its made of natural acid fruits..careful: don&#x27;t use too often, esp around eyes and chest.&lt;br /&gt; They say, old folk lack needed  skin acids. I like that it has no drying PETROLEUM.&lt;br /&gt;.I use it abt. 2 a week..than put on  CeraVe (oops some petroleum in that one) which has humectins etc. everything.feels greasy at first, but in a few hours it soaks in..The rough skin is going away..not sure where it goes. old method was to scrub myself raw and add moisturizers..I cant soak in tub and get out again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 and for the first time in over 20 years I&#x27;m abI e to wear shorts and expose my legs! I&#x27;ve tried Amlactin, Lachydrin, Glytone, KP doctor..you name it without success. Not to mention the financial drain that comes with the process. You cant go wrong with the refund policy. Perhaps not all products work for all but this worked for me. The bumps are completely smooth. However somewhat visible still like stubborn scars. They are not red. Like I said still somewhat visible but not magnified and prominent as before. Tame they are to the point where I have the confidence to sport naked skin. Something that I had not dare to do for years.Thank you KP elements. You did not disappoint. However the exfoliating scrub has not done much for me. I was disappointed in that aspect. I was hoping the joint duo would eradicate all signs of the bloody red bumps. Best of luck my fellow KP friends.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly optimistic, but figured I&#x27;d give this product a try because of the money back guarantee. Amazingly, it actually works! I&#x27;m only about 2 weeks into using it, but I already see a 75% reduction in the bumps on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stings a little when you apply it after exfoliating - but that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s working! It also stays a bit sticky for about an hour after application...but all of these are tiny prices to pay for having arms I can show again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to KP Elements for this fabulous product!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many things to help my KP and nothing has helped. This did not help me either, but the company sent s full refund promptly when I told them it didn&#x27;t work. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I wish it absorbed better.  Seems like you rub and rub and still feel a layer of cream on skin.  But it seems to help combat (but not clear up) bumpy skin caused by keratosis pilaris.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and have been using it for over two years.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Order it now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other treatments in the past, including home remedies - without results. After only 5 days with KP Elements I&#x27;m seeing an improvement. This is the only keratosis pilaris treatment that works for me!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product as my KP has gotten really bad due to my last pregnancy. Unfortunately my skin is still very red and bumpy. Disappointed as I was hoping to find a treatment that would help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about 5 days (twice a day) and I&#x27;m already noticing results. The patches of bumps are starting to break up and my skin is noticeably softer. Even if the bumps don&#x27;t go away completely, I&#x27;d still be happy with the results because it made my skin look less dry and rough.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff significantly reduced my KP within days. No other product has worked nearly as well. Great product.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t suffer from keratosis pilaris, I have very dry, fragile skin.  I love the way this product makes my skin feel and look: smoother and healthier.  Even my hands are improving.  While not miraculous, it really helps and the effects don&#x27;t wash off with water.</li>
    <li> This really works if you have bumps and rough spots behind your arms</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! But you have to reapply a lot. Maybe if I wouldve received the scrub that I ordered with it, yet never received, maybe it wouldbe worked even better!?!?</li>
</ol>
