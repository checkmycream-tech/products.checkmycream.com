<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer, especially for people with sensitive skin or allergies</li>
    <li> good buy and inexpensive</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from the dermatologist years ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily.  It would be nice if it had an SPF.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me and I use it every day. Works well and it is absorbed quickly, and doesn&#x27;t aggravate acne or rosacea. Only thing better would be if it provided some sun protection (for those of us with rosacea, we need to stay out of the sun or have some protection from it when we are). It does not leave a greasy residue like some lotions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 10 years and it is the best for dry sensitive skin. Dermatologist recommended</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the only body lotion I can use for a long period of time without my skin getting irritated.  More expensive than I would like, but I don&#x27;t really have a choice since I haven&#x27;t found anything else that is comparable.  I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of lotions, including ones for sensitive skin, but this is the only one that moisturizes enough and doesn&#x27;t cause me to itch or break out in a rash.</li>
    <li> Best cream out there!</li>
    <li> I have always just used Lubiderm and have for years. It is the only thing that help&#x27;s my hands in the winter. I&#x27;m now 60 and have a spot on my face that the skin keeps peeling like what you get when you have sunburn. I tried everything including a $35 lotion from The Art of Shaving and the Lubiderm that I have used for years. Nothing was doing the trick. One day while visiting my hair stylist in Charleston, SC I was put on to DML. It has worked great for the last 3 years. No complaints, No burning, easily washes off from the hands and is readily absorbed by the skin within a couple of minutes. My Dermatologist also recommended using this.</li>
    <li> I have had eczema for 20 years and used so many lotions and creams and changed my soaps and nothing ever worked.. Well finally was told to try this lotion out and in less than a month a gt major results.. My skin is always smooth and looks amazingly healthy.. I can&#x27;t get enough of this..</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I really like this lotion.  It was recommended by a friend and we tried it at their home.  When we got home, I searched the internet until I found this.  My macho husband who NEVER would use any lotion really like how it makes his skin feel.  It is not sticky and soaks into the skin quickly.I wish it were available in out local drug store.</li>
    <li> I had recently gone on the medicine Accutane and it really dries out your face.  I tried Eucerin, Neutrogena and Cetaphil and nothing worked at all. I got a sample of DML from my dermatoligst and I only had to apply it to my face once a day, and before I was using the other mositurizers upwards to 15 times a day. I really, really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I bought this for my face.  It is not as emollient as hoped for, and it made my skin tingle and burn, so I can&#x27;t use it for the reason it was purchased.  Other store name brands (\\&quot;intensive\\&quot; types) work better and are much less expensive.</li>
    <li> This lotion is more expensive than most in department stores, but well worth it.  I have extremely dry skin and I only have to use this once a day.  My physician recommended it, and it has been a life saver!</li>
    <li> great, light face lotion</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now.  I get skin blotches when the season changes and this helps tremendously.  I would recommend this to anyone, it&#x27;s worth every bit of it!</li>
    <li> This lotion&#x27;s great -- mainly for its irritate free properties.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have extremely sensitive skin and am prone to eczema, so it works very&lt;br /&gt;well for me.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  My face has gotten sensitive to many lotions, and I am sensitive to lotions like my old department store brand that went rancid before I could use more than half the bottle.  This has a nice clean feel.  Not greasy, no smell.  It absorbs quickly.  I love the pump.  It is a generous size for the price.</li>
    <li> Dr. says this is the lotion to use, especially in the dry wintertime...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist was the one who introduced me to this lotion but I was unable to find it in any of my local stores so I looked online and found it on Amazon.  It is a great lotion for your face if you like light, non-greasy moisture. It dries witin a minute so that I can put on my makeup in a hurry without having to wait for my lotion to absorb.  Just take a nickel sized amount and dab it around your face and smooth in. A little goes a lot way but the moisture lasts without a lot of shine. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended by my Dermatologist 20 years ago for my Rosacea condition.  It is great for sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t find it in local stores. Through Amazon I found it at   other stores and have it shipped directly to my home.</li>
    <li> I had been using Lubriderm for years to keep my skin from drying out. My dermatologist recommended I try DML. Immediately I saw and felt the difference. This lotion absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving your skin oily or greasy. I now use it daily. I tried a few vendors and found this vendor to be reliable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just okay, definitely not as nice as the DML Forte Super Moisturizing Cream.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I got a sample from my dermatologist and was happy to find it on Amazon.  3 L&#x27;s -luscious, light and long lasting. I&#x27;d buy it by the jug!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive facial skin and I bought this lotion to moisturize my face after shower/shaving (I am a man haha). DML is a very \\&quot;light\\&quot; lotion and absorbs easily. Not much smell if any. I recommend this to anyone who has rosacea or dry facial skin as it seems to work all day and does not irritate or sting when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend likes it too. She puts it on before she puts on her makeup but she has really nice skin anyway.</li>
    <li> Last year started getting super chapped skin on my face. Like wind burn kind of chapped. Nothing worked except this. Redness and cracking went away after first day!! Bought one for my sis n she loves it too! Said it made her face matte and not shiny. Yup..</li>
    <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great product, I use this everyday for dry skin after I shower but also after I shave. I like that it has no fragrance and you don&#x27;t feel greassy after putting it on.</li>
    <li> Gold standard for moisturizers.  This is the stuff my dermatologist recommends I use for my face, and my skin looks great. Fantastic for sensitive skin, and I never worry about using it on eczema-prone skin.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling sticky, which I hate. I bought this because of the reviews, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Plus, the pump is handy to keep by the bathroom sink. Instead of a screw-down closure, you just turn the pump a quarter-turn to lock it for travel. Great design that doesn&#x27;t waste lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the very best go-to formulation for dry skin. Originally prescribed by my daughter&#x27;s allergist for her dry, allergic-type skin, my entire family now loves this lotion. I send it to my mother who is 80, and I would use it on an infant. Since it is not usually available in stores, rather than ask the pharmacist to order it, I prefer to get it by mail order from Amazon. My family uses it summer and winter. Not sticky, not greasy, dries quickly, unscented, does not cause breakouts, great for sensitive skin, it&#x27;s just an excellent formulation. It&#x27;s hard to compare it anything else on the market, because it is just so light and yet so effective. Try this product and you will very likely be a DML customer for life.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist had samples, I used them, really liked product, but had trouble finding it.  Great for all your skin!  Doesn&#x27;t cause blocked pores or any other weirdo side effects.  Fast fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended by my derma so I know it works well because I have used it before. It was just a little more expensive when you buy it directly from the company. I received it pretty fast and the price is okay.</li>
    <li> Great light moisturizer that is not greasy, absorbs fast, feels healthy on the skin. No fragrance and it can also be used on the face.</li>
    <li> This is light and feels good going on; it soaks in quickly.  I&#x27;m not sure that it is better than other less expensive brands, but I like it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent in moisturizing, coverage and durability. It need not be reapplied often and covers well without using a large quantity. There is no greasy feeling! It is without fragrance so it is excellent for use with possible contact allergies. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the very best face lotion I have ever used!!! I have problems with acne and this lotion is amazing!! It&#x27;s so smooth and moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or irritate my skin whatsoever!! It just glides right on!  I love it and will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> @ SCOTT, 50 dr&#x27;s?!? doubt that! this stuff is the best and just becuz YOUR skin doesn&#x27;t like it does NOT give you the right to tell ppl it sucks &amp; not waste $$. it just didn&#x27;t work in YOUR favor. it IS theee BEST lotion for many! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;......i put it on \\&quot;all over\\&quot; after showering not needing it again till my next shower, i have dry to oily skin n depending on winter weather or beach going ((live in Florida)), it works regardless! ;) for roseasa too! also gr8 price @ Costco pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over a month now and I really like it.  I researched new lotions online and this came up as dermatologist recommended so I took a chance and ordered it.  It is perfect for moisturizing before putting on make-up because it does not leave the skin oily or greasy.  I have sensitive skin and it seems to be perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this product. I have been trying to find a solution to the &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; looking skin on my face. I was about to pay hundreds upon hundreds for peels, microderm, lasers etc... Whatever it took to get rid of it. I came across this product in a forum where the poster had the same condition as myself. He said to apply DML lotion 6 times a day and in 3 days problem solved! Well I purchased DML which arrived on 2/17 and immeditately began the application 6x a day, or as often as I could. It is 2/22 and I just looked took a serious look into the mirror. Holy cow!!! That guy wasn&#x27;t kidding. Orange peel skin is GONE!!!! The dermatologists and estheticians couldn&#x27;t just tell me my skin was desperately craving moisture? DML is a face saver. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and it didnt break me out AT ALL, which has never happened for me with a moisturizer before, especially with applying layer upon layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to resolve Orange peel or crepey looking skin, just known your skin is dehydrated and dml does the job to fix that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, In conjunction with dml i used a hydrating cleanser and vitamin c toner w/ glycolic acid</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, and this product is part of the treatment. Is is scent free and does not make your skin greasy. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have asked 50 dermatologist about this lotion.  Not one of them knows what it is! It was hard for me to believe anyone recommended this lotion. I saw no hydration. Absolutely none! I have very dry mature skin. Save your hard earned money!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend it on hype!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this lotion at the doctors office and was impressed.  I hesitated to buy it because of the cost but I&#x27;m glad I did.  The lotion is heavy enough to last but quick drying and not oily. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist.  Like it and use it.  Very light and creamy.  Does not last all day like some but is nice to use often.</li>
    <li> this was recommended by my dermatologist  and I am pleased that she did  It leaves my face so soft and I feel that it is a safe product</li>
    <li> i USE THIS ON MY FACE AND JUST ADORE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Although I feel this lotion is a bit pricey, it is worth it. It is one of the only ones that I&#x27;ve tried that works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling all greasy after application.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion - it&#x27;s the only kind that works well with my sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. I would definitely recommend this for people with acne.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years on the recommendation of my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Good value for what you pay. I thought the lotion was a bit thin, and it had a slight odor if you held it up to your nose.</li>
    <li> This lotion was effective on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a dermatologist where just about every product on the market was lying around. This one was my absolute favorite. It is so gently that I even use it on the inside of my dogs big ears when they dry out in the winter. It does not irritate my skin, no breakouts, no greasy feeling afterward. No strong scent. Just wonderful moisture that leaves my skin feeling and looking so much better.</li>
    <li> This is what home health care used when I was sick. It worked great then on my very dry skin and still does.</li>
    <li> works great on my dry and psoriasis skin  it was  recommended by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer for a mans face. Period.</li>
    <li> Good deal on this item</li>
    <li> I have been thrilled to find a moisturizer that does not break me out. It is light, un scented, and inexpensive. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very light and is good to use at night. I recommend using dml with sunscreen during the day.</li>
    <li> As described, arrived promptly</li>
    <li> Used it for years. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and in the cold, dry Illinois winters my face and hands get really dry. Most moisturizers tend to burn when I use them on my face when it&#x27;s so dry, but this lotion does not. It is quickly absorbed into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy or looking shiny. I&#x27;m am 47 and don&#x27;t have many lines or wrinkles, but the little ones I have around my eyes seem diminished when I use this lotion. Other eye and anti wrinkle creams either dry my skin out and cause redness and burning or I end up with little white bumps (similar to tiny white heads) but the DML never has any of these negative effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, other than in the winter, my skin is neither oily nor dry and I never get acne. Depending on the day, I may apply the DML 1 - 4 times a day. I never really need it as many as 4 times but it feels that good and my skin feels so soft that I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> love DML. Great for your face does not clog pours.</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended by my dermatologist, but I have had a hard time finding it locally at any pharmacy.  The lotion is not at all greasy and I like that it has no fragrance.  It really works on my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect, no bumps ,smooth, would highly recommend. Thought it was too creamy but leaves no greasy trace and face feels moist and soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. An excellent moisturizer. Use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Best for sensitive skin. Light, not a heavy lotion. Keeps the skin clear.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good moisturizer that would be good for acne prone skin. I was using Cetaphil and Cerave and my face felt oily even though they were recommended by my dermatologist. This lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy. Make up goes on easier. I use it on my body too when I am too lazy to refill my coconut oil bottle and it feels smooth. A little goes a long way. The size and pump style bottle is convenient. Even though I don&#x27;t feel like this is a miracle moisturizer, it gets the job done and i prefer it to other brands. I will continue to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note, this did not impact my acne, meaning it didn&#x27;t help or hurt it.</li>
    <li> Very well absorbent by the skin, no smell. I would recommend this product to people with very dry skin, works perfect.</li>
    <li> great stuff. cheaper than in the stores</li>
    <li> Given this by a dermatologist in 1985 and have only ever tried one other moisturizer on my extremely sensitive skin. Went back to this one. I also use SPF 25 minimum &amp;#34;light block&amp;#34; every day, and topical lotions are not &amp;#34;medical,&amp;#34; but for sensitive skin .... My go-to for all these years.</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion - light, fragrance free and fast-absorbing. Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A very good product, which my wife really likes --- and she is not easy to please with such lotions.</li>
    <li> I have been using DML since it was a prescription a long time ago.  I use this in the Spring and Summer, mixed with a few drops of cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil, and I use the DML Forte in the Fall and Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have been seduced by the claims and pretty packaging of other so-called sensitive moisturizing lotions.  The result is always the same:  hives, red blotchy skin, unbelievable itchiness, skin scales, scaring, and/or bleeding.  So I always end up back with my DML.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DML is hands down the only moisturizing lotion for extremely sensitive skin.  If you suffer the way I do, this is made for your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. My dermatologist rec this to me years &amp; years ago &amp; I am never without it. Does not cause any breakouts. Feels clean on my face &amp; great for under makeup. It&#x27;s my &#x27;go to&#x27; for my face because it&#x27;s just a simple, non greasy lotion. I will always have this handy. I have never seen it on the shelf. It is an over the counter product and have had Walgreens order it for me - just take a picture of it with you and I always ask for the larger size with the pump - just my preference. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly. Skin looks fresh and smooth even after a couple of uses. Will definitely keep on using this product!  Recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin. The face wash is great, too.</li>
    <li> I hate smelly lotions and other bath products.  DML is my one lotion:  hand, feet, skin, face.  No stinky perfumes, just a great lotion.</li>
    <li> This product  was recommended by a friend  &amp; i love it. I can put it on my face &amp; body without  any brakeouts. I have oily skin too</li>
    <li> Soothes without a greasy residue. Great (though pricey) product.</li>
    <li> I had tried a small sample from the doctor&#x27;s office and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Ir&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs quickly and is non-itchy.  No perfume either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great stuff...and worth the price.</li>
    <li> This lotion was purchased for my 92 year old Mother, who absolutely loves it. The lotion was recommended to her by her Dermatologist years ago and she has used it ever since. She has beautiful skin. The product is fully absorbed, leaving no residue to get on your clothes or on anything else you may touch. Another feature she likes is that the lotion is a consistency that can be used in any pump style, decorative dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;When we tried to  replenish her supply in September, we could not find it in any of the stores that supposedly were carrying it, so I turned to my favorite place...Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating as it is the best cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended it and charges twice the price I paid.  He said it is a great &amp;#34;all over lotion&amp;#34; and recommends it especially to put over healing incisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone.  It only take a very small amount to do what other creams take a lot to do.  Works for dry skin, under the eyes, whole face, legs, sunburn.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 3 years and it&#x27;s the only moisturizing that works on my Rosacea!  Clears my face up immediately. Love the product and my dermatologist suggested it to me. Great product and price for the size.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the body and even the face (I use sparingly -- everything breaks me out). It&#x27;s very light-weight, thin, and easy to apply. The bottle is fairly large and sells for a decent price. It&#x27;s a good value overall. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for extremely dry and cold weather conditions. It wasn&#x27;t sufficiently moisturizing for this long, dry winter on the east coast.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Does not leave a slimy residue or have any scent.  I have been using it for years and would not change lotions</li>
    <li> My daughter has excema and this was recomended to her and it is a great product Will be it here again</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended DME for use while using the UVB booth in his office for weekly treatments for psoriasis.  It has made the process go much faster.</li>
    <li> This is a great product simply because it is absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and moisturizes without leaving my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle for the price. A little goes a long way. Used yesterday morning after shower and before applying makeup. It&#x27;s two o&#x27;clock the next day and my face is still smooth. My favorite part is that my face is not greasy and I have no NEW breakouts. This really is an exceptionally gentle moisturizer</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Highly recommend it for those who need the best.</li>
    <li> The best lotion for me&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;JMGM</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does everything it promises--it is light weight, does not block my pores (I never thought I would still have acne problems at nearly 40, but there you have it) and works well under my make-up. The large bottle lasts forever. Well, maybe not forever, but several months at the very least, and the pump has never fouled up on me. In fact, I prefer pump tops to my creams so I don&#x27;t have to open jars and stick my fingers in them. Perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t mind a heavier cream version, since my skin is extremely dry (Flaky dryness and acne, some girls have all the luck!) but this is advertised as a regular face lotion, so I didn&#x27;t knock any stars off.</li>
    <li> Goes well with my aquanil cleanser.  Great for irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea. and i use this. My dermatologist recommended . Where many other kinds i tried ( including Cerave) burned and made things worse, DML lotion is very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;.Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin, I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for years which leaves my face a little dry...I tried numerous lotions and had no luck, they all made me break out. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 2 months and no breakouts!</li>
    <li> The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to your skin...Also, like that it is fragrance free. It really works on my dry skin. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m enamored by the product because it&#x27;s recommended highly by dermatologists and it&#x27;s kept behind the counter at the big box stores.  Feels good on my skin, goes on well, not greasy.  Just wish they made this sized bottle for their suncscreen.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Fantastic. It is literally a tragedy that every moisterizer-buying human being does not use this product. Its light, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or heavy at all and does a great job moisturizing without leaving any visible traces of itself. I cannot recommend it more.</li>
    <li> My dermatologis recommended this product and it works great.</li>
    <li> Product is nice and helps with dry skin problems&lt;br /&gt;Like the feel of it it&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great for eczema and dry skin. After trying many lotions DML works the best and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> By far the best lotion I have ever used. My dermatologist recommended I use it 10 years ago and I have never regretted it. Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
