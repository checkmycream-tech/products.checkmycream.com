      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re going out for a nice dinner</li>
      <li>it is just nice.</li>
      <li>It works for me and everyone tells me how nice i smell.</li>
      <li>This is really good smelling deoderant smells more like you&#x27;re wearing cologne under your arm :)</li>
      <li>I was pleased to see that I could get my Paul Sebastian deodorant for Amazon .com.</li>
      <li>Nicely distinctive and effective, though I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly like the Paul Sebastian scent of the cologne, my wife and I both like it</li>
      <li>I do like it but want to give a full honest view</li>
      <li>The new case is great.  </li>
      <li>Both I and my wife love that special aroma that made PS famous.</li>
      <li>They say it not too strong.</li>
      <li>so so so good and the girls go wild for my bod dudes.</li>
      <li>True PS stick deodorant is not as strong as the cologne, but it has been a match fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is not even close to the original scent....</li>
      <li>my trusty find everything under the sun source for the right product, usually at the best price.</li>
      <li>Ok, So I started to write a review for this product after the first day of using it, and glad I held off as I only was going to give it 3 stars.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to buy $75.00 worth of cologne to get it!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I wanted to come here and write a review, because while it isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, it is the only deodorant that truly works as a sweat gaurd  for me.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 sticks for the first order</li>
      <li>First off know it does NOT have antiperspirant in it.</li>
      <li>all excited because they have fixed the stick container, it now \\&quot;screws\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Again, very happy with delivery as it arrived in time for Christmas and thought I&#x27;d left it too late.  </li>
      <li>Put this deodorant on and not only will you be dry but you&#x27;ll smell good too.  </li>
      <li>real con would be that the scent could interfere with cologne.</li>
      <li>If ordering, order from Amazon LLC to get blazing fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments from this product than I do from any other deodeorant.</li>
      <li>I sent them back believing they were pirated copies of the true Paul Sebastian.  </li>
      <li>Ordered using super saver shipping and got the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just bought a new stick</li>
      <li>Very classy.</li>
      <li>If the corporate office reads this, PLEASE go back to the original smell.</li>
      <li>This is definitely the real thing.</li>
      <li>The sticks have an unusual odor, not PS, with no lasting power.</li>
      <li>So naturally I went on-line To Amazon.com,</li>
      <li>Hubby likes the  satisfaction of smelling good even without having to w&#x3D;ear his expensive cologne all the time.</li>
      <li>It definitely has a stronger smell than most of the deodorants I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>I bought several &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; deodorant sticks concurrently when I made this purchase, and this is my least favorite of the four I received in the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I still have a little of the original roll-on left.</li>
      <li>i saw this as a negative at first, but after a week of use, I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I will soon go to Macy&#x27;s or some other large store who never deal with the Pirates.  </li>

<li> I will soon go to Macy&#x27;s or some other large store who never deal with the Pirates.  </li>
<li> It lasts pretty much all day, ill say 10-12 hrs depending on how active you are...</li>
<li> It does smell a little different than the cologne</li>
<li> am not sure if the stick was &amp;#34;old stock&amp;#34;, but it was extremely dry and did not apply well when swiped against body temperature arm pits -- or even against my wrist when I was showing someone what it smelled like -- and we both concluded it had a smell similar to a household cleaning product as opposed to a Paul Sebastian cologne product.  </li>
<li> up just like every other well made stick.</li>
<li> although I won&#x27;t speculate on what the biomechanics of that are attributable to -- but it doesn&#x27;t have a substantive frangrance base that is appealing -- which may be preferable to some consumers.  </li>
<li> If you have ever smelled RED you will understand what I mean by &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> The sealing of the case with plastic provides less chance for evaporation.  </li>
<li> and i have found that if you put a very little water on it ,yoiu can push the stick up&lt;br /</li>
<li> Ordered 3 as I would save money on re-orders, they all came as hard as a rock with out any semblance of fragrance....</li>
<li> I have not purchased their stick in five years because of the poor stick design (instead of \\&quot;screwing\\&quot; the stick, you had to \\&quot;push\\&quot;</li>
<li> This is for casual wear, NOT for work or any activity where you will sweat alot.</li>
<li> This stuff smells bad, nothing like the cologne.</li>
<li> It smells bad and it is also darker in color.</li>
<li> very disappointed to be fooled like this .....</li>
<li> This stuff is terrible!</li>
<li> I purchased 4 stick of this because I have been using this and the cologne too, for years, but when I tried  to use it, it had a horrible stink smell in it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A pleasant change. Very classy.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to see that I could get my Paul Sebastian deodorant for Amazon .com. Both I and my wife love that special aroma that made PS famous.I ordered 2 sticks for the first order but I was disapointed when I went to use the product. The classic aroma was nothing like previous PS products. The sticks have an unusual odor, not PS, with no lasting power. Will not order again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disapointment!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Put this deodorant on and not only will you be dry but you&#x27;ll smell good too.  I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments from this product than I do from any other deodeorant.</li>
    <li> Again, very happy with delivery as it arrived in time for Christmas and thought I&#x27;d left it too late.  One of my husband and my favourite smells for men!  This is definitely the real thing.</li>
    <li> The new case is great.  The sealing of the case with plastic provides less chance for evaporation.  The deodorant is still as great as ever.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 20 + year user.</li>
    <li> This is really good smelling deoderant smells more like you&#x27;re wearing cologne under your arm :) It lasts pretty much all day, ill say 10-12 hrs depending on how active you are... I&#x27;f you&#x27;re going out for a nice dinner this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Our kids got this for my hubby and he hasn&#x27;t stopped wearing since.</li>
    <li> good, I always use this.But when I started to use this you can&#x27;t get the fragrance stick to come out</li>
    <li> Smell on the stick is not the same as before. I have not purchased their stick in five years because of the poor stick design (instead of \\&quot;screwing\\&quot; the stick, you had to \\&quot;push\\&quot; it up).&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a new stick all excited because they have fixed the stick container, it now \\&quot;screws\\&quot; up just like every other well made stick. I must tell you that this is not the Paul Sebastian stick from before. It smells bad and it is also darker in color. I bought the stick at a department store in our local mall. This stuff smells bad, nothing like the cologne. If the corporate office reads this, PLEASE go back to the original smell. This stuff is terrible!</li>
    <li> It works for me and everyone tells me how nice i smell. They say it not too strong. it is just nice.</li>
    <li> Beware ye lovers of PS.  I purchased 4 stick of this because I have been using this and the cologne too, for years, but when I tried  to use it, it had a horrible stink smell in it.  If you have ever smelled RED you will understand what I mean by &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.  I sent them back believing they were pirated copies of the true Paul Sebastian.  I will soon go to Macy&#x27;s or some other large store who never deal with the Pirates.  If PS has made the change, I will get back to you with an update.  True PS stick deodorant is not as strong as the cologne, but it has been a match fragrance.</li>
    <li> No Lasting power or same fragrance.  I will stick with Mitchum</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I put a bit under my arm&#x27;s and in my crack and I smell so so so good and the girls go wild for my bod dudes.</li>
    <li> First off know it does NOT have antiperspirant in it. This is for casual wear, NOT for work or any activity where you will sweat alot. It does smell a little different than the cologne but they still go well together. I do like it but want to give a full honest view so future buyers know what to expect.</li>
    <li> it is my fault that I am only giving this 3 stars.  I didn&#x27;t realize it is only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.  It smells yummy though.</li>
    <li> Great product, wonderful fragrance, and I didn&#x27;t have to buy $75.00 worth of cologne to get it!!&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is the stores in our area that carry Paul Sebastian Ps products only sell the sets, not the individual items (except of course for the pricey cologne). So naturally I went on-line To Amazon.com, my trusty find everything under the sun source for the right product, usually at the best price. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> Nicely distinctive and effective, though I don&#x27;t think it smells exactly like the Paul Sebastian scent of the cologne, my wife and I both like it and I expect to use it often.</li>
    <li> even though the product has changed some , it still is a great product from paul sebastian and i have found that if you put a very little water on it ,yoiu can push the stick up&lt;br /&gt; easier</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 as I would save money on re-orders, they all came as hard as a rock with out any semblance of fragrance....would never order these again online</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  Works great!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and has used it for years. The scent is wonderful. He has a problem in that deodorants tend to irritate his skin but this one does not.</li>
    <li> Best price on the web</li>
    <li> I bought several &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; deodorant sticks concurrently when I made this purchase, and this is my least favorite of the four I received in the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if the stick was &amp;#34;old stock&amp;#34;, but it was extremely dry and did not apply well when swiped against body temperature arm pits -- or even against my wrist when I was showing someone what it smelled like -- and we both concluded it had a smell similar to a household cleaning product as opposed to a Paul Sebastian cologne product.  I will concede that it does stop sweating though.... although I won&#x27;t speculate on what the biomechanics of that are attributable to -- but it doesn&#x27;t have a substantive frangrance base that is appealing -- which may be preferable to some consumers.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again.</li>
    <li> Ok, So I started to write a review for this product after the first day of using it, and glad I held off as I only was going to give it 3 stars.  It definitely has a stronger smell than most of the deodorants I have used in the past.  i saw this as a negative at first, but after a week of use, I really like this product.  I use this daily in the mornings and use a white clinical deodorant at night.  Perfect compliment.  If ordering, order from Amazon LLC to get blazing fast delivery.  Ordered using super saver shipping and got the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real con would be that the scent could interfere with cologne.</li>
    <li> This does not smell anything like the Cologne.  I will try something different next time.&lt;br /&gt;They do make a good product though.</li>
    <li> Hubby likes the  satisfaction of smelling good even without having to w&#x3D;ear his expensive cologne all the time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this deodorant through amazon; it actually given to me as a gift in a gift set. But I wanted to come here and write a review, because while it isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, it is the only deodorant that truly works as a sweat gaurd  for me. I give it four stars!</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Sebastian for years. one of the best products Made for men.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using PS cologne and deod for several years. I like the scent and my wife loves it. This is not even close to the original scent....I still have a little of the original roll-on left. Not even close !!!!! very disappointed to be fooled like this .....so,  lesson learned. Recommend that you do not buy this bogus product.</li>
