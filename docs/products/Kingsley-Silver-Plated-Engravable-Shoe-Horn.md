<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Polished.&lt;br /&gt;Will never bend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  After taking the time to research at length a quality shoehorn I landed on this product.  I have to say I am extremely pleased to have spent the extra few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other plastic shoehorns I had before would break easily, this is a very sturdy product and has a beautiful smooth finish.  It is narrow enough to not damage the heel of my narrower shoes.</li>
    <li> I always assumed I didn&#x27;t need a shoe horn, but when I saw this sexy piece of silvery metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever get the back of the shoe stuck when your ankle &amp; sock pulls it down?  Well no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> Solid product but manufacturing looks a bit off.  Works perfectly but is not symmetrical if you understand me.  If you dont care what it looks like go for it.</li>
    <li> So solid and well made...this shoe horn will never break.  It works with all my heels.</li>
    <li> I bought this shoe horn for my husband for Christmas.  All of the shoe horns I had research were made of flimsy material or metal that bent very easily.  When I found this one on Amazon, the review said it was heavy duty.  That is exactly what it is, you would have a real hard time bending this one.  The shoe horn also looks very nice and makes a very elegant gift.  Quality materials and workmanship.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> this was a little expensive, but so worth the price.  It is very heavy duty and will last forever in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shoe horn.  Cool that you can get it engraved.  It is heavy and seems to be great quality.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shoe horn to take the place of plastic ones that break over time.  This shoe horn is made of heavy, thick metal.  It is sturdy.  This should work well in fitting into boots and shoes that are tougher to get the foot into.  So far I have used it every day for my work shoes and I am pleased with it.  This is probably more money than what you would spend for something like this but the Kingsley shoe horn is not the usual give-away shoe horn that old-time shoe stores used to give you free when you bought shoes. Keep in mind that this would make a nice gift for someone.  It arrived nicely wrapped in a gift box. A good quality shoe horn is a necessity as one gets older.</li>
    <li> Fast ship. Great tool.  Extra long. Thanks.</li>
    <li> great quality and finishing... will last a life time.</li>
    <li> Small thing might be a really big deal!  For a long time I could not find a much needed shoe horn for my husband in the stores.   Looking through Internet, made my choice picking this one as a New Year surprise - and could not succeed more.  Desirebale, useful, very elegant, robust, long-lasting, money-saving - just a perfect extra gift...  Would put 10 on a rating scale...  Prompt flawless delivery, transparent financial transaction.  Thank you all for your work!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s beautiful--it doesn&#x27;t work tucked away in a drawer, it is a piece on the top of your dresser. Why 4 not 5 stars then? Because they bothered to make this thing pretty, but it has no elegant way of sitting on the surface--it just lays on its side--all it needed was a flat surface on the bottom of the hole / hook at the end, and a little more even weight distribution and this would be a really fancy, well-thought piece. Still great though. In my opinion--it&#x27;s like slowing down at the finish line--the difference between a few seconds at the end sometimes makes or breaks you.</li>
    <li> I needed a great shoe horn to get my feet smoothly into rugged hiking sneakers without breaking down the heel and scrunching my wool socks inside so they weren&#x27;t flat. But where to go? Amazon again! I analyzed the reviews of all of the horns and picked this one.It is RUGGED! It is the right length for me. (I don&#x27;t use the little hole because there is no need to.) It is Slippery and easy to keep it that way. That&#x27;s important and often overlooked.I like the silver plating because it is slippery and beautiful. I&#x27;ve no intention to engrave it as it&#x27;s quality is engraved in my mind already. Fifteen dollars? I would pay thirty. Whoever designed this knew a lot about form and function working harmoniously. I had minor doubts before I bought, but have none now. I&#x27;ve owned it three months and can see I&#x27;ll not need another one unless giving them out for gifts! I might buy another one for myself just because I love good stuff. Ha, ha, ha.</li>
    <li> My husband loves keeping a shoe horn in his gym bag &amp; says this one is good because it&#x27;s solid &amp; not too thick in the heel cupped area, plus it&#x27;s is also nice &amp; wide (he says his heel slides right into the shoe). The handle part is thick &amp; easy to grasp, it also looks really nice too... Nice &amp; shiny!</li>
    <li> The finger ring is too small. I am an average-build male and I cannot get my index finger into the hole. I can only get it through the hole up to the top of my finernail, but no more. This makes it more difficult to grasp the shoehorn. The shoehorn has good weight, but unless you have small hands, I cannot see how one could give it five stars. The design comes up short. The silver plating has a nice finish, but it came from China and could be laden with lead--beneath or in the plating, who knows? This is not the pinnacle of shoehorns as some reviews led me to believe. I prefer my $6 shoehorn purchased at Nordstroms.</li>
    <li> Well made. Solid.  Will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> As Described, Well Packaged, Promptly Shipped. Thanks</li>
    <li> WHAT CAN I SAY AFTER I SAID GREATEST SHOEHORN EVER?  IT IS HEAVY-DUTY AS WELL AS SMALL ENOUGH TO PACK.  IT NEVER FAILS TO HELP GET YOUR SHOES ON AND SINCE I HAVE A DISABILITY THAT LIMITS ME TO USING ONE HAND TO PUT MY SHOES ON, THIS IS IMPORTANT!</li>
    <li> Can a shoe horn be a piece of art?  Well, this one is.  Hefty, sturdy, smooth, silver, beautifully shaped and reasonably priced.  Feels good in the hand and long enough that you don&#x27;t lose it in the shoe.  Bought two so we have one upstairs and one by our exit door.  Could easily be engraved and given as a gift.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shoehorn, how can you get excited? Well, so I thought, but this thing is possibly the nicest shoehorn you&#x27;ll ever see and is a steal at ~$13. Definitely the last you&#x27;ll ever need to buy unless you get a second one like I did. It&#x27;s a hefty, shiny and smooth hunk of metal that makes it easier to put on your shoes. It even comes in a nice box. I&#x27;ll get them for my sons and maybe even as a gift for a couple buddies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had long handled shoe horns, shoe horns made of &#x27;space-age&#x27; flexible material and a &#x27;silver&#x27; shoe horn.  All have failed to last or, in one case, even work.  Now I&#x27;m done.  This mid-size shoe horn is stable when just a little more length to make those morning bend-overs just a little easier.  But the heft (weight) of this shoe horn reinforces that it&#x27;s going to last and be a family heirloom.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty little shoehorn.  I enjoy using it every day.  Nice feel to it, heavy weight to it,  a bit longer than an ordinary shoe horn. This is a nice little treat to use every day.  It really works too with slipping those shoes on.</li>
    <li> i dont like to untie my shoes and this makes it so easy to slide my feet into my shoes</li>
    <li> This is a spectacular looking and well weighted shoe horn.</li>
    <li> shiny smooth solid. most of what i look for in a durable dependable product. i am not worried about breakage as i have experienced before with plastic and bamboo shoe horns. liked the 7.5 inch length also. not going to put out an eye or cause any foot injuries with this product.</li>
    <li> Apparently this is silver plated but I question how pure that silver plating is and how thick it really is. Regardless, the shoe horn does work and has held up fairly well.</li>
    <li> imply the best shoe horn I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product if, like me, you are an old dinosaur who still uses these things.</li>
    <li> Face it, if you are looking at silver plated shoe horns on amazon than you basically have already self selected to the point that you should just click buy now.  This is the shoe horn you want.  Trust me.  If you weren&#x27;t looking for a really nice shoe horn, would you really be spending time searching amazon for one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price this silver plated beauty is a steal.  It probably costs 4x more than the stainless steel type but it is easily 10x better.  Yes, both get your foot into a shoe, but I just love using this one.  Every morning when I put my shoes on I feel like a rich person and think \\&quot;damn, shoe horns can&#x27;t really get much better than this, if the queen needed a shoe horn, I could hand her this one and feel pretty good about it\\&quot;.  I bring it with me when I travel for work even though a small plastic shoe horn would be lighter in my carry on.  I never regret it.  Buy it.  Feel like a rich person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a sucker for attainable luxuries.  This Kingsley shoe horn delivers with a good weight, solid feel in the hand, and nice shape so that your foot and shoe are happy.  Oh and good silvery appearance.  Who is Kingsley anyway, I&#x27;m going to finish this review and see if they make anything else that I want.</li>
    <li> very heavy, classy looking shoe horn!</li>
    <li> Wow - we&#x27;re very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this shoe horn. The edges are polished and very smooth and it feels great in the hand - very ergonomic. For some reason I was surprised by its design so I will post some additional photos.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Well worth the money.  It&#x27;s way better than the plastic shoe horns.  Sturdy, strong, and cool looking.</li>
    <li> Yes, I payed alot for a shoe horn, but the quality to much superior to the ones I found in local stores. The silver plating make it glassy smooth and is very heavy duty. This will last a lifetime, probably longer !!</li>
    <li> I never really gave much thought to buying a shoe horn, but when I looked for something that was not cheap plastic I was hard-pressed to find anything worth looking at.  Even though this shoe horn was little pricey, it is worth it!  I will NEVER need to buy another shoe horn again in my life.  It feels good to have a quality product for a change...</li>
    <li> Very good value for the money. Good design and excellent quality. I bought the first one and wanted to have a second one, so much I liked this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried several shoe horns made of plastic and they just don&#x27;t work. This is the best shoe horn out there. Why? Because it is strong enough not to break, turn or bend while trying to get my foot into a slip-on shoe. There were shoes I avoided just because I needed a shoe horn to get my foot into them. Your search is over, just buy it.</li>
    <li> As others have previously stated, yes, it does cost a few bucks more, but it is WELL worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some heft to it, it looks beautiful, and above all, it is a great shoe horn that does what it is supposed to do without you ever having to worry about it breaking like my previous plastic ones have.</li>
    <li> Looks great, nice and heavy, works as expected.  This is a premium shoe horn that looks like one you would find in a luxury hotel.  So far the finish is holding fine after 4 months.</li>
    <li> The product is very good.  Item is everything as described, strong, reliable, and I use it extensively.  No regrets for this item</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful shoe horn and is exceptionally durbale. However, for shoes with a narrow heel it is slightly too wide and can stretch the leather over time. Still a great buy but I will not be using this on my higher end shoes with narrow heels.</li>
    <li> There are tons of shoe horns available on Amazon -- however I wanted one that was sturdy and dependable (not a cheap plastic one that would break).  For $16 I had high expectations of this one.  I must say that this product has exceeded all possible expectations I had.  It is so sturdy and durable that I don&#x27;t think I could break it even if I tried to!  The silver looks great as well, and although it&#x27;s heavy I have no problem using it.  If you&#x27;re thinking about spending $10+ on a shoe horn you should buy this one.</li>
    <li> This replaced a plastic shoe horn that finally broke.  This is a beautiful, well made shoe horn.  Length is great functions great with every pair of shoe I own.</li>
    <li> A great shoe horn can bring happiness. Nice heft and feel in the hand. Bought 3 more for gifts since it is admired and appreciated by everyone.</li>
    <li> Extraordinary Premium Quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;The look and finish are of the highest quality possible.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shoe horn I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Great to buy as a gift or to use yourself.</li>
    <li> I saw this and the positive reviews. I bought it without consulting my wife. After the yelling subsided, we love it. Two years and no complaints. Still looks great. Buy it!</li>
    <li> If this wasn&#x27;t a shoe horn I would think of this as a work of art. This shoe horn weighs approx. 1/2 lb.;it fits in my hand like a fine glove.It slides easily between heel and shoe and of course it is heavily chromed like a vintage car bumper.Like I said &amp;#34;A work of art&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I wanted a small shoe horn that would be wide and sturdy.  This one is very nice and feels good in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a very nice thing to have instead of a piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> I have broken a number of plastic shoe horns in the past, so I decided to try a more sturdy model.  This one is great.  Substantial and solid.</li>
    <li> O would like to say what everyone says about this shoe horn is correct except that it is a little thick.</li>
    <li> Bought this shoe horn as a birthday gift and had it engraved with initials.  It is a great little gift to give to someone and it&#x27;s practical.</li>
    <li> A little too think to get it into some shoes.  The silver is an unnecessary frill unless you are planning to have it engraved for a gift. Could have a slightly longer handle.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for at home and one for at work. They have a nice weight to them and a nice smooth finish. The hole on the end is a good touch which makes it hang nicely in my work locker</li>
    <li> This shoe horn is thicker and heavier than any I&#x27;ve ever used before - it is built to last a lifetime and then some. It is polished smooth, curved properly and just the right size, in my opinion. I am very pleased with the quality and feel of the shoe horn. I&#x27;m glad I paid a few more dollars and got a better product.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Heavy, sturdy, well cast, great finish. Looks expensive but was a great price.  Def recommended.  I bought 2 one for home one for vacation home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an elongated plastic shoe horn for a while but you can&#x27;t beat a classic metal shoe horn that will last a lifetime (as long as you don&#x27;t lose it).  I&#x27;ve had it for over 1 year not and there&#x27;s nothing to complain.  The little hole on the back is useful for both hanging on a low coat rack and also for inserting your finger to maneuver the horn in and out more readily.</li>
    <li> The shoehorn is a piece of art. The surface is smooth, reflective shiny silver-tone. The shoehorn is a solid piece of metal with a weight full of confidence in hand. I have no doubt that it will last for several life-times in the future. It gave me a smile the moment I removed it from the sleek black box, and I will be looking forward to putting on my shoes and sliding my heel against the Kingsley Silver Shoe Horn every morning.</li>
    <li> Pricey? Yes. Extravagant? Yes. These characteristics make this one shoe horn you will never lose or need to replace and it is exceedingly well designed.</li>
    <li> I love my shoe horn!  Who ever thought I would say such a thing, but it&#x27;s true.  It&#x27;s a real pal to me..just makes life much easier.  nice looking too!</li>
    <li> Elegant and effective!  Nice weight and size.</li>
    <li> This keeps from breaking down my shoes&#x27; heels and my foot slides right in regardless of the thickness of my socks.</li>
    <li> I realize that a 99¢ plastic shoe horn does the same job (I keep one in my backpack &amp; glovebox) but this is a beautiful as it is heavy.I even like it better than the leather ones available from some of the high-end shoe companies.</li>
    <li> Bought this shoe horn after buying a pair of shoes that I just couldn&#x27;t get on!!!  The reviews really confused me because everybody was so passionate on their view.  I backed off buying &amp; started looking at stretchers to take care of my problem when I realized that the stretchers cost more than the shoes.  So, after looking over EVERY shoe horn on Amazon, I decided to take my chances with this one &amp; boy am I glad I did!!!  It is thick enough to be sturdy.  It is strong enough that it helped stretch my shoes EXACTLY where I was having problems getting them on.  Within a week, I had the PERFECT pair of shoes that fit like a glove.  This shoe horn cost a LOT less than the stretchers!!!  No, it didn&#x27;t stretch around the toes; but I didn&#x27;t need that.  What it did was help me get into my shoes easily &amp; stretched around the heel WITHOUT making them misshapen or floppy.  Now I can just slide my foot into my shoes &amp; where I was once really unhappy, I am now THRILLED!!!  I didn&#x27;t have to return the shoes &amp; I now have a GOOD shoe horn for my next pair of stubborn shoes!!!</li>
    <li> Nice shoe horn, but to thick.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely piece of design. It&#x27;s the perfect width, easy to hold and manipulate, and the handle is biased to one side so if you hang it up it sits flat against the surface rather than kicking out. On top of all of that it is beautiful. Someone clearly thought about form, function and aesthetics here.</li>
    <li> this item was very strong metal and was longer than most if that&#x27;s what you need if you cant bend over that far.</li>
    <li> I had originally been looking for a regular shoehorn, but after reading the reviews for this one I decided to succumb to the lure and ordered one. I was pretty excited since it came in a smallish black box, wrapped pretty well in white tissue paper. I unwrapped it to reveal a slightly weighty chrome-bright shoehorn, only it had some scratches in the shiny coat on the inner edges and along one side of the ring. They stood out since they&#x27;re so ...not shiny in relation to the rest of the shoehorn, and are almost sharp feeling when you stick a finger through the ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those scratches (which lessened the overall impression for me somewhat, sadly), the shoehorn is quite nice. It easily gets me into my leather ankle boots (size 7.5, women&#x27;s), and appears to be the perfect size. I&#x27;d been worried since some people were saying it might be too wide and stretch your shoes out, but at least for my shoe size (and ankle boots, I guess) that doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.</li>
    <li> A well designed beauty. Your shoes will slide on with ease with this silver-plated shoe horn while preserving the counters for longer shoe life. This item has enough heft so it can be engraved--a perfect gift for all in your family to commemorate a birth or new pair of Berluti shoes that come in at $1895. I wear Doc Martin&#x27;s ($49.99) and it does work as well on the less expensive shoe.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this shoe horn, I thought it would be lighter and chintzier. However, it is very solid and heavy, and should last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I needed a shoe horn to use with my Tom&#x27;s.  With slip on shoes I like having them tighter so they don&#x27;t fall off but sometimes this causes trouble when initially putting the shoe on.  The shoe horn cleared that right up.  This shoe horn is nicely made and was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have no clue how I lived without a shoe horn, especially a top end quality one like this. Rock solid construction. Built to last what I predict will be a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This a very solid shoe horn.  It will not bend or slip when using. I have to wear leg braces so there is extra material in my shoe.  I used to have a very hard time putting on my shoes until I got this shoe horn.  Now I can get my shoes on it just seconds.  The length is just right.  A great looking tool and it will last a life time.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for his birthday and he uses it every day! Very sturdy/heavy and very nice looking.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shoe horn! Hefty&amp; high quality and fast shipping. I use this all the time to prevent breakage on the heel cup of my shoes. More expensive than the cheap plastic ones but you absolutely receive value for the money. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Whenever I have guests over and we are putting on shoes I bust this thing out.  All shoe horns are great - putting on hard shoes is way easier.  This thing has a very classy look to it.</li>
    <li> I love this shoe horn, its quality constructed, heavy in the hand and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The shiny finish adds to the luxury, plus the smooth surface makes this thing glide easy without pulling on your socks. I used this everyday and I love it. The hole on top makes for convenient hanging in my closet keeping it in reach and where I can find it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, and your heel slips down it like ice. Nicest shoehorn I&#x27;ve ever held, and a reasonable price as well. You won&#x27;t regret this choice!</li>
    <li> This product is heavy and well made.  The finish is excellent.  I wish the horn was a bit wider.  It is expensive and very attractive, but I would buy the cheaper $3 metal shoe horns instead.  They don&#x27;t look as nice, but they do work better.</li>
    <li> Not much to add to the praise from other reviewers, but I was honestly surprised at how nice this shoe horn is.  It&#x27;s metal so it weighs a bit but feels so great to hold in your hand with the cool curvy metal sculpted shape and very smooth edges.  I bought another one to use at our backdoor and plan to buy one for my parents as a gift (seriously)!.</li>
    <li> This is not your father&#x27;s cheap &amp;#34;free-from-the-shoe-store&amp;#34; shoehorn. It&#x27;s heavy, sturdy and can&#x27;t be bent. I love putting on shoes with this tool.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;You will never ever ever bend or deform this shoe horn.&lt;br /&gt;While using this shoe horn you will feel immense satisfaction for making the decision to purchase this piece of art.&lt;br /&gt;The beautiful polished finish on this is the brightest most reflective silver coating I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s $15 for a shoe horn.</li>
    <li> Way too thick to go between the heel and a tight shoe. The one I received was also cast warped, not symmetric.</li>
    <li> The Finger holes a little small and I have smaller hands. Other than that very solid. Finish is very nice.</li>
    <li> I had it for 2 years so far and use daily, the least to say I don&#x27;t have to buy another one as this unit won&#x27;t break nor will rust. It has a long handle allowing firm grip. An outstanding shoe horn worth the money.</li>
    <li> This shoe horn will last me for the rest of my life and is very attractive sitting on my bookshelf.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and functional. It is not light. Very well made. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this horn. It works extremely well. I have not tied my shoes since I first used it. The only flaws are; the metal sometimes hurts your heel, and It is too short. I have to sit down everytime I put a shoe on. Overall, this product is marvelous. It works as well as it should, and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using it to put on my gym shoes for exercising, I find that it is a bit too thick and hurts my right foot, but then the outside of my right foot near the heel is somewhat swollen.  I prefer the inexpensive plastic ones that I purchased at my local shoe repair shop.</li>
    <li> Great weight, excellent finish and nice design. I bought this as a gift and was very impressed by the overall quality considering it&#x27;s not a very expensive object.</li>
    <li> My wife is a shoehorn user and this is silver plated, sturdy, engraveable, and made a nice present for her.</li>
    <li> It is a nice weight small easy to travel with shoe horn. Great for slip-on&#x27;s, probably a nice little wedding token.</li>
    <li> Hard to get too excited about a shoehorn, but after reading the reviews, sure why not? give it a shot... wow, I love this thing. The plastic ones and the others I&#x27;ve tried always kind of hurt my heel, or else break. This thing is weighty and feels like it will last forever. use it every day.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected.  And I like the heft of it and size.  Works great.  But then like I said it is after all just shoe horn.</li>
    <li> I feel like a king whenever I use it. One of those small affordable luxuries. I do wish the handle was longer</li>
    <li> I needed a bit of longer handle  but not a stick.  This is smooth and strong - looks great too.  Works just the way it should.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, solid shoe horn.  Nice length.  My only complaint is with Amazon, who thinks that this was a disposable purchase, and keeps trying to get me to subscribe to have them delivered.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually meet my needs, but as one reviewer noted it&#x27;s nice to own the very best even if it is just a shoehorn.</li>
    <li> great quality--just could use a slightly larger finger hole.  I would buy this again, especially if it came with a longer handle.  the again process is not my friend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a few years and use it every day.  It&#x27;s quite sturdy and very handy.  If I ever lost mine, I&#x27;d certainly buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> very fancy and nice to look at.  It&#x27;s heavy and thick for a shoe horn.  Very decretive.  Lost a star because how think it is, making it difficult to use it with tight shoes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shiny! Very very shiny, which makes it easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty short so it makes it easy to lose underneath other stuff if you don&#x27;t hang it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just as heavy and then some as you might expect from such a sturdy item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No moving parts and solid constructions means this will outlast you!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and works great!</li>
    <li> OCD researchers look no further.  As someone who wastes hours researching even the most mundane purchase, let me tell you this is the one you want.  Its shape is a little different than the standard shoe horn, but it provides for a better, more natural grip.  This thing is SOLID metal with just the right amount of heft to make it feel like it&#x27;s real quality.  The edges are all smooth.  The silver plating gives it a great, luxurious shine.  I take special care in the choosing of my accessories, and this exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> A bit pricier than the other shoe horns, but great.  I received it and it is massive (as in dense - heavy for its size).  Just holding I realize this is a sturdy product and that it should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised when I received this shoe horn at how sturdy and beautiful it is.  I never thought a shoe horn could be beautiful.  When I saw that they could be engraved, I initially thought, who would engrave a shoe horn.  And then I saw it.  I really like shoes without backs.  But I recently bought some shoes with backs and needed a shoe horn so that I didn&#x27;t bend the shoe everytime I tried to get into them.  This shoe horn did the trick and it is so strong that I never have to worry about breaking it or breaking the backs of the shoes.  Exactly what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money.  If you&#x27;re waivering, don&#x27;t wonder anymore.  Spend the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost track of how many plastic shoehorns I&#x27;ve thrown out when they cracked or bent.  This thing is nice and firm with a great profile.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other shoehorns at a similar price that were not nearly as nice as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It has an attractive design. Many other shoehorns are just stamped steel. This one&#x27;s got curves.&lt;br /&gt;* The edges are rounded to avoid damage to shoes and comfort for your feet&lt;br /&gt;* It has a substantial weight. Feels great in the hand (but not suitable for weight-sensitive travel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for myself, but it comes in a nice box for use as a gift. I liked it enough that I bought a second one for the office.</li>
    <li> Form over function. Beautiful, great style, wonderful design, but a bit clumsy, and hangs on its side, which is daft.</li>
    <li> I did not want to spend too much on a shoe horn for my fiances new leather shoes, so when I found this, I figured it was great, and it is! Its shiny and works really well.</li>
    <li> Nice looking shoe horn. It is slightly thicker than what I&#x27;m used to but this is one shoe horn you&#x27;ll have for life!</li>
    <li> Yes i read reviews and saw many people so excited about this shoe horn so decided to buy it - literally this is one of the best thing i purchased. it is so awesome - doesn&#x27;t bend, easy to hold, shape is fantastic and it is so sturdy i can&#x27;t imagine what i would need to do to break it, probably nothing. my old metal shoe horn as stupid - it was bending all the time, plastic ones break every time this thing made to last you lifetime. worth every penny, if i saw it in a store in person i probably would not hesitate to pay twice as much</li>
    <li> just buy it. very good, quality item. Looks good.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a high quality shiny silver or silver plated shoe horn similar to the shoe horn used for customers at Salvatorre Ferragamo Boutique Store. The shoe horn for sale at Salvatore Ferragamo is $150 and is not as nice looking as the one they use for their customer.  I was initially apprehensive about the quality of this shoe horn since the box says Made in China. Surprise, surprise. Just like iPhones which are handsomely Made in China, this product looks and feel expensive. It is solid, heavy and it is beautiful!! My feet glides easily inside my Salvatore Ferragamo shoes. I very highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful shoe horn and I had it engraved with my husband&#x27;s monogram.  The engraving turned out beautifully too.  The only complaint I have is that the inside of the finger hole was chipped when it arrived.  I didn&#x27;t have enough time before Christmas to exchange it, so I decided it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal, especially for the price.  My husband lost his beloved shoe horn so he&#x27;s very happy to have this nice new one!</li>
    <li> High quality material, sturdy, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see how someone with big hands might not be able to use the ring at the end to pull the shoehorn out after putting on their shoe.  I tied a little decorative string on the ring so that I can use that to pull, and also hang it while not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.  very happy.</li>
    <li> this was a good purchase for me.  surprisingly heavy. seems solidly made. the little finger hole is big enough for my pinky up to the first joint, the other fingers not so much - not a big deal. what else can you say?  it&#x27;s a shoehorn. on the other hand, if you&#x27;ve been using a serving spoon as a shoehorn this is several steps up from that and you&#x27;ll revel in the luxury. much more so if you&#x27;ve been using your finger.</li>
    <li> Solid. not fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of the plastic ones breaking every so often. You have to squat or sit to use this one which makes it not as user friendly but definitely long lasting!</li>
    <li> This is a very well made tool.  Hard to find something like this today. Highly recommended. Very comfortable and durable.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was a little pricey, but after breaking 5 plastic shoe horns I thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;Very heavy, looks great....worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this Shoe horn. Timeless design and great quality. Im quite sure that it will keep for a very long time</li>
    <li> This shoe horn is the best ergonomic design and works like a charm</li>
    <li> This shoe horn is very well made and thick. not a thin piece of metal like some of the others, this one will not bend..&lt;br /&gt;as some have stated about the small finger hole being too small, it is if you are trying to put any finger but your pinkie finger in it..&lt;br /&gt;if you grasp it correctly you will be holding the thin shaft and your pinkie will fit in it to help hold, although you really do not need to use the hole. I think where the problem lies with one&#x27;s who complained, they try to use their index or fore finger to hold it to try and get a bit more length in holding it. which one might do if they have back problems or have a bit difficulty in bending over to use it to put on shoes.. although it is a bit expensive it is well made and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Solid, beautiful and well built.  It&#x27;s a shoe horn, so there&#x27;s not much to say.  The plating is well done and the finish is extremely smooth/polished.  Plan to use this for a long time.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s been having trouble bending over to put on his shoes and so I got him this for Christmas. He loves it and said it makes putting them on really easy! No more back pain.</li>
    <li> I still use this many years later, and it hasn&#x27;t lost its shine. You&#x27;re not alive until you have a shoe horn like this.</li>
    <li> Classy and efficient. It is really well made.</li>
    <li> Really nice if you don&#x27;t mind overpaying for a shoe horn.</li>
    <li> Plastic shoe horns are not for the long haul.  This one is made of metal and will last a very long time.  Very pleased with it.  Large as well, so its easy to hold.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a fine product Long enough for those who cannot bend over&lt;br /&gt;very long and a Highly Polished finish makes this Shoe Horn a&lt;br /&gt;a very good travel companion. The weight is hefty and it&#x27;s not easily&lt;br /&gt;lost in your luggage. A great addition to your shoe wardrobe.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a durable shoehorn, and this one does the job. Had it for a year or two now and even after some rough use and several drops, it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> This is a solid, well-made shoe horn and for you it may be perfect. For me it was a little on the heavy side and I actually prefer to use a cheap plastic shoe horn. I actually think it deserves 3 stars from me for my particular needs, but it&#x27;s easily a 5-star shoe horn to many other people, so I didn&#x27;t want to down-rate it too far. I gave it a 4.</li>
    <li> This is a work of art as well as a well made tool.  Thank God for reviews and research.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Someone said the hole is too small.  But they are mistaken.  The hole is not for the finger, it is for hanging the tool up, if you so choose.  The back part is the handle and the grip is perfect.  I highly recommend this shoe horn.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.  These shoehorns are the best.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll never buy another shoe horn. Get it. Great quality! Your shoes will love it. Can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
    <li> My last cheap plastic show horn snapped and I wanted a proper one that lasts a lifetime. This piece definitely qualifies with it&#x27;s heft. The blade is bordering on too thick but the good smooth finish makes it work.</li>
    <li> Great deal, excellent product, valued Seller, highly recommended A++</li>
    <li> This would be a five star review, but the silver plating is coming off almost immediately after arriving.</li>
    <li> Best shoe horn money can buy.</li>
    <li> It is definitely heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I was primarily looking for durability and it seems like it will be extremely durable.  It also has a smooth feel that allows your foot to slide right into the shoe.  I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It is more like crone plated. It would be more functional if it were 3in longer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an OK investment good quality just not long enough.</li>
    <li> I have been cramming my feet into my shoes for over a decade without realizing the damage I was doing to my shoes. Too often would I spend more time trying to get my heel into my shoes than I did tying them. I decided I was going to invest some money into a shoe horn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and eventually came to this particular shoe horn. I read many reviews on plastic ones, and came to the conclusion that they would not be sturdy enough to last me long enough. I also looked into cheaper metal ones, but what I found were more negative reviews about the thin ones bending out of shape. After finding this one and reading through the reviews I made the choice top purchase one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival I was mostly stunned by the elegant look to this. It&#x27;s a very polished silver look that certainly makes it look fancier than it is. It has a great weight to it and I don&#x27;t feel like I will have any issues with it bending out of shape in the future. My only complaint would be the hole at the end, it is extremely small and I am unable to get a finger in there, and my finders are fairly small. I don&#x27;t know if this is not its intended purpose, maybe it is meant to have a string of some sort roped through and used for hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way I love it and it has become a daily essential for putting on shoes.</li>
    <li> I have DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy) so I have difficulty handling things, however, after a little practice I was able to use the shoe horn easily.</li>
    <li> I use shoe horns five days a week when I dress for work.  This is probably the last one I&#x27;ll have to buy.  Up to now, I had been using plastic Kiwi shoe horns, but they tend to break into shards after a while.  Instead of shelling out $7 for another plastic one, I decided to spend a little extra to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is extremely well made and looks great.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and is much thicker than I thought it would be.  You&#x27;re just not going to bend this thing without applying tons of pressure.  It&#x27;s also just the right size for my medium-width dress shoes (size 10).  My only complaint is that the inner surface of the hole used to remove the horn wasn&#x27;t smooth.  I don&#x27;t really use the hole, but I was surprised that the metal was as rough as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.  It&#x27;s worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but once received, I feel it was totally worth it. I will buy another one and recommend.</li>
    <li> This shoe horn is durable, classy, and comfortable.  The moment I hold it, I can feel its quality in its weight.  Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Feels good, good heft to it.  The ring is small but fits on the hook in the closet easily enough - another reviewer thought this was a place for the finger but I just grasp the handle and use the ring for hanging the device.  Very snazzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a shoe horn, and wanted something nicer than a cheap plastic one. Works great, feels smoother, and I like the more substantial weight. Totally worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I kept breaking my shoe horns until I got this one.  I think it is well made, attractive and worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shoe horn that is solid and does its job. What more could you ask for in a shoe horn?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and works nicely.  Hubby likes it. It feels very substantial. Definitely something you can give as a gift.</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  It has a great weight to it, is beautiful to look at, and works perfectly.  It&#x27;s not a travel shoe horn (way to heavy) but one to have around the house or to give as a gift.  I was surprised at how nice it is and am very happy.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i got these for my dad he is 82 he love them they fit great and the prices were also great we got them with in 12 hours after i order them if i ever need anything ill always check here first thank you</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting a good shoe horn for a long time, finally found the perfect one!! He loves the way it feels, says his foot slips in his shoes so easy, it&#x27;s a great size and will pack in his suitcase great, he couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and loved the two day  free shipping.</li>
    <li> Nice piece of personal hardware. I&#x27;ve also sent one to a friend as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is the best shoe horn that I have ever seen and used. You will love it just like me</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  It&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t bend.  It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to pack as well.</li>
    <li> I gave this shoe horn to my friend for Christmas. He loved it. I almost didn&#x27;t want to give it to him when I received it in the mail and opened it up myself. Very, very nice shoe horn. Wow! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good solid horseshoe. At first I thought it was rather thick; but after using it, I see it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> It is quite heavy and thick...And it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful shoe horn. The picture does not do it&lt;br /&gt;justice.The Kingsley shoe horn feels good in the hand&lt;br /&gt;and I feel will serve me well in the future.</li>
    <li> A fine way to start your day. Feels great in the hand, eases shoes on foot.&lt;br /&gt;Looks expensive, and works fantastic</li>
    <li> Wow!! This thing is beautiful. Amazing materials and finish. It is a work of art. It makes putting on shoes a pleasure! I bought it for dress shoes, but I&#x27;ve even been using it with athletic shoes because of how well it works. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shoe horn for ages now.  My dad used to have this metal shoe horn but it has since been misplaced.  A quick search on Amazon and BAM Kingsley Shoe Horn in to save the day.  It had a much higher price tag than the other &amp;#34;3-foot plastic shoe horns&amp;#34; that were being suggested to me.  I&#x27;m in my early 20s so I figured, I can still crouch down and use a small shoe horn.  I purchased this and when it arrived, I was very surprised!  This thing definitely has some weight to it.  A well balanced, solid metal shoe horn is what I was looking for and this thing delivered!  I feel like I can fend off shoe bandits if they ever come to steal my shoes while I am fitting them on! Again a bit pricy, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> There are really only two things one could want out of a shoe horn: looks and durability.  This product readily fulfills both of these requirements.  This item is sturdy, well formed and of admirable heft.  I can&#x27;t imagine it warping, bending or breaking.  Moreover, it is very nice looking.  Short of real horn this silver plated shoe horn is about the best looking one I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I even get complimented on it believe it or not!</li>
    <li> A nice, affordable luxury – as other reviewers have pointed out.  This shoe horn is pleasing to look at -- it is a nice example of well done industrial design. It has a nice feel in the hand.  Because it is substantially heavier and more solid than the typical shoehorn, it is a better, smoother and more comfortable performer than the typical shoehorn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the largest or most expensive thing I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, but it&#x27;s one of my favorites. This shoe horn from Kingsley is a good size, has great weight and the silver plating is really good for a item in this price range. I use this shoe horn every morning and I haven&#x27;t really found a better functioning one since I purchased this Kingsley (I also keep a Allen Edmonds shoe horn at the office).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt the Kingsley shoe horn is going to be a &amp;#34;buy it for life&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> This shoe horn is great. It is very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Lovely piece of craftsmanship.  Very pleasing to behold, the way that it gleams and shines.  It makes me feel like Gollum (Hobbit), \\&quot;Ooh, my little precious.\\&quot;  Made it a pleasure to put my shoes on to go to work each morning.  Until one morning, it was gone!  Turns out that my son was playing with it the day before and left it on the trunk of my wife&#x27;s car.  So, it hitched a ride with her to work that day.  And somewhere along the way, it hopped off.  I can just imagine the pleasure of whoever found it.  \\&quot;Wow! Look at that shiny thing!\\&quot;  I hope that person enjoys it as much as I did.  *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  BTW, I missed it so much that I bought another one!  Now, I&#x27;m a happy camper again when putting on my shoes in the morning.  :)</li>
    <li> I have a brace on my right foot and always struggle to get my shoes on. This had ended that problem forever. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it. It is a thing of beauty too, silvery and slick it is a pretty thing.</li>
    <li> Best shoe horn I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a couple pairs of nice shoes for work and other fancy pants occasions.  I wanted to purchase a shoe horn to prevent wear and tear on the shoes heel when putting these new guys on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually did some homework when shopping for (what would seem like a no-brainer purchase of a) shoe horn.  There were several reviews of other shoe horns that claimed the tool to be very wide or to have sharp edges, both of which would damage the shoe as opposed to protecting it.  I made sure to avoid those guys and went with this one.  So happy I did.  This guy is the perfect size for almost every adult male size foot (I wear size 11).  The edges are rounded off very nicely.  And it has a beautiful silver plated finish.  Solid and sturdy.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good weight and high quality material a bit bigger than traditional shoe horns but the lip will do its job.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it. Uses everyday.</li>
    <li> I would be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t have to talk myself into shelling out $15 for a shoehorn. But I was tired of throwing cash at the cheap plastic ones that always break. Two years later this is still going strong, and I can&#x27;t help feeling like a millionaire each time I use it. Beauty, function, and quality materials make this product a must have. Quite honestly, after having used this, I would pay double what the seller is asking. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as well as http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GT633M/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.  The Kingsley shoe horn is definitely a good looking hefty/strong shoe horn.  However, there are some things I don&#x27;t like about it and hence would not recommend it (I am planning to get rid of mine):&lt;br /&gt;1. The &amp;#34;tongue&amp;#34; (not sure if this is how you describe this) on the Kingsley shoe horn isn&#x27;t as wide as I would prefer and hence takes a little more effort to get into shoes.  It is still usable though and will work, but is not as good imo when compared to the other Four Seasons other one I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Kingsley shoe horn is relatively heavy.  This makes traveling with it more difficult.  The Four Seasons shoe horn is much lighter and hence easier to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The Kingsley is also a little thicker.  On its own, its not a problem, but the Four Seasons shoe horn I purchased is thinner and hence I find it easier to get into laceless shoes than the Kingsley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Kingsley is a good looking shoe horn and would look great if presented as a gift, but I have personally chosen the Four Seasons over the Kingsley for my use since it is much more functional for me.</li>
    <li> we love it,its the best i&#x27;ve ever had. shoes go on in a minute. i have thrown away all the others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months and it&#x27;s fantastic. Probably won&#x27;t have to buy another shoe horn ever again, which is nice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, shiny silver, beautiful in appearance, even easy to find in the early morning because it&#x27;s nicely visible. It has a nice heft and it&#x27;s really convenient in action. I can grab it and squeeze into a pair of shoes in a second.</li>
    <li> I love this shoe horn. It has a great weight to it and feels like it&#x27;ll be around for generations. the plating looks nice and thick. I like it so much I bought another so that I have one for home and one for the gym.</li>
    <li> perfect and long and strong for protecting your shoes ... strong and good looking&lt;br /&gt;item right on time and packaged well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as beautiful as everyone else has said.  A little extravagant but hey, you only live once.  And as much money as I spend on shoes it&#x27;s only right to have something nice to help get them on my feet.  I bought this specifically for ankle boots and it does the trick very well.  Better than using a kitchen spoon which is what I resorted to in the past!  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to do that again.....</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on shoehorns, especially metal ones, that just crumple when I put on my shoes.  I leave my shoes tied, so it&#x27;s always a tight squeeze with a lot of pressure on the shoe horn.  So far, this is the ONLY shoe horn I&#x27;ve bought that does not bend.  It is very thick and solid, and will not bend.  This product is expensive (my wife almost passed out when I told her I paid $22 for a shoe horn), but it is totally worth it.  You&#x27;re going to waste money buying multiple shoe horns so why not do it right the first time.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good quality, works perfect</li>
    <li> I recomend this item is good and the seller</li>
    <li> great product. works great looks great !</li>
    <li> A solid, well made, well proportioned and good looking shoe horn. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Its nice and well built, just a little thick for my taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this shoe horn because it was rated 5 star by the other reviewers.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now, and can say it feels great to hold and to use to put on my work shoes.  Since I plan to using this for a long time, I found it to be good value for money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice, sturdy shoe horn for quite a while.  The Kingsley was a great find and a great value.</li>
