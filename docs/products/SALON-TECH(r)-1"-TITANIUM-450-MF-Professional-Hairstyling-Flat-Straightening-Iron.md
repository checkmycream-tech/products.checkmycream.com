      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>These irons have been used in a salon setting, operated at 450 degrees and used for straighteners which they are advertised as being very good for.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to it in a salon and had incredible results.</li>
      <li>bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, high-end iron, buy this one!</li>
      <li>This straightener was great, for about six months.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find it in Amazon.</li>
      <li>My stylist sells it for $150 so this was a great deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon was great about the return</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>

      <li>Great iron--definitely better than my T3--it doesn&#x27;t snag on hair like my T3 sometimes did, the plates glide through your hair very smoothly, and you truly need one pass to straighten your hair.</li>

      <li>One of the best things about this flat iron is that it heats up very quickly!</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this straightener....</li>
      <li>Love, love love this.  </li>
      <li>would have been more accomidating.  </li>
      <li>I had a lot of compliments, more than I&#x27;ve ever had with the Chi.</li>
      <li>I definitely love it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many and have had no luck.</li>
      <li>So out of the box, it is compact, and has a swivel cord which I love.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s lovely</li>
      <li>However when I have tried this hot iron along with my serum and heat protectant as well, my hair was more bouncy, full, and it looked beautiful :)</li>
      <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>Best flat iron on the market!</li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron!</li>
      <li>I brought the Salon Tech since I read so many great reviews and the Silicone version (which, according to Salon Tech&#x27;s website, is more recommended for finer hair while the Titanium Pro is supposed to be better for thicker hair) was recommended by Allure, and I must say, it&#x27;s definitely not overhyped.</li>
      <li>Worked great while it lasted but completely stopped working after 6 months.</li>
      <li>I have extremely think hair &amp; it works great!!</li>
      <li>and it adjusts to your hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to handle, lots of heat settings, and feels sturdy.</li>
      <li>It works amazing &amp; is shown exactly in the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, it&#x27;s amazing, and looks cool all in one.</li>
      <li>so I am fine with what I paid.</li>
      <li>The power turns on in 20 seconds( so quickly!)</li>
      <li>The top gets very hot and you almost always burn yourself.</li>
      <li>the light would stop flashing.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a light weight</li>
      <li>I have used many different straightening irons over the years, and this is by far the best one I have had.  </li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s straight as a pin!!!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great flat iron that will do all the work for you then get this one.</li>
      <li>it is not heavy so easy to use, love it:-)</li>
      <li>SO many passes over each section of hair to get it perfectly straight as it does when I go over my hair practically ONCE with this!</li>
      <li>Tried a Hot Tools, and conair and was still thinking that my stylist had a much better result.  </li>
      <li>I thought my old one was great but not so much after trying this one.</li>
      <li>It was super easy the very first time I used it</li>
      <li>If you want a good straightener for 6 months then this could be it, but if you want something that will last longer this isnt it.</li>
      <li>I wanted a really good flat iron but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.</li>
      <li>Have had a Salon Tech flat iron for years and loved it.</li>
      <li>Have had many professional flat irons over the years this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I got this particular model.</li>
      <li>Also, a warranty return should be an exceptional event and not a regular occurrence.</li>
      <li>The iron seldom takes more than one pass through each section of hair, even with the most coarse and curly hair.</li>
      <li>Fast to get heated and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Because the light flashes the whole time, thought once it would reach the temp</li>
      <li>Seriously it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
      <li>totally worth the $$.  </li>
      <li>Heats up super fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed on how this iron board works well, heats very fast, don&#x27;t leave the hair looking dry, make hair shine, I have curly hair, sometimes takes me about 2 hrs to hair dry and iron, but with Salon Tech I used as soon a</li>
      <li>This iron really straightens my hair quickly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>In general I would say that these products have some great potential and for some they may work very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the iron a couple of times but seems to be doing the job, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning my hair, love the size</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a temperature setting from 200-400 and it heats up SO fast!</li>

      <li>My favorite  flat iron!!!!.</li>
      <li>have given the product 2 stars because these irons are not complete junk (as so many others are) and are in fact very well made.</li>
      <li>I like the feature of the on/off switch and that when the iron is ready it has a blue light.  </li>
      <li>This Hair-styling Iron works really well.</li>
      <li>I have EVER spent. :)</li>
      <li>and straight my hair very well and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair never got totally straight.</li>
      <li>but really, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I used it on my hair even though it was really curly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use (this is my first flat iron ever) and it takes only seconds to straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>(in part because the replacement iron carries the same warranty except that it begins at the original purchase date</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this straightener for REAL.</li>

    <li> This is by far the BEST hair straiaghtner there is! I have had my share and this one is the BEST! Spend the money - you wont be sorry</li>
    <li> After a trip to the salon, I was inspired to purchase a flat iron.  I went out and bought a $200 FHI and tired it.  My hair never got totally straight. It was still frizzy looking. So I returned it.  Tried a CHI, wasn&#x27;t so impressed. Tried a Hot Tools, and conair and was still thinking that my stylist had a much better result.  After a call to the salon I learned that this is the flat iron she uses.  I bought it and immediately washed my hair so I could straighten it.  I was amazed!! I have hair past my shoulders, it&#x27;s thick, and really curly.  After my hair was dry, it literally took 10 minutes to completely straighten my hair! I added a few curls with the flat iron and was completely finished with my hair, from out of the shower to out the door, in 30 minutes! It was a rainy day out so I was expecting to end up with frizzy bushy hair but it stayed all day! The only thing that happened was that the curls relaxed and I had that phenomenon I&#x27;ve dreamed of, flat hair!  On a rainy day no less! Best flat iron on the market!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a month and it works great. I purchased it based on my hair stylist recommendation and it exceeded the expectations so far. I thought my old one was great but not so much after trying this one. I have very thick coarse wavy hair and this iron leaves it shinny and Straight in about 15 minutes. I hope it lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> This Hair-styling Iron works really well. I have very curly hair and usually have to go over each bunch more than once. The Salon Tech does the job effortlessly!</li>
    <li> OH MY GOD! This has to be the best straightener I have ever come into contact with! I have used for years the $20 Revlon straightener you buy at Walmart and it would take me SO many passes over each section of hair to get it perfectly straight as it does when I go over my hair practically ONCE with this! I have to the middle of my back long hair that is EXTREMELY curly. I&#x27;m talking I wash it I wake up and it&#x27;s like Felicity all over the place. The minute I got home I used it on my hair even though it was really curly. I didn&#x27;t even use a brush to brush out the curls it smoothed them on it&#x27;s own. I HIGHLY recommend this straightener for REAL. Best $118 I have EVER spent. :)</li>
    <li> The best flatiron. I have extremely think hair &amp; it works great!!</li>
    <li> I have finally found THE most phenomenal flat iron in the world!!!!!!! I have tried many, many, irons and this one takes the gold! I have thick and curly hair but after using this iron, I look like I just had a la braziliana KERATIN treatment all over again!!!!!! I&#x27;m going to buy another one so that my daughter can have her own.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast! Works great! My hairdresser recommended this to me! Well worth the $$$. Amazon cheapest place to purchase!</li>
    <li> Have had many professional flat irons over the years this one is by far the best. I was introduced to it in a salon and had incredible results. I was happy to find it in Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite  flat iron!!!!.</li>
    <li> My hair is chemically treated, thick, and usually hard to manage. This iron really straightens my hair quickly and painlessly. The only thing I notice is that it is missing a little bit of the shine and luster that I usually have after using a ceramic plated flat iron. Other than that, this iron serves me well! Easy to handle, lots of heat settings, and feels sturdy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist for about 13 years.  I have used many different straightening irons over the years, and this is by far the best one I have had.  I&#x27;m on my second one, only because I loaned my first one to a co-worker and the cord got damaged.  The iron seldom takes more than one pass through each section of hair, even with the most coarse and curly hair.</li>
    <li> My T3 flat iron broke about a month ago so I went back to using my old hair iron and my hair felt like straw after awhile. I brought the Salon Tech since I read so many great reviews and the Silicone version (which, according to Salon Tech&#x27;s website, is more recommended for finer hair while the Titanium Pro is supposed to be better for thicker hair) was recommended by Allure, and I must say, it&#x27;s definitely not overhyped. Great iron--definitely better than my T3--it doesn&#x27;t snag on hair like my T3 sometimes did, the plates glide through your hair very smoothly, and you truly need one pass to straighten your hair. I&#x27;m one of the few Asians with wavy hair (not in a good way at all), and my hair&#x27;s really thick and coarse. This iron also literally heated up to 400 degrees in less than 20 seconds, and left my hair much glossier than any other straightener did, and I didn&#x27;t put any styling creams in my hair today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, high-end iron, buy this one!</li>
    <li> Fast to get heated and easy to use. Very nice product and i highly recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed on how this iron board works well, heats very fast, don&#x27;t leave the hair looking dry, make hair shine, I have curly hair, sometimes takes me about 2 hrs to hair dry and iron, but with Salon Tech I used as soon a i got it, no hair dry first and took me about 30 minuts to be completely done, looking ready to go</li>
    <li> As someone who has used both the Titanium and Silicone 450 flat irons from Salon Tech, I will contribute the following observation and warning to people considering these irons. In general I would say that these products have some great potential and for some they may work very well. However, they also have an extreme failure rate when used in a professional setting at the highest temperature (possibly in other settings as well). In fact the failure rate is virtually 100% within 6 months of operation with some failing in as little as 2 months. These irons have been used in a salon setting, operated at 450 degrees and used for straighteners which they are advertised as being very good for. If you are using the iron for personal use and/or operating it at lower temperatures then your mileage may vary but it&#x27;s very questionable whether these irons are truly suitable for professional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given the product 2 stars because these irons are not complete junk (as so many others are) and are in fact very well made. But the failure rate is simply unacceptable to someone who needs to rely on an iron and it makes me very leery about ever purchasing or recommending another one until I see some strong indication from Salon Tech that they have addressed this problem. The warranty on these irons is 1 year and in the past I have simply written them off and not bothered (in part because the replacement iron carries the same warranty except that it begins at the original purchase date so when it fails it&#x27;ll pretty much be guaranteed to be out of warranty). Also, a warranty return should be an exceptional event and not a regular occurrence. At the moment I have decided to try the warranty return on a Silicone 450 that failed within 2 months so I&#x27;ll probably update this review with my warranty experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you are a person who needs a reliable iron then you should be cautious about putting too much faith in this product until the failure rate issue is addressed. If you are planning to use this iron occasionally in a personal setting then it&#x27;s possible that it will suit your needs but my experiences are related to professional use so I can&#x27;t truly address that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the iron a couple of times but seems to be doing the job, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning my hair, love the size and it&#x27;s a light weight, the only thing is I&#x27;m not sure when the iron has reached the temp? Because the light flashes the whole time, thought once it would reach the temp the light would stop flashing.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned. I only need to pass it through my hair once. The only down: it does not work well with converters so I cannot use it when I travel abroad. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years without incident and just bought new ones as gifts for family</li>
    <li> I bought this on March 25 and it is already not working.  That&#x27;s less than 2 months!  It won&#x27;t heat up at all which is unacceptable for a $100 flatiron.  Of course, I tossed the box and don&#x27;t have any warranty information.</li>
    <li> Love, love love this.  Where has this been all my life???  It&#x27;s the only flat iron that straightens without having to go over and over a section of hair. One sweep and it&#x27;s straight as a pin!!!</li>
    <li> the salon tech pfip100 , flat iron is hot, fast and very easy to use .heats up fast,would reccomend this product</li>
    <li> Have had a Salon Tech flat iron for years and loved it. Went to buy a replacement and it never worked. Tried 4 times. The last time tried a &amp;#34;different supplier&amp;#34; but i believe they were the same with a different name.  All 4 would turned on, over heated, then blinked double red after 5 minutes and never heated up again.  All four did the same thing. Amazon was good about providing free returns and money back right away but the supplier had to be sending a bad batch or fake ones.  I ended up getting the salon tech flat iron from Folica and have not had an issue since.  Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this straightener....when it works. I have gone through 2 in a little over a year. I bought one through my salon and when that one died, went through the company to get a new one. This one didn&#x27;t even last as long as the first one. I won&#x27;t even bother contacting the company and I will not be using them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many flat irons such as FHI heat and herstyler,  I am  hoping this is the last test run... so far so good.</li>
    <li> Bought this iron from 2 different sellers ($89.00 /$150.00) and both times had to return because it didn&#x27;t work as expected . I&#x27;ve used someone else&#x27;s salon tech and it worked wonders on my frizzy, unmanageable hair . So I decided to per chase my own and was completely disappointed .</li>
    <li> I generally do not post reviews but I am so disappointed with this purchase. I did a lot of research and thought it might be too good to be true at this price point and I ended up having a similar experience to another on this thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my iron and it worked for a day then just stopped heating up. When looking closely at the product dial and picture on the box and salon tech website the words \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; are missing which makes me wonder if the product is even legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was great about the return and I plan to send to item back and purchase at a beauty salon or folica instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron! I have tried so many and have had no luck. I have thin hair but it&#x27;s super curly in the back and really hard to control. I always had a wave in the back with other flat irons. This flat iron gets it straight with two passes and I mean straight. There&#x27;s a temperature setting from 200-400 and it heats up SO fast! They weren&#x27;t kidding! Seriously it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Well, I am not new to the flat iron scene..I have owed Chi,Babyliss,Sedu and decided to try this out.  My Babyliss after two years was not heating up properly and was not giving me the same performance.  So out of the box, it is compact, and has a swivel cord which I love.  I like the feature of the on/off switch and that when the iron is ready it has a blue light.  It heats up literally in seconds, which is a plus!  I have medium semi-thick hair, a few inches past my shoulders, and with that said I kind of feel that the iron is a little to short.  The iron is great and leaves my hair cuticle sealed and shiny.  I guess for the amount of hair I have the next size up would have been more accomidating.  Overall I do like the performance of this iron, and will keep it, but when ironing I will probably just need to take smaller sections of hair.  Oh, and I can get the job done in under 15 min.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The BEST flatirons I&#x27;ve ever had! Makes my keratin treated hair sleek and bouncy!</li>
    <li> I got this iron from salon tech distibutors last me for few month I&#x27;m hair dresser my self I wouldn&#x27;t recommended  to no one</li>
    <li> This straightener was great, for about six months. Then it started to seem very cheap! The letters came off, and one morning it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I was disappointed, it was recommended to me by my stylist and now its money in the trash because it barely lasted 6 months, and I take care of my things. If you want a good straightener for 6 months then this could be it, but if you want something that will last longer this isnt it. Side note- If you like curling your hair with a straightener you cant use this product. The top gets very hot and you almost always burn yourself. Not to mention the fact that the chord gets all tangled and you can&#x27;t undo it.. this definitely isnt a multi purpose straightener.</li>
    <li> I typically used curling irons and finally decided to try a flat iron.  This one worked great!</li>
    <li> The wen is so damage what should I do?</li>
    <li> Worked great while it lasted but completely stopped working after 6 months. My roommate and I did forget to turn it off on a couple of occasions though but not for more than a few hrs</li>
    <li> I was afraid to purchase a flat iron this narrow since I have very coarse thick wavy hair but was super-pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  I definitely love it.  I had purchased a few others and returned them so I finally asked my hair stylist for a recommendation.  this is the one she recommended. I was reluctant to pay this price but really, you get what you pay for. totally worth the $$.  it was far from the most expensive still so I am fine with what I paid.</li>
    <li> Ok so i saw that my friend had this flat iron and i decided to use it...omg it&#x27;s lovely it&#x27;s way better than the kor i had purchased inside the mall!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the same flat iron that my stylist uses but I never thought I could afford a professional quality flat iron. I wanted a really good flat iron but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money. After reading reviews on several less expensive ones I decided to get this one. My stylist sells it for $150 so this was a great deal. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and I&#x27;m so glad I got this particular model. It&#x27;s super easy to use (this is my first flat iron ever) and it takes only seconds to straighten my hair. It heats up in less than one minute and it just glides through my hair. I thought it would be hard to to use and it would take some getting used to but I was wrong. It was super easy the very first time I used it and now it&#x27;s even easier. If you&#x27;re looking for a great flat iron that will do all the work for you then get this one.</li>
    <li> I bought one 2 weeks ago . It goes off every few minutes . This was a replacement for one I bought a year ago with exactly the same problem .&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely returning this&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone else have this problem ?</li>
    <li> Completely love this flat iron! It works amazing &amp; is shown exactly in the picture. I recommend everyone purchase this iron.</li>
    <li> I was recommended it by my hair stylist. The power turns on in 20 seconds( so quickly!) and straight my hair very well and shiny. Not only to make hair straight, you can use it to curl your hair( you have to practice) It is powerful so after you take your hair, you should slide it quickly not keep holding otherwise your hair will get a line Mark.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is not heavy so easy to use, love it:-)</li>
    <li> Good good my girl love it</li>
    <li> One of the best things about this flat iron is that it heats up very quickly! So if you have somewhere to go, it&#x27;ll heat up in seconds. You can manage how high you want the heat and it adjusts to your hair very quickly. My hair is thick naturally but when straightened it is so thin. However when I have tried this hot iron along with my serum and heat protectant as well, my hair was more bouncy, full, and it looked beautiful :) I had a lot of compliments, more than I&#x27;ve ever had with the Chi. The thing about titanium plates that I&#x27;ve learned from this youtube guru is that it produces negative ions which neutralizes damaged hair, the negative ion, and that&#x27;s what makes it able to make your hair great. It&#x27;s worth the price, it&#x27;s amazing, and looks cool all in one.</li>
    <li> after a few months it no longer works.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hairdresser dependent upon reliable tools, this is excellent, easy to use and a perfectly balanced tool!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses this when I do my Brazilian Blow Out.  I&#x27;m in need of another treatment so this is a LIFESAVER.  You only need to run through one time.  I am more of a make up gal than a hair stylist, so this is easy!  Still working on trying to curl with this flat iron but I love this one!!</li>
    <li> Good product, delivered on time and as described</li>
