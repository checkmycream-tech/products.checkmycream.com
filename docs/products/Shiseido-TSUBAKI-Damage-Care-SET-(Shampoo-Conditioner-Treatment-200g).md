      <li>Many people just believe the product stops working, trust me it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My hair is getting so much more moistu</li>
      <li>Smells FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten my mom to love it.</li>
      <li>Perfect for damage Asian hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is better than it was before.</li>
      <li>I have frizzy hair that breaks easily and on top of that</li>
      <li>The bottles are a good size and the price is reasonable compared to most.  </li>
      <li>Back at home, I used to use the Aquair, and my hair condition was very good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great improvement from all the various brands I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>my hair become smooth after using this product</li>
      <li>The product was a success!</li>
      <li>After the first time I used this set my hair felt better than ever.</li>
      <li>It came in a nice new unopened box.</li>
      <li>It really helps keep my hair feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>The deep conditioning treatment is very good as well, again not heavy at all!</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my hair, and it smells so pretty!</li>
      <li>The deep conditioner is even better!</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth and straight without using hot iron or styling gel.</li>
      <li>It is soft and has it&#x27;s own natural shine.</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty flowery though, be aware.  </li>
      <li>and the ends are pretty damaged from it.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t run out so fast!</li>
      <li>The second time I used the set, the result were even better.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the set, I just used the conditioner and treatment because I switch off the shampoo with dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>Tsubaki is a great all-natural shampoo/conditioner duo that leaves your hair so soft while not weighing it down.</li>
      <li>First time I used this, I thought it was a miracle, but it turns out a few times later, it&#x27;s not THAT incredible.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ll definitely choose the Aquair line next time; it&#x27;s definitely the one that gives me the best result so far.</li>
      <li>Now, if you aren&#x27;t satisfied or you are using the wrong products for your hair.. you should do research it what is better for your own personal needs.</li>
      <li>The bottle works well and made my hair soft but my hair gets used to products really quickly</li>
      <li>They come in 3 large sized bottles with very convenient pumps to dispense products.</li>
      <li>My hair still frizzes quite a lot, but it&#x27;s a much much tamer frizz.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try the Shiseido series..</li>
      <li>Really like it a lot</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair much healthier and fells nicer.  </li>
      <li>This is very moisturizing and seems gentle on my hair.  </li>
      <li>My routine with this care set is : I rinse my hair and then start with the shampoo with gentle massage.</li>
      <li>Too much hype-</li>
      <li>The package is a little different from what I used to but still with good quality.</li>
      <li>This line made my hair better, and I lose less hair (maybe just because the hair losing season has passed).</li>
      <li>Even I noticed the difference in my hair when I used it, less dryness and more control...</li>
      <li>I love both red Tsubaki and the white.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend trying out this product.</li>
      <li>My hair was so soft and the ends were much smoother.</li>
      <li>Very soft and controlled hair.</li>
      <li>Smooth your hair but not making you feel heavy.</li>
      <li>I have been looking or a gentle non-drying shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and my back.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and its fuzzy</li>
      <li>Not to mention shipping, it was so fast that I couldn&#x27;t believe it was actually the product.</li>
      <li>I love this, usually I bought this in Asian supermarket, but amazon is cheaper than them, I think!</li>
      <li>I chose Pantene when I first got here, and my hair became very dry and started to lose my hair.</li>
      <li>We used to live in Guam and paid $20 for just 1 bottle from the Japanese store.</li>
      <li>so I can really see the difference in how dry and damaged my hair has become.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for natural shampoo&amp;conditioner that actually make your hair soft as well.</li>
      <li>This is the same genuine product for ALOT less!</li>
      <li>Left my hair feeling shiny, soft, detangled, and generally healthier.</li>
      <li>It could very well be that the shiseido formula is developed targeting asian hair, whereas the l&#x27;oreal or any other non asian brands do not.</li>
      <li>I wish they would pull back on the scent just a bit, but other than that, I really like the product.</li>

    <li> Very soft and controlled hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair is better than it was before.</li>
    <li> Well I feel a diff. I have naturally curly hair and its fuzzy this somehow smooths it a bit</li>
    <li> Nice set. Really like it a lot</li>
    <li> Tsubaki is a great all-natural shampoo/conditioner duo that leaves your hair so soft while not weighing it down. The deep conditioning treatment is very good as well, again not heavy at all! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for natural shampoo&amp;conditioner that actually make your hair soft as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried my other brand for my thick, hard hair, until my friend turned this for me. Perfect for damage Asian hair. The smell was extremely good and not that strong either? The conditioner and the treatment mask were must have.</li>
    <li> I have really long and heavy Asian hair that likes to tangle in itself a lot, especially with the humidity of Hawaii. I have taken to coloring my hair, so my hair needs more than the Shining line, and the Damage Care is great. It moisturizes my hair, and it smells so pretty! I&#x27;ve even gotten my mom to love it.</li>
    <li> leaves hair shiny and smelling amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been looking or a gentle non-drying shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and my back.  This is very moisturizing and seems gentle on my hair.  The scent is pretty flowery though, be aware.  I wish they would pull back on the scent just a bit, but other than that, I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I have long asian hair with thick strands that reaches down to my mid back. I used brown box dye a while back and the ends are pretty damaged from it. I moved from a humid-temperate climate to an extremely arid climate so I can really see the difference in how dry and damaged my hair has become. The first time I used the set, I just used the conditioner and treatment because I switch off the shampoo with dandruff shampoo. I could see and feel the results immediately. My hair was so soft and the ends were much smoother. The second time I used the set, the result were even better. I would highly recommend trying out this product.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Tsunami is the best! I have long ethnic hair that is VERY THICK AND VERY DRY!&lt;br /&gt;Tsubaki shampoo and conditioner tames it all the way.  The deep conditioner is even better! Of course I will be buying again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I decided to try Asian brand shampoos to tame the frizziness of my thick WAVY asian hair. First time I used this, I thought it was a miracle, but it turns out a few times later, it&#x27;s not THAT incredible. My hair still frizzes quite a lot, but it&#x27;s a much much tamer frizz. than others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a great improvement from all the various brands I&#x27;ve tried before. However, I&#x27;ll be moving on to trying others once I finish these bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and shipping and everything was great. It came in a nice new unopened box.</li>
    <li> I have been using Red Tsubaki set for a long time (10 years or so) and wanted to try White Tsubaki.  It makes my hair much healthier and fells nicer.  I changes to White Tsubaki from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this, usually I bought this in Asian supermarket, but amazon is cheaper than them, I think!</li>
    <li> Too much hype- ordered it twice hoping time would make a difference but no. Switched to Biologe</li>
    <li> If you are an asian, use shiseido product. I have frizzy hair that breaks easily and on top of that I swim regularly. I&#x27;ve tried almost all hair product from expensive to inexpensive. It could very well be that the shiseido formula is developed targeting asian hair, whereas the l&#x27;oreal or any other non asian brands do not. I am not an expert. But this product is a life saver.</li>
    <li> I am an asian girl with very thick and long hair. Back at home, I used to use the Aquair, and my hair condition was very good. I chose Pantene when I first got here, and my hair became very dry and started to lose my hair. As  result, I decided that I would return to Shiseido. This line made my hair better, and I lose less hair (maybe just because the hair losing season has passed). However, I&#x27;ll definitely choose the Aquair line next time; it&#x27;s definitely the one that gives me the best result so far.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing I love both red Tsubaki and the white.  It really helps keep my hair feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this shampoo. We used to live in Guam and paid $20 for just 1 bottle from the Japanese store. This is the same genuine product for ALOT less! Even I noticed the difference in my hair when I used it, less dryness and more control...</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try the Shiseido series.. I was stuck on which series to try, but then I figured well I use my hair straightener every other day. I blow dry if I&#x27;m in a hurry, which is at least twice a week. So, I decided to try the damage care set, since ironing your hair and drying it out causes a lot of damage to your hair. I use this set as a weekly damage regime, I purchased a co-wash for the in between showers. I haven&#x27;t used or ever felt the need to use it for every shower, so my hair has been perfectly fine with this routine! No idea how my hair would be if I used it for every shower.. Nor do I have the desire to find out. I read from online hair guru&#x27;s that they use it weekly, I simply followed their footsteps and I&#x27;m happy with the outcome! My routine with this care set is : I rinse my hair and then start with the shampoo with gentle massage. I let it stay on for 5 minutes before rinsing. I then use the treatment, which I let sit on my hair for 10-15 mins. I rinse, and then use the conditioner. I let that sit for another 5 mins. When I&#x27;m done I put my hair up with a Turbie Twist, which I also purchased on Amazon. My hair has become healthier! It is soft and has it&#x27;s own natural shine. I get many compliments and sometimes just the envy hair glares! Now, after 2-3 months of use it feels like my hair hasn&#x27;t improved! Why? Many people just believe the product stops working, trust me it doesn&#x27;t. The product was a success! It has helped your hair achieve the results it was suppose to do. Now, if you aren&#x27;t satisfied or you are using the wrong products for your hair.. you should do research it what is better for your own personal needs. Sometimes, the mixture of other products or some products keep damaging your hair. Just remember research, research, research! Everyone&#x27;s body/hair is different and you can&#x27;t expect the same desired results as someone else.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Good product. The package is a little different from what I used to but still with good quality. I will always consider to buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Latina with thick long hair. My hair has been damaged with years of use of heat and poor products. This is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Beats nexus, bed head, and anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I will only use this and never belittle myself by using other things.</li>
    <li> Smells FANTASTIC! The bottle works well and made my hair soft but my hair gets used to products really quickly so I&#x27;ll have to purchase again after a couple months and a few brands later</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling amazing.  I ordered a leave-in separately (different brand) and wish I hadn&#x27;t because after using this, I don&#x27;t need it.  The bottles are a good size and the price is reasonable compared to most.  Not to mention shipping, it was so fast that I couldn&#x27;t believe it was actually the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product !</li>
    <li> My hair is smooth and straight without using hot iron or styling gel. I will buy them again. Please don&#x27;t run out so fast!</li>
    <li> my hair become smooth after using this product</li>
    <li> Quality is poor compared to the ones I bought in Japan. So I have a lot of doubt on this product.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used. I&#x27;m gonna never going back to any other hair products</li>
    <li> Can not live without this shampoo &amp; conditioner set. Smooth your hair but not making you feel heavy. And I especially like the hair mask.they are just great.</li>
    <li> Love them! My hair is getting so much more moistu</li>
    <li> This set of products is amazing. They come in 3 large sized bottles with very convenient pumps to dispense products. After the first time I used this set my hair felt better than ever. Left my hair feeling shiny, soft, detangled, and generally healthier. I don&#x27;t have bad hair days anymore. Oh and I switched to this system from Wen. This outperforms Wen for my hair. I will definitely buy again and recommend this set to anyone!</li>
    <li> Awesome product I used it As soon as it got here and my hair is softer than its ever been.</li>
