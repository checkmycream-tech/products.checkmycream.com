<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My face definitely tightens after I apply the serum prior to moisturising&amp;#62;  Good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  My pores have diminished, skin feels and looks smoother.  This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Amazing is not the word for it as it is like a miracle salve. My wife almost never uses anything on her face, but after many sleepless nights (my two kids were breastfed) she did develop some dark shades under her eyes. She has used it and has glowed ever since. It seems to firm and tighten and smooth all at once and dramatically lessens the darkness under her eyes. She has used it for several weeks now with good results. She did note that it seems to be powerful and has limited it to skin that is thicker (cheeks / forehead) because on most delicate skin it seems to cause redness and she got a pimple. Overall it seems great, will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It is packed with dirty bubble wraps... I was disappointed when i received it. But after i used it the first night. I felt the difference. My skin is smooth.</li>
    <li> Still undecided if this is doing anything yet. Only used it for about a week.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the vitamin C serum. My face feels fresh, refreshed, and rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar products, but this one seems to hit home for me. Always a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ves suffered from acne since I was in middle school, and I&#x27;m now 25 years old. I have scarring and hyperpigmentation which doesn&#x27;t look that great and puts a damper on my confidence. I got this in hopes that it would help repair some of my damaged skin and reduce the hyperpigmentation. It took a while of using this serum, but I have started to see a difference in my complexion, and my hyperpigmentation has improved. It has taken pretty much the whole bottle to see these results, but I am happy with the improvement. I might see more with another bottle and continued use.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest review. This is my opinion after receiving and testing this product myself.</li>
    <li> Irritating, or maybe my skin is too sensitive  My face feels like it&#x27;s on fire whenever I use this product.  Stopped using after a few times.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and was a little skeptical, but truly an incredible serum! I started seeing results in less than a week and was shocked!! Even had some friends notice how radiant and fresh may face was looking. I absolutely love this product and recommend it for anyone. Truly worth the price and love it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I recommend it to all my friends and family. It helped clear up spots on my face caused by acne damaging the skin. And helped my mom with age spots.    It&#x27;s affordable enough for me to buy for family members 5+ stars</li>
    <li> My skin feels and looks so much better! I&#x27;ve been using this day and night for a week. I&#x27;m so relieved my skin is glowing!😘😘😘</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moLIU21VYT01G3]]Hello, I have decided to make a video about this great product. It really does work and I was very excited to post it here for everyone to see!</li>
    <li> For some reason this made me have red rashes on my face when i use it.</li>
    <li> I usually do not leave feed backs however this item was AWFUL!!! dried my skin especially under my eyes where I really needed it. The reveiws I dont understand how anyone could say anything good about this product. It has been over a week and now my skin and eye area are smooth again..I would not recommend this product alt all!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent value and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I was so hoping that I would see even a little change in the fine wrinkles of my facial skin. After using this product for four weeks, I am sorry to say I don&#x27;t see any difference. I do feel that my skin is somewhat smoother than before.  I have been using this product every night before I go to sleep, on clean skin. I will continue to use it for at least 10 weeks and will update this review.</li>
    <li> For several years I had experienced several long bouts of breakouts, dry skin and uneven skin tone. I had tried product after product with no real lasting results. I was recently suffering from another irritating breakout and was desperate for relief. I took a chance and tried the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and was amazed out of my mind! Within a few days, my breakout completely disappeared and I could feel my skin healing itself. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 months and my skin feels softer and has significantly evened out. All my friends and family are stunned by the difference this serum has made to my skin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is desperate like I was to get smooth, glowing, even skin. What a great buy!</li>
    <li> This was the very first facial serum I have ever tried. I have to say I LOVE it! It feels smooth going on and once it dried, your skin feel non-oily and smooth, like right after you scrub a facial mask off. That &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; feeling. I love it! Plus, it smells good! I would buy it again and again*&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a beauty review before, and I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but I have never seen lines minimze like this, quickly and noticeably before, so...53 y.o. with sun damage happier</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo12VVYUDFPUQ9M]]I wanted to make a video review rather than just comments so you could actually see my skin!! Thank you Real Radiant!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a month and do not see any visible difference to my skin. No one has noticed any difference. Disappointed in the product. Just hyaluronic acid may be better</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C serum for the past month and there is a glow to my skin. People have told me my complexion looks good.  For the money, it is a good product that penetrates the skin.  I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have found this.  I live in Hawaii, so i&#x27;m in the sun a lot--pair that with fair skin and i&#x27;m in trouble!  A friend told me that Vitamin C would help with the sun damage, so I searched and decided to try this Serum.  I haven&#x27;t had it long, but already I am noticing a difference in my skin.  I put it on my skin right after washing my face--it absorbs easily and quickly and feels really light!  This has definitely made it into my daily skin care regime.  After seeing reading the reviews other people gave I&#x27;m going to try this on my stretch marks--courtesy my 3 munchkins!  Bikinis here I come!</li>
    <li> But I do use this everyday - I love the way it makes my skin feel and I really do see a difference in the texture of my skin and the firmness, I do love it!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge advocate of natural beauty and maintaining a good skin regimen with natural products…which is one of the reasons I bought this product. It&#x27;s very difficult for me to get that one perfect product that not only hydrates my skin, but also treats wrinkles. I felt in love with this serum on my very first application. The vitaminc c with the hyaluronic acid keeps my flaky dry skin hydrated throughout the day… it also sets my foundation, so I don&#x27;t have to reapply it. I&#x27;ve seen a great difference on my complexion and pigmentation. My skin is looking radiant and smooth. I&#x27;m in love :)))</li>
    <li> This product can really take 10 years off your life. I had issues with discoloration and fine lines on my skin. This vitamin C Serum really help repair the UV damages in my skin. It took about 8 to 10 weeks but after awhile you will reap a maximum benefit. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who is into skincare and taking care of my skin so I&#x27;ll always have healthy skin so trying new skincare products is something I like to do. Before I use this Vitamin C Serum I gently wash my face and neck then I use my Clarisonic&#x27;s cleansing brush to cleanse my skin. Cleansing my skin first makes for absorbing the Vitamin C Serum more effective. I apply the serum with my fingers then massage it into my skin. I like the applicator on this serum because it makes me not waste any product. I wait 3 to 5 minutes then I apply my moisturizer that contains sunscreen. After applying the serum my skin feels softer, looks more radiant and the serum has a lot of benefits to help my skin.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3GZ26LAJS59MW]]Just about anything I want to say is said in the video. I use this product 1-2 times a day, followed by my moisturizer. It appears to help for dark circles under the eyes, a problem I oftentimes have! A few drops go a long way. I usually place three to four drops on my face at specific areas and distribute evenly. Quite happy with this product!</li>
    <li> OMG great product. Living in an arid climate at winter has been taking its toll on my skin. Not even my moisturizer was helping. Somehow this serum made my skin feel softer and more moisturized.... my skin is actually glowing ! ! ! !  I&#x27;d pay $100+ for this product if I had to!</li>
    <li> The serum is excellent, however, to see results you must use microneedles to open the pores and allow the product to penetrate.</li>
    <li> This worked very good on me.They say that my skin glows, but it takes little more time for that so have to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! It&#x27;s super silky feeling, and it makes my skin feel really good. Its moisturizing and gives my skin a nice glow, without making it look oily. I like using it especially because I&#x27;ve been tanning, and it helps reduce sun damage. I recommend this :)</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical about trying a product offline. I&#x27;m typically the kind of person that stands in the store and reads every ingredient on every product they have to offer. But after obviously trying everything (L&#x27;Oreal, Olay, Aveeno, Ambi, I could go on and on), it was time to explore other options. A friend (who might I add is always flawless) told me about this serum and I had to try it for myself. I&#x27;ve been lucky to outgrow the days of constant acne, but my face has been left with dark spots and blemishes from the outbreaks. I also am forever trying something to minimize my pores and make my skin more toned. After only my very first night using the serum I noticed a dramatic difference. The next day my face was so soft to touch, my pores were less visible and I could already see some fading in the dark spots. I only regret not using it sooner, and not purchasing more than one bottle. Thankful someone shared this little beauty secret with me. Hope it does wonders for you too!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product as it contains both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid. I&#x27;ve heard that these are two of the very best things to use when battling both fine lines and wrinkles. I am always iffy about trying new products because I have sensitive skin but this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I noticed a vast improvement in the texture of my skin in the morning after applying it. Even though it is intended for wrinkles,  it actually helped clear up a breakout I had. It wasn&#x27;t oily at all even though it is a serum and it absorbed very quickly. Overall, this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used up the whole bottle...and I wasn&#x27;t all too flattered by it to be honest. There are definitely much better serums out there with better results. It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a good solid month and can say it&#x27;s not a miracle serum.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because the price of this little bottle. Vitamin C is not expensive along with witch hazel, and the other added items in the mix. If it took away all the wrinkles, then it would be priceless.&lt;br /&gt;I use another product which works probably just as well, costs a little less.&lt;br /&gt;But everyone&#x27;s skin is different and it may work better or worse.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my wrinkles after using this product for about a month but my complexion is softer and smoother.  Actually I didn&#x27;t expect  a miracle.  The only problem that I have is that there weren&#x27;t any directions and I have been using the product twice a day, under my regular moisturizer, but don&#x27;t know if I should be using it less often.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but can&#x27;t say it has made a tremendous difference in my skin tone. However, it has improved my complexion in conjunction with other skin care products.</li>
    <li> This serum really does made a big difference on your facial skin&#x27;s appearance and hydration.  I use it twice a day, every day and have noticed smoother, more hydrated skin.  The coloring on my face is evening out nicely!  Highly recommend-and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I picked up this product because I live in Southern California and I get sun burns quite often. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much SPF I use, my face usually gets burned. Lots of sun burns can prematurely age your face and I just can&#x27;t have that so I stumbled upon this product. I know its technically winter, but winter for Socal still means there&#x27;s sun with a potential for burning so I bought it. I actually have a lot of face products and some I&#x27;ve just stopped using because they smell funny (yes, I&#x27;m weird about smells, especially near my nose) or they leave my face really oily because I have such a natural oily complexion. I just started using the Vitamin C Serum and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell, which is important to me AND it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all oily like other products have. I&#x27;ve only been using the product a short time and already my skin looks and feels brighter. Some of my deeper lines appear to be filled in and some redness I&#x27;ve had some sun damage has lightened giving me a more even tone. Love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to give my face more tone and do this with something natural. I heard about this from a friend, and decided to try it out. After only a week of using it, I noticed visibly firmer and softer looking skin! I really can feel it &amp;#34;doing its thing&amp;#34; when I put it on, and I am so glad it is using natural ingredients, because that is so important to me. I don&#x27;t feel any peeling or flaking of the skin. It glides on my face, and feels so soothing. I am going to use this from now on to keep my skin on point!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a little over a week now. I purchased it after hearing that it could help with my sun damaged skin and fine line; and i also have bad acne scars on the sides of my cheeks. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in skin brightness and texture. I like that it also dries up nicely on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel wet or moist; so i put it on first before my moisturizer and makeup in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it once dried so that&#x27;s a plus too! I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing continued results :)</li>
    <li> My  skin feels SO much better after using this.  I haven&#x27;t had it long, but I&#x27;m seeing results fairly quickly.  I&#x27;ve particularly had problems with the lines around my eyes, and I can see them noticeably receding.  My skin color is better too.  Just follow the instructions as directed (moisturizer is definitely necessary) and it works well.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I believe that this serum dries the skin which is the last thing I need.  I mix it with an organic rose hip oil, or any other moisturizer that is on hand to minimize the drying effect.  I would not purchase it again.  I am 58, so the drying up business is full effect, perhaps a younger persons skin would find it perfect.</li>
    <li> Not as good as my coconut oil, but still very good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do a thing. Leaves my face a bit too dry, so I need to apply a moisturizer over it.</li>
    <li> GREAT product!  I&#x27;ve received many compliments, a youthful glow, and an exhilarating feel.  I&#x27;ve been recommending this to my friends and family, and they seem to love it as well.</li>
    <li> my skin feels smoother after only 1 week of using it, i only use it at night time before going to bed.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels. I love that my skin is absorbing Vitamin C. I cannot say if I see a remarkable difference in my skin yet, but it does feel smoother and seems to be more nourished. I have very sensitive skin and it is gentle and soothing. Based on that, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks. It absorbs nicely, and I feel it makes my skin feel a little smoother once I add moisturizer on top - but I don&#x27;t notice any fading of discoloration or diminishment of lines. I&#x27;m 36 years old so my skin isn&#x27;t showing terrible signs of aging but what I do have hasn&#x27;t improved.</li>
    <li> One I got into vitamin C serum, I had a hard time determining the difference between different brands... and to be honest I&#x27;m still kind of there. Once you achieve your results and you&#x27;re in maintenance mode... it&#x27;s a little hard to tell!? This one was affordable and I was quite satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! It works beautifully. Within minutes my face feels a little tighter and looks a little smoother. I&#x27;ve received many many compliments...</li>
    <li> I dont think I have used this product long enough to see any anti-wrinkle results (only 1.5 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;But I do feel that my skin tone is more even and with this product I eliminated my other moisturizer, which is great since I have oily skin and this seems to control that extra oil production</li>
    <li> I was not expecting miracles - in fact would have been happy with just not being disappointed. However I did see a difference after only a few days. Very good product, not overly priced and it does make a difference! I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Im not sure what makes it control my acne but it does.  It also seems to make my skin firmer.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I like this product.  It reduce the damage acne cause to my skin.</li>
    <li> loved this product will buy again</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good. I didn&#x27;t see a big difference in my skin- but no harm done at least. It may have lightened some discolorations on my skin slightly. I wish it was less watery. I may like the Jason&#x27;s Vitamin C lotion better.</li>
    <li> I used it for 2 weeks now. I like its feel after I put it on.</li>
    <li> My skin looks healthier since I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> Alright, I don&#x27;t really hate it (that&#x27;s what the 1-star was equated with) but I DO hate that when I click to see other reviews for all of the reviewers who gave it 4 or 5 stars -the other products they&#x27;ve reviewed and the reviews they&#x27;ve given lead me to believe that they are purchased reviews versus genuine reviews.  I was looking at whitening products and saw fake reviews called out on a few of them.  This prompted me to go back and scrutinize the raving reviews for this Vit. C serum (which did definitely influence my decision to buy).  The product itself I am sort of liking ... I do feel like my skin is feeling a bit fresher and maybe a bit firmer, but I&#x27;ve only been using for a week.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, so I woudn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy it, but don&#x27;t buy it based on glowing reviews.  I&#x27;m feeling duped.</li>
