      <li>Every individual is different, but Joico has some of the best and most versatile hair products on the market (and no I don&#x27;t work for them).</li>
      <li>I love the Moisture Recovery and Silk Result lines so much that I have begged them to start making relaxers after these lines for crazed junkies like me!</li>

      <li>The best stuff I have used in a long time..makes your hair so silky and soft</li>
      <li>I dont think I will use it anymore because I felt like my hair felt kind of waxy and with natural products</li>

      <li>It is epensive, but worth it.</li>

      <li>First of all, I am African-American</li>
      <li>The hot rollers take a toll on my hair,  </li>
      <li>My hair is long and very dry, this is the best balm I have used so far, and I have tried a lot!</li>
      <li>After use this moisture Recovery, I felt it really make my hair become soft and smooth</li>

      <li>I love it, can&#x27;t say enough about it, and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and super soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I have really curly hair and after putting this on, it separates the curls which makes my hair so much easier to work with.</li>
      <li>Really works wonders for a Conditioner.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling very moisturized and silky.</li>
      <li>I was really worried about the damage.  </li>
      <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
      <li>that dosent happen much</li>
      <li>much easier to brush thru.</li>
      <li>and I could really tell a difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It worked very well when I had a relaxer as well.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but dry from highlights and this was recommended by my hairdresser</li>
      <li>Anyway, if your hair type is similar to mine, this Moisture Recovery Balm will most likely work for you.</li>
      <li>It also left if soft and tangle free.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>my hair was soft, shiny and very managable.  </li>
      <li>It really works and your hair stays soft</li>
      <li>This product is Fabulousi for thick hair, the price was fabulous, and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Joico products are light enough to use on relaxed hair when you want to actually style it and keep the moisture AND body.</li>
      <li>I have long hair with a slight natural curl that really does noting with out hot rollers and that left on its own my hair gets frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have ever used for my thin, fine dry hair (it says its for thick hair, but works well on mine).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so the second time when I use it follow the exactly the instruction.</li>
      <li>,my hair looks beutiful and soft after using it!</li>
      <li>This helps smooth down my hair weightlessly and infuse into it cationic hydration and botanical/marine</li>
      <li>I usually do is wash with the Silk result shampoo, deep condition with the Moisture Recovery Balm using a warm shower cap, rinse and seal it with the Silk Result conditioner.</li>
      <li>hair is fine and wavy, and this treatment balm was just too heavy.  </li>
      <li>This made a world of difference in how soft and shiny my hair is.  </li>
      <li>Unlike the Joico it is messier and has a natural, somewhat nauseating smell.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>My mother can&#x27;t even believe how shiny and soft it is after air-drying before I even flatiron it, and she is not the observant type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stays soft till I wash it again.</li>
      <li>I was recently in a wedding and the stylist put so much product in and heat to my hair</li>
      <li>but I thought this did make my hair feel soft</li>
      <li>I normally use my regular shampoo and conditioner, then I apply the balm after - use as directed.  </li>
      <li>After read so much positive review, I decide to order this item for my very dry and corse hair.</li>
      <li>My hair got very coarse as I got older and white hair grew in.  </li>
      <li>but this is the I only item that is in the marked that works for my type of hair!Thank joico.</li>
      <li>I only use it when I feel my hair is in need of something soft for my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I recently went natural again and</li>
      <li>I would highly recomed this to anyone with dry hair.</li>
      <li>but after a few hours my hair keep back the same condition, dry not soft any more.</li>
      <li>only other time my hair has ever felt that lovely is when I deep conditioned with raw Amazonian Tucuma butter.</li>
      <li>Now I barely have any hair left.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my dry, coarse hair soft and moiturized for days after washing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This treatment works well. It leaves my hair feeling very moisturized and silky.</li>
    <li> The best humectante product on the market. It has made such a difference in my daughter&#x27;s hair. The shine and softness are unmatched.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am African-American and I swear by this stuff... along with the Joico Silk Result shampoo and conditioner, this allows me to stretch out time until my next relaxer on my 4a/4b textured hair. My hair is kinky, thick-wiry, and I have very dry scalp. This helps smooth down my hair weightlessly and infuse into it cationic hydration and botanical/marine moisturizers- not mineral oil as a cheap filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I usually do is wash with the Silk result shampoo, deep condition with the Moisture Recovery Balm using a warm shower cap, rinse and seal it with the Silk Result conditioner. Then I usually add Image IntraKera Deep Penetrating Leave-In Conditioning Complex and pure jojoba oil, then air dry if I&#x27;m not expected anywhere.  I kid you not, my hair feels exactly like silk upon finishing! My mother can&#x27;t even believe how shiny and soft it is after air-drying before I even flatiron it, and she is not the observant type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other time my hair has ever felt that lovely is when I deep conditioned with raw Amazonian Tucuma butter. Unlike the Joico it is messier and has a natural, somewhat nauseating smell. Joico products are light enough to use on relaxed hair when you want to actually style it and keep the moisture AND body. Anyway, if your hair type is similar to mine, this Moisture Recovery Balm will most likely work for you. Every individual is different, but Joico has some of the best and most versatile hair products on the market (and no I don&#x27;t work for them). I love the Moisture Recovery and Silk Result lines so much that I have begged them to start making relaxers after these lines for crazed junkies like me! Hopefully they&#x27;ll listen... :)</li>
    <li> Great for really course hair</li>
    <li> My hair got very coarse as I got older and white hair grew in.  I tried everything to get it to \\&quot;sit down\\&quot; instead of looking thick and frizzy, including using natural treatments like eggs and olive oil.  When I ordered this hair conditioner (along with the Joico Silk Result shampoo) I finally hit on the thing that worked!!!  My hair is smooth, silky and shiny again!  Please never stop making this product and I will never stop ordering it!!!</li>
    <li> I just had my hair hightlighted and it was dry and fly away.  After using this treament balm (a sample was given to me by my hairdresser) my hair was soft, shiny and very managable.  It is an awesome product and I would recommend it to anyone.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse hair and have worked with too puffy hair for years.  Tried this conditioner and I could really tell a difference in my hair.  It is hard to find in stores, so I have only ordered it through Amazon.  It is epensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> used it for the first time and absolutly noticed a difference.  hair is fragarent but not overly so.  and super soft to the touch.  much easier to brush thru. and def less hair breakage.  i have recently gone from black hair to platinum blonde so this was most excellent in restoring bleached out dry hair.  love it.  plan to use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery.product is amazing,my hair looks beutiful and soft after using it!</li>
    <li> I am not one to advocate silicon-based products, but this one definitely moisturized my thick&lt;br /&gt;hair. It also left if soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> Awesome for dry hair. It softens the hair. Life saver!</li>
    <li> I was recently in a wedding and the stylist put so much product in and heat to my hair I was really worried about the damage.  I&#x27;ll admit, I am vain about the condition of my hair and do whatever it takes  to ensure it stays healthy and brilliant.  After the wedding the first thing I did was wash out all the product using Moisture Recovery then put in this balm for a good 15 minutes.  I rinsed with very cold water, squeeze and then air dried my hair.  My hair felt amazing and I didn&#x27;t see any signs of the damage from the up-do.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Its perfect, you need to use it only once and you will see the difference.It really works and your hair stays soft</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my thin, fine dry hair (it says its for thick hair, but works well on mine).&lt;br /&gt;I only have to use a small amount.  It has saved me from buying other products.</li>
    <li> I love this treatment. I use this one everyday for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have a wonderful result in my hear.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite conditioner!  I&#x27;ve used many other products, but nothing seems to smooth my hair like the moisture recovery balm.  I have very thick, coarse, color treated hair.  This made a world of difference in how soft and shiny my hair is.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything so awesome. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing I used before then started to use it again not only it made my hair soft but it also made think,long and strong I have hair that dosent grown but this is the I only item that is in the marked that works for my type of hair!Thank joico.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, 4b/c hair and I recently went natural again and this conditioner has been so awesome! It worked very well when I had a relaxer as well. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy or oily film on your hair when you rinse it out. It leaves my hair very soft. I have used it both as a regular conditioner and post protein conditioner- awesome for both. I will keep this as my go to conditioner especially when I want to blow dry and flat iron my hair. Highly recommended. Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
    <li> I have long hair with a slight natural curl that really does noting with out hot rollers and that left on its own my hair gets frizzy.  The hot rollers take a toll on my hair,  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and I also use the Moisture Recovery shampoo and conditioner.  This is the absolute best product I have ever found.</li>
    <li> IT IS AMAAAAAAAAAAAZING!!!! i absolutely love this treatment balm for my 4c hair texture!  I normally use my regular shampoo and conditioner, then I apply the balm after - use as directed.  Here&#x27;s what i notice, the moment i put this balm on my soaking wet hair - it instantly soaks up the water, like it&#x27;s sealing in the water, immediately hydrating my hair.  I love it, can&#x27;t say enough about it, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it  conditions my hair too good and I think I like Dove products better, but I like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Sealed to ensure quality. The product works as described. Joico is a great company that helps people that have coarse/thick hair.</li>
    <li> I only use it when I feel my hair is in need of something soft for my hair.  It works just as I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I usually dont use products with silicon in them but I thought this did make my hair feel soft I have 4b hair thats really dry. I dont think I will use it anymore because I felt like my hair felt kind of waxy and with natural products that dosent happen much but I guess it does what its suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Works well and adds moisture!</li>
    <li> i love this conditioner but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.i wish they made this into a perfume because it smells so good and its moisturuizing and leaves my hair soft and if when i sit under the dryer it makes my hair fluffy.great conditioner will probably repurchase when it goes on sale or something</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Really works wonders for a Conditioner. I have really curly hair and after putting this on, it separates the curls which makes my hair so much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> The best stuff I have used in a long time..makes your hair so silky and soft</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but dry from highlights and this was recommended by my hairdresser and I bought it and tried it and  oh my god....it literally dissolved away alot of my hair.  Now I barely have any hair left.  What a disaster.</li>
    <li> Love this hair balm! My hair is long and very dry, this is the best balm I have used so far, and I have tried a lot! It leaves my hair soft, shiny and silky. I would highly recomed this to anyone with dry hair.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and is genuine. It leaves my dry, coarse hair soft and moiturized for days after washing. Usually by the second day after using othe conditioner, my hair feels dry again on the second day, but not with this. Stays soft till I wash it again. My hair is past my shoulder and thick. This is a must!</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioner i have tried. I actually left it in my hair as a styling product and rinsed it out the next day. Left hair very soft and frizzy free and smells good too.</li>
    <li> After read so much positive review, I decide to order this item for my very dry and corse hair. After use this moisture Recovery, I felt it really make my hair become soft and smooth but after a few hours my hair keep back the same condition, dry not soft any more. I thought probably I did not use it correctly( not enough time to put on my hair) so the second time when I use it follow the exactly the instruction. but still the same. Maybe this moisture recovery is not suit for me.</li>
    <li> I must admit, part of the problem I have with using this conditioner may have to do with the fact that I&#x27;m using a product NOT designed for my hair type.  The tube specifically says, \\&quot;for thick/coarse hair\\&quot;, which I do not have.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you have \\&quot;thick/coarse hair\\&quot;, this would be an excellent conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and wavy, and this treatment balm was just too heavy.  Even after rinsing and drying, my hair felt over-treated and heavily coated.  And my ends felt sort of \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like \\&quot;coatings\\&quot; on my hair, which is why I don&#x27;t use \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; products. I&#x27;ll give this product 3 stars because IMHO, (just as the tube states) this conditioner is not for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Update - July 13, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T like this product as a \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does remove tangles.</li>
    <li> This product is Fabulousi for thick hair, the price was fabulous, and it arrived quickly.</li>
</ol>
