<ol>
      <li>The best men&#x27;s lotion I have used.  </li>
      <li>Smells awesome.</li>
      <li>I get a great tan with this!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall its the best I have found in years</li>
      <li>, it isnt all that oily or liquified, a perfect mix</li>
      <li>this suff is good but it works the best if it is used with HD fab step 1.</li>
      <li>Love it, it&#x27;s the best, great price!</li>
      <li>Oh, besides the 14 bronzers - the lotion is simply great for your skin.  </li>

      <li>Great smell and</li>
      <li>This is a great tanning lotion and lasted for a while.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>just as in the store, this works great and dose not smell to girlie, do id say yes buy it</li>

      <li>It has a very nice smell to it, almost like a cologne.  </li>
      <li>Seems to give good tan.</li>
      <li>, it smells good</li>
      <li>The results with this lotion are great, it maximizes your tanning results and makes your skin nice and brown regardless of your complexion.  </li>
      <li>Do not see how this product can be good for your skin-</li>
      <li>so I figured it must be a good product.  </li>
      <li>Good price compared to tanning salons.</li>
      <li>You can get great results, without having to spend many hours in the sun or both.</li>
      <li>Great Bronzer, I recommend the product, but I am not so sure about the seller.</li>
      <li>The tanning lotion gave him a really nice bronze color which he said he loved.</li>
      <li>Good product nice smell.</li>
      <li>id amazing</li>
      <li>he really liked it</li>
      <li>I dont think I will use this producat again despite its more manly scent and good job at keeping my skin moist.</li>
      <li>and it really does smell awesome!</li>
      <li>But I wasn&#x27;t sure how good of a bronzer it was.</li>
      <li>I was at first pessimistic about HD man since it is mostly marketed for its awesome smell....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I not only saved 70% off retail the lotion works and smells great.</li>
      <li>I like this (my husbands) better than my lotion.</li>
      <li>having 14 bronzers, I am not getting outstanding darkness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most potent bronzer i&#x27;ve used--</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve stuck with it for more than 8 months now.</li>
      <li>i love these two and the smell</li>
      <li>A squeeze tube would have worked better.  </li>
      <li>but I wish it would darken more with one tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>lotion smells more of a cologne but is not overpowering</li>
      <li>but I guess that is okay.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he says he likes it better then</li>
      <li>but maybe it&#x27;s ok if you&#x27;re in hurry and want to get a quick tan in before hitting the bars/clubs!</li>
      <li>worked great as promised arrived early.</li>
      <li>My first response was when I smelled how strong the cologne was, \\&quot;You better AXE somebody!\\&quot; LMAO.</li>
      <li>The bronzing agents are better and more effective than the older version of the product.</li>
      <li>(though the smell isn&#x27;t as strong after you tan).</li>
      <li>Smell us not too strong.</li>
      <li>It also does the job, you walk out with a pretty nice tan.</li>
      <li>It appears the cap issue has been resolved as the cap now fits securely on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I question whether the product is genuine.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great product though</li>
      <li>and he said he loved it he bought a differnt brand right from the tanning salon and paid over 100 dollars for it and didnt like it as much as this smells great and works great without giving you that fake tan look</li>
      <li>While the old HD Mann was good, the new HD MANN 2 is a better.</li>
      <li>Recieved it within a resonable amount of time considering i didnt pay for any special hanfling.</li>
      <li>Also gives you a nice and natural golden/bronze color</li>
      <li>it was a decent purchase, good price and decent results</li>
      <li>It seems like the amount given gets used up too quickly</li>
      <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Not as many bronzers as some other tanning lotions, but still does great job in creating nice dark tan.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy tanning lotion online since tanning salons scare you into paying top dollar</li>
      <li>Not very greasy, goes on smooth, and smells pretty good...</li>
      <li>Considering that this lotion is between 70 and 90 bucks at Salons, its definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Jwow and Obsidian and luminary make you darker, but this gives you more of a natural tan and wont leave you smelling like a charred fruit after tanning.</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast and this product darkens you up quickly.</li>
      <li>There are other lotions out there that are better and have better results that this.</li>
      <li>My second bottle, very strong smelling and my girl hates it but works</li>
      <li>Shipment was very fast; compared to another place that product didn&#x27;t show up for six weeks after I ordered.  </li>
      <li>Not much product comes in bottle (or perhaps because he&#x27;s a rather muscular guy he goes thru the product more quickly), but worth the price here, bought 3 for the price of 1 that they sell at the tanning salon.  </li>
      <li>It smells pretty good and applies evenly even on my arms where there is a little bit of hair.</li>
      <li>Im sure the weight of this thing does not reflect the actual lotion amount within.</li>
      <li>but after my first use with this product I did not see any issues with streaking.</li>
      <li>i bought this for my brother and this is the first time he used this brand</li>
      <li>First, the cap won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
      <li>Recently found this seller and glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Although the product was good, there was about a ¼ of the bottle missing when I received it.</li>
      <li>just didn&#x27;t get as dark as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>It felt light and looking down the top it was clearly not filled to the top</li>
      <li>So, I tried one of those product sample pouch and found out that this product is no joke - it really DOES bronze you up, without making you look like Cheetos (nor does it make you look like a jar of Nutella).  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>he said it was the real thing,( from sealed lotions)</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>They have it about twice as much at the tanning salon so buying it here was a no brainer.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of it</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>So, I just purchased the 7oz bottle on Amazon today and look forward to using HD Mann to get my color deep and rich before my Vegas trip in two weeks.  </li>
      <li>It was on special - 25% off the regular price!</li>
      <li>I like the smell as it is somewhat more manly than the typical flowery / coconut smell of my wife&#x27;s lotions.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, good not great.</li>
      <li>He has somewhat sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I would have given it five stars, but the bottle is misleading as far as the quantity.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t go as far as you might think.</li>
      <li>The $5 I spent on a 1/2 ounce packet was worth it to me to see what it was like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not very greasy, goes on smooth, and smells pretty good... like cologne (though the smell isn&#x27;t as strong after you tan). I also like the push nozzle dispenser and glass bottle. The little fake leather strap on the bottle gets annoying pretty quick, but it is held on with a little dot of hot glue and is easily removed! So that&#x27;s small stuff!  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> HD Mann has a great manly scent to it.  Not as many bronzers as some other tanning lotions, but still does great job in creating nice dark tan.</li>
    <li> Good price compared to tanning salons.</li>
    <li> i gave this to my son for his birthday he really liked it he said it was the real thing,( from sealed lotions) he had tried a sample at the salon</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product before.  Works very well</li>
    <li> Good product nice smell.The container is big and bulky to take along. I put some of the product in a small container</li>
    <li> I was at first pessimistic about HD man since it is mostly marketed for its awesome smell....and it really does smell awesome! But I wasn&#x27;t sure how good of a bronzer it was. Overall I am very satisfied with this product. It smells great and seems to work well. It&#x27;s not the most potent bronzer i&#x27;ve used--Jwow and Obsidian and luminary make you darker, but this gives you more of a natural tan and wont leave you smelling like a charred fruit after tanning. The only negative about this bronzer is that the bottle is annoying- the top falls off very easily and it seems to run out rather quickly--though I do apply it generously! Considering that this lotion is between 70 and 90 bucks at Salons, its definitely worth the price. I am a return customer. 25 year old male and I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a typical tanning lotion for men.  It has a very nice smell to it, almost like a cologne.  The results with this lotion are great, it maximizes your tanning results and makes your skin nice and brown regardless of your complexion.  I recommend this lotion and ONLY this lotion to any guys out there that like to go tanning.</li>
    <li> The minute we got it in the mail, he went to the tanning salon to try it out. The tanning lotion gave him a really nice bronze color which he said he loved. The only thing I&#x27;d say bad or maybe not bad for others is the cologne smell is really strong. My husband even thought so also but maybe it&#x27;s ok if you&#x27;re in hurry and want to get a quick tan in before hitting the bars/clubs! LOL My first response was when I smelled how strong the cologne was, \\&quot;You better AXE somebody!\\&quot; LMAO. Overall, this is a great product though, it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> just as in the store, this works great and dose not smell to girlie, do id say yes buy it</li>
    <li> i bought this for my brother and this is the first time he used this brand and he said he loved it he bought a differnt brand right from the tanning salon and paid over 100 dollars for it and didnt like it as much as this smells great and works great without giving you that fake tan look</li>
    <li> There are other lotions out there that are better and have better results that this. The cost doesn&#x27;t justify spending that much and getting so few ounces. Save your money and buy other lotions.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy tanning lotion online since tanning salons scare you into paying top dollar however I&#x27;ve read the other reviews so decided to save money and give it a shot. I&#x27;m happy to say I not only saved 70% off retail the lotion works and smells great.</li>
    <li> No post-tan unpleasant smell...actually smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;For having 14 bronzers, I am not getting outstanding darkness.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good not great.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. I like this (my husbands) better than my lotion. I&#x27;ll probably use this next season. It hides the after tan funk smell too.</li>
    <li> Any man looking for a deep bronzing lotion, this one is worth the extra money! Ive used it on and off over the last couple of years, because Im always in hopes of finding something that works as well, but for less money. Let me save you the time and frustration...it doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and it&#x27;s great.  Recently found this seller and glad I did.  Shipment was very fast; compared to another place that product didn&#x27;t show up for six weeks after I ordered.  After I convinced myself I was just crazy and forgot to hit the submit button on my order, it showed up.  This order through THIS seller showed up just days after my purchase.  I will order my lotion from here from now on.</li>
    <li> Just bought a bottle at Palm Beach Tan. It was on special - 25% off the regular price! After taxes, it was $77 bucks and change. The $5 I spent on a 1/2 ounce packet was worth it to me to see what it was like. Had I known then what I know now, Amazon! Could&#x27;ve saved $50!</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s the best, great price! Don&#x27;t hesitate about this buy, retail price typically runs anywhere from $50-$110 depending on where u go and what sales they got.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this.  Great smell (if you like that &#x27;men&#x27;s cologne&#x27; smell).  Really created a nice base tan for him.  Not much product comes in bottle (or perhaps because he&#x27;s a rather muscular guy he goes thru the product more quickly), but worth the price here, bought 3 for the price of 1 that they sell at the tanning salon.  He has somewhat sensitive skin and he had no problem with irritation.</li>
    <li> I recently asked my &#x27;tanning expert&#x27; if there were any products he would recommend that smells like a man, and without hesitation, he recommended HD Mann.  He went on with his sales pitch about guys skin is tougher than the ladies - and that there are 14 bronzers in HD Mann that will really work well to deepen my base.  So, I tried one of those product sample pouch and found out that this product is no joke - it really DOES bronze you up, without making you look like Cheetos (nor does it make you look like a jar of Nutella).  I noticed immediately how great my skin looked after one use.  So, I just purchased the 7oz bottle on Amazon today and look forward to using HD Mann to get my color deep and rich before my Vegas trip in two weeks.  Oh, besides the 14 bronzers - the lotion is simply great for your skin.  You can get great results, without having to spend many hours in the sun or both.</li>
    <li> I get a great tan with this!</li>
    <li> If you have done tanning before you probably know the repulsive smell some tanning lotions give you. Not this one. I really like the smell of it, it smells good but it is not overpowering. It also does the job, you walk out with a pretty nice tan.</li>
    <li> worked great as promised arrived early. I saved over 100. dollars compared to salon prices. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Finally a quality bronzing lotion for dudes that doesnt smell feminine. My only gripe is the size and weight of this cannister. It&#x27;s like carrying a can of spray paint or hair spray. Im sure the weight of this thing does not reflect the actual lotion amount within. Just saying</li>
    <li> I just wish there was a larger container or bottle. It seems like the amount given gets used up too quickly</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast and this product darkens you up quickly. Great price also. Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get that summer glow</li>
    <li> Bought this tanner a couple if weeks ago and almost done with the bottle.  Recieved it within a resonable amount of time considering i didnt pay for any special hanfling. Haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference in how dark I am.  All in all it was a decent purchase, good price and decent results just didn&#x27;t get as dark as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> didnt want to smell like beetches while and after tanning. this did the trick. will buy again and again with the now released step 1</li>
    <li> Although the product was good, there was about a ¼ of the bottle missing when I received it. I weighed it and it did not weigh the correct amount stated. It felt light and looking down the top it was clearly not filled to the top</li>
    <li> Great smell and you won&#x27;t get that awful tanning bed smell after it. Also gives you a nice and natural golden/bronze color so your tan won&#x27;t look like those fake and excessive brown or orange colors. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great Bronzer, I recommend the product, but I am not so sure about the seller. The packaging was iffy. I question whether the product is genuine. It smells slightly weaker than the first bottle that I bought at a salon, and the salon bottle lasted longer than this did. For the price being less than half of what I paid at the salon, I will recommend, it still got me tan and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Much less expensive then buying at a salon.  Works well also</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion and lasted for a while. They have it about twice as much at the tanning salon so buying it here was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Two cons:  First, the cap won&#x27;t stay on.  Second, it comes in a hard plastic bottle so you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re running out until you&#x27;ve run out.  A squeeze tube would have worked better.  Edit:  One year later and I reordered the same product.  It appears the cap issue has been resolved as the cap now fits securely on the bottle.  But the product still comes in a hard plastic bottle.  So if I could, I&#x27;d raise the stars to 4.5.</li>
    <li> this suff is good but it works the best if it is used with HD fab step 1. the two used together make you ultra extreme dark and im so plae lol i love these two and the smell id amazing and it mositureizes like a mofo!! im on my 6th bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of tanning lotions, paid top dollar, and always end up being disappointed at some point because none seem to be geared towards men. Until Hd Mann...&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells more of a cologne but is not overpowering (it fades a lot as you tan so by the time you are done you are left with a slight masculine aroma)&lt;br /&gt;Big point, it isnt all that oily or liquified, a perfect mix so you don&#x27;t feel like you are putting on silk or butter. It absorbs into skin well so you don&#x27;t waste a lot of time rubbing and rubbing or trying to find a sport to relocate the excess because it just won&#x27;t absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is that I don&#x27;t feel it provides enough bronzing/darkening. Maybe it is subject to each persons skin but I wish it would darken more with one tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its the best I have found in years and I&#x27;ve stuck with it for more than 8 months now. I highly recommend it and don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I tan every year for two months before i go on vacation.  I bought the California Tan as it sold and the tanning salon so I figured it must be a good product.  I bought from Amazon as it was about $15 cheaper.  I like the smell as it is somewhat more manly than the typical flowery / coconut smell of my wife&#x27;s lotions.  However I feel that this year using the California Tan my tan is not dark / bronze as in previous years and that I am tanning at a slower pace than in years past despite tanning 4xs a week for 8 weeks. The one strength of the product is that my skin is not dry and flaky which has been a problem in years past when I tan so I credit California Tan for keeping my skin moist and healty.  I dont think I will use this producat again despite its more manly scent and good job at keeping my skin moist.</li>
    <li> My second bottle, very strong smelling and my girl hates it but works and I like it. Seems to give good tan.</li>
    <li> The best men&#x27;s lotion I have used.  Feels great with a cooling sensation after use and the fragrance almost smells like a cologne.  Get compliments quite often after use.</li>
    <li> I only tan at a tanning bed for a couple months a year. I previously used this product and had success. This is my second order for the same product. Smell us not too strong.</li>
    <li> While the old HD Mann was good, the new HD MANN 2 is a better. The bronzing agents are better and more effective than the older version of the product.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about using a bronzer at first but after my first use with this product I did not see any issues with streaking. It smells pretty good and applies evenly even on my arms where there is a little bit of hair. The price seems a bit steep but I guess that is okay.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he says he likes it better then any thing else he has tried.</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars, but the bottle is misleading as far as the quantity. It&#x27;s double walled and only holds 7 oz. and it doesn&#x27;t go as far as you might think. The lotion itself is hard to beat. It smells great even after tanning. Have even used it as cologne.</li>
    <li> Horrible tan product. The product left an itchy skin, smelled horrible (very strong chemical type smell) came out in globs and had a burning sensation even without being in the tanning bed. Do not see how this product can be good for your skin- it is like your skin is yelling at you to get the product off of your skin ASAP.</li>
