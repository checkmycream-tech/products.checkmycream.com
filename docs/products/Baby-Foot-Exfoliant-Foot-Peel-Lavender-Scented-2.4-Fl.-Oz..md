<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> It did take 2 weeks for all of the skin to come off but my feet feel wonderful. Will definitely use this again</li>
    <li> So far, one star is all I am can give.I followed the directions exactly, I am heading into day five and have seen no difference- no peeling ,sloughing,NOTHING! I have read that in some cases the process can take up to two weeks- I am soaking my feet every night for 30 minutes starting last night-I&#x27;ll see how it goes- so far I am extremely disappointed and if this does not work will be returning for a refund):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Let the molting begin (: last nights soak seemed to do the trick-- will soak again tonight-- so far -looking ood((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;adding 4 more STARS****</li>
    <li> My feet are much softer after using this product but mine didn&#x27;t peel off in big pieces like some of the pics that others posted did.  My feet peeled in small pieces for about 2 weeks.  I did soak my feet before using the product and every day after for 2 weeks.  Since mine didn&#x27;t peel off in big pieces I used my pumice stone to help get off the dead skin. Overall, the product did help my feet but didn&#x27;t give me the results I had imagined after reading others reviews.</li>
    <li> Thought nothing was going to happen, on day 6 feet started to peel, WOW! what a difference.  I won&#x27;t be ashamed to show my feet in summer  shoes&lt;br /&gt;All that ugliness is gone. Terrific product.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased this product twice and I am happy with the end result. You should be warned however, that the sloughing off of you skin is not a pretty process (which in part is why you would by this product). No great surprise, I know, but it is a bit of a drawn-out process since it occurs over several days (possibly up to a week). About three days after you apply the product, I would recommend taking a wash cloth towards the end of your shower and rubbing your feet to help speed up the process and to contain the skin in the tub. It really does peel off in rather large pieces so be prepared! It costs less than a pedicure however, and my feet really are as smooth as they have ever been as an adult. The key is to just keep with moisturizing your feet to prolong the softness (which I didn&#x27;t do the first time and is the reason I had to buy the product again).</li>
    <li> Worked great!  The key is to soak your feet first. If you do that, it will work.</li>
    <li> A bit of exfoliation, but not like I had hoped. My feet aren&#x27;t hardened and cracked, but my heels aren&#x27;t perfect and I wear crazy shoes and have general &amp;#34;runner&#x27;s foot&amp;#34;, so I thought I could use a pick me up. A good exfoliating pedicure would have been much more pleasant and as effective. As usual, I have to remind myself to just continue to use a pumice stone, exfoliating foot scrub and lotion with AHA every night. Then I don&#x27;t need a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells like a public washroom air freshener and burns pretty badly.</li>
    <li> This product does work,  but it takes a while to start seeing the results.</li>
    <li> Sorta did what it said it would. Definitely gross process and my feet itched for weeks. Only problem is, my feet went right back to the way they were within 2 months, I would have to keep doing this over and over for a temporary fix. Not worth the expense for such a short reward.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. Very interesting to say the least.</li>
    <li> These worked great the first time. The second time I bought them, the results were not as dramatic and I&#x27;d probably keep the boots on much longer next time. I experienced no allergic reactions at all.</li>
    <li> Ok... but felt terrified...this thing can provoke a serious infection....scary...never again....</li>
    <li> It works! Plan on purchasing before every flip flop season!</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully.  Years and years of rough skin gone and my feel look great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a charm! Don&#x27;t buy the other brands that are cheaper - cuz they don&#x27;t work. Fork over the money for a product that actually does what it claims to. :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who had very rough feet. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it until he tried it. It really WORKS!</li>
    <li> I achieved great results with this product. It&#x27;s a little expensive however.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and removed all the dried skin from my feet. I had harden yellow callouses on the ball of my feet and my heels were just really dead white cracking and peeling skin, gross! For years I have tried using a paddle shaped foot file but never could get rid of all the dry skin. Nothing happened for the first three days but then I took a bath in hot water and the peeling began! For about 4-5 day the skin just sloughed off my feet; my toes peeled a couple layers--so it took off all the skin, not just the dry but it eliminated all the &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34; on my heels and my feet are truly baby soft.</li>
    <li> I will never get another pedicure again. I will be using this at least twice a year. Awesome product! It does completely annihilate any toenail polish but it&#x27;s so worth it. In the future, I will probably remove nail polish beforehand.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions to the T and it will work perfectly!</li>
    <li> It did peel but not completely remove my desk skin.</li>
    <li> It did really work for. It just pulled off the top layer but didn&#x27;t penetrate deep into the callous.</li>
    <li> Only worked a little for me, but I&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
    <li> Best product for dry feet!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Really, really works!! Definitely recommend this product to everyone!!! Happy Feet : )</li>
    <li> Wow!  I thought it wasn&#x27;t working for me . . . at first.  After about two and a half days, nothing was peeling as described.  Then, the peel just started happening definitely as described.  Left me with smooth feet (and I&#x27;m a guy who is hard on his feet).  This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased and will probably do another round in mid-Summer if needed!</li>
    <li> My sister was coming to visit so I ordered one for each of us. I was SO excited. Both of us have such dry feet and suffer from cracked heels. We took pictures of our feet before we started. I had read the reviews and some of the suggestions from other users that the product worked for. We soaked our feet first, wore the booties for probably a little longer than instructed just to be sure and we soaked our feet each night after. Two weeks later we came to the conclusion it was not going to work. It&#x27;s been a few months now so I think I&#x27;m safe to say it didn&#x27;t work. Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Seems very ineffective. It took almost 4 weeks to arrive. Applied it left on for about 1.5 hrs. Day 4 and very minimal peeling. A mani/ pedi is $35  in Naples they remove dead skin and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;For the price this product is definitely not worth the bother for a one time use.</li>
    <li> I used this product about 4 weeks ago. I take very good care of my feet: have regular pedicures and exfoliate my feet in the shower. I used the plastic boots as recommended, following a 30-45 minute soak in hot water and let my feet sit in the clear gel solution the recommended time. The smell is citrusy and not unpleasant. Your feet will begin to peel a few days later. It is quite shocking, so don&#x27;t be surprised. I wore socks the whole time they were &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;, even to bed, and scrubbed my feet in each shower to assist the process. All the old callused winter skin sloughed off and my feet look great and ready to face the season of sandals. I also made my boyfriend use it and his feet look great, too! Recommended. I plan to use Baby Feet every winter now.</li>
    <li> This did a tremendous job on my feet. I soaked my feet first, as recommended, then applied the booties with the gel inside. I thought I was going to be someone who reported it &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; but on day 7, my feet started to peel. While I didn&#x27;t get sheets of skin peeling off as some users report, I definitely got baby soft feet out of it. My advice: wear socks, especially to bed, until the process is complete.</li>
    <li> Really worked! My heels were cracked and rough, they are now smooth! My husband even noticed. The only thing is I applied baby foot one week before I went on vacation to Arizona where we went hiking a lot. My feet were in the process of shedding and I ended up getting blisters from my tennis shoes. I would have done this two weeks prior to the trip so the shedding was complete.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s feet. Where have you been all my married life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Married 32 years.</li>
    <li> These worked just like advertised.  Very good product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Makes a mess and doesn&#x27;t do a through job.  Buy a foot razor.  They work the best I don&#x27;t care what the pedicurist say.  They used the use them too until they became illegal to use by them in my state.  They don&#x27;t want you to use one so you have to keep coming back to them every month.</li>
    <li> great product, however if you have chronically dry feet you will have to repeat the process every so often and moisturize daily.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST STUFF EVER!  It is messy for 5 days but as soon as it finishes peeling, perfection.</li>
    <li> Actually works really well, does take days too peel but it addresses that in the instructions.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me as it did for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just didn&#x27;t have that much dead skin to be removed. I did experience some peeling, but nothing like what you see on other product reviews.</li>
    <li> 6/22/13 (am)-I was so inspired by that other dude&#x27;s multi-day review that i just had to make my own! So here it is. Today is the morning after i first put the booties on. How it feels &amp; looks today, i&#x27;ll get to later, but let me reiterate what everyone else is saying: it&#x27;s probably best to follow the tips on here rather than on the box. My feet, prior to this morning, looked like a cross between an alligator, bluegill, and the Grand Canyon. They were leathery in spots, had flakey scaley crap falling off, and would get dry cracks in them that you could lose a small child in. I&#x27;m *kind of* hoping this product will change that, and so far so good! So the tips on here (two hour soak instead of one, etc.) are right on for heavy duty gator feet like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, last night i put the booties on. I want to say something other than booties, but my manlihood was severely damaged enough last night by the wifey wanting to take a picture of me in my temporary footware, so saying  booties won&#x27;t make things any worse. I keep telling myself, no more socks to bed! Wife likes smooth feet! She won&#x27;t wake up screaming about a sandpaper monster if my toes brush against her at night under the covers! So that makes me feel better. But wearing bootes for 2 hours, walking like i had to poo (it&#x27;s hard to walk on gel), and the wife giggling at me the whole time (half at the booties, half at the fact that i was gonna have smooth feet) was quite the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is day one...so far, i didn&#x27;t expect to see any results, but it appears my gators are starting to shed already. Can gators shed? Well, the skin is falling off or anything, but it already looks like...it&#x27;s hard to explain it. It&#x27;s almost like when you were in grade school, and you were making crafts. You got some glue on your skin, and it dried. Right before you peeled it off, it kind of looks like that. Like i&#x27;m about ready to molt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this product works as well as i&#x27;ve heard, because i&#x27;m ready to stop wearing sock to bed on these hot stinking summer nights! And the wife says she can&#x27;t wait to help me peel the skin off my feet. All the dudes out there that are using this-are your wives as twisted as mine? The wierd thing is, the twisteder she gets the hotter she gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for day 2 tomorrow!&lt;br /&gt;6-22-13 (pm) Okay so it&#x27;s still inside day one, and the tops of my feet are already molting...the tops were the smooth parts! Eh, oh well, that hopefully means the bottoms of will start peeling tonight when the wife gets home from work. We can sit back, have some wine, eat some ice cream, watch some DVR&#x27;ed movies, and peel skin like the freaks we are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another update: cue the itchy peely toes...did anyone else have this stiff work this fast? the bottom and sides of my feel are starting to look like the final stages of a monarch butterfly metamorphosis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-23-13&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nearing the end of day two, and there are a couple of spots in the house that look like a 20 foot anaconda molted and slithered off into the Amazon (heehee). The tops and toes are peeling like crazy, and the bottoms are starting up. The only bad thing (besides the trail of dead skin...how am i supposed to play hide and seek with my kids now???) is the bottoms of my feet are a little uncomfortable, like, well, the skin is stretching and about to peel off. I feel sorry for whoever has to vacuum this crap up lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-24-13&lt;br /&gt;Bazinga! Had my first huge piece of skin come off the bottom! And only 2 days after the start, not bad! Most of the area is still to sensitive to pull the skin off. I thought i had a piece of fuzz hanging off my toe when i got home from work, but it was all the skin off my toe! The calluses are coming off my big toes, which gosh, i&#x27;m sure you wall wanted to know. But if you have dino feet like me and that other reviewer, you&#x27;ll sympathize! This big suckers eat their way thru the covers on the bed at night like afreakin cracked out mole through wet sand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-29-13&lt;br /&gt;Let me summarize the last 4 or 5 days...SKIN EVERYWHERRRRE! we&#x27;ve had to vacuum a couple times, simply because it wouldn&#x27;t stop coming off hahaha...i slept without socks for the first time last night, and by golly i&#x27;ll probably do it again tonite. my toes seem to be able to regenerate the calluses on the sides of them, so if you have that problem like me, it&#x27;ll take some sanding and major lotioning to keep up the smoothynesses that the babyfoot stuff did for me. To sum it up, the 5 stars i gave it the first day still hold! i have no idea how long my feet&#x27;ll stay smooth, but i&#x27;ll enjoy my day or two of no socks to bed!freakin cracked out mole through wet sand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-29-13&lt;br /&gt;Let me summarize the last 4 or 5 days...SKIN EVERYWHERRRRE! we&#x27;ve had to vacuum a couple times, simply because it wouldn&#x27;t stop coming off hahaha...i slept without socks for the first time last night, and by golly i&#x27;ll probably do it again tonite. my toes seem to be able to regenerate the calluses on the sides of them, so if you have that problem like me, it&#x27;ll take some sanding and major lotioning to keep up the smoothynesses that the babyfoot stuff did for me.

    <li> A &amp;#34;must do&amp;#34; before flip flop season</li>
    <li> Full results yet to be determined, which is why I currently give the product 3 stars.  I&#x27;ll update as I proceed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Took a 30 minute hot bath with sea salt soak in order to prepare my feet.  I opened the package and cut open the bootie packets which were exactly as pictured.  There is a lavender smell but also something sharper and a bit stringent, which is not surprising.  Overall not a bad smell.  It was fairly unpleasant sliding my feet into cold jelly, and some liquid did ooze out the top, so I recommend having an old towel under your feet for the duration.  The tape that came with the booties to close them up around your ankles was completely useless, so I just slid on some old fuzzy socks and that held them on well enough.  Sat for an hour and then because the baby was sleeping, carefully made my way upstairs - NOT advised.  Very hard to walk.  I removed the booties and rinsed my feet very well in the tub - did not re-soak as I did not have time.  No lotion.  About four hours later my feet felt a bit puffy and kind of burned - as if I&#x27;d been walking on hot sand all day.  The skin also felt a bit itchy.  There was no redness and this feeling subsided by the time I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Skin might look a little shiny, otherwise no change.  Stopped up the shower drain to soak feet while I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Now we&#x27;re talking...soaked my feet for 15 minutes after work and had large areas of shedding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4-5: Shedding continued in smaller amounts.  Not quite the huge sheets that previous reviews had led me to believe, but perhaps because I was not soaking (except day 3), just stopping up the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days 6-8: This was the annoying part.  Itchy flaky skin on tops and sides of my feet, more irritating than anything else.  It was like a constant shower of tiny flakes any time I moved my feet, and was driving me crazy.  Finally took a pumice stone to it to end it because I was fed up.  At this point I also put lotion on the tops and sides of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Eh.  It was fun, interesting to see the process, but I don&#x27;t feel like the real problem areas got any more result than a particularly thorough pedicure would have.  I still have thick areas on the balls of my feet and heels.  Maybe if I try again and am aggressive with daily soaking but for now I&#x27;ll stick with pedicures.  It was a cool experiment but not the rave reviews I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be continued.dict: Eh.

    <li> This product is the only one of it&#x27;s kind that actually completely peels off layers of dead skin. It&#x27;s not a pretty process but if you can stand to wear the plastic booties for an hour and then socks for the next week afterwards they&#x27;re great. The skin takes a couple days to start peeling and then the skin on your entire feet including the tops will shed off. I&#x27;ve used these twice and it takes about a week for the skin to completely come off with me helping peel off some of the skin. You have to wear socks for a week during the process so it&#x27;s not good to do it in the summer or if you&#x27;re planning on wearing sandals.</li>
    <li> Love it..great product...amazing results...but less expensive elsewhere.</li>
    <li> great great item !  try it would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> The individual foot packs were too small and should be made in larger sizes.  I wear a size 12 men&#x27;s shoe, and the foot packs were near impossible to fit on my feet. Also, some areas on the soles and heels of my feet did not peel at all, so I think that each individual foot pack should probably contain a lot more product.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go as far as to say &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t buy this product,&amp;#34; but if you do buy it, you need to be aware that it seems to work wonderfully for some people and not at all for others.  And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than luck involved, as far as I can tell.  I followed the package directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and even soaked my feet each night religiously, as many reviewers here have suggested.  Despite this, not so much as a single flake came off either of my feet.  I am so disappointed, not to mention annoyed at wasting $20!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after five days the dead skin just rolled off.  My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom except for a spot on my heels that I have to still use a pumice on.  I will use again before the summer.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Feet grossly peel for a few days, so don&#x27;t do it in summer, but it does what it claims and my feet were soft and smooth afterward.</li>
    <li> Love baby foot exfoliation, in a matter of days my feet went from very dry, cracked heels to smooth and soft.  The peeling last about 3 days but it does not hurt in the least.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As I have grown older, so have my feet. Where they used to be soft and smooth, they developed calluses and cracked heels. Weekly soaks with Johnson Foot Soap followed by a session with a pumice stone help, but I wanted a much quicker solution to get back to pretty feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Baby Foot at Amazon&#x27;s website, and after reading other customers&#x27; positive reviews, decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state to remove nail polish from your toenails prior to use and to clean your feet thoroughly. After removing my nail polish, I soaked my feet in a Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soak for a half hour, occasionally brushing them with a bath brush. Then I dried my feet thoroughly before slipping on the Baby Foot booties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The booties are completely sealed when they arrive, and you simply cut the top off. They are full of a gel that is a little cool, but not uncomfortably so. You wear these booties for two hours, taking care not to &#x60;spread&#x27; the gel. I took that to mean they don&#x27;t want you to walk much, and I tried to sit still, but that is sometimes easier said than done. I did minimize my movements and stayed seated as long as possible, but I will confess to getting up probably three times while wearing the booties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the two hours is up, you are advised to immediately wash your feet well, then clean the tub or sink that you washed your feet in. The first thing I noticed after washing and drying my feet is that the biggest callouses (which were on my big toes), were nearly completely gone. Any raised skin was gone. There were still callouses and cracked heels, but there was an immediate improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that the dead skin should start to peel off your feet in approximately two days and the complete process may take seven days. I soaked my feet in the booties on a Saturday night and didn&#x27;t really have much dead skin peeling until Wednesday. Once it started, though, it really started. The peeling continued until the second Sunday (8 days after I performed the treatment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result is really amazing. While I still have a few small areas that could use attention, my feet are so much nicer now. The calluses on my big toes are gone, and I have just a little bit of the cracked heels left, but it was mostly taken care of with one treatment. My feet were in such bad shape by the time I did this, I&#x27;m not surprised that I might need a second treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to easily melt away calluses and cracked heels from their feet.e second Sunday (8 days after I performed the treatment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result is really amazing.

    <li> I&#x27;m going to give them one more shot.  I used it about 2-3 months ago, and after a couple of weeks, I peeled. NOTHING like the picture representations here, but my feet flaked a little. (Like almost not at all,) I think the reason for that is somewhere (package directions?) I only kept the booties on for 90 minutes, I&#x27;ll post an update when I do it once more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I used two treatments over 6 months and was very happy with the results. I went and got a pedicure 2 weeks ago and came home with newly cracked heels and &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;, scratchy feet. Those files they use are what ruin our feet! I&#x27;ll use Baby Feet forever now!</li>
    <li> Product instructions were not in English and did not exfoliate as advertised.</li>
    <li> This foot peel is excellent! It is a much better use of your money than a pedicure. I recommend just using this and then paint your own nails and so on (if you are able to). The only thing I would note is make sure to follow the instructions (soaking your feet first and leave the booties on for an hour) exactly. I have used this 3 times and have been very happy with the results each time. I didn&#x27;t have the inclination to take pictures to post however I will tell you that the pictures posted by other consumers showing excessive peeling and then fresh clean feet is very acurate.</li>
    <li> You have to try this to believe it.  I used for the whole 2 hours and was amazed at my feet following the peeling procedure.  I may try again within a fw weeks because my feet were pretty bad but wouldn&#x27;t really need to because it was that good.</li>
    <li> Worked within 5 days! Be prepared for your feet to shed dead skin for a week. I wore socks to bed to save my bed sheets.</li>
    <li> I read nothing but rave reviews on Baby Foot and wanted to try it. My feet are very calloused around the heels and the callouses are very thick and hard. I did follow the instructions, wash, soak feet, put on booties for 1 hour, wash feet. My feet did peel after 5 days however they didn&#x27;t really peel at all. The peel was very light and my heels didn&#x27;t really peel at all, they still have hard thick callouses. So it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me, what a waste of $30.00!</li>
    <li> Product flaked, not peeled. Feet are not softer.</li>
    <li> SOOOOO DISAPPOINTING!!!! I had really high hopes for this product, but it literally did NOTHING!!! I should have spent the $30 on a pedicure!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, beats that hard scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described. I have used it before with great results and this was the same.  I put the plastic &amp;#34;booties&amp;#34; on and then sort if massage my feet and toes (top/bottom) and then I put on a pair of mid calf socks on! I also leave on for 2 hours (while I watch a movie on TV)</li>
    <li> Unbelievably fast delivery, and the products were perfect! Also, they had the very best price on Baby Foot I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
    <li> The produce did an amazing job. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product!! I found a review/ usage guide on Refinery29 that walked through the steps on how to make it most effective. After two weeks, the product worked and my feet are much smoother. I definitely recommend soaking your feet often during the process.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the desired results.</li>
    <li> I purchased baby foot after reading a blog the reviews. It smells nice but my results were nothing like what the reviews said. I followed all the directions. Nothing happened the first day other that i had dry feet. The third day my feet began to flake. By day four my feet were flaking like a bad sun burn. It didn&#x27;t hurt but was very annoying. It flaked on both the top and bottom of my foot. It took about three days for the flaking to stop. My feet didn&#x27;t seem any better off then they were before the wrap. I would suggest spending your money on a pedicure or foot file instead.</li>
    <li> This product works for me. It took about 4-5 days before my feet starts peeling. The whole process took over an week. The result was not bad. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> bought this in asia once-price here same as @drugstore there-so good deal . Does what it says-peel old skin off to reveal new baby skin.  what i realized i didn&#x27;t like was that it takes off a layer (or 2 or 3) regardless of whether skin is healthy or calloused since you soak entire feet in it. feet are smoother, but for my purposes i&#x27;m moving on to stuff that just target the callous only</li>
    <li> this stuff is awsome i have had the worest skin on my feet even my doc. cant belive  how my feet are even after using meds he had me use they look like some one elses feet now they are soft and no chuncky dry skin peeling off. If it wasent for a frind i would never none of this prodect . You really do need to try this if you have dry feet.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because she has rough feet and she kept telling me that it was itchy when she put it on but after 2 days it started to peel and she was so happy with the result! definitely going to order again :)</li>
    <li> after 5 days your feet will shed dead skin like you never thought possible! I do it about once every few months.</li>
    <li> my feet peeled but it took 5 days so at first I thought it was not working but it is ok</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  Second purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Lived up to the expectation wow.</li>
    <li> This was the best! My feet felt so great afterwards! I use this stuff every few months to keep my feet fresh.</li>
    <li> Be ready for your feet to peel like crazy, but when it&#x27;s done your feet will be oh so soft for a couple of months!!!</li>
    <li> This was a pretty cool product! It worked as advertised (although, it took longer than expected for my skin to start peeling). My feet were left super smooth and silky. My only issue with this product is the price, I feel its overpriced !</li>
    <li> I was in a hurry and skipped the step of soaking my feet before using it (since it was a suggestion)  and then just showered for four days or so afterwards with nothing happening to my feet. I finally took a bath and that did the trick but still, the sloughing is pretty superficial.  I will try the product again, soaking my feet first, and then take baths instead of showers to see if it makes a difference.  I think it will.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that I hate this product, but that it didn&#x27;t do what was promised.  I followed the directions given in reviews---soak 30 min, wear Baby Foot for 90 minutes, soak 30 min again, then daily 30 min soak until peeling starts.  I had only a tiny bit of peeling on the tops of my feet.  No peeling whatsoever on the bottoms of my feet.  *sigh*  Guess it&#x27;s back to daily pumice scrubs.</li>
    <li> It just left a lot flakes all over.  The areas of my foot that really needed sloughing didn&#x27;t peel.  In fact it left my foot really dry.  I finally soaked my feet and used a file after 10 days.  It definitely made filing easier but didn&#x27;t leave my feet like a baby&#x27;sfoot</li>
    <li> My wife used this product deligently  and it didn&#x27;t work like it was promised. Very small amount of peeling on the top of the feet after 7 days. We won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I just got around to using this item, I followed all instructions and it burned my feet after about 30 minutes. I continued on for the entire time and the only thing that it did was turn my feet RED, nothing else. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> A lifetime of going barefoot inside and an aversion to socks with most shoes plus two years of desert living in sandals and my feet were finally ready for walking on hot coals! Cue Baby Foot praise online and a last ditch effort to have soft feet again since being a toddler.  Baby Foot has worked well for me! As other reviewers have mentioned... 1. Soak feet for at least 30 minutes before using Baby Foot to soften the skin and help the feet absorb the gel better. 2. Leave Baby Foot on for 1.5 to 2 hours as long as your feet are not feeling irritated by the gel. 3. Rinse gel off well. 4. Soak feet daily or every other day in warm water mixed with  plain old Listerine (yellow kind) and vinegar to soften the dead skin so it will slough off more easily. 5. You can pick off the dead skin. Just be careful and be patient. 6. Wear socks during peeling process to keep the dead skin flakes contained. Good luck with your baby foot journey. Softer feet can be yours again, friend. You can use the 2nd pack two weeks later if you still have some tough calluses you want completely gone.</li>
    <li> It did take off a lot of the dead skin, but now I used the electric roller kind of device that works even better!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really work for me. and i followed the detailed steps left by another reviewer</li>
    <li> This stuff works as designed, which is great.  I sat on the couch one Sunday afternoon for an hour with the booties on during my children&#x27;s nap time. I put the booties on with the solution and then socks over the booties (as suggested).  Didn&#x27;t look any different when I was done, however in 5-7 days I started to see peeling. The peeling does continue for a few weeks, so you may want to consider the time of year when doing this treatment. After the peeling, new soft skin was revealed.  I never have this kind of success after a pedicure or paraffin wax. This stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well for me...my feet never really peeled...just barely. I was so excited to receive this product because I wanted it to work so badly but it didn&#x27;t. I was very disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> Over 7 days and still peeling. Would of given it 5 but, I feel like a lizzard and peeling every day. Can&#x27;t wait for the end result.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It takes about 2 days for anything to start happening. It&#x27;s been a week and my feet are still shedding like crazy but all the skin that has already shedded is super soft. I know it takes up to 2 weeks to fully get all the dead skin off. I do recommend wearing socks at all times during this process so you don&#x27;t get dead skin everywhere. This stuff works as I hoped and I would totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked as describe, excellent product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FOI7X3E0V33K]]Here&#x27;s my posted audio review with some pictures of my peeling feet.  I hope you find it helpful -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just really surprised that Baby Foot hasn&#x27;t made a bigger splash in the U.S.</li>
    <li> worked--but did take 4 to 5 days before the skin started to peel--but I did like the results and even ordered another pack to treat my feet again--this and a pumice stone should keep my feet young and smooth!!  Nice product --with they made a face peel too!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the woman who does my manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and washed my feet beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week after the application the outer skin on my feet that were in the gel booties began peeling and now they&#x27;re soft as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not want anyone to see my feet during this week of peeling since it&#x27;s gradual and not all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband put the gel booties on after me to see if it would work for him too (and save $) and it worked for him too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a slight tingly sensation on my feet during the 1-hour soaking but nothing the least bit painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t Work as promised!!!  Definitely NOT WORTH the money!!</li>
    <li> made my man feet look good, the peel is slow and there is no need to pick at it.  I would buy it again and may in a few months to make my feet even nicer.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this and found myself to be sorely disappointed when this didn&#x27;t work as described. I had some peeling but nothing like how you see in some photos/testimonies. My feet were pretty bad to begin with as I stand most of the day. I read a few reviews pointing out that the American baby foot product contains fruit acids instead of the Japanese version which contains the actual salicylic acid which acts as a superior exfoliant as it really sloughs away dead skin. That will be my next purchase. I&#x27;ll be looking for the Japanese version to try it again. ( Japanese characters on the box).</li>
    <li> These booties really work!</li>
    <li> I tend to get very deep, fissure cracks on my heels and my skin is extremely dry. I often go to bed with bag balm on my feet covered with socks. It softens, but the dryness returns almost immediately. I was a bit skeptical I admit, but I put the booties on as directed. After 20 minutes I ended up cutting off the top 4 inches because it burned my toenails a bit. It still worked well and the dead skin began to come off 4 days later after 45 minutes in a lake. I do recommend soaking in water before the application and after to keep it coming loose. My feet have not been this soft in many years. I will do it again if necessary. As a note, I did not apply with having any cracks. I do believe it might sting as a side note.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product really, really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has an extreme problem with cracked dry skin on his feet. Even though I am a health care professional and I see bare feet quite often at the hospital, I have never seen dry skin like the cracked skin on my husband&#x27;s feet! This product basically took ALL of the dead skin off! For the first time since I have known my husband, he has soft, smooth, baby skin on his feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I will continue to use every two to three months.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! It does take a couple weeks and it can get messy messy messy, but my feet were definitely much smoother after. Only the thickest part of my heel was still a little rough, but nothing a pedicure couldn&#x27;t manage. Soaking your feet every night (the longer the better) helps get the skin off much faster. I would absolutely recommend this, especially if you have very calloused feet.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this was so effective, I am compelled to share. I have always battled with the dry skin and callous on my feet. It doesn&#x27;t help that I hate to wear shoes. I followed the directions carefully and then forgot about it. A few days later, I was stunned at how flaky my feet were. It&#x27;s so not pretty, but it is so effective!  I helped it along by using a pumice stone in the shower (not dry).  I can&#x27;t get over the difference!</li>
    <li> Used the product exactly as directed. My feet flaked not peeled, but it all happened with in the advertised time period. I did go swimming in a friends pool that was a pebble tech pool and I think that really helped the exfoliating process. Most of the flakes were gone after that. My feet were NOT baby soft after and it did NOT get rid of all the callouses on my heels. I had severe cracked heels and the spots that were the worst before still had some callouse left after. Even the spots that were not as bad were not exactly &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; after. Overall it was a definate improvement but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again for the price.</li>
    <li> Probably the worst purchase I have ever made.  I spent two hours applying this product and saw absolutely no results whatsoever.  I think my heels looked better before I used this. Save your self time and money and pass this one up!!</li>
    <li> Greatest little invention.  An all natural, extremely effective product to eliminate the touch skin on your feet.  I wear flip flops 365 days a year and therefore had cracked, rough and ragged heels etc.  Its crazy as it is mild and yet very effective product - it is really amazing.</li>
    <li> I just tried Baby foot last week-end and it worked like a charm! At first I didn&#x27;t think I left it on long enough because I didn&#x27;t see anything at first but a few days later It started! I won&#x27;t take you thought the grisly details but the product works. Bottom line, if your feet ( and I&#x27;m being kind when I say this) a jacked-up and your ashamed to go barefoot try Baby Foot. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Wish the Amazon description states the fact that you cannot use this product while you&#x27;re pregnant or nursing. I am nursing for another 8 months so I can&#x27;t use it until then! I was so excited to use this! BUMMER!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It did remove all the dead skin, but my feet were back to their origional condition within several weeks. Expensive and time consuming for such short term results.You need to follow the directions to the letter, and then soak your feet in water every day for the next week or so to get the most dramatic results. Don&#x27;t skip the soaking part!!!</li>
    <li> worked great!! love it!</li>
    <li> They are right--it will take about a week to start seeing the peeling. But, man, this does leave your skin very, very soft. I did not &#x27;soak&#x27; every day like some suggested. I just showered and then would use the towel to rub. After about three days I could see some skin coming off (gross, I know) but the man effects where about six days in. You could peel off like a sunburn. It seemed to leave my skin smoother than using a rasp or pumice or the other chemical callous removers. I will repurchase but would not use this real often (for fear of it being bad for your health).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase!  I&#x27;ve always liked this film, and I particularly enjoyed the commentary with Shirley Jones.  It was great fun hearing her recollections of working on the film and the people involved with it.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I soaked my feet for 45 minutes before proceeding with the Baby Foot treatment. Instructions were followed to the letter.  After 2 weeks peeling did begin, the layer that came off was quite thin and made very little difference in my feet.  I would recommend a good pedicure over Baby Foot, at least your toenails will be done.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it works. Didn&#x27;t realize it would take quite so long to work but it did the trick!</li>
    <li> Bought myself one and liked it a lot.  Bought two more for the kids!</li>
    <li> This peel really does work!!! I was sceptical during the first two days of not seeing any shedding. BUT BAM! On the third day, peeling and shedding began. I soaked my feet in very warm water several times, to help the shedding. I plan on using baby foot every 6 months for my dry and cracked heels. Thank you for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Smooth results and I would recommend it to anyone who wants smooth feet. Very effective. Just wish there was more in this package.</li>
    <li> Did not work bought 2 of them one for myself and one for my daughter. Both of us had a little bit of flaking of dead skin on about 5th day.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Its OK. Will not try again</li>
    <li> This product works but it takes a long time....weeks for the process to be complete,</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does what it advertises it will do...my feet peeled like snake skin withun the span of a week after using the product, I exfoliate every time I showered and moisturizers as well. My feet are baby skin smooth, I will be buying this product again</li>
    <li> So I have horrible feet (I really should have taken pictures). Cracked and all decrepid looking. My heels are a disaster. I found this product while looking for something to help moisturize my feet or do something with them. I was skeptical at first, &amp;#34;Fruit acids&amp;#34;, yeah right, but I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet in my girlfriend&#x27;s foot bath thing, which was really nice by the way with some nice epson salts. Dried them off and stuck my feet in these gross gel packs for the time it takes to watch 2 episodes of Sons of Anarchy. I almost died getting another glass of water because you really shouldn&#x27;t walk in these gel slipper thingies. Keep whatever you need for however long you wear them handy. I&#x27;d recommend a roll of paper towels handy too so you can wipe yourself off before you traipse off to the bathtub to wash off your tootsies. I didn&#x27;t, and got gel all over, stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho. The box and reviews are all like &amp;#34;WAIT 5 DAYS&amp;#34;, I thought &amp;#34;I know this is a scam, i just know it&amp;#34;. Yet, day 3, my toes started shedding skin. It wasn&#x27;t what I wanted but ok. After 4 days and nothing happened I figured nothing else was going to happen, either the product was rubbish or my feet were terrible. Day 7 I nearly screamed when I saw my feet literally flaking as I walked. It was nuts, skin was everywhere. Day 8? I was like a friggin snake, I was shedding skin and sure enough, baby smooth skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, pretty much my entire foot has been reborn. My heels, well, I think I need to see a pedicurist to really get those suckers under control, but the product really does work. My feet actually feel pretty great, and they are not gross to look at. I no longer sneer at &amp;#34;Fruit Acids&amp;#34;. This stuff works, give it a week after your treatment.</li>
    <li> It peels as directed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I did it and everything was as described. My feet started to peel 5 days after and now my feet are as soft as my 6 months old baby :)</li>
    <li> Awesome product I have been looking for this for 20 years and finally it&#x27;s here and I love it!!</li>
    <li> My new favorite thing!!!  Soak your feet before, and every day for 5 days.  You will be AMAZED!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It was worth every penny that I sent on it because no pedicure I have ever had would have gotten rid of that much dead skin. I will purchase this again but I shouldn&#x27;t need another application for several months and yes my feet are baby soft. No more steel wool on the bottom of my feet. By the way, the peeling process takes about two weeks to complete with additional soaking of the feet  periodically. You don&#x27;t want to peel the skin off unless it&#x27;s coming off on its on already or else you could cause your feet to be really sore.</li>
    <li> I also followed the instructions and had no results. I&#x27;m sure this is a scam. It&#x27;s a perfectly orchestrated one too: since you apply the pack on your feet you can&#x27;t ask for your money back. It shouldn&#x27;t take 2-7 days for the dead skin to be exfoliated if it were a legitimate product. Doubt it was made in Japan. Do not buy. Go to a podiatrist instead if you have insurance or just soak your feet and use the pumice stone.</li>
    <li> This product is total crap. My husband followed the directions perfectly and his feet never peeled in the least little bit. I have no idea how these other people &amp;#34;got it to work&amp;#34; but don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money.</li>
    <li> not great at all. when you use this product, you feet peel for a week, the skin falls everywhere, you cannot even go out unless you wear boot. and after 2 weeks your feet get worst , same pb than before using .</li>
    <li> Takes days to see result. Not perfect, but works.</li>
    <li> This product works fine for very light dry skin but does NOT work for heavily callused heals and pads of feet. Followed directions exactly ...left on the correct time. The day after, I soaked feet for about 10 minutes.  Soaked again several days after and then the peel started. But the peel was only the very light dry skin OTHER THAN the heavy callused areas. Those areas, this foot mask didnt even put a dent in it. Never peeled on the super hard callused areas. Will never waste $$ on this again.</li>
    <li> It definitely works, and as per the instructions after a few days my feet began to peel. I don&#x27;t know how it works, and it is definitely weird, but I can&#x27;t argue with the results.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a scam or something. I didn&#x27;t think it would work but because I trusted the reviews of other customers I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so happy to say that it worked. My feet were damaged from me walking on them while pregnant. I don&#x27;t know how but my heels had raised scales on them. It would scratch my husbands legs at night and he made me wear socks to bed. Well baby foot worked and those nasty looking thick chunks of skin that were on my heels and big toes are gone. It ever took off my callus.I peeled it off with the rest of the skin. I&#x27;m still peeling because it&#x27;s been 7 days and I haven&#x27;t had the time to get it all off but it is so wonderful and I&#x27;m very happy it worked on my thick skin I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> It did not work. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not remove any dead skin.  Pure waste of money.  I even followed the suggestion the product gave to soak your feet first and still nothing.</li>
    <li> better then a pedicure. Its nasty when the peeling starts but your feet are super soft after a couple of weeks. Will do this now 4x a year and have always nice feet.</li>
    <li> This is not the easiest product to use.  Sitting for an hour or two with slippery bags on your feet, followed by somehow getting to a bathroom to wash it off is at least boring.  Then you just want it to work.  I actually noticed nothing - so won&#x27;t be doing this again.</li>
    <li> I read about Baby Foot and had to give it a try.  It does a great job of removing dead skin from your feet (it is as gross as all the pictures show when it really starts peeling, so do wear socks), but is only so-so on callouses (which it does warn you about).  I got best results by wearing the socks for a bit longer than instructed, and by soaking my feet before using and every day after until they stopped peeling.</li>
    <li> I hate to leave negative reviews, but I used this product as directed and soaked my feet for two hours. It has been 5 days and no peeling of any kind has started. My feet don&#x27;t even look like there is any change. After the treatment they felt drier than usual and were a little itchy which I thought yeah they are getting ready to peel. Nope, no peeling.  I had so hoped this product would work for me. I even soaked them on day 4 as one reviewer suggested. I am contemplating purchasing another and trying it again, but I don&#x27;t know if I should waste $20. Maybe I just have really tough feet, although they are dry they don&#x27;t have deep cracks. I would rate my feet as standard with dry skin, so this product should of worked wonders right?  The product itself is simple to use and there is no odor. I recommend watching a show or reading while you are doing the treatment, because they are too slippery to walk in. Another reviewer gave a great tip of slipping on your uggs or something similar and that would probably work. However it does say the product could stain clothes, rugs, or furniture, so I would be careful :)</li>
    <li> I  love this product,  it does exactly what it says and my feet have never looked better! So worth it!</li>
    <li> This product got rid of my very dry heels. I had to use it twice but it was well worth the $$</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually think it would work but sure enough 4 days later and my feet have started to peel like the product had advertised.  I could tell a big difference in my feet within the first 2 days.  the package only comes with one pair of booties so i put them in a zip lock baggie so I could reuse them.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product.  Got this thinking there was a good chance that this would all be hype, but it is NOT.  By the 5th day, my feet starting peeling and didn&#x27;t stop for the next 8 days or so.  the end result is amazing.  For the 1st 3 days or so, I kept touching my feet because I couldn&#x27;t believe that they were actually mine!!!  I NEVER thought my feet could feel this smooth ever again.  So happy I got this.  And I will 1000% purchase this again.  Will be interesting to see how long it takes before they start getting yucky again, but by using this, it really gives you an awesome headstart to keep up with them on your daily showers anyway.  Well worth the money</li>
    <li> While my feet did end up softer after I used this product but it took quite a bit of elbow grease on my part. I read several reviews before hand and did a presoak followed by the foot pack followed by another soak for the next couple of days. By the fourth day I had not noticed any peeling but I took a foot file to my foot and after quite a bit of scrubbing they did come out much smoother then had I not used the product. So for that I give it three stars. Not sure I would pay The cost of the product to do it again anytime soon since my feet were apparently not that bad off to begin with. My guess is that this product works much better for people with extremely dry and cracked feet.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Took a while to get but great product</li>
    <li> Works great!!! My feet are still peeling, only used 4 days ago but so far is great. I have found that soaking your feet in water really helps, been doing once/day since day 2, and the peeling started immediately.</li>
    <li> This product was a fun bonding experience with my boyfriend. Some how but the graces I was able to convince him to do it with me. It doesn&#x27;t work for the first two days, and then all the sudden. BAM! My boyfriends feet peeled like crazy!! Mine did as well, but not as extreme. I HIGHLY suggest to take a foot bath each day. For ours we used a little bit of olive oil, and a touch of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap.</li>
    <li> works great!  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Do you make a full body suit?!  I followed the instructions of the Reviewer who suggested soaking and it worked perfectly!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> It really works will purchase again if needed.If calluses aren&#x27;t really BAD it will help.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm, I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten 2 at the time. My feet were pretty bad, I think after a week and a half the dead skin was still falling off. It made them so smooth, this product is awesome. I definitely recommend it, if u want soft feet &amp; toes. 5 stars will be purchasing another soon.</li>
    <li> Took longer than I expected for the peeling, but once it started there is a definite difference!!!  I will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my feet.  They look better then ever!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great on my feet. Better than a pedicure. I def will buy this product in the near future.</li>
    <li> This stuff really work!  Be ready for the wet feel that you place your foot into the footsie bags for one entire hour.  You will feel some heat more on the top of your feet.  Immediately you will feel drying of the feet, but it will take one week to two weeks for your feet to actually start to peel.  Not deep peeling and it does not hurt.  No lies when they say baby foot, because your feet will feel super soft, the more the feet peel off callus or just skin that has become a little more rougher on your feet.  I would not put the footsies on the top of the feet next time, because you also peel there up to your ankles, if you allow the gel like substance to touch your upper part of your feet.  No need for skin to peel there since most people&#x27;s upper part of their feet are not coarse or rough.  Good deal and product actually works.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My entire family uses it. I&#x27;ve also recommended it to license cosmetologist. It removed many layers of dead skin, leaving my feet feeling soft and smooth. The peeling process does not began until 3-5 days after applying. If you have a build up of dead skin, I recommend purchasing more than 1 box. Be sure to soak your feet in warm water for about 30 minutes prior to use. This allows the skin to loosen.making it easier to peel off. It&#x27;s an easy painless process. Please read instructions carefully and follow as directed.</li>
    <li> No peeling. Just cracked dry horrible.</li>
    <li> All I received was a clear plastic bag with the footies; no ties, no instructions. It didn&#x27;t work but I didn&#x27;t soak first.</li>
    <li> I bought because of the reviees and I never thought I have this much dead skin on my feet! I will let my friends try it as well! Really good product!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for the product as my feet are a nightmare - hard, thick skin and cracked heels.  Well, the treatment was easy to use and the skin peeled off in sheets as promised, but the heels and areas with considerable calluses/thick skin just didn&#x27;t come off.  I ended up using my scraper anyway for these areas. As I bought two intially, I&#x27;ll use the other one for spring prep, but this time I&#x27;ll know that the results won&#x27;t be magical.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do as much as they made it seem like it would, disappointed!</li>
    <li> Expect your feet to be in bad shape a couple weeks. Hard to deal with for so long.</li>
    <li> Love Baby Foot!!!  I need to purchase these again and will do so in the near future!</li>
    <li> It definitely works, but you have to be patient. Soak your feet everyday!</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations.  Callouses are still in place.</li>
    <li> My sister bought one of these for me, herself, and my mom to use at girls night. We all felt silly and I was sure it wouldnt work, but three days later my feet started to peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later and all of us have had great results and swear we&#x27;ll buy it again. Best beauty product I&#x27;ve used in a LONG time!!!</li>
    <li> The product was okay, but took about 2 weeks for the full process to work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true that a large layer of skin did peel off. I don&#x27;t think that it had any impact on my (very moderate) calluses- it barely peeled any skin there at all.</li>
    <li> Maybe me feet weren&#x27;t bad enough, but this did not give me the results I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Gosh, who knew this would be my favorite new beauty find? I followed the directions perfectly plus the review suggestions about daily soaking. Still skeptical, you can imagine my surprise when I could pull a sheet of dead dried skin from the sole of my foot. I did not force it away, it just came. This was on day 4 and continued for another 4 days to lesser degree as the days went on. I do suggest wearing socks continually until its all gone. My husband was picking up small skin molts for a few days when I went without.  Not very romantic, especially in bed, huh.</li>
    <li> Omg !! Finally. I feel like a new person. My feet were more then terrible and I get them done monthly but I could get them done weekly there so horrible. I recommend to all. So happy ❤️</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s feet where very soft after about two weeks. She said that her feet itched for the first week. She had it on her feet for about one hour. Her heels needed more time. Next time I would try two hours.</li>
    <li> At first you&#x27;ll be like &amp;#34;Nothing&#x27;s happening.  What a rip-off!&amp;#34;  Then you&#x27;ll wake up one day and you&#x27;ll have zombie feet.  After your shower you&#x27;ll feel like your feet are rotting away.  It&#x27;s almost scary.  Then, about a week and three days later, you&#x27;ll have fresh, beautiful BABY FEET.  I loved this stuff so much I bought some for my husband&#x27;s gnarly feetz.  Now he has Prince Charming feet.  They should market it to boys as Prince Charming Feet.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever bought to give a pedi. Feet feel amazing&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Watch the description--I paid for what I thought was two separate treatments, I received only one.  I feel I overpaid.</li>
    <li> Worked! Will be buying it again when my feet are in need. Was gross and fascinating to see my feet peel so badly.</li>
    <li> Loved Baby Foot. I was always embarrassed by how dry and cracked and ugly my heels were. Not anymore. I&#x27;ve recommended Baby Foot to several people.</li>
    <li> It takes days to see any peeling, and then it was mostly in my arch (where I don&#x27;t have callus) and very little on my heels or ball of the foot.  After using, I noticed that people recommended soaking your feet first and massaging it in while wearing the booties.  I did neither, but these suggestions were not on the directions.  Perhaps they would have made a difference.  It&#x27;s off for a spa pedicure asap where they DO take care of my calluses.  Also, I thought this was two applications, it&#x27;s just two booties, and if you have two feet, that equals one use.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> definitely works!!!!! my feet are not as rough as they were after having kids.  great product.  Just be careful to not walk around, you&#x27;ll fall</li>
    <li> Awesome product that never disappoints.  Absolutely love!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  My husband&#x27;s feet were chock full of callouses, etc.  Baby Foot took care of al of that - layers of dead skin peeled off and his feet became so soft!</li>
    <li> I have always had callouses on my feet and had never found a viable solution.  I used &amp;#34;Baby Foot&amp;#34; and starting on day 6 (for the next 4 days) the skin started peeling away starting with the top of my feet.  Even the thick callouses on my heels are completely gone!!  The skin on my feet is down to pink and it hasn&#x27;t hurt at all!  I even played competitive basketball right when it was peeling off and it didn&#x27;t hurt.  This is incredible and I&#x27;m telling everyone about it!  I soaked my feet for 20 minutes before applying the product and I think that helped.  I could not recommend this more highly!</li>
    <li> I followed all of the instructions perfectly- socks for 2 hours, daily soaking etc. Product did not work at all, but did make my feel worse. Totally disappointed and out 20 bucks</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I soaked my feet per the instructions and in about 3-4 days my feet started to peel.  I noticed that my heels were still pretty rough, so I used the ped egg to scrape some of the dead skin off.  I&#x27;m about a week into the process and my right foot is done shedding and so soft.  My left foot is just now starting to shed. My husband was amazed at how well the product worked and how well it removed my &amp;#34;spurs&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Worked okay. After five days my feet started to peel and some areas were very soft. Unfortunately the calloused areas remained calloused and my feet were rougher than prior to the treatment. Bought one for my mother as well with similar results. Certainly not worth the price for one treatment and I will stick to using my Amope.</li>
    <li> My feet are amazing after the initial &amp;#34;snake skin shedding&amp;#34; ! The skin sluffing takes about a full week in phases but is well worth the process. Gets rid of cracked tough heel calloused skin like no other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Did just about everything it said it would do but either my feet were really bad or this product didn&#x27;t make my feet perfectly baby smooth.  Still a great product and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works like a charm. After day 4 is when the magic happens.</li>
    <li> The directions in the box are not detailed and I found good instructions on line. 1) soak feet for 15 min in plain water before using Baby Foot; 2) use Baby Foot exactly as directed; 3) Wash feet with soap and water, rinse, then soak feet again in plain water for 15 min. 4) If skin sloughing does not begin after 2-4 days, soak feet for 30 min in plain water. When feet are blotted dry you should see sloughing and peeling. More sloughing and peeling will occur if you soak another 30 min. 5) Thereafter for the next two weeks, continue to soak feet in plain water for 30 min to an hour ever day or every other day to encourage more peeling and sloughing.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The skin ever peeled like they said it would. I give it &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.. It does exactly what it claims to do. When your feet first start peeling, you really want to be sure you are wearing socks or at least not going barefoot because stuff will fall off your feet. Soaking your feet regularly after the application helps to control some of the when and where the skin comes off. My feet have never been so soft :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Peeling began within 2 days.  TIP:  Soak your feet everyday, don&#x27;t just rely on the shower.  This speeds up the process.  I used a pumice stone to help the dead skin peel off.  It&#x27;s been a month since I have used it and my feet are still baby soft!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product received any negative reviews! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever posted a review on Amazon (prefer beauty/makeup boards), but I bought this via Amazon and haven&#x27;t seen it in many online stores. I originally was able to purchase these via Ebay for $14 a piece, but the seller must be out of stock so Amazon is the next best place. My feet have always been dry and cracked on my heels. But over the last few years, even the balls of my feet have started to split, and the calluses on my big toes and the sides of my feet (near my pinky toes) have gotten worse. I tried using my TCA and lactic acid peels to no avail. This is just the best I&#x27;ve found. Since my heels have such deep cracks, I typically have to use these 3-4 times spaced a couple weeks apart to get the smooth results I desire. I don&#x27;t expect miracles! Once my feet are smooth, I can go into maintenance mode and use these every month to two months. Only downside is that they take two hours, but the result is total worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how how well product works!  The dead skin just falls off, literally!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Did what it said, peel the skin off. Callous remains. Not mad, just a bit unsatisfied. I think these smooth foot high review are people who don&#x27;t really have callouses</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s worth mentioning though of you are a swimmer you can&#x27;t get in a pool for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Very cool. Took a lot of dead, rough skin away. Ready for spring and summer sanders!</li>
    <li> Love this. I had to use it two weeks in a row but how nice to sit in bed and relax with this stuff on. Very nice results</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin.  We&#x27;re talking detergent with fragrance burns my skin sensitive.  So naturally I was hesitant to use a product with such extreme results.  I did the full 2 hours as directed yesterday, then immediately moisturized my feet afterwards. Absolutely NO discomfort!  I will update when I start to see results, fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update****&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t end up doing anything except drying out my skin extra bad. I have another one and will give it a try will update when I do.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Just when I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work (day 5 or 6 and still no peeling)…BOOM! New feet. The process takes time, but it has completely worked for me and my feet are crazy soft and silky smooth now, from the tops of my feet to the soles. I left the booties on for 2 hours (and wore socks over the booties to keep the gel evenly dispersed and close to the skin). Then I soaked my feet every day after that. Peeled a lot for over 2 weeks. I plan on doing it again every 4 months for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in the past and had great results however with this particular order I got zero results and I was quite disappointed I think that the package that I received may have been sitting out for quite a while or just in the factory for too long and the active ingredients got old. Generally speaking baby foot is a great product I personally just had a bad experience this time around</li>
    <li> I love this product! I could not believe how much dead skin fell off of  the top and bottom of my feet.  They were super smooth.</li>
    <li> this product did absolutely nothing - i had purchased a $7 version-had fair results- this one more then twice the price did nothing at all. Lesson learned: Beware of  the  &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; 3rd party vs. any third party purchase. complained to the seller- no response</li>
    <li> This was great.  Way more effective than regular pedicures.  I live in a warm climate so I wear flip-flops almost every day and as a result I have a few callouses with some cracks in my heels.  I&#x27;ve tried sleeping with various ointments, lotions, and oils on my feet to soften them but I&#x27;ve never gotten this from it!  Pedicures last about a week even though I use jojoba and coconut oils often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet for about 15 minutes in warm water.  Dried them and put on the socks.  It didn&#x27;t hurt.  After an hour I rinsed and washed, as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, nothing really happened the first few days.  I did not lotion them, took daily showers, and watched for peels.  On day four, it began on my right foot.  I had a few, painless dry skin bubbles on my toe bottoms and arch of my foot.  I couldn&#x27;t help it and picked at it.  Then the little sheets of skin came off of the bottom of my foot and it didn&#x27;t hurt  or damage my skin.  It felt really good and the new skin is so pink and soft!  It has been about a week and nothing has happened to the top of my feet.  They are extra dry looking and feeling.  My heels are peeling a little but are not as good as I expected (so far).  I&#x27;m at least hoping the tops will peel a little more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying the two pack because it is cheaper.  That way you can do back to back peels or have one done at the end of spring and then another after summer.  I will have to buy another one pack or two pack for a second application for a back to back series. In a few weeks, I plan on soaking my feet more and leaving it on a little longer.  Then, doing daily feet soaks with no lotion after until peeling begins.  My heels need this.</li>
    <li> This peel does exactly as advertised with little effort. I will keep this product as part of a routine beauty regimen. My feet are noticeably softer and dry skin is practically non existent.</li>
    <li> So far I love the product. I would recommend it to anyone who wants baby soft feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of product before, this one had different packaging. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working, it took longer than I remember the first product taking to see the peeling. Now, they are peeling like crazy. My husband and daughter say it&#x27;s gross, but that means it&#x27;s working!!</li>
    <li> Worked over time. Saw an improvement but not complete.  Still had horrible callouses but not as bad</li>
    <li> Not sure what to think about this. I soaked my feet ahead of time like many people recommended. Kept the booties on for an Hour and a half. Feet peeled but not like I expected. Now a few months later, my feet are drier and worse than before I used this product. My husbands did the same thing. We are going to do it one more time to see what happens</li>
    <li> WORKS! My feet have never looked better!</li>
    <li> Better than any pedicure could begin to provide. I have had pedicures for years, and without question my feet look 60 years younger. Don&#x27;t walk, run to this product.</li>
    <li> I love this, works great. Awesome, just a little pricey</li>
    <li> The product said ×2 . For the price I thought it was going to be 2 boxes of baby foot item. Because who would just put one booty on one foot?and leave the other foot looking bad.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. It does feel cold and gooey on the feet at first, but after a couple days the dead skin starts to come off...mine did not peel like dried school glue peels off the hand, it was more of a sloughing effect. My feet were soft and nice. Since, the dead skin has come back (about 3 months later) but I think I just need to maintain it by doing this treatment every couple months, or doing pedicures more often.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me after I heard about it on the TODAY show.  I don&#x27;t have bad feet, but I just wanted to freshen them up due to working out daily.  And, I can honestly write that it worked for me!  You do need to follow the instructions when applying and afterwards by not putting any lotion on your feet that contains oil.  It has been over a month and my feet look and feel amazing!  I highly recommend it to my friends and relatives, it&#x27;s the best out there!  I will use this for the rest of my life, it gives me confidence to wear great shoes or to go barefooted around my friends.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This really works!  I will definitely be using this product again when needed!</li>
    <li> Baby Foot delivers. If you follow the directions then the results are fantastic. I walk a lot and the callous builds up. I stopped having the manicurist use a knife because of fear and the fact that the callous grew back faster. Someone told me about this product and, of course, Amazon had it! Five to seven days, the callous simply peels off and your feet look and feel like baby feet from your heels to your toes. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, worked as described.  Tried another cheaper product that did nothing at all for me.  Spend the extra for this one.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet beforehand and left the socks on for two hours. My feet peeled but not like other users&#x27;. Mine were simply flaky--the kind of flaky after a small sunburn or tan. It did not completely remove my rough heels (which, truly, were not that bad to begin with), and I had to exfoliate again within two weeks. This would be great for an event but not for routine maintenance.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my hubby&#x27;s feet :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very calloused feet, and use a pumice stone semi-regularly, so my results were not that dramatic. I think it&#x27;s fun for a bit, but a pumice stone should work for most people if you care for your feet regularly.</li>
    <li> I use this product every few months - it really works</li>
    <li> Not a good product for severe cracked feet</li>
    <li> On Day #5 right now and NADA.  Might work for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> My feet were never that bad, mainly just some dry spots on the heels and on the ball of my foot near my pinkie toe. I get pedicures regularly but I my feet are ticklish so I&#x27;ve always wondered if they were really getting everything off my feet that they could, or just rushing through the pumice part worried I&#x27;d jerk and kick them. So, I bought Baby Foot thinking I could get all the dead skin off and start new. I read all the reviews on here first.&lt;br /&gt;The Beginning: I washed my feet, then soaked them for 30 minutes. I put on the booties and socks on top and then watched some television. I ended up leaving it on for close to 90 minutes, I got caught up in a show. Rinsed my feet really well, dried them and went about my afternoon. It immediately felt like there was liquid trapped in the arches of my feet when I would walk. Weird, but not unbearable. That night I couldn&#x27;t sleep. My feet were so dry they felt like they were going to crack in half. I soaked them for 10 minutes and was finally able to go to bed. Day 2-14: My feet became insanely dry, even with soaking for 20+ minutes every night. Every crease in my foot was bright white. The balls of my feet turned into sandpaper. I felt my feet getting stuck to socks. It was terrible. Day 15: no sign of peeling and I couldn&#x27;t take my dry, scratchy feet anymore. I spent nearly 30 minutes on each foot with a pumice stone and even a callous shaver in some parts. I slathered them in lotion and put on socks. It made no difference. Day 16-19: more work with the pumice stone and more soaking in hot water. I bought Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter (the wax like stuff, not the lotion) and began spreading a 1/4 inch thick smear of it all over my feet, wrapping them in plastic wrap, putting on socks and going to bed. Day 20: I was running errands for work and felt like something was stuck under my big toe. Nope. Nearly a week after they should have started to peel, the peeling began. More lotion and more soaking, but the skin didn&#x27;t really come off too much. Day 23-25: Finally some noticeable peeling, but we were spending the weekend away and walking a bunch. All of the new, soft skin was now going to become hard from miles of walk. Just great. Day 28: The tops of my feet started to peel and I looked diseased. Fun times. Day 30: My toes started to peel. More looking diseased. Day 32: In desperate need of a pedicure, I sucked up my embarrassment and went. My pedicure lady yelled at me telling me if I wanted softer feet I should have come to her and we could have tried different lotions. She told me I better never use this on my feet again. She also peeled another layer off all of my toes. Day 40: There are still spots that are peeling, mainly on the sides of my feet where the skin is thin to begin with and just doesn&#x27;t want to come off. It took my feet so long to peel that by the time all of the bottoms of my feet had peeled, there was a mix of new soft skin and new skin that had already begun to get dry, despite lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess it worked, but to have my feet still peeling after almost 5 weeks and the fact that they barely stayed soft? It&#x27;s just not worth it.  I&#x27;ll stick with the cocoa butter/plastic wrap routine on top of my regular pedicures instead.ff too much. Day 23-25: Finally some noticeable peeling, but we were spending the weekend away and walking a bunch. All of the new, soft skin was now going to become hard from miles of walk. Just great. Day 28: The tops of my feet started to peel and I looked diseased. Fun times. Day 30: My toes started to peel. More looking diseased.

I&#x27;ll stick with the cocoa butter/plastic wrap routine on top of my regular pedicures instead.</li>
    <li> Works as stated, I will be purchasing this again. My softness last about 2 months before I noticed that I had to start doing a little exfoliating again.</li>
    <li> This really really works. On the 4th day my feet started to peel and now all the dead crusty skin is gone leaving smooth summer ready tootsies!!!</li>
    <li> Seriously, the best foot product ever.  So simple to use. I wore the booties for 1.5 hours and then soaked my feet for 30 minutes everyday until the peeling was complete.  I almost gave up on day four and thought it wasn&#x27;t working but the next morning in the shower i noticed my heels had started to peel. I had a pedicure after the peeling process ended and my manicurist was amazed at how soft my feet felt.  Best $20 I ever spent!</li>
    <li> If you love pealing skin off your feet for weeks, this is for you! Seriously, my feet are baby soft and I loved it!</li>
    <li> This is just a great natural way to get your feet the way they should be: smooth and free of cracks.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, this product is the &amp;#34;TRUTH!&amp;#34; I was amazed how well this product performed and am planning on purchasing more in a few weeks. If you experience dead skin on your feet (not just the bottoms of your feet), heels, between your toes, this product is for you!!!</li>
    <li> Worked but made both of my feet, calves and ankles swell up for days!</li>
    <li> This was truly deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know until I purchased it and received it that you had to stay off your feet for almost a week after using it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can do that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very serious item....I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to use by just everyone.</li>
    <li> It was all it said it was, I was taking a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did because my feet are amazing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after seeing it featured on the Today Show.  I was skeptical that it would be effective, as I&#x27;m someone who is on their feet at least 40+ hours a week and am active at the gym.  I have blisters and callouses even after pedicures at nail salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed other recommendations of soaking my feet for at least 15 minutes (I did 30) before applying the booties.  My feet began to peel after 3 days, and continued to peel for approximately a week - the tops, bottoms, and even between my toes peeled.  I am thrilled with the results.... My feet are softer than they&#x27;ve been in years.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This worked better to remove thick skin on my feet in a few weeks than the 40% Urea cream I had been prescribed by my dermatologist and been using for 3-4 years.</li>
    <li> Works great, feet peeled forever. I would suggest doing this before flip flop season</li>
    <li> GREATEST THING FOR FEEET!!!!! IVE RECOMMENDED IT TO TONS OF PEOPLE !</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and soak feet in warm water and massage every night for a few minutes and your feet are like new.  I was skeptical but tried it anyway.  So glad I did!  I didn&#x27;t realize my feet was SO bad.  :-)</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not as softening as hoped for</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions soaking my feet before putting them in the hell filled baggies.&lt;br /&gt;I even left the gel on an extra 1/2 hour. I&#x27;ve soaked my feet daily and even taken a few baths rather than my usual shower. I pat then dry afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Other than drying my heels and toes out till they appear to be cracking I am at day 7 and NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;No peeling, no flaking just some serious cracks and itching and I&#x27;m quite perturbed at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a drop in temp 3 days after I did the treatment and I had to wear \\&quot;real\\&quot; shoes.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 hours the shoes rubbed a huge blister on my left heel that remains painful ( yes, I&#x27;m making sure it stays clean and covered with a small bandaid). Never had a problem with the shoes making blisters before.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m back to wearing my FItFlops...with clean white cotton socks which I had anticipated would catch the peeling skin but that hasn&#x27;t happened.&lt;br /&gt;I even bought some BLISS softening socks and foot patrol cream so once my feet had peeled I&#x27;d keep them soft.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say they remain unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****ADDITION*****&lt;br /&gt;From 1 star to 3 stars and maybe more!&lt;br /&gt;Surprise, surprise it is now day 14 and everything has changed. On day 9 I woke up to see crinkling across the tops of my toes. Upon closer inspection I could see and feel changes. The calluses on the sides of each big toe were lose, my heels were sloughing skin right and left. I had continued with soaking my feet each night , using a homemade sugar scrub ( white sugar and Grapeseed oil) and using a dry towel to encourage exfoliation. It paid off...big time.&lt;br /&gt;While I doubt my feet will ever be baby soft they have improved 500% but I still have spots on my heels and ball of my foot that are callused and rough. The peeling looks like how when a guy has athletes foot... Flaky yucky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet still look a mess as the peeling continues and I seriously need to get a pedicure but I&#x27;m gonna be even more patient and  this play out. Sorry I jumped the gun.play out. Sorry I jumped the gun.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Huge waste of money - I followed the instructions and NOTHING happened.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. The product was exactly as advertised. I soaked my feet for 30 minutes in plain water prior to using the product.  I wore the product for an hour as suggested in the directions. I suggest using the product near to where you will be washing your feet. The directions say that you should not try to walk with the product on due to slipping and this is definitely true. It was an adventure to make it up my stairs to rinse the product off.  After rinsing the product off I did feel a very mild itching sensation on my feet but it did not last long. After 2 days the very top of my feet started to slightly peel. It took another few days before the rest of my feet began to shed. I soaked my feet for about 15 minutes every other day and would lightly rub them while in the water to help get the peeling skin off.  This worked great. I do not suggest picking any of the dead skin off as this can expose new skin that is not ready.  It has now been a week and four days and my feet are pretty much done. I have very mild peeling on the inside of my arch but it is close to none. I was very impressed with how well it worked on my heels. Two weeks prior to this product I had been consistently trying to get rid of my &amp;#34;winter feet&amp;#34; with no success. When my heels began to peel it had looked like they were still dry but give it time and they will look great. I will definitely be using this product again.</li>
    <li> I saw this and was in the fence after reading the reviews. I recommend soaking your feet ahead of time, sitting down with something to do for the 60-90 mins while you are wearing the boots, and putting the tub stopper in for the next weeks worth of showers (or soak your feet every other day). It works. My feet were pretty dry and nothing was working on them. The skin falling off is amusing or gross depending on how you feel about seeing flakes of you around. I suggest wear socks and turn them out in the trash before you throw them in the washer.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a 3 weeks and my feet are still in good shape. They will get dry again but that is my skin issue and no product is going to keep them permanently soft.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  6 months later I can&#x27;t get feet to stop peeling and the layers are really deep.  Really bad cuts.</li>
    <li> I have successfully used Baby Foot twice.  I found this product after trying every foot file and cream possible, without much relief.  The first time I followed the directions included and it worked well...taking an entire layer of dry skin off my rough ol&#x27; feet.  The second time, I had read more customer reviews suggesting bathing or soaking your feet after the initial application, so I tried it.  On the third day after the treatment, I started soaking my feet in warm water for  20-30 minutes each day for 3 days...and WOW, what a difference!  The dead skin came off faster and much more completely.  Cannot recommend this product (with the soaking step) enough and will continue treatments every three or four months to maintain my new baby-smooth tootsies!</li>
    <li> This stuff works so good.. Its amazing .. Never thought my feel would be this soft...</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. And after following instructions exactly I got no results whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It definitely works.  I soaked for 30 min. before, left it on for 1.5 hours, and soaked 30 min. after.  Soaked feet every day for about 5 days after for 30 min.  I think people that it doesn&#x27;t work for are not doing the soaking and people who had sore or cracked feet probably left it on too long.  As with anything else though, it could just react differently to different people&#x27;s chemistry.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is my feet weren&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;soft as a baby&#x27;s&amp;#34; but it did definitely help my heels.</li>
    <li> Okay, when you start this makes sure you have the phone nearby, have used the restroom and have the TV remote nearby. It takes awhile. It is messy, I would make sure I had my feet in some sort of dishpan and towels nearby. After you get out of the plastic footies, you are going to think &amp;#34; this is a rip-off&amp;#34;. Then, in a few days, you&#x27;ll take off your shoes/socks and think what is all this mess ? It&#x27;s the dead skin literally falling off. Definitely do this in the winter when you can cover up your feet.</li>
    <li> This peel takes a little bit for the process to be over, but once the skin has all peeled off about 7-10 days later your skin looks so much better. Definitely worth it. One caution: don&#x27;t do this in the summer when wearing sandals or flip flops though, as your skin is very tender and you can blister easily if you are walking in flip flops or sandals for extended periods of time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, even after following package instructions, the skin did not fall off of my husband&#x27;s foot. I read the reviews about how users advise soaking the skin in a bathtub 1-2 hours at at a time for the following consecutive days, but after three days of an hour-long soak in a foot bath, he still did not get the results described. I felt like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but the application needs to be revised. First of all, the booties they give you do not accommodate a foot larger than 11 inches (I estimate). I have a size 13 shoe, and I had to cut the plastic booties in order to use them. The biggest problem with having to wear the booties is that the solution gets on the top of your feet and destroys otherwise healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d soak your foot for at least an hour before using this (as others have recommended). You won&#x27;t see any peeling for about a week when you shower. After that the skin starts coming off like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about this product is the price. It is a one time use only, and if you need a chemical peel, your feet must be bad (as are mine). I believe it would take 2 or 3 applications for your feet to be fully fixed, and sorry, I&#x27;m not shelling out $60 for something that damaged the top of my feet and turned them (the top) red for weeks.</li>
    <li> Works great will definitely repurchase!!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  AWESOME product.</li>
    <li> Worked just as promised... Very happy with the results</li>
    <li> Worked like a dream......my feet haven&#x27;t felt or looked this good in years!!!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Feet were soft but not like a baby. Within a few weeks feet were the same again and this is after 2 applications. Once you use it you will always have to use it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money - this item did nothing for me.  My feet are in fairly good condition, but I wanted to try this product to help remove some dead skin before summer.  I followed all instructions (mostly from the reviews) like soaking etc, but nothing at all happened.  There was some minor dry skin flaking, but that would have happened anyway if I soak my feet and then don&#x27;t apply moisturizer</li>
    <li> The best pedicure around. I can&#x27;t believe how well this exfoliation works. Much to my delight, my feet look years younger.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Works just as it says.  Takes at least a week to completely peel but so worth it.</li>
    <li> Yeah baby. This works! I was getting frustrated because it took a little longer to take effect, but when it started boy oh boy it was raining dead skin. Lol I didn&#x27;t realize that soaking your feet would kick start the peeling. So I went to the pool and when I got home my feet were GROSS! I was like wth?  But now all of the dead skin is gone and even the calluses on the bottom of my foot are gone. YEAH BABYFOOT!</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this. I have not been kind to my feel this winter and I have always struggled with rough heels. I thought this would work to some degree. It didn&#x27;t work at all. I kept the booties on for almost 2 hours. I actually kept a heating pad under my feet because I read heat helps to activate it. I soaked my feet before and after and have soaked them several times since then. But nada. Not one peel. In fact my feet seem even dryer and have been really itchy. Today is day 6. The product says feet will peel in 5-7 days but unless I wake up to a miracle in the morning - I shall remain very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work that well with me . may be need repetition.&lt;br /&gt;No allergies no side effects</li>
    <li> Good product! Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Does not actually exfoliate your feet. This is basically just glue that peels off. It&#x27;s a scam. After the peeling, all calloused areas are the same.</li>
    <li> This is the one I should repeat.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift.  I soaked my feet prior to using and then each day after until the peeling started.  I used the product Wednesday evening and noticed the peeling the following Tuesday (6 days total).  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and plan to buy it in the future!</li>
    <li> it works exactly how the reviews say it does. took off all the nasty dried and peeling skin. within 3-6 months my feet were back to normal though. I live in southern arizona and am in sandals/flip flops or bear foot quite a bit though. I also had this problem with flakey skin on my feet and when I used the baby foot it pretty much took care of that. I had been to multiple dermatologists who couldn&#x27;t help, but this did the trick. even when my feet got tough again, the peeling and flaking didn&#x27;t come back.</li>
    <li> I have the most ugly feet. Thick skin from years of being barefoot, of being a dancer. Well I used the baby foot pack, and holy crap its getting better. I did use a bit of salicyclic acid on my feet yesterday to speed up peeling, but for once i can see pretty pink skin. if your feet are cracked, this might not work as well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s another tool in the arsenal for basic foot maintenance. The product will take a layer off the most pampered feet and you will find peeling happening in places you didn&#x27;t think possible. It&#x27;s not a cure all though. It does little to nothing for calluses. You&#x27;ll also have to do some work yourself. A nightly soak to maximize its benefits is nearly essential.</li>
    <li> This procuct really works. I was a little hesitant, but I applied the product a week ago and can say it truly works. It takes several days after application for the peeling to start. During the peeling process your feet will look pretty gross, so it&#x27;s a little embarrassing to wear flip flops or sandals, but the end result is worth it. After 6 days, I&#x27;m still peeling, but so far the process has really gotten rid of the dead skin.  I would say you should probably allow 10 days from start to finish.</li>
    <li> This product only made my feet peel on the top.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure it was working at first but then…it did.  Give it time!  Great product!</li>
    <li> This works! I left it on longer than I was supposed to, (fell asleep), I wore them on a Saturday, by Tuesday, the soft skin on top of my feet started peeling. By the following Friday, the rest was coming off in sheets. I have pretty, soft pink feet now! I am so happy with this, that I am ordering more for the husbands feet! The instructions say to remove any polish, I didn&#x27;t, just because I am a rebel :) I should have! Ruins your polish! So just remove it! After the husband does this I will do another review. I had sandal feet, but he has nasty man feet lol that will be the true trial!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom and her foot has never looked better. She is in her 60&#x27;s so her foot has a lot of years on them. Her heels are only a little ruff now but a second application should do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is so easy, and works like a charm. Some folks haven&#x27;t been happy with it, but I found that if I soak my feet for a while after the second week, the dead skin rolls off and I do have Baby Feet!</li>
    <li> Saw this on the baby feet website and my daughter wanted it for Christmas. This seller provided a way more competitive price than I could have gotten on the main website and it is exactly the same product. Works like a charm and my daughter was sooo happy! She wants to reorder so we will definitely use this seller again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I used the peel, Frist soaking my feet for 20 minutes, then opening the booties and putting them on. 40 minutes later, I washed my feet.  The skin on my feet felt somewhat rough but that was fine. I soaked my feet everyday for about 20 minutes in clear water. After the third day my skin began to left and peel. Unbelievably the skin continued to left until the ninth day, when there was no more dead skin. All new soft, skin. I am very pleased with this product. I will order Baby foot over and over.</li>
    <li> I had to try this.  My feet aren&#x27;t completely disgusting but they&#x27;re bad enough that I only show them after performing a rigorous at-home pedicure that involves cutting and filing dead skin..if that tells you anything.&lt;br /&gt;I am all about cool skin care products (I happen to be a licensed esthetician, but not in practice), and definitely something that claims to work better than my efforts that cause me to really work up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, including the recommendation to soak my feet prior to treatment, which I did for about 20 minutes.  I wore the booties for the recommended one hour, then washed as recommended.  Here is where I share a little TMI (too much information): I shower about every 3 days or so.  I have 3 kids, I&#x27;m busy, I&#x27;m not working right now and I really don&#x27;t get that dirty and don&#x27;t see a need to waste the water.  I do wear house socks a lot and snow boots right now so my feet sweat a lot.  I think the extra moisture, while not as effective as an actual foot soak, did help in the process.  The first shower I had after my feet started peeling, I was just mesmerized.  There was so much peeled skin I had to pick it up for fear it would clog the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;The entire peeling process took about 2 weeks and there is still a small amount of residual peeling now.  I fully intend to order another treatment, and this time follow a regular foot soak schedule.  My results were great but my most stubborn callous, on the outer bottom of each of my big toes, didn&#x27;t end up peeling.  They did flake a bit and I was able to use a foot file to remove them without any cutting required, they had softened quite a bit.  I recommend this product and will continue to use it for regular foot maintenance.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that it works.  I have had rough calloused feet my whole life and used every foot lotion and file on the market.  I followed the directions on the baby foot website, pre-soaked for 15 minutes, put socks on over the booties and watched a movie for 2 hours, then rinsed it off.  I&#x27;m more of a shower person, so I just took longer showers rather then soaking my feet every night. The fourth night I was sore from working out, so I took a bath in epsom salts.  When I started using my pumice stone, I noticed it seemed to be working better than usual.  After I got out and dried my feet, the peeling began.  It&#x27;s been 9 days and it&#x27;s mostly done peeling, and my feet look and feel amazing! I wish I had taken before and after pictures. I am obsessed with this product now and will buy it every 2 or 3 months.</li>
    <li> your feet will completely peel, but they will go back to a callous mess in a matter of weeks so it wont be a permanent solution to your screwed up feet.</li>
    <li> I Worked in steel toe boots and i absolutely love to jump in a pair of sandals...so the damage on my feet had gotten bad...this stuff works...i received mines Monday...and yes i was skeptical...but its now Thursday and my feet are starting to peel...i had started to see light areas forming on my feet Wed but no shedding...i can say mu feet or in remission!!! Love the product and i will b ordering more!!!!</li>
    <li> Product works.  Slough is messy. Be careful not to stress your feet ie tight shoes- super painful</li>
    <li> AMAZING....but soak your feet nightly...it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! I wasn&#x27;t expecting it the day I got it. I have only applied the peel this morning. I am excited to see all the sick dead skin start to shed. I will say, to watch it! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend rinsing this off with hot water, it burns!! I was in the shower and felt like I was walking over coals or something- so don&#x27;t get into a hot shower to wash your tootsies! I will update after my feet start to come apart. :D</li>
    <li> oh my god what even is this it is so magical wowowowowwowowowow. after beating on my feet pretty hard via 10 weeks of an intensive tap dance role for a musical, and then not really doing anything to my poor feets for a couple months because I&#x27;m too broke for my pedicure gal now, I heard about baby foot and thought, why not try it for 20 bucks. IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE. this stuff peeled off my crazy dance shoe calluses and my feet felt so soft and light after. the peeling process is gross in a really creepy fascinating way. if you want the max result, I would recommend soaking your feet for 15 minutes before you use it and also every day after (this also helps the actual peeling to start sooner). also, be good about moisturizing after, it&#x27;ll keep the happy prolonged. 10/10 would recommend</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to believe it would work because four days had gone by, but by the fifth, it was going on. The little wet booties were comfortable, but you should sit down and let them do their work for about an hour. Just read a book or watch television.  It began to peel and the softness peeked through, by the seventh day, it was all off.  Your only job is to help peel it off, then observe the natural skin.  P.S. It does not hurt, just like peeling Elmer&#x27;s glue off of a child&#x27;s hand during art class once it has dried .</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Getting ready for flip-flop weather has never been easier. I followed the directions and about a week later my skin started peeling off. It took another 5 days to finish coming off. Make sure you use it at least 2 weeks before any important event otherwise you will look like you are molting.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the crustiest feet in the world so although it was a bit of a pain.  My feet were peeling for 3 weeks, they are smoother and, I would use it again. Also, soak your feet first.  They advise you to do so on the box as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  My feet have no rough spots anymore.  This is definitely a worth while purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great, allow time for end results.</li>
    <li> OH WOW....My daughter gave me this for Mothers Day. My feet have always been aweful. (jiffy feet), Hard, cracked, and calloused. No matter how much  I would soak them, scrub them,.and cream them. This product is Amazing. This is a miracle!  my feet feel so soft &amp; and energized. They look so pretty in my sandals. And feel remarkable. I get a pedicure about every 21/2 to 3 weeks. She always complains to me to moisturize my feet.I have not been in 4 weeks because my feet are fantastic. I am ordering one for my youngest daughter, who is a school teacher, and is on her feet so much of the day. I&#x27;m so happy she bought me Baby Feet....I am telling everyone they need to try this.</li>
    <li> It does  NOT smell like lavender! It smells very strongly of rubbing alcohol!</li>
    <li> This works well!  I was dubious and reluctant (if it seems too good to be true, it probably is). I used as directed and got a nice peel on my dry, heavily-callused feet!! I work at home, so I am barefoot a lot: hence, very thick calluses and perpetually cracked heels. I may have helped the effectiveness of this by wrapping my feet (with the booties on) in \\&quot; vet wrap.\\&quot; This is a sticky, self-adhering Ace bandage-like material (available where they sell horse care products, but I suspect there&#x27;s a human version available).  Baby Foot peeled off layers and layers of this excess skin.  A warning though: my feet have been peeling for 10 days, rendering them non-sandle-worthy.  If you want to show off your tootsies for a special occasion, start 2 weeks in advance.</li>
    <li> I was meticulous in following the directions and it did not perform at all as advertised..  I could perhaps understand it if the product was ineffective on the real problem area of the heels, but at the very least it should have removed the dry skin areas around the toes and other areas of the foot.  But it failed utterly to perform.  A huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product after the many other things that have not worked for my dry heels. The product was very easy to use and the waiting part was hard. Every day I kept looking for the big &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;! My feet started peeling like it said about 5 days in. They were super soft. However, my heels never softened as I hoped. I will definitely do again, but listen to others about soaking feet prior.</li>
    <li> Really pleasantly surprised. I read lots of reviews and made sure to soak my feet in plain warm water first. I only left them on for 1 hour as I was nervous about overdoing it, but when I do it again will go for the full 2. I didn&#x27;t get the crazy drastic peeling some got, but I DID get much smoother feet, no more cracks, and mild to moderate peeling after I soaked my feet in plain water every other day or so. I found the dry skin somewhat uncomfortable so I used lotion several times which really seemed to arrest the peeling. Can&#x27;t wait to try again, leave longer, soak more, and not use the lotion. 4 stars because the boots are really flimsy and you can&#x27;t walk around.</li>
    <li> Pros: About a week after I used this product for an hour, some dead skin came off rather easily after soaking my feet in warm water for 45 minutes. The gel smells rather nice. The booties fit my large, manly Shrek feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The package says to use product for 30 minutes, the FAQ says it&#x27;s safe to use for up to two hours; very confusing. I chose an hour, which apparently was not quite enough time since no skin ever flaked or peeled off. In fact, the dead skin on my feet actually got rougher to the touch because it started to crack and rasp a lot, as if the dead skin were starting to break away but never quite finished. Following suggestions from other reviews, soaking my feet did actually allow a fair bit of skin to come off, but not nearly enough to make my feet &amp;#34;baby soft,&amp;#34; and my feet were still rough afterwards. I eventually had to just use my regular old callus shaver and foot file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I just don&#x27;t have the time to use this product if I have to soak my feet for (potentially) hours in the following week to get the promised results.</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome and I will probably use it again.  It is really gross and kind of expensive for one treatment (thus 4 stars) but i will probably continue doing this a couple times a year.  In the future I will definatively soak a lot before I start.  I did not and it took about a week before the peeling started.  I am a shower taker and I imagine a couple baths during the first couple days would make it happen sooner also.</li>
    <li> It was the best product that i have ever used on my feet.  It amazing how it worked and left my feet smooth.  Expect a  lot of skin peeling.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try Baby Foot after reading the reviews.  I followed the directions exactly (presoaking, soaking at least every other day afterwards, etc.), and even left the Baby Foot booties on my feet 1 1/2 hours rather than the recommended 1 hour.  My feet are moderately calloused.  Anyway, I had ABSOLUTELT NO RESULTS!  After one foot soak at the end of 2 weeks I had a tiny bit of skin slough off the top of my feet, but I&#x27;m sure that would have happened anyway with all the soaking!  To say I&#x27;m disappointed is putting it mildly - especially after reading so many positive reviews.  It was a total waste of time and money for me.  I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if that were possible.  Back to my old pumice stone.</li>
    <li> Works very well, just follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I needed this 10years ago, where have you been. Why? Crying! I could have avoided paying 100,s of dollars getting pedicures. All that wasted time at salons for what, just to come back two weeks later. :/ feet jacked up by nonprofessional people just wanting your money. No more foot pumice stones. No more metal foot files. No more scrapers that will harm your feet and cause further damage. You would be crazy not to purchase a bulk load of baby foot peels. Crazy. I am DEFINITELY GOING TO PURCHASE MORE. I recommend this to anyone that has rough dry scalely feet. Ugh. Buy it. Buy it. I truly speaks volumes because it works, as stated, by the manufacturer. Just say thank you Lord.</li>
    <li> It did peel skin off my feet nut barely impacted heel calluses.  For the price....</li>
    <li> You have to try these to believe the hype. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Baby Foot does a great job in softening your feet.  I put the booties on as instructed for an hour and washed my feet.  About 4 days later my feet started peeling and continued to do so for several days.  I purchased a brush for my feet that also had a pumas stone and used that to help the peeling process.  My feet are much softer after using Baby Foot.  Better than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Baby Foot saved a trip for a pedicure to get my feet soft.  I soaked my feet first. Left them in exactly for 2 hours, per directions.  I worked while sitting so barely moved them. Warning they are very slippery to walk in and do not recommend doing so. Washed them off. They felt the same. 3 days later I had just a very light peel on 1 spot on top of my foot from day 4-14 had very gradual peeling starting with my eyes, then under my toes, then under my arch and finally around my toes. I had nothing like thick sheets of skin coming off. I don&#x27;t know how you would have that unless you were peeling it which the directions clearly state not to do so as not to risk damage.  In the evenings I would soak them in the tub and just gently rub any excess skin off. Your feet will start to look dry before it peels. I was worried I would have real baby feet and it would be painful. Nothing of the sort. It was just as if I had someone file my feet but not sit there for it. I have zero idea how it works which is the only thing I found odd. No ingredient list of what exfoliating acids are in it.</li>
    <li> God, this product is both so gross and amazing, it had to have 5 stars.  My mom uses this back home, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot too, since her feet are always smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt.  I soaked, strapped this plastic little booties on, and relaxed.  After the hour, I rinsed my feet off and went to bed. Day 1 to 4 - nothing.  Day 5 - started to get some peeling on my toe where my shoe was rubbing.  Not too bad though.  Day 6 to 11 - OMG.  I was molting like a reptile.  My husband was grossed out,I was grossed out, it was ugly for a few days.  It just kept coming off! Day 12 - My feet felt like a baby foot!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Didn&#x27;t soak before, just took a shower. Feet started peeling on the fourth day. Still peeling on the eighth day. Feet are so smooth and beautiful. No pain or soreness. Will do it again when needed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  Second time purchasing, &amp; each time it has made my feet super soft. It takes about 5-7 days for the peeling to start, but once it does... WOW! Kinda gross, but the end results are amazing. I used a pumice stone to take off the leftover skin, &amp; my feet are as smooth as ever. Definitely buy again and again</li>
    <li> These actually work!! I was very skeptical but tried it anyway. The key is to soak your feet every night fir a few days leading up to application. Then soak them each night also. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome! Just like the package says, it takes about I&#x27;ve days for you to start seeing peeling. but I did not just buy this product, I looked at the reviews on Amazon first. one reviewer stated that he and his friends did a test to see what works. 4 friends took showers everyday after using the product, and 4 other friends took baths. they found that the friends that took baths saw more effective results. I have very thick skin on my feet. VERY thick. I believe it comes from genetics because my dads feet are the same way. Every two weeks I was getting my feet done.and it seemed like every two weeks the same amount of skin came off my feet. I chalked it up as I might as well just deal with it, it&#x27;s going to be like this for the rest of my life. I just got tired of the skin piling up after a while. I started researching some helpful things for this dead skin... And baby foot was one of them. I decided to take a chance and try out out...I had nothing to lose. I placed my feet into the booties for 2 hours instead of 1 like it said on the package, and I put socks on over the booties. It&#x27;s been about a week and I&#x27;ve been taking baths every night to get a good soak. This product really works! The skin practically wipes off day by day. I&#x27;ll update you on any changes that happen. Thanks baby foot!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;m almost excited to get a pedicure now! No sanding/scraping required!</li>
    <li> This product really work.</li>
    <li> What a great product! Did everything it claimed it would do. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my third time buying these bad boys and I would repurchase again and again. Late winter is the best time to use these as your feet are still covered and no one will question your possible leprosy when your skin is shedding everywhere. Another reviewer has the ultimate key to making these work best: soak your feet prior to applying, leave on for around 1 1/2-2 hours, soak your feet after removing, and continue soaking your feet for 30 minutes to 1 hour daily after the first 2-3 days. Then brace yourself for the sick pleasure of watching your skin peel off in sheets. Also, I highly recommend wearing socks to bed every night. There will be flakes/pieces of skin everywhere, so it&#x27;s best to try and contain them as much as possible.</li>
    <li> as soon as my feet were done peeling, they got rough again. not even any time to enjoy the soft feet!! :T</li>
    <li> So unlike the picture and all the hype from friends, this did not work for me. 3 days after I took the boots off my feet were a peely mess.. After cleaning them off, nothing  has happened since.  Not one peel, nothing. I&#x27;m highly disappointed.. The 2nd star is because they did peel once</li>
    <li> this is the best think since sliced bread.  I loved the result and will order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic!!!  I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the folks it didn&#x27;t work for below.  I just take a bath/shower and then put the bags on while my feet are still soft.  An hour later I take off the bags and rinse my feet as directed.  About 3-4 days later, usually while I&#x27;m showering I notice my foot starting to peel.  Then shortly there after big pieces just fall off.  Kind of gross, but better in the trash than on my foot.  AND it only affects the dead skin on the bottom and sides of toes.  The top of my foot has never peeled.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Use it EXACTLY as the instructions say, and watch the skin peel away... It does take a few days for the dead skin to come off, but trust me, it WILL come off, and leave you with soft pretty feet. I was skeptical at first, but these things work. FYI, I have very rough dry heels that crack occasionally. After using this product, I did what others recommeded in their reviews... Exfoliate daily to speed up and help remove dead skin. Worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great product wife&#x27;s feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in years.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Be patient, it really does take 5-7 days before you start seeing anything happen.  It takes another 3-4 days before you&#x27;re almost done.  Definitely worth the wait.  It does an amazing job.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews and looking a pictures, I pre-soaked, post-soaked, and had high expectations.  It didn&#x27;t perform as expected - I had flaky skin, but it seemed to be mostly on the tops of my feet, and a light surface layer on the bottom.  It didn&#x27;t give me the dramatic results I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Amazingly disgusting but worth it!</li>
    <li> Works quite well.  Use well ahead of the event you are planning on, really causes a lot of peeling.</li>
    <li> I thought this would never work--but was I surprised!!  It took all the old layer of skin off bottom of feet &amp; heels over a period of a week, made feet &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; as described.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet before the application and then each day plus a shower. It took six days but now they are peeling like crazy</li>
    <li> I had really tough calluses so I was not expecting much but was more than pleasantly surprised by the results. I will probably wait a bit (recommended) and do this again. Until then I am enjoying the smoothness of my soles.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Sounds crazy but this product really does work!!! My feet are beyond soft. I&#x27;m totally going to buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had rough feet and pumice stones don&#x27;t do much. I tried these and it&#x27;s amazing! My feet have never been so soft!! I&#x27;ve told everyone I know and some of  my friends use them now too.</li>
    <li> It was just OK. Nothing as promised specially for the price ( more over to add the S&amp;H ). The smell of Lavender was not bad and not too much overpowering.</li>
    <li> Second time buying hoping for a good foot exfoliation and absolutely zip happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do anything and followed the directions precisely.  Been almost 2 weeks and my feet have yet to start peeling.  I soaked my feet before treatment for 20 minutes and afterwards and even used socks over the booties.  Was hoping this was going to work, but no luck</li>
    <li> This was not the real Baby Foot product that I ordered in the past from BeautySage.com.  It what I received was not the item pictured.  The entire package was in another language.  The boots were different, the scent was different and the product did absolutely nothing.  And I mean nothing!  Not one little bit of skin flake off and it has been almost 3 weeks.  This is a classic case of bate and switch.  They lead you to believe you are getting a real product and then send you a cheap Chinese knock off.  The real Baby Foot works great, but if you buy it here, you won&#x27;t get the real product (only a very bad fake)!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months and I LOVE IT.  If the directions are followed and the time allowances are observed, the results are great and promise to be a real problem solver.</li>
    <li> this is great its better than a pedicure.</li>
    <li> Hard, rough feet to soft baby feet in about a week. The only part I don&#x27;t like is the nastiness of the peeling, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to make my feet feel this soft, I&#x27;d do it again!</li>
    <li> For years I had crusty soles that would routinely shred wool tights.  I would pay $60 every month or two for a pedicure that supposedly treated calloused feet.  Although improved, they were never baby smooth, and turned rough again within a week.  Based on the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to give Baby Foot a try.  It&#x27;s basically an acid peel for the feet, and since I routinely use an acid peel for the face with great results, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I was dubious at first - it took a little over a week for the peeling to start - but once it did, my baby feet slowly and painlessly began to emerge. It&#x27;s been three months of happy feet, and I am starting to feel a few rough patches.  I will be treating with Baby Foot again.  I routinely recommend this product to friends.  Just amazing.  Gently, no aroma, a good excuse for putting your feet up for two hours and watching a movie!</li>
    <li> My skin started peeling off at five days.  The skin continued to slough off for another three days.  My feet are soft and the cracks are gone.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it left my feet looking and feeling nearly like I&#x27;d been having a pedicure a week for several weeks.  The peeling process too a lot longer than I expected -- nearly two weeks of at least a LITTLE peeling somewhere on my foot -- so if I were going to do this before going on vacation, I&#x27;d probably do it two weeks ahead of time, then have a professional mini-pedicure right before I left.</li>
    <li> They really work. My foot are soft than ever. At the 4th day my foot start to peeling. They are sensible wearing high heels</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to see if there&#x27;s a way to get a refund.  I followed the very simple instructions exactly.  Here it is, five days later, and nothing has happened.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the &amp;#34;socks&amp;#34; are gel filled baggies.  It comes with tape so you can seal the top tighter around your ankles.  You are then instructed to basically not move for two hours.  I read a book and napped a little while waiting.  Then you take off the bags and rinse.  In theory, you&#x27;re supposed to notice peeling occurring for up to a week.  You are warned that this will ruin your pedicure/nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toe nail polish was unmarred.  I suppose that should have been a hint.  I&#x27;m terrible at remembering to pumice in between pedicures, so I was hoping this would work.  Nope.  Not a darn thing happened except I&#x27;m $25 poorer.  I&#x27;m glad some folks had luck with this.  I did not.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work!. Grrr wondering if it was even the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My feet were so sooooft! Better than getting a pedicure. I will continue to use this when i need a pick me up.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought I needed a tub to soak my feet in the solution, so I put it off for a few weeks. I bought one, and then opened this up to realize I didn&#x27;t need it, but you really should soak your feet before using it, apparently that speeds up the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I got said 30 minutes, but most people are using theirs for an hour. I did it for 30 minutes and you could definitely tell a change in texture. On day four, it started peeling, and it becomes an obsession. It&#x27;s still peeling, although at a much lower rate. Having seen my son&#x27;s feet, I&#x27;m hoping it will help him, because they are getting really rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - If you are a diabetic, they recommend NOT using this.</li>
    <li> It works. You just need a lot of patience. It&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks since I applied product. My foot is still peeling around the ankle area. It appears as if regular soaking accelerate the process. I am mostly a shower person. Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s taking too long. Overall I loved the product. I purchased another already</li>
    <li> Baby Foot works as advertised.  Refinery 29 had reviewed this product, and I gave it a shot, because my poor, poor winter-beaten feet needed help.  Be patient; it is not an instant shed.  It probably differs with everyone, and the mass shed off began on day 5 for me.  After two weeks in which I really didn&#x27;t do much with it, just showering every day, the process is done and my feet are amazing.  I will definitely buy this again, because I&#x27;m pretty lazy with daily foot care.</li>
    <li> fabulous!  first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but boy did it ever!  Feet couldn&#x27;t be any softer, a pedicure can&#x27;t do what this product does.</li>
    <li> I loved it.. It really worked..</li>
    <li> Worked just like it said. Just took a little longer than the box said. Very satisfied with the product and the seller. . I have already ordered one for my father and plan to get one for my husband as well... just need to learn patients. . Lol</li>
    <li> it really does make the feet peel and leaves the feet soft</li>
    <li> Fabulous product for anyone wishing they could reduce the tough or calloused skin on their feet.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of recommendations on how to best use Baby Foot and followed their suggestions- worked amazingly well!  I would recommend this product highly. Only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get it sooner.</li>
    <li> I never saw anythinng like it in my life, I didn&#x27;t think it did anything initially as it took 7 days, but I sloughed all my skin like a snake and fresh baby skin underneath.  Painless and great results.  I thought it was expensive at $25, but now it is even more money.  I think it is overpriced</li>
    <li> I like the product- have horrible dry feet from always living in the desert. Took 5 days to start peeling &amp; while it wasn&#x27;t a huge difference, it did help. Will try another round</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product. I heard them talking about it on the today show so I ordered it. I followed directions to a T! I am supposed to start seeing sloughing of dead skin in the week to follow .... It&#x27;s been 5 days and not one flake!!! This was expensive for nothing to happen !! I just have to believe I got a bad batch or something ?!!! Not interested in chancing again for the price !</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  I soaked my feet, stuck them in the gel packs and waited 90 minutes.  Took the gel packs off, rinsed my feet and waited. For the next 3 days the skin on my feet felt tight, and I wanted to moisturize...badly!  Day 6 and 7 the skin on my feet started to peel and shed.  Long pieces of skin as well as smaller pieces.  I am on day 12 and they are still shedding.  I don&#x27;t have extremely bad feet, I have regular pedicures, moisturize and wear those uncomfortable gel socks to bed.  However, I have peeled both of my feet for the last 2 days and this product is incredible.  I intend to purchase this every 6 weeks as long as I have feet!</li>
    <li> Baby foot is amazing!!! After I had my child my feet were crusty as hell but this right here took my feet from looking like a 70 year old man&#x27;s back to a 26 yr old female  lol lol. But it really works. The skin will shed off your feet for about a week but after that everything&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was over 30 dollars!  Now I see the price dropped and I am upset!!!&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of review and hoped it wold work for me as well before purchase, if it worked well then the price didn&#x27;t matter...&lt;br /&gt;I did this with my friends for fun ( I bought one in Japanese and one of this to compare...and I guess they both were the same products), and we realized the foot pack was too big for both of us....&lt;br /&gt;My foot is 7, and my friend&#x27;s size is 7-1/2,  and the pack covered all the way to my ankle so as the gel inside.  It made a mess.&lt;br /&gt;We both couldn&#x27;t do anything for the whole one hour since the bag was too big, and there was  too much gel so it was so slippery.&lt;br /&gt;My feet (specially my ankles) felt super itchy and I wondered if I should take them off before I would have bad chemical reaction...my feet felt itchy for the next few days.  Results were not as good as I expected.  I still had some skin left.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I followed the recommendations and instructions exactly... had pre-soaked my feet for 30 minutes prior to using the product and kept the booties on for the time stated. And based on other people&#x27;s recommendations, I also continued to soak my feet for at least an hour each day afterward for one week to help it work its magic. However, nothing happened and my feet were exactly the same. Perhaps this product is only good for women with slightly callused feet.</li>
    <li> Love this! Feels so great! Works as described. Takes a few day for you to notice. In the shower a few days later you can see it. About 5 days later it was like a had new skin!</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work as I had expected. There was minimal peeling and a week later you still couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference. The only part that peeled was between my toes and the rest of my foot still looks dry and dull. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Is it safe for diabetics to use?</li>
    <li> I was worried after the 3rd day of no results, but that night I plugged the drain while I showered and rubbed with terry cloth. It worked! The skin started to come away from my foot and 3 lotion-less days later, almost all of the skin had peeled away. I was curious to see if the let-the-foot-peel-on-it&#x27;s-own-time instruction was necessary. So I decided to &amp;#34;manually sped up the process&amp;#34;, but only on one foot and always after the daily shower soak. An experiment persay.. The results: absolutely no difference. So peel away if you can&#x27;t resist!&lt;br /&gt; The only problem I had with this product was that I had to wear socks at all times, which wasn&#x27;t bad because it&#x27;s winter.  However I find it extremely hard to sleep with socks on so I didn&#x27;t get great sleep for a few days. However I only needed to constantly have socks on for 3 days of the entire process. So it weighs out. It&#x27;s been a week since I applied the gel and it&#x27;s getting to the end of the peeling process. Only the tops of my feet have little pieces of skin still clinging on. Thats easily concealable with some lotion.&lt;br /&gt;All in all the product worked phenomenally! It got more layers of skin off than any pumice, foot file, or expensive pedicure ever could. My biggest tip is to make sure you keep up with daily soaks! And to use terry cloth when peeling seems to be clinging on for too long.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have been seeing people cry about how long this takes, and I am saying its well worth it!! I have EXTREME dry, rough feet (ruined 3 sets of fitted sheets in the last couple years) and have tried so many things and nothing has ever come remotely close to the great results this has.  I first saw this product being used in a salon and decided I would try that, but then FOUND it on here and thought I would save a wad a cash and do it myself. Although my skin didn&#x27;t fall off in big huge chunks ( I used a pumas stone while soaking on the 5th day), it did fall off leaving my feet softer than they have been probably my whole life ( I was a barefoot child, hated shoes).  I cant stop touching them!  Get it and love your feet!</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  After wearing the booties for an hour and washing my feet I thought this product was going to be a dud.  I didn&#x27;t feel anything. No tingling, burning or itching.  Nothing!  Then sure enough about 5 days later the peeling began.  CRAZY!  Every surface of my feet peeled off over the next few days.  I was very worried that my feet were going to be sore or very sensitive but they were not at all.  Just soft and smooth.  Better than anything I have ever achieved with a pedicure!</li>
    <li> It did not work at all.  I followed the instructions and after the wait, no peeling occurred. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. As per another reviewers suggestion, this time I not only soaked before using but right after and have been soaking every day since for at least half an hour. Usually I only take showers and have never seen this much progress. Soaking is definitely the key to getting the most out of this investment. Here two weeks later I am still sloughing off old nasty skin and the areas that have completely peeled feel baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other new thing tried this time- my husband put the used booties on after I took them off and left them on his feet for an hour. He did not soak first, because it was spur of the moment curiosity on his part, but his feet are peeling. He has also soaked a couple times after to great effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can get past the initial gross factor of sharing these with a friend, the gel does not become ineffective after a first use. By the way his feet don&#x27;t really fit, He simply cuts the toes out the bootie (because his heels need it more) and then tapes up two small  plastic garbage bags worn over the broken booties and puts sock over the whole thing. Enough gel somehow made it on to his toes to cause them to peel too. Not ideal perhaps but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Expensive but does work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews but I feel in this case I need too. I will submit a follow up. I read about this several times and when I read an article of one of the writers in a magazine write a review I figured I would try it. Not on myself but my husband. He has bad feel and feel this would be a good way to kick off taking better care of them. So I read all the instructions and every tip I could find. What I did not read about or find is what happened next....its says to tape the booties over the top of your feet to they are secure and put socks on...well we did. The next day my husband said the top of his feet were itchy...I just chucked it off as a irritation...NOPE the top of his feet are BRIGHT RED! He says it itches like crazy. I have had him soak in water, re washed his feet. Applied Aloe and itching cream. Anything to give him relieve. Its an obvious chemical burn to me. The bottoms of his feet are just fine with no issues. However he keeps scratching and making it worse...how long it will last I dont know...we are on day 2 now. What they should instruct you to do is fold the tops IN not over!! my current review is based on what I have seen as of now...Keep you posted...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as described.</li>
    <li> Used this foot peel before and really like it.  My feet feel soft and not so dry after using it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but much looking forward to it. Spring is only 14days away and I gotta get these dogs ready for sandal weather. Once I try it, I promise to come back with an edited review.</li>
    <li> After ten days it peeled the more thinner layer of skin on top of my feet and between my toes. The more thicker and harder dead skin on my heels and the balls of my feet still remain to start peeling. Since there is no advice about a partial success, I&#x27;m not sure if I continue to wait or try another treatment.</li>
    <li> My husband sent me a website with a review of this stuff.  Bless his heart, he says he doesn&#x27;t care if I have Hobbit feet but he knows I don&#x27;t like them.  My feet haven&#x27;t looked right since I was in the Army and I have tried everything from pedicures to those small cheese graters sold to knock down calluses.  Nothing worked.  I still had Hobbit feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the box arrived I let it sit on my bathroom counter for a few days.  This isn&#x27;t a necessary step but it might help build a little courage.  I finally got brave enough, so, after reading the directions several times - and Following Them - I sat down with a good book.  Then I needed a drink of water.  If you can help it at all Do Not try to walk in these things.  I managed to stuff them into a pair of slippers and even that felt like I was walking on an iced sidewalk.  As other reviewers have said, take them off near the tub so you don&#x27;t track the goop all over the house.  I ended up leaving them on for 2 hours because it was a really good book and I lost track of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day 3 I was beginning to believe this was a scam.  I still had Hobbit feet only they were dry and itchy.  I went back through the directions and reviews to find clues.  I had figured the soaking my feet got in the shower would he good enough.  It&#x27;s not.  Give it a couple days and do a serious foot soak for at least 30 minutes.  I did that today, again with a good book, and still didn&#x27;t see anything.  At least not until my feet dried.  I was walking barefoot around the house about an hour later when I took a step and felt cold on the bottom of my foot.  A HUGE piece of skin had come off and stuck to the floor behind me.  YUCK!  I sat down to inspect the bottoms of my feet and skin was coming loose all over!  Gentle rubbing, not peeling or pulling, has gotten the worst of it off and they&#x27;re still peeling.  By the looks of it, this process is going to need a couple more days and at least one more good soak.  Since I have calluses on my calluses I may need to do another treatment in a couple weeks to get those off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this for anyone who actually needs calluses on their feet.  So you, the woman who lives in Manhatten and walks everywhere in heels...Don&#x27;t do it.  Same goes for the guy who climbs all the rock, the woman who runs marathons, and anybody currently serving in the military.  It will make you calluses go away and you will hate the earth you walk on.  For everyone else, go for it...just try not to panic when your feet look like something out of a zombie movie.s on my calluses I may need to do another treatment in a couple weeks to get those off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this for anyone who actually needs calluses on their feet.  So you, the woman who lives in Manhatten and walks everywhere in heels...Don&#x27;t do it.  Same goes for the guy who climbs all the rock, the woman who runs marathons, and anybody currently serving in the military.

    <li> it worked but the process is messy...follow the directions to the T... make sure you soak before doing it ... be prepared to clean up my bf hated it after we watched tv n the carpet had a trail of dead skin</li>
    <li> Worked well as expected but their are much better options out there. Ones that take far less time, create less of a mess, work immediately(instead of 2 weeks of foot flake), and cost less. On the upside it killed a rather large planters wart.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this and I followed the directions exactly. Either I don&#x27;t have dry calloused skin because of previous pedicures, last one this past fall, or Baby Feet did not work. I even soaked my feet again a week later as someone suggested and still no skin peeling. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The rougher the feet, the more you may have to use so buy 2, on the first time getting it!</li>
    <li> Worked as well if not better than advertised.</li>
    <li> Good product, lived up to expectations.</li>
    <li> Worked great worth the price!!!!!</li>
    <li> My feet are baby smooth! This product does what it promises, but the whole thing is a little &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; -- putting my feet in some slimy stuff in a bag, then watching the skin peel off every time I took my shoes off. In the end, though, my feet are ready for summer.</li>
    <li> This is my second time getting this product and I haven&#x27;t used it yet. Saying that, the first time I tried it I had gotten it for a birthday present. It did work and my feet were super smooth after the skin had come off. Mine wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as some of the pictures you see online but I don&#x27;t have bad feet. It is something I think you would have to use often to keep them soft. I did buy one for my stepdad for Father&#x27;s Day and can&#x27;t wait to see his results, bc his feet are well......... Let&#x27;s just say a little rough. ;)</li>
    <li> Great foot peel. Peels very well but just takes too long to peel completely for me but still a great product. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I wasted my money on this so called &amp;#34;Miracle Product&amp;#34;.  I followed the directions exactly and waited for the appropriate amount of time for it to do something...ANYTHING!!  Nothing and I mean NOTHING happened. Perhaps the people who had positive results received a suitably manufactured product while those of us who had a failed result received a defective product.  My feet still look terrible and even more money needs to be spent to get them to look presentable.</li>
    <li> Love,love. After using this product your feet really are baby soft!! The pealing process is a bit strange but worth it when your feet feel so soft after.!</li>
    <li> Wow. I thought the reviews of this sounded like fake paid advertisements. But here comes another one. Don&#x27;t even think twice about *if* you should use this- just do it. It&#x27;s practically miraculous! My heels were literally catching on the bed sheets. I used as directed, plus after about four days I started doing a 20-30min epsom soak and gentle rubbing about every other night for another week. I can&#x27;t get over how much smoother and fantastic my feet feel. Seriously, I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to hear about this product.</li>
    <li> I kept waiting for more exfoliation to occur.  It was no more than the drug store bottle exfoliation I have used in the shower.  Not worth my money.</li>
    <li> 5th day and not even a flake. Followed the directions exactly with clean feet and soaked before hand. However I went back and read reviews and the reviewers are saying to SOAK YOUR FEET DAILY FOR 30 minutes and this will help start the peeling. Well I did and it did. The packaging I received did not say that so I&#x27;m assuming that the people that it didn&#x27;t work on were the people like me that didn&#x27;t soak their feet in the days after.</li>
    <li> the product worked fantastic.  I soaked prior to using and then soaked just after taking my feet out of the booties.  It took about 3 days before the skin started peeling.  My feet were really, really dry so I was always putting coco butter on them.  Since I have used the baby foo, my feet are not dry and the skin underneath is so soft and smooth. I am exactly one week from application and I have out lotion on my feet one time.  The skin is still peeling but my feet feel fantastic.  I will definitely do this again.</li>
    <li> So, here I am 2 weeks in and all of the thick skin from the bottom of my foot has peeled off leaving pink, healthy, SOFT skin. I am currently experiencing an unexpected event...which is the peeling of the top of my foot up to the ankle! So basically every place that the boot touched my foot has or is peeling. With that said, I would buy it again and my husband is constantly harassing me to buy him one for his rough man feet, LOL.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and like another reviewer stated, the package was totally different and frankly I didn&#x27;t expect it to work at all. I read many reviews about this product on many other sites and this is how I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak feet for one hour before putting on botties&lt;br /&gt;2. Wrap feet in booties and leave on for an hour (don&#x27;t try and walk, you will fall)!&lt;br /&gt;3. Washed my feet with soap and water and that&#x27;s it. Don&#x27;t wear slippers afterwards because whatever color slippers you put on, your feet will turn that color.&lt;br /&gt;4. Two days later, I soaked my feet in plain warm water for 15 minutes (still nothing).&lt;br /&gt;5. Every other day, I would soak my feet in warm water for 15 minutes and the second time I soaked my feet, the skin starting coming off. Especially around my toes and then all hell broke loose. Skin starting coming off, in places I didn&#x27;t think possible (the arch of my foot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the directions say, because my package was from Japan, but some other reviewer suggested this and this is what I did. Not sure if it would have worked any other way since you have to soak your feet. If you just take a daily shower, I don&#x27;t know what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told all my friends about this product and when I use it next time, I am going to take pictures.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  I was hooked the very first time I tried it.  It completely removed all of the dead, dry skin from my feet.  When the peeling first started it was not too attractive, so I soaked my feet in a tub of water and gently smoothed the loose skin off.  My feet are now &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of dead skin on my feet, but after wearing flip flops all summer I need something to peel away dry skin. This product does exactly what it says it does. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product! it really works..Now all my girlfriends, co-workers are trying it along with their spouses...I will use this product on a bi-annual basis..</li>
    <li> **update** don&#x27;t but from this seller! Bought from the other Prime seller (that&#x27;s about $2 more), and they send *the real product*. These vendors probably occasionally send the correct product, but also send out rejects, so it&#x27;s a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy from elsewhere for guaranteed satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m trying it ONE. MORE. FREAKING. TIME. I am so bummed, not only because my feet are still like they were, and not necessarily because of the money, but it&#x27;s been A PAIN to devote 3 hours the first night, and then 30 minutes to an hour of nothing but foot soaking EVERYDAY for the two weeks since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious if maybe I got a bad batch (it was all in Japanese, and didn&#x27;t look like the picture shown)? My feet were chilly during the initial application, but normally they sweat. Does that affect it? I have no idea, but the most I got from it was looking like my feet had just gotten out of a swimming pool (which they basically had been since soaking for that long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO ANNOYED.</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing! I peeled like a snake!  Totally disgusting but sooo worth it.  Finally a product that actually worked!!  Do not hesitate to buy. My feet feel and look wonderful!! Be patient took my feet 6 days to peel but came off in sheets!! Love love love this!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. After a couple days you can just scrape dead skin off your feet with your fingernails. So gross, but oddly satisfying. I wish it was cheaper though.</li>
    <li> actually works. i was shocked. took about 2 weeks for me to get the full effect.</li>
    <li> It really does work well. But it is best to soak your feet in warm water like it recommends, first.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, the box contains 1 treatment for 2 feet,  it is crazy how much skin peels off your feet. Though it isn&#x27;t an immediate effect, it takes many days for the skin to begin peeling.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product, but it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.  My feet are even worse now than they were before I used this product.  I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> so gross and i LOVE it.  Layers of my dry skin fell off. Be warned: You can&#x27;t wear open shoes for the week you are peeling!</li>
    <li> It worked. It really did. But be prepared to be annoyed by endlessly peeling skin for several weeks. It sheds the skin in the places you want it to, and then the places you don&#x27;t, like the tops of your feet.</li>
    <li> This product truly works. You will in fact have 100% all new skin on your feet. Now, if you can only deal with the week or so it takes to get all that nasty old skin peeled off! It&#x27;s fun if you are into it! I do not recommend if you want instant results, or need nice looking feet quickly. The whole process takes 1 week to start peeling, then another week or more to get all the skin off.</li>
    <li> Really fantastic! Give it a good five days to start working! Wonderful results</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have awful feet, but despite frequent pedicures, my heels always looked dry &amp; I had lots of thick skin around the toenails.  I soaked in warm water for a good while, then put on the booties, with a pair of socks over to hold them in place.  Find yourself a good spot when you do this, because you won&#x27;t be walking around for an hour.  I went to my desk with a glass of ice water and my computer, slid on the booties, and the hour was up before I knew it.  I toddled to the bathroom, washed the gel off thoroughly.  Absolutely nothing happened for about 5 days, then suddenly, pouf, the dead skin started peeling off, even on the toes.  The top of the feet, where there wasn&#x27;t much of a problem, came last, kind of just flaky.  I felt nothing this whole time; there was no redness,no irritation at all.  It was like magic.  I put off having a pedicure for a month, never said a word about what I&#x27;d done.  My regular lady said my feet were really in nice shape, &amp; of course she took all the credit for it because of her great pedicures. I just smiled sweetly &amp; said nothing.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have insanely dry feet, especially around the heels, which are always cracked. Even my boyfriend&#x27;s feet were smoother than mine. Foot scrubs, foot cream, and a Ped Egg helped a little, but nothing lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used Baby Foot, my feet felt insanely dry and uncomfortable. The skin started to peel four days later and continued for a few days after. I was worried that the fresh skin underneath would feel raw and sensitive, but the peeling actually revealed some very healthy, rejuvenated skin. My heels started to peel first, then the balls of my feet--the driest parts. It was oddly satisfying to pull off giant pieces of dead skin. The skin around the toes and the tops and sides of my feet were more flaky and I couldn&#x27;t really pull them off as easily because they&#x27;re not flat surfaces. You just kind of have to rub it off in the shower or let it fall off on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;m really impressed with the product. My feet are so soft!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!! Will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried to use this after seeing the reaction someone had. I put the booties on and sat down with my feet propped up for about an hour. It felt a little squishy and odd but it didn&#x27;t burn or feel bad. I rinsed my feet off afterwards. About 3 days later my feet began to peel. I have very bad callouses on my heels and it took most of that off. I probably need to do another treatment in a month or two to get the rest of it.</li>
    <li> This product did not deliver the results that I was hoping for. My feet started to peel on day 3 after soaking my feet every day for about 30 min. I was so excited to see it starting to work, unfortunately every where peeled but the area I really wanted to. My heel, which is really bad did not peel at all really even after two weeks. I would like to try again but not willing to spend another $30. I am going to try a cheaper brand off eBay to see if that works, and if at that point it doesn&#x27;t work then at least I haven&#x27;t wasted so much money.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed, I thought it would do more.  I still have the deepest calluses, I didn&#x27;t know that I would need to buy more and repeat the process.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It does exactly what it promises. My feet feel great when it is all over.</li>
    <li> It did everything the reviews said it would do. My feet felt awesome afterwards! Interesting peeling process to say the least LOL I would def do it again!</li>
    <li> Product worked beautifully! !!Absolutely effortless treatment with smooth &amp;#34;Baby feet&amp;#34; results!:)</li>
    <li> I kept it on my feet for one hour and fifteen minutes. Three days after, I soaked my feet and the skin started peeling off. Amazing!! I am going to buy a couple more and make this part of my regular routine. It works, it actually works.</li>
    <li> Exact results as reviewed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t come in the packaging that is shown. It was just in a silver package so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a knockoff. It&#x27;s very messy but after 4 days my feet started peeling. The important thing I&#x27;ve noticed is to definitely soak your feet daily to get the product to work better</li>
    <li> Worked As well as advertised, very effective</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.. It did exactly what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this was going to be a bust.  It took a full 10 days before the skin started peeling off, but then,  it went crazy and three days later, I had completely NEW FEET.  Could not belieeeeeve the difference this product made.  (Feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!) You might not think it will work, but have patience; IT WILL!!!</li>
    <li> No good, peeled my feet but my cracking heels were still there...:(</li>
    <li> Wow I was sure the product would not work on my ugly feet! My GF insisted I try it. Holy moly, 3 to 4 days after using my dead skin started peeling off. Super gross but really cool!! I recommend the product for sure. I will use more in the fall when I am not wearing flip flops. It was embarrassing to have peeling feet for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Best product ever.  I have crocodile feet.  Had to use twice but my feet look like new.</li>
    <li> This product works fine.  Not as dramatic as the ad shows, but does exfoliate and make your skin smoother. It may be really useful to those with a lot of callouses.</li>
    <li> Boy does this stuff actually work. My only warning is that if you have several layers of dry skin it can crack and leave some cuts that take a few days to heal. I have no idea why anyone needs to use it more than once in a very long while.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing stuff!  I would recommend this stuff to anyone just thinking about giving it a try, and I actually have recommended it to people.  I will no doubt use this again if I need to.  It left my feet feeling amazing.  It will literally take 5-7 days for the product to start working (peeling) on your feet, but it is worth the wait.  Give it a try, it&#x27;s worth the $$!</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to confess that I am embarrassed of my feet.  When I get pedicures with my friends, I always pre-prep my feet hoping for them to look at least a little less embarrassing when I take my shoes off at the salon.  I am always the one who needs the cheese grater for my heels, and I always tip extra because I know I&#x27;m THAT lady.  So when I read the reviews of this product, I thought &amp;#34;Yeah, right.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the package, I opened it up and there were two thin plastic booties sealed at the top.  I have big feet (11), and I was so happy that the booties were quite large.  As per the instructions, I washed and dried my feet.  I cut the top off one of the booties and put them on my foot, one at a time.  The booties were more than ample for my long feet.  I put a pair of non-skid socks over the top, so I could feel more secure if I needed to walk around during the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat and waited the hour.  During that time, I didn&#x27;t feel anything except maybe a little tingling.  It&#x27;s possible that was just in my head, though, since I had read other people who said they felt that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off the booties and washed my feet, hoping that maybe something magical had happened and the booties would come off to reveal the beautiful soft feet I&#x27;ve always wanted.  Nope.  Nothing. So  I waited...one day...two days...four days, nothing.  I thought I got duped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up on the 5th day, and lo and behold my feet were shedding like mad.  All of the old, dry skin was painlessly flaking away and under it was new, healthy, smooth skin.  It&#x27;s been about 3 days and they&#x27;re still shedding a little on my toes.  Hooray!  I wasn&#x27;t duped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it wasn&#x27;t the perfect cure all I had hoped for.  The heals and balls of my feet didn&#x27;t seem to shed as much as everywhere else.  I am ordering the booties again and will try again in a week or two.  This time I will soak my feet and maybe use a pumice on the difficult areas and see if they come out better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this in my routine every once in awhile if the soaking works.  I&#x27;ll just make sure to start wearing socks to bed around day 4 or 5 as it does get a little messy.e if they come out better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this in my routine every once in awhile if the soaking works.  I&#x27;ll just make sure to start wearing socks to bed around day 4 or 5 as it does get a little messy.</li>
    <li> This is so cool and makes your feet feel wonderful....I will would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> I will order this and make sure I check my order next time it should have been to but it ok work very well on my feet very smooth woohoo kmsl..! a great buy</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected. I&#x27;m young, my foot aren&#x27;t in rough shape, but not as smooth.</li>
    <li> Never pay for a pedicure again! Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought! The peeling latest a few days but I didn&#x27;t mind. Strongly recommend</li>
    <li> peeled some skin, but definitely did not work as advertised. very messy, too.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I mean I have searched all over for something to remove the dead skin from the heels of my feet. I received my set on Monday by Friday my feet were pealing !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the product I recommend soaking your feet for at least 30 min. That&#x27;s what I</li>
    <li> Not as dramatic results as I was expecting, just very minor peeling on the side of my foot for one day- certainly not the entire foot or much skin.</li>
    <li> Best stuff EVER for getting rid of nasty ashy skin on your feet, plus you get the fun of peeling it off. Love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a 55 year old woman who was a summertime, outdoor life guard all through my high school and college years.  Needless to say, I developed tough feet from walking on hot concrete pool decks for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, my feet suddenly went from tough to thick callused, cracked and bleeding. It was both painful and ugly. I went to dermatologists who prescribed creams and ointment.  I went to podiatrists who shaved off the outer layers of the calluses. I had weekly pedicures.  But nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months ago, I saw the Baby Feet product mentioned in several magazines.  I went online and did a little more research and decided to give it a try.  Why not? I had tried everything else.  I ordered 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used Baby Feet, I followed the directions perfectly.  10 days later I had very minimal peeling.  I was kind of disappointed, so I went back and read other users&#x27; comments.  Several people suggested soaking your feet in warm water prior to using the product (which I did not do originally).  Most importantly, one user suggested keeping the booties on for 2 hours instead of the 1 hour listed in the directions. Knowing that I had tough, tough feet with very thick calluses, I decided to try the 2 hours and see what happens.  I also planned on soaking my feet nightly in warm water to help speed things along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SOOO wished I had taken pictures...but after only 2 days, the calluses on the ball of my feet and the calluses on my heels were just hanging.  It was amazing.  The product seemed to just attack the areas on my feet with the thickest and hardest calluses.  The rest of the foot did peel, but not to the extent of my problem areas.  I was thrilled and my husband was even impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that I had years of damage to undo, I have continued to use the product about once a month.  Each time, I continue to get results, but to a lesser degree mainly because the calluses are so minimal.  My shoes are even fitting differently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend this product enough!!  I wish I had found it years ago.are even fitting differently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend this product enough!!  I wish I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the service and got the product very fast. I soaked my feet and then sat with my husband ( both of us bought a pair) for one hr. The peeling did not start till about the second day. But my complaint was that it removed all the skin in the areas I did not really need to have skin removed. My Heels and the ball of my foot and my big toe did not start to peal and I am now into the 8 day mark and the skin in these 2 areas has still not come off. Do I do it again and spend another 25 $ or what?</li>
    <li> followed directions and it did not work for me.  tried this 2x, nothing, no peel just a very superficial peel 2nd time.</li>
    <li> Yes, it took a layer of skin off my feet starting about day 4.  My feet were very soft and looked nice... But, !y feet are so tender they hurt when I walk.  I now have a big blister on my heal and can&#x27;t get on the treadmill.  I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> Really peels feet, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Burned my feet. Under doctors care</li>
    <li> I read about this product in Allure magazine, and as usual, the editors were right!  I have neglected my feet for 45 years--walking barefoot, never using lotions or creams regularly, and it had caught up with me in calluses and soreness.  I wore the booties for 1.5 hours, and then waited.  It took about a week to start peeling, but like I said, I have not cared for my feet, ever.  Of course the calluses didn&#x27;t want to go peacefully.  I have been on vacation, so I helped the product along with long, hot baths all week.  After 9 days, 90% of my calluses are gone--even my nasty, cracked heels are much improved.  I am on vacation again in March, so if necessary, I may do a second treatment then to clean up any bad spots that are still left.  It is always wonderful to find a product that does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about Baby Foot at first, but because I have chronically dry feet I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it out. It was really simple to use. Just take the little footie packages out of the box, open them up and put them on. My feet started to feel a little funny while I had them on, but it was nothing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 5 days after using Baby Foot, I was starting to get a little worried because nothing spectacular was happening. My feet looked just as dry and cracked as ever. But somewhere around day 6, BOOM! That&#x27;s when the magic happened lol. I got out of the shower and dead skin began peeling off the bottom of my feet. This was pretty gross, as you can imagine, but I was so excited. I then spent the next hour peeling dead skin off my feet (blatantly ignoring the instructions on the box to not do so). I couldn&#x27;t help it, it was hanging off of my feet for goodness sake! The skin on the top of my feet started to peel really bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress, all in all the product worked as promised. I recommend giving yourself a full 2 weeks after the day of use to allow you feet to look normal again. Great buy overall. I plan on purchasing again in a a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Not too bad. I was expecting something more like those extreme pictures I saw.</li>
    <li> It sort of worked. It was just as horrible as some people explained with the peeling -but it&#x27;s NOT long lasting and did not do everything as initially promised. I followed directions completely, too.</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to this product, after reading good reviews and seeing an article in Huffpo. What a waste of $30+ bucks. Didn&#x27;t experience any peeling until the 8th day. It did not make any difference whatsoever on the calloused areas, it just peeled the thinnest layer of skin, similar to what you experience after a sunburn. I&#x27;m disappointed, and wasted ten days waiting for results that never came. Spend your money on a good quality pedicure instead.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!!  You may think one or so days it is not working then bamb!!! After you are through your feet are very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought Baby Foot for my husband, whose feet are exceptionally dry and calloused. Just used it Friday, so it&#x27;s been 3 days. He reports that the bottoms of his feet feel more pliable, but there&#x27;s been NO peeling or shedding of skin. ??? If that doesn&#x27;t happen I don&#x27;t think the product is worth the $25 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest product I&#x27;ve ever used. I tell everyone about it. The pictures and results you see here are real. I always keep an extra pack laying around for touch up purposes. Make a great gift for man or woman. My husband and I both had baby smooth feet after days of using this. No pedicure has ever rid me of so much dead skin. Totally worth the cost (which has recently went down)!!!</li>
    <li> Do not use this product if you have any history of sensitive skin, eczema, psoriasis, etc. At first, my feet felt soft. A day or two later, they started to peel and then I had a horrible rash on both feet. My feet ended up cracking and peeling. I had to see a podiatrist (who ruled out Athletes foot) and then a dermatologist. The condition has lasted for 6 weeks, right in the middle of sandal season.</li>
    <li> I bought this product previously from the Baby Foot website and it worked fabulously.  My feet peeled within days, revealing super soft, beautiful skin.  Not this time.  Purchased through Amazon and nothing - absolutely nothing - happened.  It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks and not one sign of peeling, no soft skin, nothing.  I followed the instructions to a T, soaking my feet first, left the booties on for an hour, etc.  Not sure if the product was expired or just lavender scented goo but I&#x27;m very disappointed since it&#x27;s pricey.  Would NOT recommend through Amazon.  Try the mfgr website since that Baby Foot purchase worked like a charm for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! My feet have never looked or felt better. Already bought 2 more.</li>
    <li> I wish I took before and after pictures.  My heels have always been extremely dry, flaky, cracked and at times, painful.  I tried the foot files, a million different lotions, Crisco, pumice stones, callus remover creams and weekly pedicures.  Nothing worked anywhere near as well as Baby Foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that you need to be essentially immobile for two hours while you have the booties on.  They are not designed to be walked-in and the gel is super slippery so even if you&#x27;re careful you still will probably fall down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no odor and I didn&#x27;t experience any kind of tingling (although other reviewers have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two hours with my feet up (which was a mini vacation in and of itself) I washed the gel off in the shower and put on some cotton socks and went to bed. I didn&#x27;t notice any major changes on Day 1 but the typically rough skin on my heels and the balls of my feet felt softer.  By the end of Day 2 though, I saw all kinds of yuck peeling off my feet when I got out of the shower.  The peeling has continued for almost a week and the difference in my skin is night and day.  The dry stuff is almost completely gone and my feet look SO soft and healthy now.  The summer is almost over but I would not be at all embarassed to wear sandals or slingback heels.  I&#x27;m experiencing minor discomfort on the ball of my left foot where it&#x27;s peeling but it hurts less than a papercut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say not to peel the skin by hand, to just let it fall off on its own.  To avoid a mess of dead skin rubbing off while I sleep, I&#x27;ve been rubbing my feet in a circular motion with a damp towel after getting out of the shower.  If you choose to do this, a word to the wise, put a trashcan or towel under you when you do, it&#x27;s a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;ve tried so many different methods and this is the only on that has made any kind of difference.  I love this product so far and I&#x27;d definitely use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Baby Foot two additional times since I wrote this first review (I&#x27;m in the middle of a peeling period right now) and I&#x27;m still 100% satisfied with the results.  The peeling has gone much faster the subsequent times.  I just used the booties on Saturday and by today (Wednesday) I&#x27;m almost completely done peeling.

    <li> My  wife now has feet like a baby!</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever done for my feet!!</li>
    <li> This product is a JOKE!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite things. It works better than a pedicure. I recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> Loved it! The peel made it feel so soft and nice. A month later my feet are still soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel for my husband for Christmas.  His feet were in absolutely terrible shape...think cheese grater feet.  So, I may have purchased this for myself just has much as him.  After following the instructions, my husband set back in the recliner with his feet up and his booties on. Why, oh why, didn&#x27;t I take a picture? I acted as his servant, since he couldn&#x27;t move.  He whined a bit about a burning sensation, but it was definitely not unbearable or uncomfortable, just noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His peeling started after two days.  He had no pain.  He stands on his feet for hours each day, and he was still able to do so with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day five, his feet were as soft as can be! I was amazed! I guess I won&#x27;t have to complain anymore when his feet inadvertently brush my legs in bed.</li>
    <li> The wife loves these.</li>
    <li> Ever since I use this product I have such pain in my feet. I wish I never use this product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. I read the reviews and ignored the unhappy costumers. I wish I would have took their advice as now, as I feel the same way. A complete waste of money, give me a pedicure over this any day, it feels so much better. My skin felt super tight for a few days, then it started peeling. 4 days later it is still peeling, I feel like I am shedding like a lizard. It&#x27;s nasty! I can&#x27;t wait until my skin stops peeling.</li>
    <li> Work way better than I thought.My feet were really bad.I did it just like it said.First I saw nothing in about 4 days later lots of dead cskin peeled off and my feet feel amazing.</li>
    <li> A friend buys hers from her dermatologist and recommended it to me. Now I&#x27;m sharing the info with everyone! It really works. Be prepared to have &amp;#34;lizard feet&amp;#34; for a couple of weeks but the end result is work it. I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, but I love this product and will buy again.  The gel that you soak your feet in is actually pretty cool and relaxing.  My feet actually started peeling the next day.  And within 5 days, were done.  Although, I had to wear socks the whole time so that I didn&#x27;t leave dead, exfoliated skin, wherever I went.  Especially in public...can you imaging the looks you would get?  lol...  Skin felt babyskin soft but I can see it becoming very addictive!  Need to sell in bulk!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I know someone who has and loved it</li>
    <li> After a lot of research, I decided to purchase this product. My feet were terribly scaly and dry. After soaking my feet for 15 mins, I put on the booties for 2 hours. I then soaked my feet again for 15 mins. After 2 days, I saw no peeling or any signs that it was working and I was extremely disappointed. By day 3 after coming out of the shower I saw a huge piece of skin peeling off! I then started peeling off as much skin as I could without pulling anything that wasn&#x27;t ready. After 2 weeks, my feet finally stopped peeling. The part that took the longest to finish peeling was the top of my ankles. But my feet are smooth!!! I would definitely recommend this product but when I do it again next year I would definitely soak my feet everyday to speed up the peeling process.</li>
    <li> The product takes a few days to work, so I am not really sure it is working at this point. It felt good though.</li>
    <li> I have US Women&#x27;s 10 size feet so I was worried these wouldn&#x27;t fit. They fit exactly perfectly; maybe a size 11 could stretch in there too because there is a lot of extra material at the top of the bootie bag. If you&#x27;re size 12+ I would definitely go with the larger size in the blue box. I uploaded a picture with the bootie bags next to a measuring tape so you can see the exact length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works exactly as described, the peeling process didn&#x27;t take forever either. I thought I would have to hide my feet for a month or more but it&#x27;s 1 day shy of a week since I did it and I&#x27;m basically done peeling, except for the tops of my feet &amp; toe crevices. I only spend about 30 minutes picking at them every night since the 3rd night. My feet are so smooth, and it even peeled away some of the thicker parts on my callused areas. It didn&#x27;t peel the whole callus, but it got several layers off; it feels much better and smoother. I don&#x27;t have any corns or bunions so I can comment on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not soak my feet every day or even moisturize them after the first day. It was completely low maintenance, I just picked at it in the evening as I watched a video. There was no pain at all during the peeling process, no tender spots where the skin held on. I even peeled my big toe cuticle off with no sensitivity at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably want a good exfoliating cloth for the tops of your feet to get those peels off, because they don&#x27;t really peel off in sheets like the bottom of your foot. I recommend the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001MSEHYE Aquasentials Gentle Weave Terry Bath Cloth (2pk)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000EZOC1O Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel - Pink]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also take a pumice stone to my toes to scrub the skin away, since it&#x27;s hard to peel in between them. Overall I would buy this again, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product, but have to say that 2 weeks after wearing the booties, I&#x27;m a believer and will definitely purchase again. I soaked my feet for one hour prior and then soaked them every other day or so starting on about day 4 and the skin just fell off my feet in chunks. I was a lifeguard in my teens and 20s and my feet have had thick dry calluses ever since. My heels were also extremely dry and cracked and now they are smooth and free of cracks. The calluses are still there but much softer. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this product, however, despite soaking my feet for over an hour prior to application, I noticed VERY little exfoliation in the days following application.  It was a disappointment for me.</li>
    <li> If you use your feet, don&#x27;t use this product.  Seriously - it is acid-burn on your feet. A friend used it and showed me her super soft feet and so I ordered it.  Whoopsy.  She doesn&#x27;t need to walk the dog and stand on her feet all day - I do, so for her, she didn&#x27;t notice any pain because she sits all day.  My feet were so painful from this stuff, I could barely walk for 2 weeks.  Are they softer?  A little, but not worth the pain.  I will stick to the old wives solution of raw vinegar and water and get the same results.</li>
    <li> I tried it, it took off some dried skin and flaked for a little bit.  However, not was I was expecting.  Although I took a quick bath and washed feet prior to trying it, I did not SOAK my feet prior.  While reading the instructions after I put the booties on it said works best if you first soak your feet.  It would have been helpful if they had that sentence in the directions up front.  So, I purchased another, I will soak feet this time for a long time prior to use to see what happens.  Not happy with the current results, but hopefully it will work better the second time around.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t complain at all about the mess because I expected that and anyone who has read anything about this product before buying it should as well. I was skeptical because my feet were horrible. I didn&#x27;t think it would be this easy to get them soft and beautiful again but it was. It took about 5-6 days to complete the process but when all of the dead skin finally came off (and I helped it along by soaking and rubbing) my feet were wonderful again! I would definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking as mentioned in other reviews is a must. I soaked my feet for about 30 minutes prior to using this and then soaked them once a day after. I wore the booties for 2 hours instead of 1 which may have also helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t peel the skin off when it first starts to look &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; (I tried this and it made my feet sore and tender). Wait until it&#x27;s ready to come off and then you can easily rub it right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear socks. :)</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this product.  I used it exactally like the directions said but have had below minimum results.  very disappointed.  A wadt of my money.  The package came and had stickers covering the upc code and now i have found probably the date.  if i hadnt thown the packaging away i would have returned for a refund.  So mad.  Will not order products like this from amazon again.</li>
    <li> I loved it...much better than expected.</li>
    <li> Works! Try not to put pressure on your heels  - those need to soak the most. I will use every summer.</li>
    <li> First off let me say, if you took one look at my feet before I used this product you&#x27;d swear I had been wondering around in the wilderness for 40 years barefoot! Dry,cracked and calloused. I got the product about 3 weeks but didn&#x27;t get to use until a week ago. I did as the instructions said, washed and dried my feet. Put the booties on. I did it for a little over an hour, then washed it off. Week later and the skin is coming off as advertised. I am guessing that if people are not seeing the results then either they got a bad batch or they didn&#x27;t follow the simple directions. Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions&lt;br /&gt;*Take a shower, wash,dry your feet. Put the product on and watch your favorite television show.&lt;br /&gt;*don&#x27;t cut both booties at the same time. It could get messy&lt;br /&gt;*move your feet,wiggle your toes so the product can get all over.&lt;br /&gt;*I wouldn&#x27;t suggest trying to walk while you have these booties on, they can rip pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;*during the peeling process your feet will look like a reptile shedding it&#x27;s skin so it is gross looking. Chances are your significant other will be grossed out by it.&lt;br /&gt;*Showering/bathing seems to expedite the peeling process once it starts.&lt;br /&gt;****Buy this product****</li>
    <li> It really works! My skin has softened up after the exfoliation.  Before that, I feel like I have reptile skin. LOL. I need to do this another round so my heels will look a lot better. I will use this again in the future.</li>
    <li> This product worked exactly as advertised. Gross, but effective! The first week I was skeptical. One week later I was a believer.</li>
    <li> Except for some slight peeling a week after I used the booties, the product did not work as advertised.  I am so disappointed!  I was truly hoping for smooth feet for the holiday season. I guess I will have to go back to getting pedicures.</li>
    <li> i soaked my feet first and then  put the &amp;#34;boot&amp;#34; on . after five days the magic started . my feet have not been this soft in years. i am so glad i tried it .</li>
    <li> I bought 2 kits and my sister and I did it together. I started peeling sooner than she did, but right around the time she thought it was just not going to do anything, her skin came off in sheets, just like other reviewers have said.  Next we are going to soak our feet first, and leave the booties on for 2 hours.  Just enough time to watch a movie!!</li>
    <li> I first picked this up before a warm weather trip.  Thankfully, I was warned that my feet would peel about four days later.  And boy howdy did they.  On day five, I think I shed about five layers of skin during a yoga class.  Not sure, but I feel like I lost a pound of dead skin in all.  Gross, I know, but awesome at the same time.  Now, a month later, my feet still feel like a baby&#x27;s behind. Seriously better than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Great product! My feet feel amazingly softer than ever! I recommended this product to everyone I know! Only thing is, if you have calluses you may have to soak feet a little longer. I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I applied the goo on a Friday afternoon and pretty much forgot about it. Then, Monday morning after a 12-hour work shift I removed my socks and was startled to see large chunks of skin falling on the floor. It was so dramatic that I had to take pics as I knew no one would believe my story. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all. For the next few days, the skin continued to slough off leaving nice un-calloused feet. Using this product was a fun experiment, but the price makes it prohibitive to use on a regular basis. I will most likely gift this product as it is pretty unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did leave the boots on for 2 hours based on much of the information I gleaned from others&#x27; reviews.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Two months later, my feet are back the way they were...almost seem worse! I don&#x27;t understand why it didn&#x27;t last. Worked great, but I won&#x27;t use again since the results didn&#x27;t last.  Also, with patience these could last for two uses by using 1 on one foot and then switch it to the other foot. There was plenty of gel inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with results. I put it off for a week after I rec&#x27;d it because the photos made it seems gross. I soaked my feet every day and then rubbed off the dry skin with a paper towel each time (after a 20 min soak). It kept the dry skin from peeling or coming off in between soakings. Took 4 days to start and the whole process was over in a week. I used this a month ago and my feet look great. I will use again if/when it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
    <li> I loved my baby foot exfoliation. It did exactly what it said on the box that it would do. It took me probably more than 7 days to start peeling. I started peeling probably 8-9 days after using baby foot. It was wonderful, it took all of my dead skin off and even my calluses. I would recommend this to anyone that want their feet to feel completely like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Tried the product it did absolutely nothing has suggested it would</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me... I&#x27;ve used the Baby Foot peel once before from an authorized dealer and it was unbelievable, but this was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I use this product periodically as I hate having rough feet. It does a great job. It seems to work best when you pre soak your feet and then I usually leave it on for the longest recommended time. Summer and sandals here I come!</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I did not think anything could make my feet soft again!  I live in the desert and love to go barefoot, my feet were in bad shape.  Now they are great.</li>
    <li> This worked just like it said.  All the reviews are true--this is a magic product.  Only downside was that having the booties on burned a little more than I thought it would (at least for me), but despite that I will still use this again and again.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, but there were still some slight rought spots on heels.  It&#x27;s still worth it, it just doesn&#x27;t get everything.</li>
    <li> I figured it would probably work just ok, but this went way above my expectations!  It took almost a week for the peeling to start, but once it did it was amazing.  I haven&#x27;t written many reviews, but I thought this product was  so great that I wanted everyone to know.  First, exfoliate and wash your feet.  My feet were bad so I wish I had left the booties on longer, but now I know.  I used O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s foot cream every night.  Once it started peeling, I used an exfoliate scrub and it helped the peeling along.  Disgusting and miraculous!  My feet are soft, and I&#x27;m not embarrassed to take my shoes off.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!! Still peeling 3 weeks later! Feet were awful before this product even with regular pedis</li>
    <li> I will use baby foot again and have recommended product to several people</li>
    <li> I did not see the same results as others, and I wore 30 minutes longer then instructed. My foot peeled and the inside of my socks were disgusting, however I did not see softness.</li>
    <li> My feet were horrible. I love to go barefoot any time I can and you could tell. My heels were dry, cracked deeply, sore to walk on and the skin was so hard that I barely had any feeling in them. I had to rub my feet in coconut oil any time I went out in public because the dry, cracked skin was so embarrassing. Lotions, creams, files, lavender oil - nothing hid the damage for more than an hour or two.  Baby Foot has made my feet look BRAND NEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I did soak before using it &amp; soak for 15 minutes every day after. No lotions or oils.&lt;br /&gt;- Day 1 - 3 my feet just looked dry - the skin looked kind of like tissue paper, worse than usual. I was scared I&#x27;d ruined them. But on day 4 the peeling started. Small patches at first, but the more I soaked - the more skin fell off.&lt;br /&gt;- You WILL have a lot of dead skin to deal with. It will go everywhere! I wore socks at all times so I didn&#x27;t leave a trail of skin around the house.&lt;br /&gt;- The tops of my feet &amp; ankles did peel, but not until the last 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;- By day 11 I was finished and I have never been happier! No more cracks, my heels are soft and pink again. Even my toes look better.&lt;br /&gt;- There are a few small areas that could use a bit more help because they still FEEL a little rough even though they look great, so I may do a second application in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic!! I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> This product worked great. Just like the instructions state, it will take a week for your feet to start peeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had rough feet and have tried just about everything to rid my problem of constant dry feet (we&#x27;re talking feet catching my blankets rough).&lt;br /&gt;I read so many reviews that my eyes began to hurt and decided it was worth a try, I patiently waited for it to arrive and the minute I got my package I followed the instructions and put those babies on!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impatient so the almost week wait before my dead skin started sloughing off was agonizing! There was skin everywhere, it was disturbing yet satisfying, by the end of it my feet were baby bottom smooth and I was ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;Here I am maybe two weeks after the fact and every single toe has started to re-peel and not just a light layer, very thick hard layers of skin that bleed. I&#x27;m assuming I now have athletes foot, but will check with my doctor in the very near future.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll ordered this product again, the outcome didn&#x27;t exactly reach my expectations.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product be sure to soak your feet in warm water for 20 minutes or so first.  Works miracles</li>
    <li> Everything as promised</li>
    <li> Simply Amazing, it works!</li>
    <li> make sure when you order you KNOW there is ONLY 1 in a package! I find this odd as one, or I did, think there would​ be 2 in a pack for 2 feet as the one with 2 indicates 2 PAIR!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and followed all of the instructions and previous posters advice on soaking.  This product did pretty much nothing.  My feet were really dry for two weeks feeling tight and uncomfortable.  They shed like dandruff a little but didn&#x27;t get any softer.  They never peeled like everyone raved about.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Shipping took quite some time, but the product truly works! My feet began peeling 24 hours after using this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, even though a friend had used this with great success.  But I bought a kit, soaked my feet for one hour, and waited.  And waited... I&#x27;m the least patient person on the face of the earth.  About three days after soaking, the tops of my toe and foot started to slough off.  Not so much a peel, as just skin coming off when I dried my feet after a shower.  On day 6, however, things started happening.  My bathroom floor was a mess after wiping my feet after my shower.  It is now day 9 and the only skin that hasn&#x27;t peeled is on the very tips of my toes, and I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;ll slough off after a shower today.  My feet....soft and smooth, and free of dry skin and calluses.  I can&#x27;t believe how nice my feet feel.  The skin under my big toe has always been horribly dry and cracked and peels.  It&#x27;s now perfectly smooth and soft.  I would highly recommend this.  I have recommended it, and several cousins and my mom have ordered kits.  NOT something you want to be doing during sandal season, though, as it&#x27;s messy during the peeling process.  Wearing socks was a necessity while my feet peeled.  But it only lasted a few days and now they&#x27;re fabulous and ready for summer sandal season!</li>
    <li> This product delivers and in a HUGE way.  I am going to continue to use it every other month to keep my feet from cracking, and HURTING!  My feet have not looked this good since I was a kid.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  It really does the job and while a bit grouse worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any peeling of dead skin and this is day 3! It said 5-7 days so I will update if my results change.</li>
    <li> I used this and was very happy with the results until my feet started to not only flake and peel but also crack.  They cracked up and down, sideways and in long wavy lines.  They were bleeding on the floor when I walked and when I covered them it was worse.  I could hardly walk and it was very painful.  After removing a bandage, I could smell a yeasty smell and got on the computer.  I had a very bad fungal infection.  Nothing had changed in my life aside from the peel.  My floors are steamed each week and are hard surface.  My showers are bleached.  I live alone.  This has gone on for five months.  I have gone through tub after tube of anti fungal over the counter cream.  I finally admitted that this was not going to get better without help.  I have gone to a doctor who indeed agreed that I have a bad fungal infection, which most likely had been introduced by the defoliant I had used on my feet. I am on medication, trying to avoid the really big guns that may ruin your liver in the process.  I ordered several to give to friends because I just knew this would be a God send.  They have gone in the garbage.  I would not give this to my worst enemy.  It has been Hell.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product, but it did absolutely nothing for me. I followed directions, but no peeling, no nothing. Waste of a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My feet started peeling on Day 6, which is a lot later than the directions say. It didn&#x27;t work on the harder calluses on my feet. It worked to a small degree, but ultimately, made no difference. Probably works best on people with really minor skin problems.</li>
    <li> I used it on my husband&#x27;s feet. It worked wonderfully! It got rid of the roughnes, and gor rid of the dry skin. Loved it. Can&#x27;t wait to order one for me.</li>
    <li> I got these as a birthday present from my loving mother. She told me that she used them and loved the outcome. I thought it was absolutely disgusting, and doubted they would work.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to a T. I soaked my feet in the bath for around 15 minutes and dried them thoroughly. I slipped the plastic booties on, securing the tips around my ankle with the stickers included. My mom suggested putting on thick slipper socks, as to avoid breaking my neck, and I&#x27;m glad she did. Just walking to the sock drawer proved to be a risky and challenging task. The gel becomes incredibly slippery!&lt;br /&gt;I waited in a comfy chair for an hour, as instructed. Afterwards, I simply rinsed off my feet and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;3 days later, I wake up to a horrifying sight. Pieces of skin the size of post-it notes and gum wrappers adorn my sheets. It was truly disgusting. 5 days later, the large pieces were gone, revealing smooth skin. I continued to peel on the arch, sides, and top of my foot. Today marks day 8 and I&#x27;m still peeling between my toes, sides, and around the nail beds.&lt;br /&gt;***I would like to mention that I did soak my feet every night, as I&#x27;m a bath person in the evenings. I shower in the mornings. This may have helped the process.&lt;br /&gt;***For those people who gave lower stars and complained about this being temporary, umm... Our skin continues to grow each day! Of course this is temporary. I will update later on how long my feet have stayed soft.&lt;br /&gt;***I have taken pictures from before, twice during, and day 8, but cannot upload them here. If you would like to see them, just comment with your email and I will gladly show off my smooth feet!</li>
    <li> These are amazing. They&#x27;re effective. They are the weirdest, longest pedicure process I&#x27;ve ever undergone. It took several days for the peeling to begin. After I applied the booties, the skin on my feet felt &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, as if my skin was no longer big enough for my feet, until it started peeling. And then once it starts peeling...ooh, boy. You do not want to go anywhere where your bare feet will be visible. The peeling process is a slow process, taking up to a full week. If you get a good strip to start loosening up, go ahead and peel it. It&#x27;s oddly gratifying to remove sheets of dead skin. Just be cautious to not be overly aggressive with peeling. Don&#x27;t peel where it&#x27;s not clearly loose and easy to lift. The layer of skin under the dead skin needs to toughen up just a bit before it&#x27;s exposed. If you peel too aggressively, you will make yourself a tender foot and be limping around a day or so! (Ask my husband about his experience with this!) The soles of my feet came off in almost one big piece. It was half gross/half fascinating. They WORK. My feet weren&#x27;t excessively gross or scaly, but it took 2 treatments, 2 weeks apart to get them really soft. My husband&#x27;s feet were stereotypical gross man-feet with thick, crusty turtle-shell like man-leather for soles. His crazy thick skin took 3 treatments, 2 weeks apart to get nice and soft. Maintain with a good foot cream with lactic acid in it after your peeling is complete. We like the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet, conveniently also sold here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if that Buffalo Bill guy from Silence of the Lambs had this product, he would have had to capture and kill way less people to make his people-leather suit. He could have just given all of his friends pedicures and then been their designated peeler. So get these! Not only will you not have to put the lotion in the basket, you also won&#x27;t get the hose again!</li>
    <li> This product gets results and is easy to use.  The transformation is impressive, but the process isn&#x27;t pretty.  Three days after using the product my feet got VERY peely and remained so for a few days.  Now that the peeling skin is falling away, my feet are markedly smoother.  I&#x27;m a believer, but I will be timing future applications to avoid barefoot weather.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than a pedicure or a foot scrubber for removing dead skin. It literally takes off 1 full layer of skin.</li>
    <li> I was so blown away by this product. My heels were dry but nothing extreme, and I had 2 calluses on my toes.&lt;br /&gt;I resisted putting lotion on after the fact, and day 4 I woke up, boom! The magic happened! Skin was peeling everywhere, even on my toes and around the edges of my toenails! My calluses even came off! I found wearing socks and doing a 15min Epsom salt soak every night speeded up the process. By the time it was exactly a week my feet were pristine! I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone I know and will make this part of my regimen every few months. I was skeptical but take it from me, try it once and you&#x27;ll be convinced!</li>
    <li> This has been an amazing experience. My feet are still peeling (a week later) but the majority of all my callouses are gone and my feet are super smooth. Bonus if you&#x27;re a picker/popper - pulling sheets of skin off your feet is SO SATISFYING.</li>
    <li> This product has not worked for me. There hasn&#x27;t been any shedding of dead skin. Waste of my hard earned money.</li>
    <li> Works great, literally a peel for your feet.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest thing! It WORKS within 2-3 days for my feet and continues to peel for two weeks. Have used it twice so far in the past couple months.</li>
    <li> Did okay  overall except heels.  Would probably try it again.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd pack of baby foot I have used in a month--I live in a desert, go barefoot a lot and have the nastiest feet in the world. The first TX did amazing stuff---so I tried a 2nd &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; about 3 weeks later and my feet are truly &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34;. I DO soak my feet for a good 1/2 hr before applying the booties, and then force myself to either &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m a shower person) or soak them every night for about 1/2 hour. Amazing how all the old calluses and guck just scrubs off. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> My feet were very calloused and my heels were cracking from all the dead skin that I could not get rid of, no matter how much I tried. I saw a lot of reviews from people who said this didn&#x27;t work for them and I have no idea how that could possibly be true. I didn&#x27;t even follow the directions for soaking my feet for 30 minutes and soaking them daily, and this took off every bit of dead skin on my feet. It is pricey but there are others out there that are not as expensive as this brand, but this is the original product so I wanted to make sure I was getting the good stuff. It works so well that my feet had sore spots because all the calluses were suddenly gone! I am sure they will be back, but now that I know how to get rid of them, they won&#x27;t be a problem any longer.</li>
    <li> So, I tried this twice to make sure I really liked it before giving a review or giving 5 stars.  Just a note of caution...don&#x27;t walk around wearing these :))  It even states in the instructions not to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times I used the product my feet did not flake until 5 days after application.  The second time around it flaked more than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great results though and I will continue to use it once a month.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after being embarrassed of my feet for years, and I do mean years, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. I should also say I was too freaked out by the thought of someone touching my feet to get a pedicure. So I sat with this goop on my feet for an hour and a half (it only says an hour but my feet were like trotters so I figured it might need a little bit longer) and then rinsed it off. Then waited and waited and on the 5th day - nothing. On the 6th day, nothing! I was so disappointed - almost put up a bad review then - tadah! It started, oh boy did it start. Skin everywhere - I&#x27;m still having to wear socks everywhere because I leave skin all over the place. Yay! My feet are pink! No more trotters. I&#x27;m planning on using this for ever, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the 10 disposable razors a week I was using, and this is way better. Love it!</li>
    <li> So my giant size 9.5 feet were looking rough. My last pedicure? Well, it didn&#x27;t touch the callouses and dead skin... I swear I was ready to take the power sander out of my husband&#x27;s shop and go at my heels, it was THAT bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some women talking about this product on a mom&#x27;s group I am part of, so I figured, what the heck, I am giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, and looked the same as the photo here on Amazon. The directions were in English and super easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped in the shower washed up, and then soaked my feet for about 20 minutes. They looked horrible, as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a towel down on my bed, got a bag of chips, a pair of my husbands socks, and my remote control, then started my search of scissors to open the bags. I couldn&#x27;t find scissors to open the foot &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; and had to hunt around, and finally raided my 5 year-olds art supplies for a pair of child scissors, but hey, they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I propped my pillows up, slid my feet into the baggies, and taped them shut... it was a bit gross feeling, and cold! But I went with it, moved my toes around a bit, and grabbed my husband&#x27;s socks and stuck them over the baggies. I laid back, tuned into my latest NetFlix obsession, and started in on my bag of chips. I finished the first episode and then went to another. I left the baggies on right around 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no tingling, or burning, it was just slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the two hour mark I jumped out of bed... BIG MISTAKE. Those suckers are SLIPPERY. I went down like a sack of chicken feed. Smack on my rear. But, I persevered and pulled myself up by the edge of the bed, and slowly walked to the bathroom. I went to step into the tub and BAM. Back on my rear. Yeah, they are that slippery, and that was with socks on! I don&#x27;t claim to be the most coordinated person in the world, but come on, I can walk from my bed to the bathroom without falling twice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet actually felt soft after washing them and patting them dry. I climbed into bed and went to sleep manifesting the nice soft heels I was going to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one... nothing but dry skin. I soaked my feet for 20 minutes and rubbed them lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day two... same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day three... rinse later repeat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day four... I needed a bath after a especially sweaty soccer practice, and jumped in the tub to soak... after relaxing and washing my hair, I remembered my feet... well not so much as I remembered, but I saw my pumice stone and it reminded me of the horror my feet were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maneuvered my leg up and examined my foot, it was peeling! (Notice it said foot, because only one was peeling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin 1/8in thick was peeling off painlessly, it took an hour, but that heel was perfect! It was as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum. The upper parts of my feet were not peeling. The other foot had a small patch that peeled, and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is day 5. The other foot has peeled about 50% and the upper portions of my feet are slowly peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this product. I am hoping that I can upkeep this for a few months and then do another peel. I love how soft my heels are. I have not loved my feet so much since I used to live near the beach and went for daily walks that helped them stay soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints other than I wish I had ordered more when I ordered! I will be doing this again in a few months to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************&lt;br /&gt;Edited much later...&lt;br /&gt;I am still using these every few months and my feet have never looked better! They pull skin off each time, and leave them soft and beautiful!soft after washing them and patting them dry. I climbed into bed and went to sleep manifesting the nice soft heels I was going to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day one... nothing but dry skin. I soaked my feet for 20 minutes and rubbed them lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day two... same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day three... rinse later repeat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day four...

They pull skin off each time, and leave them soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling or burning as others reported.  My feet peeled longer than I expected but the results were worth it.  The edge of my heels still needed a little work.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t get enough contact with the solution or if they were just that bad.  I suspect the latter.  I will definitely use again if needed.</li>
    <li> Due to medications and the dry Nevada heat, I had really gross feet.  They were dry, rough, and cracked.  I tried lotion socks, pedicures, etc. but nothing worked.  I saw this product and decided to give it a try.  You put your feet in the booties and just let it soak in for 1-1 1/2 hours.  I had a slight itchy sensation during this time but that was the only side effect I had.  Three days later, my feet started peeling.  Not just a little, but large sheets of skin.  It looked like a sunburn peeling.  It took 3 days before the peeling was done.  I am amazed at how soft my feet are!  No more dry skin, no rough and scaly skin.  For less that what I have paid for a pedicure, I finally got the results I have been searching for.  I love this product and would recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be another product advertised that did nothing. I was wrong. I used Thursday night, and on Sunday started noticing heels were peeling. By Thursday of the next week my feet looked like lizards peeling. Afterwards they really did look pretty. I soaked feet half hour before using product. Then I did use a pumice stone when it started getting really bad. It did work and I plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried other things that guarantee to smooth and soften your feet.  I was really surprised at how great this works.  I will definitely be using this again and again.  I&#x27;m even getting this for my husband and in-laws.</li>
    <li> Your feet will look and feel pretty gross for about a week, but then all the peeling skin comes off and your feet will look and feel amazing. I used this on my feet about 2 months ago and I&#x27;m about to use it again. I think for most people, their feet will stay softer longer, but I have to wear combat boots everyday, so naturally my feet take more of a beating.</li>
    <li> make sure you give yourself time to this to work....meaning you will not expose your feet during this process. It took the 5th day to see my feet starting cracking then the massize dead skin peeling in small sheets.  Honestly, it was gross. The entire process took almost two weeks from start to finish. My feet are so soft and look better.  I plan to keep this in my beauty routine twice a year. Very simple instructions and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how amazing this product is!  I used it as directed, one time for 1 hour.  After 5 days the skin began peeling off.  That lasted for about 5 days.  Better than the best pedicure!</li>
    <li> I am only on day 5 after using this product, My feet are still peeling the smallest amount, (I have soaked them for 30 minutes every night) for the most part they are done, even if this was it (and Im sure it is not) my feet are softer than any pedicure I have ever had. This is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I have to say this stuff really works. I have really dry feet - to the point of cracks in my heels - and I make the problem worse because i go barefoot most of the time or wear sandals. Nothing seems to help but the callous trimmers - all the cremes are just temporary at best and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all. Tried this stuff on a Thurs. (and I really let my feet dry longer than I should have or I think it might have worked even better) and by Mon. I was seeing a little flaking...next day, the skin is practically falling off. Great big pieces of dead, dry skin just peeled off - leaving super soft, supple skin. Here is what I got - There are the two clear plastic &amp;#34;socks&amp;#34; that you place on your feet with the gel already inside - the stuff really just felt cool and very hydrating on my feet - it doesn&#x27;t seem at all harsh. Stuck my feet in the socks in a towel (instead of my own socks which is what they recommend) and watched some TV for an hour. There are a couple of places that didn&#x27;t completely slough off on the toughest areas on my heels, but probably because i let my feet dry too long before putting the baby foot on. This is way better than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had - all that dry skin around the cuticles - just gone and the soles of my feet are just so soft, I can&#x27;t believe. Can&#x27;t wait to use this again and I&#x27;m going to follow the directions as closely as possible. This is really great stuff.</li>
    <li> Little disappointed. Been nice if it would have gotten the harder callouses. Also top of feet very scaly after use. The mixture is in entire booty so gets all over feet. Still scaly after a week.</li>
    <li> It is just amazing product! I put it on Sunday, my feet started peel on Friday. The all the old skin just peels off, the skin underneath just soft like a baby foot! I am not kidding, I have not seen my skin like this for years. Love it, love it, definitely recommend it! Best product ever! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Gross and awesome, just as expected. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it. I&#x27;ll be doing round #2 in a few months.</li>
    <li> I did spend a fun, fascinating couple of days peeling sheets of skin off of my feet, but I don&#x27;t feel the results were worth it for the price, mostly because it&#x27;s not very effective for thick calluses. Next time, I would buy the cheaper Korean version by Tony Moly, and file my calluses before putting on the booties.</li>
    <li> It has been 2 weeks since I used the product, from the instructions and the other reviews I should have nasty peeling skin on my feet by now. I followed the directions and left the product on for 2 hours. NOTHING has happened! Very disappointing...</li>
    <li> It did not perform at all.  I followed the instructions explicitly and absolutely nothing happened!</li>
    <li> I was a sceptic. I am on day 5 and my feet are shedding like a snake. Great product! I will be ordering another!</li>
    <li> Wish I had tried this YEARS ago!  This product is truly effective and easy to use.  The results are amazing if you can deal with all the peeling for about a week. Softness beats any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had hands down!  I was skeptical but figured all the positive reviews had to count for something...applied it at night as directed and then nothing happened for a couple of days so I figured it didn&#x27;t work.  I took a foot soak the second night and that got things peeling nicely... and then I could not believe the thickness and even-ness of peeling that occurred.  No pain at all but I did not peel back any of the skin myself.  I continued to soak each night and applied cream so the dryness wouldn&#x27;t make me crazy.  Highly recommend this product to anyone with uncomplicated healthy feet in need of exfoliation.  Side note - I think this product needs to be used a couple of weeks prior to doing any major walking as the loss of callous might cause sensitivity if activity is too intense right after peeling.</li>
    <li> It worked as promised - but be prepared for many days of peeling. Very thick calluses require multiple treatments. Maintenance with a pumice would probably be just as good.</li>
    <li> This product really works! In a weeks time my feet were super soft!</li>
    <li> The delivery was fine but the product itself didn&#x27;t  work for me and left me with some painful cracks in my heels.&lt;br /&gt;Followed the directions. Will never use again!</li>
    <li> The skin just peeled and peeled.  Make sure to soak your feet to soften skin first for best results.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!  It was better than the best pedicure I&#x27;ve ever gotten. You have to be patient and plan as it isn&#x27;t an instant process,  You use the booties, wait 4-5 days and voila... skin and callouses just start peeling off to reveal lovely skin below.  I would absolutely recommend it and as one other reviewer mentioned, will likely use it a couple of times a year to maintain my feet in this condition.  I never expected I&#x27;d ever get my feet to look like this... it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> this worked very well for me.  i used it after showering and i actually left it on for an hour and a half, and i wore socks over the plastic boot like it said to - and in 2 wks there was a lot of peeling. i bought more for myself and stocking stuffers for my sister and mom!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Better than a pedicure scraping.  The hard skin literally peeled right off on days 3-5.</li>
    <li> I used the product exactly according to directions, and I saw no results whatsoever.....a waste of two hours.  I&#x27;m tempted to try it again to see if it will work, but not sure if I want to risk wasting more money.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these and they did not work.  When i received them they were not the same as the packaged showed on amazon. My boxes had japanese writing on the front, box color different too.  I dont believe i got what i ordered! My daughter ordered one from a different website got the packaging shown on amazon and it worked.  I order several things from amazon, but this will make me question what i purchase from there in the future.</li>
    <li> Considering the rave reviews, I was so excited to try it... I even made sure to do it 2 weeks before my summer vacation, so as not to have shedding tootsies in my fancy flip flops. Well, I used it exactly as directed and nothing, and I mean nothing... I wasted 2 hours sitting around dreaming of my new baby soft feet and instead I got the same old lizard toes I had before.... what the heck???</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and have gotten several friends to love it as well. Day 4 is when the peel starts. Make sure you SOAK YOUR FEET! Seriously, that makes all the difference. And don&#x27;t use lotion, no matter how gross you think it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife cause she had this problem with her feet craking and peeling all the time, and she had already tried every remedy none to man and nothing worked.  Thst&#x27;s until Baby Foot and I be damn this stuff really works.  No more peeling or cracking.</li>
    <li> Ehhh, this didn&#x27;t really work for me but I also take really good care of my feet so maybe I just didn&#x27;t have the dead skin for it to work on?</li>
    <li> So my wife bought me a pack of these Baby Footies since she noticed my nasty feet had some really calloused heels. But deep inside I knew that I was just the guinea pig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical about the product since I had tried everything from foot shavers to those Doctor Fish nibbling fish, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured, who not give these a try? Initially I was hesitant since they are a bit pricey. But there I was putting on these plastic bags on my feet filled with a slimy gooey substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After following the instructions and taking my \\&quot;footies\\&quot; off, I noticed nothing happened for the first 2 days. Then on day 3 I started noticing my skin peeling around my ankles and toes. By days 4 and 5 the peeling really took off. And now on day 6 I am still peeling and most of the skin has flaked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin really comes off when you are showering as well as putting socks on. And boy will you need socks, or you will shed like a freaking reptile all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have no idea how the stuff works, but it does. Currently at 85% complete on shedding. Can&#x27;t wait for the molting to be complete so I can stop wearing socks around the house.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, the product caused a light peeling that took place over one day.  I would have liked to use it again but I couldn&#x27;t risk spending $30 more dollars and getting the same result.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I bought it based on the reviews. I have had very dry feet since moving to an area that has pubic water that dries me and my families skin. I get a pedicure almost every 2 weeks. Nothing seemed to help my dry white flaking feet for more than 3 days. My doctor thought I might have a fungus and prescribed me medication. This did not help. 2 weeks after using this product my feet are still smooth. I am impressive with this product and have ordered another one for a friend. If you have dry cracking feet- THIS is the solution.</li>
    <li> It really works.  Recommend to soak feet for an hour and wear the booties for at least two hours to obtain full affect.  My feet peeled for about two weeks.  ONLY the dead skin peeled away.  great start to summer.  My feet were soft until about a month after the peeling then the skin started to harden, but that happens shortly after a pedi from the local nail salon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Per  one of the top reviewer suggestion, I soaked my feet for 15 minutes before wearing the socks for 2 hours. By day 3, since I didn&#x27;t see any peeling, I started soaking every other nite. Nope, nada. I still have dried flaky skin on the bottom of  my heel and no sign of any peeling. Oh well, guess it does not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was not working. However after a week, I saw a lot of improvement.  My suggestion is when you use it, be ready to sit for a bit. If you try to walk, it is like walking on ice.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this product, a little expensive though I found it and Mitsuwa for 19.98, but it did the job peeled off all the skin, still have a little rough area but so the most part major improvement, will be using again. Its well worth it, make sure you soak your feet first and I also took a bath into the 3rd day and it worked even more.</li>
    <li> When you first use this product, nothing happens. But wait a couple of days, and the skin begins to peel away from your feet. I would say this product lasts longer than the treatment you get from a pedicure!</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used this twice, it is amazing.  My feet look perfect afterwards and feel super soft.  Can&#x27;t wait to do it for summer when I&#x27;ll be wearing sandals more.</li>
    <li> This did help my husband&#x27;s feet. I think it may take another one to clear them all up. But in all we thought it was worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I have runners feet and figured they were hopeless.  This really worked and although didn&#x27;t make my feet truly &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; it really did clean them up and give them a softer feel.  They peeled for about a week… I will purchase more!!!  Especially for summer months!</li>
    <li> I got two. My friend had great results. Her feet peeled for days without any discomfort and her feet look beautiful. My feet didn&#x27;t peel quite as much but we think it&#x27;s because I have been getting regular pedicures for several years. Even with less peeling it improved the look and feel of my feet.  It was really easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This worked exactly as I had read and heard that it would.  It is a gentle peel, but thorough, follow directions, it is easy.  I did soak in plain water my feet each night during peeling process, about 10 days total.  It took 3 days for peeling to begin, and I did not force any peeling. left it alone.  My feet are soft and pink, you will not believe how wonderful the results are, just have patience and follow directions.</li>
    <li> Did NOT work at all, I got it for my friend and she tried it and said nothing happened! Im very upset because it was almost $40!! Rip off!!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I followed the directions exactly. A friend tried later and her feet peeled like crazy.</li>
    <li> I followed the advice of one of the other reviews on here and soaked my feet for about an hour first by taking a nice long bath. Afterward, I put on the treatment for about an hour. For a full week, absolutely nothing happened. Then one week later the rough patches on my feet started coming off, and a few days later I was rewarded with amazingly soft feet, which lasted for weeks. The result is much better than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip: Don&#x27;t use these right after putting on fresh polish, as it will cause the polish to loosen and peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only CON I found with this product: It also causes the skin on the top of the foot and the ankle to peel, which I didn&#x27;t need. I may try to put Vaseline or something on those areas first the next time to see if it cuts down on the peeling in areas I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> This is the way to take care of calculus. I use this product every month or so.</li>
    <li> Works too good. Dont use in summer</li>
    <li> Didnt work as well as my first time, this is my second application</li>
    <li> When I first used the product, i didn&#x27;t get immediate results.  Over the following weeks (approx 1.5 weeks), all of the rough, patchy skin started to peel off!  This product definitely works!  FYI: don&#x27;t use during the summer time when you&#x27;re more prone to wearing sandals and open toe shoes.  Your feet WILL continue to peel no matter how much lotion or cream you use.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  Worked just as described.</li>
    <li> Works fabulous.  My feet have never been in such good shape.  It did take the full five days for any noticeable peel, but once it started it was awesome.  I will definetely buy again.</li>
    <li> Works awesomely! I would just plan on using it when you have a week when sandals or open toed shoes aren&#x27;t in your plans. When the dead skin peels off, your feet look awful!</li>
    <li> It really works by exfoliating the dead skin. However, keep in mind that after approximately 5 days after the dead skin will start to peel and fall off. So do not do this if you need to wear open shoes for a special occasion. The peeling lasted about a week.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I first heard about Baby Foot, but I was intrigued right away.  I searched the Internet, and found glowing reviews, as well as pictures of people with skin peeling off ALL OVER THEIR FEET!  Amazing!  It sounded like the perfect answer to the dry skin on my heels.  It seemed too good to be true, but I finally decided to give it a try, and ordered It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the package, also using suggestions made by a reviewer who gave a detailed description of how to get good results.  I soaked my feet in warm water for half an hour, then put on the booties containing the Baby Foot gel, and a pair of warm socks.  I sat back for an hour and a half, waiting for the gel to do its work,  before soaking my feet again for 30 minutes.  Yippee!  It would only be a matter of time until my feet started to peel!  Every day, I looked at the pictures again,  and soaked my feet in warm water for 30 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t start feeling discouraged until a week had passed, and not one flake of skin had peeled.  It has now been two weeks, and nothing has happened.  I don&#x27;t have elephant skin - I&#x27;m a redhead, and my skin burns and peels after less than an hour in the sun.  I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t have worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I feel like a sucker.  I haven&#x27;t felt this ripped off since I was eight years old, and bought Sea Monkeys, thinking that they would actually look like monkeys and have little crowns and everything like they did in the picture, and finding out they were just little specks in water.</li>
    <li> Was expecting more, my feet peeled and that was it.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does exactly what it claims to do!! I love Baby Foot and will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> My initial review of this product was made way too early. My feet had become highly callused from wearing heels and sandals and doing yoga outside barefoot. Not even the razor works as well as this product!!! My feet did not start peeling until the 4th day &amp; it was only on the tops, not the bottom where I needed it. This continued through day 5 and then stopped peeling around day 6 &amp; 7. I gave this product a bad review then on day 8 my feet started peeling like CRAZY!! Soaking your feet every night really helps the peeling. On day 8 I went paddle boarding for about an hour and when I took my water shoe off...prepare yourself... It was filled with skin!! My feet peeled all over the bottoms, the tops, the sides! It dramatically lighted some dark scars on my feet and Achilles tendon I got from wearing bad high heels. I expected my feet to look soft, but they also look younger! My ankles look young lol! I know that&#x27;s weird to say but they do! I am so happy with the results! It was completely painless. The new skin is a TINY BIT sensitive but not so much that I could wear heels to work all day. The only callus it didn&#x27;t completely destroy was on my heel, but I am glad because it may be too sensitive if it did. My heel is no longer cracking and is very soft.</li>
    <li> oh my goodness... didn&#x27;t think anything could help my feet - this is a miracle.</li>
    <li> This was a terrific product! One thing I would like to mention is to just avoid getting the product on the top of your feet as they will also peel😩</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I initially did not seeing anything happening.  And, then after the 5th day the skin just started peeling off my feet.  And, yes the lizard like shedding is not the most attractive thing.  However, my heels have never looked better.  I would say that my heels have not looked like this in years!  And, this even after having regular pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I use it I do plan on soaking beforehand and in the days that follow to assist with the exfoliation.  I will also avoid the tops of my feet since I didn&#x27;t care for the peeling on top of my feet the next time I use it.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as advertised, it works a little but certainly not worth the prices charged for it.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews. I tried this on a whim after seeing my cousin talk about it on social media. The skin on my feet can get pretty dry so on to Amazon. I went. Baby feet really?? I placed my feet in their squishy cocoons for and hour. Days 1-3 nothing happened and I began to think this product should be called &amp;#34;Delinquent Feet&amp;#34; &#x27;cause I was ripped off. Four must be the magic number, because on that day My inner Python came out and the peeling began. As the process continued I became more Snake and continued to &amp;#34;shed.&amp;#34; It was the grossest most amazing thing I&#x27;ve experienced from a beauty product. I&#x27;m definitely doing this again.</li>
    <li> My feet did peel but the product only removed a very thin top layer and had no affect on any callouses.  However, it left the top and bottom feeling soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two days and my feet are not peeling at all.</li>
    <li> My feet did peel but they weren&#x27;t any softer than they were before. There was no change. I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> So, I did my research and read all the reviews and watched all the YouTube vide and everything. I was still a little dubious; my dogs were pretty calloused and rough. I soaked my feet for 90 minutes first, and then for 30-60 minutes every night for the next 3-4 nights. It took a week or so, and then my feet started molting - can&#x27;t explain it any other way. Over the next week, I could rub off a lot of skin in the shower and after the shower. Sometimes I&#x27;d be rubbing off skin 15 minutes after I&#x27;d gotten out of the shower. It was pretty gross, and pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my sister, however, and she says nothing happened with her feet. So it&#x27;s not for everybody, but it worked really well for me. It felt weird, wearing my shoes without my callouses.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Mines started to peel about 3-4 day after. I soaked my feet in water for about 15 mins prior to using the product. I left the product on for 1.5hrs then showered after. I really won&#x27;t get a pedi again besides grooming my toes. This was AWESOME</li>
    <li> Feet started to peel on day 4 continued until day 8. They peeled nicely around the edges, on the toes and the soft areas in the center of the foot, but the callouses (the reason I bought the product) did not peel at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved it and I never found any type of ex foliation or file to work like this.I highly recommend it and I will absolutely order it again</li>
    <li> Love this! I followed the steps to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. I soaked my feet in plain water for an hour before putting the bags on my feet. I then put the bags on for an hour (with socks over them so I could still walk around). Rinsed product off and was down. It was about 3 days before my skin started to peel. It peeled for about 2 weeks before it was completely done. Made me feet so soft! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in product, especially for how much I paid. It burned when I put my feet in those gel bags, then when my feet started &amp;#34;peeling,&amp;#34; it was only on the skin on top of my foot, not my heels and toes that needed it most. A painful waste of money!</li>
    <li> At first ...nothing happened.  But about 3 or 4 days after using my feet began to peel.  It was messy....and lasted for about 4 days.  But my feet are soft, as well as the heels.</li>
    <li> So we all know that the Biore strip pulls out yucky stuff from clogged pores. It&#x27;s impossible not to inspect the strip to see how wonderfully gross it is. You feel purged. Fresh. And then your pores get gunky and you do the whole thing again. It didn&#x27;t permanently fix anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say all this to give context to the Baby Feet product. Yes, it DOES WORK -- in a really messy, fascinating way. However, it is a temporary treatment. Your feet have callouses in areas that have repeated contact and need to be protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my 2 cents ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing happened for the first 6 days. THEN, on Day 7, my skin started to loosen and come off. The entire surface area of your feet will peel -- top, bottom, in between toes, under edge of nails and (of course) your heels. It took 4 days to shed all the dead skin. While this was happening, my feet looked awful. In the end, my feet are significantly smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a one time item - you will need to repeat the treatment as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. I rated it as 4 stars because of the mess factor. Having your feel peel for days is really inconvenient.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  About 4+ days after I used it I noticed the skin was peeling off.  It is still peeling off some.  I plan on using it again for the second time.  I have some caluses that are pretty stubborn.  I have never used anything like this.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with high expectations based on other reviews. Perhaps my expectations were a bit TOO high. I soaked my feet beforehand, then wore the booties provided for two hours before rinsing. I soaked my feet nightly to encourage peeling like other reviewers suggested. My peeling experience started on the third day, but on the tops of my feet, which I was surprised by. The peeling eventually moved downwards, but never resulted in the dramatic way that I had expected over the areas that I wanted, like my heels and the balls of my feet. I do get semi-regular pedicures, so I wondered if the lack of dramatic effect was because there wasn&#x27;t a lot of the calloused skin. My feet are softer and smoother overall, but I would&#x27;ve waited for AFTER sandal season if I&#x27;d known that my feet have to be covered for over a week because I looked like I had leprosy! I will probably order this product (or another foot peel like it) after the next winter season.</li>
    <li> baby foot worked on everything except the thick callus on my heels.  It helped with the heels but did not get them baby soft.  if they sold a pack that was just for the heels i would try it again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I read all the reviews but I have to say, this didn&#x27;t quite work out as well for me as others. It took about 6 days before the skin started to peel on my feet and then it was a week long process. But it took a ton of work to get it all off, it didn&#x27;t just start shedding like some posters have noted (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone). My skin started to peel but stopped halfway there, so I had to sit there every morning and exfoliate and scrub for 20 minutes until it was all gone. And then... I still didn&#x27;t have feet completely free of small cracks in the heels lol.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I read about it in a magizine, once I did the application as instructed, it did take a week to see any peel, and a week later it&#x27;s still peeling. Too expensive for one treatment.</li>
    <li> I buy this often and LOVE IT!  It works great!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what the name of the product says. You are left with baby feet!!! Down time is about 10 days but totally worth it. I will be ordering in about 3-4 months. Thank Baby Foot!</li>
    <li> Worked great on the foot generally - but I still have dry cracked heels.  I don&#x27;t know if doing it a second time will help or if I need a different product.</li>
    <li> Wow! My feet were gnarly and after I used this product, they were baby soft!!! They started peeling a TON after week one and then by week 2, it stopped and it was done. I am planning on ordering again, as it has been 6 months and I didn&#x27;t do anything to maintain the softness. I can say that my feet aren&#x27;t remotely as rough as before using.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This product does what it promises to do!</li>
    <li> I paid $53.94 for 2 applications and only received 1 package. Beware if you order the double pack..  big rip off.</li>
    <li> Made my feet feel extremely soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks!!! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!!! You must buy this product...</li>
    <li> I dont&#x27;t even know where to start with this review. I learned about it from a friend. I followed the directions to the t and for te first few days nothing happened. Then on about day 5 when I got out of the shower WHOA!!!! this works, and keeps on working. I have done this three time now. I do one each season. My pedicurist noticed right away. She ordered some too. My mom, sister and friends all use it now. The end results are amazing and the results last for months.</li>
    <li> It really does the trick in removing all your winter dead skin.  Be sure to follow the directions and soak your feet before using the product.</li>
    <li> this works!!!  only thing to remember, don&#x27;t do anything that you need to wear sandals for a week after using, your feet will be peeling like crazy. I used this and had my teenager try it too. great results, soft and baby smooth feet after the peel. painless!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Just be prepared to wait two weeks for the full results.  You don&#x27;t get the results overnight.</li>
    <li> Bizzare stuff, but quite effective. Use as directed, and soak daily. I thought I was molting, but it did leave very smooth skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> This product is amaaaaazing!  I will forever use it to get my feet summer ready. A rather gross, but cool experience at the same time since the peeling is SERIOUS.  I would recommend leaving the product on longer than the recommended 1 hour.  A friend recommended at least 2 hours, as she did not get great results the first time.  I, in turn, fell asleep totally forgetting about the booties I was wearing, yikes!  No worries. A week later the peeling began and OMG, it was amazing!</li>
    <li> Surprising the product does exactly what it says and was able to clear a lot of dead skin from my foot.</li>
    <li> I find it did not remove the toughest skin and spots that are typically the most troublesome. It took off the thinnest areas around the sides of my feet mostly.</li>
    <li> It works as they say.  Feet started peeling 2-3 days after the soak.</li>
    <li> This was really gross but I loved it. Perfect for getting ready for sandals after a long winter. The skin really does peel right off. You definitely need to wear socks throughout the peeling process or you will get skin all over your house. My feet feel nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> I did my Baby Foot treatment about 6 days ago and didn&#x27;t see any peeling skin by day 5. So I was all like, &amp;#34;Eh, this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34;. But TODAY....oh today I took off my socks after a long day and there was flaking skin EVERYWHERE! Totally disgusting and awesome, all at the same time. When the peeling ends, I am looking forward to wowing my nail tech with my Baby smooth Foot....feet! &#x3D;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Baby Foot!</li>
    <li> No peeling at all ?!?! However my feet are a lot softer BUT the hard skin on heels remains the same. Somewhat disappointed😔</li>
    <li> It exfoliates and your skin peels but if you&#x27;re looking for something to help with callouses this is not it the skin that peeled wasn&#x27;t the rough areas</li>
    <li> Applied the product 16 days ago. Peeling started on Day 4 and continued for about 5 days. I was focused on the bottom and side of my feet and was surprised to see that not only were the bottoms  softened but the top of both feet looked silkier. (it even improved the cuticle build up on my toes!) Callouses weren&#x27;t totally removed but weren&#x27;t as thick----- so I plan to work on them separately, before I use Baby Foot again in a couple of months. Tip: 1. Putting footies over the gel packs will help you safely  walk, if you need to move around.  2. soaking your feet each day throughout and right aftert the treatment helps in the removal of dead skin.  3. I have learned that I need to be more attentive to my feet on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Great product! be prepared for the Peel. But it works great. Does exactly what it says it will do. Friends and coworkers have become believers</li>
    <li> Saw pictures of the results prior to buying this product and was a little dismayed by my end result.  The process is simple enough, clean your feet, put them in some little booties (plastic bags), and wait.  When the skin starts coming off its very messy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feet really are like a baby&#x27;s after they peel.</li>
    <li> Application easy, took away about 75% of the calluses on my feet.  But the process for me lasted over a week.  The sloughing leaves pieces of skin everywhere.  Even wearing sox the whole time somehow those pesky little pieces got out.  A real mess, but worth it for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!  Kind of creepy when the skin starts to peel, but it beats sawing on your foot with an emry board  or a ped egg. I thought you just had to deal with rough skin on the feet, but then I tried babyfoot.  It&#x27;s incredible and easy to use.  You may have to resist the urge to help it along like I did. Trust me. It&#x27;s worth the wait. Enjoy your incredibly smooth feet.</li>
    <li> After using the product, you think nothing is happening but give it a week and then the dead skin begins to peel off.  It is amazing.  You peel like a snake skin with soft skin underneath.  Wish you could get more treatments from it because it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Maybe my feet are smoother than most, for the money spent on this I would not recommend nor would I purchase again.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet as recommend ...left them on for 2 hours....waited 5&#x27;days for the first peel...after that just flakes...no big peel at all...it did however, eat off my toe nail polish......I would not recommend.....maybe I got a bad batch of the mixture.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing...I can&#x27;t believe how well it worked!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it promises. Be prepared after the first week of using to begin a week of shedding sheets of dead skin so don&#x27;t plan on wearing sandals or flip flops in public. After the second week enjoy the smoothest feet you&#x27;ve had since you were a baby!&lt;br /&gt;Repeat every eight to sixteen weeks.</li>
    <li> My feet started peeling after 4-5 days and peeled for 7-8. They looked amazing after! The peeling was very wierd and dry flakes got everywhere but it was very effective. The application process was painless and very easy. Will order again and reccomend to friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now (yes my feet have been that bad) and both times the dead skin came off my feet and left my feet feeling like babies&#x27; feet each time.  I followed the directions and soaked my feet first and then applied the product.  You can go the extra mile by soaking your feet for several days afterward, although I found that if you stand in the shower long enough that works just the same.  My feet feel so soft and look great.  I have eczema on my left foot, which leaves it with thick, hard skin patches and this has helped resolve the itching and breakouts and skin problems that I experience almost weekly on that foot.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  About 5-6 days later all my skin was peeling off.  Soft feet for summer sandals!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It took almost a week for my feet to start peeling. I did this in mid January and my feet are still very soft. I love it!! I will do it again in 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> This product will blow you away. For  a week you will think nothing is happening and then suddenly your old dead skin will start peeling off your feet. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it does what it says it will do! Great product.</li>
    <li> really works great.  will be buying this again!!!  It did what it was suppose to do.  My feet are really smooth.</li>
    <li> Im a man and my feet were terrible. Im happy to say this product WORKS!  My feet have never been this soft. I have recommended to friends and family, Must Buy! !</li>
    <li> After reading the rave reviews, I decided to try it for my &amp;#34;man feet&amp;#34;.  I have a gross dry &amp;#34;snakeskin&amp;#34; layer over my feet from winter (and having the driest feet ever) that I cannot ever get rid of.  I slather lotions on daily but it just feels like I&#x27;m remoisturizing dead skin and not getting anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all the tips about soaking my feet prior to treatment, and then soaking daily afterwards.  For about three days.  When I saw absolutely no change, I was disheartened and thought I must just not have the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; gross feet for it.  I abandoned my water soaks and ignored my feet for a few more days.  Boy was I wrong.  My feet are now peeling like CRAZY.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for the really thick calluses, but I didn&#x27;t expect that (I have a shaver for those).  But it is taking off all of that thin, crackly winter skin over the rest of my feet that I can&#x27;t ever get rid of.  I soak my feet for about twenty minutes, and then just rub off all the dead skin with my bare hands.  It&#x27;s awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try this again in a couple months and be more diligent with the soaks.  It does take about 3-5 days for most ppl to start seeing the peel start, but don&#x27;t give up.  Your feet might just take a little longer like mine!</li>
    <li> This bizarre product completely renewed my feet. After the sheets of dead skin sloughed off (painlessly) the new skin was soft and much younger looking. I didn&#x27;t realize I had sun damage on the tops of my feet until the perfectly even-toned new skin was revealed. I&#x27;m going to use this every 6 months or so for maintenance. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> It has been 6 days and nothing has happened.  Very disappointed and was also expensive.</li>
    <li> After a shower I sanded my feet with a cheap pedicure tool, and put on the booties. I did wear my socks over the booties and next time will lotion up my ankles, they became itchy when peeling began. I wore my booties for a hour and rinsed. I avoided putting lotion on feet. I didn&#x27;t see results til day 9, my skin started to peel and a few days later the skin under my whole foot had separated, I had to cut with cuticle scissors. It didn&#x27;t hurt but it just freaked out everyone else, i just laughed. The skin that I cut off felt like a latex glove, this was crazy, but it left behind soft pretty feet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I followed the suggestions of others on Amazon by soaking my feet every couple of days after the treatment. I didn&#x27;t think it had worked until it came off in SHEETS one week later. Really gross, but amazing.</li>
    <li> Works as it says it does.  My feet peeled for two weeks solid.</li>
    <li> It began to burn top of my feet about 30 minutes in. I did soak my feet for about 10 mins in warm water idk if this is why it started to burn. I left product on for a total of 45 mins. Worked ok I was a bit disappointed because the price is pretty steep.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Soaked before, put on the footies for 2 and a half hours (feel asleep), and then washed feet. I started peeling like crazy on day 2. Finished peeling on day 5. I did not use any lotion until the peeling was over.</li>
    <li> My Feet are ridiculously soft, I cannot believe there is an all natural product that can accomplish these type of results.  To achieve the  best results soak your feet for a half hour every other day AT LEAST.  This will make your feet peel quicker and more than if you do not soak. Use this product and dont go back to scraping your feet with a pumice because that is what creates the problem in the first place.  This is a must use pre-sandal season, but keep in mind the process takes a little over a week to be complete and could last as long as 2 weeks.  SOAK SOAK SOAK those feet and you will be grossed out in a very rewarding way. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions..even soaked my feet beforehand....no,no, result whatsoever....waste of money..I read the reviews and I have no idea what product they were using....not even a flake of skin...</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Follow directions...soak your clean feet in warm water first...then let the magic happen!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions on the inside of the box that stated to soak your feet before and after using the Baby Foot product. At first I didn&#x27;t think it worked, but two days later I used pedi sanding paddle and wow, the dry skin just rolled off.</li>
    <li> This really worked!  I have a problem with chronic dry, cracked skin on my heels and toes because I go barefoot year-round and I understand that walking on carpet is very drying.  I do have pedicures but they can never completely remove the deeply cracked skin on my heels and at the ends of my toes.  I tried these booties one evening.  They are cheaper than a pedicure and I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs and leave the house, so I thought it was worth a try!  After a few days the skin on the tops of my feet started to peel off, easily scrubbed off in the shower, and then the tougher skin around the sides and bottoms of my feet.  To speed up the process (mainly because I was leaving skin flakes on the sheets) I soaked my feet in a foot bath and gently brushed off the flakes, changing the water when it cooled off several times.  My feet are still peeling a little but the change is amazing!  My heels haven&#x27;t been this smooth in memory!  Now that the tough skin is gone I&#x27;m going to start moisturizing and wearing socks (am I the only one who hates wearing socks because I&#x27;m constantly going from hot to cold, socks on, socks off?) so I can keep my feet soft and smooth for as long as possible!  Although this isn&#x27;t a recommended usage I&#x27;ll bet these booties would work wonders on my husband&#x27;s dry, cracked elbows if I can figure out how to tape them on him!  New product?</li>
    <li> What a bunch of crap. The skin is peeling off my feet but the callus parts of my feet are still there and no peeling what so ever. Please don&#x27;t waste yourr money as I followed their instructions and the results suck.</li>
    <li> The product did not work at all and I followed the instructions carefully. Believe me, I am a runner and have calluses, none of which were removed. There is not the slightest indication that the pack is effective. I want my money back, this is a hoax.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff is magic, it&#x27;s magic. My feet started to peel after four days and it&#x27;s been a week today and they&#x27;re truly baby feet. I did soak my feet prior 15 to treatment and left it on for an hour and a half. Magic.</li>
    <li> I Loved it. Worked really well It  helps to soak your feet first before using this product.by doing this  it&#x27;s easier for the product to absorb into the skin and work  to the Max!!  Make sure u buy the right Size ...by reading the label Good luck!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and it worked for me!  Just like the package states, the peeling/exfoliating process starts between 3-7 days.  I did everything the box told me to do:  Soak feet, wear plastic booties for 1 hour, then wash feet thoroughly.  The exfoliation process did not begin for me until 4-5 days after.  It was a really gross process because skin was everywhere, but I just wore socks.  After the exfoliation process was complete (which took about 2 weeks)  my feet are wonderful looking.  Now, it did not remove hard spots (if that makes any sense) but I&#x27;m sure with continual use, over time it should soften it up.  I do have Chilblains, so it aided in the exfoliation process for my two toes that always has skin peeling.  I highly recommend this product!  It did not burn my feet or cause any sensitivity or reaction to the ingredients found in the product.  I do feel the price point is high since you only receive one treatment in the box.  (1 pair for $25 depending on the seller).  But overall this product does work!</li>
    <li> I read about this on the internet and had to try it. If you have calloused feet, this is the product for you. Exactly a week after applying the product, the dry, dead skin came off....just as described! I will recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d probably use this product again, but would make some changes to the application.  The booties are very large and the gel inside smooches all over the tops of your feet, causing them to peel as well.  The tops of my feet don&#x27;t need any exfoiantion.  I would either  try to smooth the gel to the bottom of the booites or  slather the tops of my feet with vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the product did exfoliate lots of problem skin from my feet and make them softer.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I thought it would be and more. I have referred several of friends to try this. I will definately be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> It definitely worked but not quite as well as the reviews and pictures described.</li>
    <li> I was AMAZED at the dead skin that came off of my feet!!!!!!!  I&#x27;d read the reviews and seen the pictures, but still I was a skeptic.  I soaked my feet for about an hour and then put the booties on for about an hour and a half and then WAITED....and WAITED....and WAITED.  Thinking after a few days that &amp;#34;this is just a bunch of bull&amp;#34; I forgot about it.  Then on day 7, my feet started to shed like a snake coming out of its skin!!!!!  I get regular pedicures, so I thought maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have very much dead skin on my feet, but was I wrong!  Skin came off from my toes and up my heels and even on the tops of my feet.  Yes, they did feel like a baby&#x27;s foot!  I read that if you have a bad problem, you may need to do this twice, and I did order another pair because I can tell my heels need it again.  I got a pedicure a couple of days ago, and when they were doing the scraping thing, I could FEEL it, and they didn&#x27;t have to do much because I had living skin again!  I&#x27;ve told everyone about it!  I&#x27;ve used every single foot scrub on the market, and this is the best.  Yes, it does take some planning and time, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I suggest you do it at a time when you are NOT going to be wearing sandals, and be patient and plan ahead because it really does take a week to get results and another week to get all of the shedding finished.</li>
    <li> Works, but I don&#x27;t feel like its worth all the effort. My feet absolutely peeled, but they are basically back to looking how they were before the peel. Not life changing in the slightest</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does.  Made of all natural ingredients, listing no unpronounceable chemicals on the packaging.  The process is:  wrap your feet in the product for about an hour.  Take it off, rinse your feet.  In 3-5 days all the cracked dead skin starts pealing off.  I expect to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable! It actually works. Just remember to soak feet for 15mins before applying the booties. I have really dry cracked heels &amp; i didn&#x27;t presoak so my feet are still cracked but softer than they were. I cant wait to do it again.</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review. Firstly, I didnt experience the same degree of peeling as some of these pics some reviewers have posted....but I think thats only cause my feet werent as bad? With that said....I still had significant peeling...to the extent there were a few days I had to wear closed toe shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result? AMAZING! I wasnt expecting a major improvement because it was a sloooooow process but a full 3 weeks later, and my feet are so soft! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Only started to peel small skin on the areas of my foot that were soft. Heels that are hard as rocks remain the same.</li>
    <li> After a few days my feet peeled like crazy.  It&#x27;s kind of gross when they peel but it really works.</li>
    <li> definitely will take off every bit of skin!  flakes for days but feet are gorgeous afterward! will buy again! loved it!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly, plus did the extra soakings that other users recommended.  I had a little flaking, but no sloughing.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this very skeptical at first but it really works. Be prepared to peel for a couple of weeks and to keep up your new set of feet afterwards.</li>
    <li> If you have two hours to kill watching a movie, stick these little pre-filled plastic booties on your clean feet and relax. You won&#x27;t feel a thing except slimy stuff - no tingling, no pain, smells awesome and slightly herbal/floral. You soak in the booties, rinse your feet, and then wait for days for something to happen. All of a sudden one day, whole sheets of skin just drop off your feet! It&#x27;s incredible. You will have a brand new pair of feet that look like they&#x27;ve never been walked on, or rough, or calloused, or flaky. You will feel like you&#x27;ve got someone else&#x27;s fancy feet. Crushes any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had by a mile. I don&#x27;t ever have to use my foot file anymore! I tried this for the first time ever in April 2013, and as of November 2013 I am just now thinking I&#x27;ll do it again. The effects will drop your jaw. Really great stuff.</li>
    <li> Despite other glowing reviews, I wasn&#x27;t certain if this would work on my long-term calloused feet.  It barely affected my big toe, which is covered with many many layers of dead skin, but the rest of my feet look--and FEEL--wonderful!  Considering using another pack in the spring, just before sandals weather.</li>
    <li> My heels were looking pretty rough and I absolutely cannot stand pedicures, so I decided to order this product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet before using this product, just like the instructions suggested. I wore socks over the plastic booties because I did have to walk out of my bathroom to my desk so I could get some work done while I waited the hour for this product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only because I was wearing socks, but my feet started to feel really hot after about 40 minutes, especially the tops of my feet. Wasn&#x27;t so much that it was unbearable though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per another user&#x27;s review, I soaked my feet for a little while once a day after using this. After three days of use, the bottoms of my feet started peeling and within one week of use, the bottoms of my feet had peeled completely. My heels are softer than they have been in SOOO long. I absolutely love it! The instructions said to let the skin peel off naturally and not to forcibly peel it, but in order to prevent thick dead skin ending up all over my apartment floor, I cut the skin off as it went along. This is so much more effective and cheaper than getting a pedicure. I would imagine it is more sanitary too. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this at least a couple times a year.</li>
    <li> My feet are soft, overall. However, I have calluses. This product was great in almost all parts of my feet, except my calluses. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m still not sure about my rating, but I figured I&#x27;d let you know. The package does say that multiple uses may be needed. I will try again, and hopefully that time I see better results.</li>
    <li> It worked awesome!  But be prepared for the dead skin on your feet to peel for up to two weeks.  My feet were horrible so maybe that&#x27;s why the dead skin took two weeks to shed. :)</li>
    <li> My feet were in need of some help! I will only get my toes painted at the nail salon and no longer will I do pedicures. I will be using this product every 3 months as needed. I recommend this product to anyone. I was skeptical at first but after a week my feet were peeling and were a whole lot softer!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to reduce the roughness of my feet and bsbyfeet did help. It&#x27;s not a full solution but it was good value and did reduce some of the less built up areas.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I soaked my feet long enough before using baby feet. It worked about 5 days later. It was okay</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money, returned the item, would not recommend purchasing this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try something else to soften your feet</li>
    <li> So my feet are wonderfully smooth and they look great. However, I don&#x27;t know if it was that I didn&#x27;t soak my feet long enough in the booties (I did do it for an hour as on the package) My feet did not peel at all as others have said. I have soaked my feet in water for at least 30 minutes every day and I have had to rub and rub at my feet to get the dead skin off. The tops of my feet have not peeled at all and I did this over a week ago. I love how great my feet look and feel but it was more work to just get a bit of the dead skin off. I will buy this again and try soaking my feet 30 minutes before, leaving the booties on for at least an hour and half and then soaking my feet after for 30 minutes. Over all I would recommend this to friends and family. But making sure that they have 2-3 hours to start the process and have 30 minutes a day to soak their feet. This is not an over night fix.....really a few weeks to get results. At least my feet will look great for Mexico!!!</li>
    <li> I love baby foot it works just as it&#x27;s suppose to and my feet feel great. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my product and service.  If I were you I would buy it too!  Merry Christmas ho ho ho!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical with this product until my skin started peeling 5 days later. When I was done, my feet felt smoother than when I get a pedicure.  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet for 30 minutes before use, kept the booties on for an hour with socks over them to hold them on to my feet, and soaked my feet for 30 minutes every night for two weeks after use.  I didn&#x27;t get a single flake of peeling.  Not just annoyed about the cost, but really disappointed because I wanted to see my feet peel!</li>
    <li> I just bought this after seeing reviews on Youtube and on Amazon. I just started it today and can&#x27;t wait for the final product. Hopefully it works like everyone else said about it.</li>
    <li> After 2-3 days nothing happened. By the fourth day my feet were peeling like a snake all that winter skin is off. It&#x27;s the best product hands down.</li>
    <li> It takes a few days for it to start working, but when it finally does, be prepared. Your feet will look like they&#x27;re molting and it&#x27;s not pretty. Once the process is done, however, your feet are good as new.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been two days since I used this product, but my feet are already peeling - the tops of my feet are peeling significantly, while the soles of my feet are noticeably softer, especially my calluses on my big toes and balls of my feet, and starting to flake.  I followed the advice of other reviewers to soak my feet before and after product use and to keep soaking my feet to get the peeling started.  I kept the booties on for a little over 2 hours (until my feet felt noticeably warm from the plastic and socks) and have soaked my feet for 20-30 minutes each night.  If you don&#x27;t have the time to take a bath instead of a shower, but you have a combined tub and shower, you might try stopping up the tub so the water can collect around your feet while you shower.  It sounds like the amount of soaking time your feet get post-product use really makes a difference in results.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, I feel that it made the tops of my feet feel great.  However, I don&#x27;t think it really did much for the areas of my feet that were really rough like my heels or the side of my one foot.  Although those areas improved a little, they are still pretty rough.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars</li>
    <li> I used this almost 2 weeks ago, and it didn&#x27;t work. My feet are dry, but they aren&#x27;t peeling. I&#x27;ve tried soaking my feet, but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I got in the mail yesterday and used right away. It was easy to use and I am looking forward to the results. I purchased on the recommendation from Martha Stewart Weddings on Sirius Radio as a must have for everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My feet are soft and pink and my skin looks amazing.  Will definitely order this product again. My feet didn&#x27;t really start to peel until around day five but, when the peeling started boy did it start.  I slathered my feet in Vaseline and wrapped them in saran wrap and put on a pair of socks and slept that way during the peeling stage and it worked wonders.  I did this for two nights.  This product worked so well my fiance&#x27; has ordered it too.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet in tepid water for about 30 minutes and then left the booties on for an hour with socks to help keep them on.  I thought it might take longer for me to see results because I only take showers, but in just two or three days my feet started peeling.  My only complaint is that my feet look pretty gruesome now that they are peeling!  And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep from peeling the skin off myself.</li>
    <li> Holy cow.  This works.  Give it a week or so, then get ready to shed your skin like a snake.  The only downside (apart from randomly leaving bits of skin behind when walking at home barefoot or in bed) is that during the peeling process, my feet itched a bit.  But the end result is amazing.</li>
    <li> My wife was skeptical but she is a believer now as well as her entire office.  Stop thinking about it and buy now, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Boy does this work. I will use it again. It does take the 7 days for the skin to come off. The results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. Results are fantastic!!!! A must have in your beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I tried this but I have to say this is amazing stuff.  I followed the instructions and about 3 or 4 days later my feet started peeling.  It started on my heals first and the amount peeling was unbelievable.  My feet continued to peel for about 5 days, I would rub my feet with a damp wash cloth for the stuff that was too thin to pull off.  My feet have never felt better, they actually do feel like baby feet.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best callus product ever...I have used many other callus removal products and nothing has ever come even close to the results Baby Feet delivers. I found myself recommending to all my girlfriends so figured I would share a review here too. TIP: make sure to time application for a timeframe where you are not planning on wearing open shoes. I started peeling around day 3 after application and continued through day 7.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat hesistant about buying this, but I am glad I did.  It takes a while for it to work, but once it does, you will notice a big difference.  Once I shed all of my old skin, my feet were left soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I followed the advice of other reviews to soak my feet everyday after using the Baby Foot booties and at about 4 days afterwards, my feet began peeling. It&#x27;s now exactly a week later and it&#x27;s almost done peeling off.</li>
    <li> Get ready to film your own National Geographic special as you shed your skin like an Amazonian anaconda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this at a friend&#x27;s recommendation and it was fascinating. Do everything they recommend: soak your feet first, wrap the booties on and use the fixing tapes, then layer on some socks. Nothing leaks, it&#x27;s just a little gooey inside and hard to walk (be careful when you head to the shower!).  After about a week and nothing was peeling, I just assumed I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. Not so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very next day, both feet started to massively slough. Interestingly, the peeling was mostly where I had thick calluses and not on the thinner-skinned top of my feet.  After two days of peeling, my feet look amazing.  If you use this, schedule accordingly with shoe wear around day 7-9 post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could find this product in a safe facemask, I&#x27;d look 16 again - I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I did not do the pre-soak, but did use the product on my feet for 1 hour via the instructions.  Nothing happened until day 5, then BOOM, my feet started peeling.  And they peeled and peeled and peeled.  Still peeling after 1 week, but the skin leftover is super soft, including my heels which have not been this soft since I was a toddler. I totally recommend the product but be prepared for lots of peeling (including between the toes and arch of foot!).  I will use this again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that though I have sensitive skin, I did not experience any burning or cracking as some others have stated.</li>
    <li> This product was not quite what I had expected. Having peeling skin hanging off my feet and having to peel it off to remove it is not my idea of a good time. I am still in the process and it seems to be working but I found the whole thing pretty gross. My Husband says it looks like I have Leprosy. Also the callous I have that I wanted to remove does not seem to be affected by the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works unbelievably! I thought nothing wa going to happen but on the fifth day, OMG! For the next week, my feet peeled consistently. Wear socks!! Otherwise, your floors and couches will be disgusting. My feet are like brand new feet!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try on my boyfriend.  He is on his feet at least 13 hours a day and wears steel toe shoes.  His feet are....in no short terms, GROSS.  Just dry and callused and always peeling.  When I finally talked him into letting us this on him it was really easy.  Some of the other reviews said they soaked their feet first, well I didn&#x27;t make him do that.  I just followed the directions and made him lay in bed with them on for an hour (just popped in a movie and went about my chores lol) after the hour was up, he rinsed his feet off in the shower with soap and water and put socks on.  It took about 4 days before any kind of result was seen.  His feet did not peel off in &amp;#34;sheets&amp;#34; like some other reviews claimed, but a TON of dead skin did start literally just falling off.  Its been 2 weeks now and I think they are just about done peeling.  They look a lot better but he will definitely need another treatment since his feet were SO bad.  Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I have typical guy feet.  Dry, cracked, yellow-ish heels, and itchy.  I don&#x27;t have athlete&#x27;s foot, my feet just itch from all the dead skin.  I&#x27;ve tried spa treatments, foot soaks, pedi-egg, soaking in mouthwash and vinegar, etc.  Even though some helped a little, there is nothing like this product Baby Foot.  It was like I had two snakes for feet as they basically shed a few layers of skin.  Though I will do a second treatment for my heels (lots of layers there), the rest of my feet look and feel amazing.  I don&#x27;t usually endorse products like this, but this is the real deal.  It says the peeling starts in 5-7 days and can take up to 2 weeks.  I started peeling in 3 days and was basically done by day 10.  I took someone else&#x27;s suggestion of soaking my feet in hot water for 15-20 minutes before doing this because it helped open up my pores.  The peeling process can be a little weird as you will peel off huge pieces of skin, but what is left behind is super soft skin.  As for my heels, even though I want to do a second treatment, they look and feel 50 times better than before this treatment.  My boyfriend was rubbing my feet last night and kept saying how he was amazed at how perfectly soft they were.  Prior to this treatment, he&#x27;d only rub my feet if I was wearing socks.  So I won&#x27;t call this a miracle product,but it&#x27;s by far the most effective foot product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Completely worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> 10 STARS! THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I got some peeling but not the dramatic peels that I&#x27;ve seen others demonstrate.  I&#x27;ll probably try it again though!</li>
    <li> I have to say I was not to sure this would work as advertised, but WOW!!!!  It does exactly as advertised.  The first two days all I noticed was my feet felt very dry, by the third day they started peeling and I mean seriously peeling.  Pretty gross, kept socks on for two weeks because I did not want pieces of dead skin all over the house.  After showering, I would rub as much of the peeling skin off as possible.  Now they are dead skin free and so soft.  I will be ordering this again, now to convince my husband to use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had callous cracked heels for years.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does exactly what it promises.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly the product worked just as described. I highly recommend this as my feet are looking really good, I&#x27;m very happy with baby foot</li>
    <li> This is a seriously intense treatment and the BEST foot product I&#x27;ve ever used for very dry feet!!!  After several days to a week, your skin just starts peeling off your feet (tops and bottoms) and ankle area.  It&#x27;s kind of gross actually and you&#x27;d probably want to wear socks around the house or you&#x27;ll have skin on your floor (yes, they exfoliate that much!).  The peeling continues for about 1 1/2 weeks.  I guess you could help it along by scrubbing your feet.  When all of the peeling is done, you have NEW FEET!  Wow - just reordered more and have recommended this to others. *Definitely don&#x27;t try to walk with these booties on your feet - very slippery!  Maybe have a basin of water nearby so when the hour is up you just take them off and rinse your feet right there. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet in warm water for 30 minutes before and after using Baby Foot. I left the booties on for an hour. After 4 days my skin started peeling on the bottom of my feet when I got out the shower. There was dramatic peeling for two days and then small scale peeling all around my feet for a few more. A thick buildup of skin on the ball of my foot came off in the first couple days. After the peeling finished my feet were super soft and required almost no moisturizer. Now, a month later, the skin on the ball of my foot has built up again and the skin on my heels is getting rough. I may try it again in a few months with more soaking and leaving the booties on longer.</li>
    <li> The product is truly amazing and I would surely reccommend it to anyone. The reason for a four star rating is that I thought it would do more with the calluses on the balls of my feet.  It worked great everywhere else. I will use the product again.</li>
    <li> Product worked as promised.  After following the treatment directions, it took about a week to start peeling.  Don&#x27;t do the treatment unless you can wear socks for 3 weeks, the peeling is effective but not pretty. :-) I liked that it went through several layers on the calluses.  My main concern is all your exposed skin will peel...top of of my foot, between the toes and ankles are still peeling.  Because of this, I am not sure if I will do this again any time soon.  I wish it could be limited to the calluse area.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loved it so I will definitely be purchasing  another one in the future.  Thanks a lot. .</li>
    <li> This worked exactly as advertised, made the dry skin fall off after a few days.  I still have the hint of cracks on my heels, really they&#x27;re just indents, so will do this again in a couple of months then as needed.  So much better/safer than typical methods for removing dead skin.</li>
    <li> My feet are soft but not baby soft. I was expecting more, but I&#x27;m happy. The process just took too long.</li>
    <li> I soaked before I did it.  Followed the instructions to a tee and soaked my feet every night after that.  I had some skin come off but nothing like the peeling pictures!</li>
    <li> This product worked as promised! I did soak my feet before applying and made sure I took baths instead of showering as much as possible.  My feet started to peel within a week.  Looks pretty gross for a while but the results are so worth it.  Feet are baby smooth!</li>
    <li> I purchased one for me and one for my daughter.  I had made the statement that I didn&#x27;t think it was working and as I pulled my feet from under my cover to show her...Viola!!  My feet had peeled and were baby soft underneath.  It was gross looking but kind of fun to peel.  I would recommend Baby Foot to everyone.  I would also use it as a gag gift for those who are always unbelieving.  Imagine thinking you are getting a special pedicure and three days later your skin is peeling.  Surprise!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product enjoyed by both me and my daughter.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because nothing else works on my dry, crusty, cracky feet.  It actually did peel all of the dead skin off and made them very soft.  I think I may have to do it again to see if it gets my heels a little deeper.  Great!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works so well.  I would recommend it!  It makes your feet soft and gets rid of the dead skin.</li>
    <li> The positives:  It works!  The negatives: Did NOT completely work on the thick calluses on the heel. They are better but the calluses are still there. Also, 8 days later and I am still flaking like crazy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Prob best to use during the winter months. The journey is gross but the end result is simply amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  I was a little leery at first and wondered if this was for real, but it certainly is!!  It took about 4 to 5 days before there was any sign of peeling......and by day 7-10, it was full blown.  I had such terrible callouses on my feet, with the ugliest cracked heels.  The skin was so thick on my feet.  After the peeling had stopped, my feet were so soft and smooth....like a baby!  The biggest thing I noticed was when I walked on a tile floor......I could actually feel that the floor was cold.  Before, with the heavy callouses, I couldn&#x27;t feel the coldness.  Now.....I do.  It&#x27;s great!  This is a fabulous product and will probably make an annual tradition of this!</li>
    <li> I do believe I have the ugliest feet in the world.  And in the summertime, they are cracked and dry, no matter what I do.  But I used this and now they are in great shape!  Granted, some may find the peeling period (which comes a few days after use) to be a bit gross.  I actually like it.  It looks like progress.  (I swim and when I started peeling, when I got out of the pool, my feet looked like those of the Creature From the Blue Lagoon!)  The results are worth the price.</li>
    <li> helped but not as much as I hoped</li>
    <li> I like it OK- but not as I expected-- not worth the money-- good product  but just not for  me</li>
    <li> When I saw this advertised, I thought - what kind of jedi mind trick is this (as is so usual in commercials - false advertisement).  But, I reluctantly order this product.  It arrived as expected and I was pretty excited to try (although still a bit skeptical).  WOW - on day 3 I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw....it was exactly as advertised - years of dead skin started peeling from my feet.  When I looked down and saw the new skin that was emerging - I was stunned at just how gray looking my feet actually were (even after a pedicure).  The new, fresh and colorful skin that was appearing was simply amazing!!!!  On a scale of 1 - 100....I give this product a 200....yes, it is THAT GOOD!!!!.  I will continue to use this product and have recommended it to all of my friends and family.  One thing that really helped was the soaking the feet every day (I used a foot bath with vibrating bubbles and warm water)...However - this is NOT required.  Thank you so much for introducing this product to the world!!!!!</li>
    <li> Worked as described but took longer than I thought. Didn&#x27;t begin peeling until 5th or 6th day and continued peeling for another week, so almost 2 weeks total. But it did make the skin on my feet smoother. My heels are still dry and cracked but they were much worse and probably need more treatment than just this peel provides.</li>
    <li> Worked, feet started to peel after 10 days of waiting. The shedding process is messy, not sure I would do it again</li>
    <li> I paid extra thinking I was getting a 2 pack - I did not. Read the description carefully. The product worked as stated.</li>
    <li> Baby Foot definitely works as described -- all areas in the bootie will definitely peel.  It took about 5 weeks total before they were fully peeled.  2 weeks before they started peeling and another 2-3 weeks of peeling.  So, use it when you have several weeks before you want to take your feet public.</li>
    <li> Yes - it makes your feet peel, but not sure it gets to the problem areas. All my life I have had very delicate feet, and as I have gotten older, my feet aren&#x27;t as soft. The first time I tried this product, and after following the directions, my feet peeled in almost every spot - except for around my big toe on each foot. I will edit this review in a couple weeks after a have tried again.</li>
    <li> Well it wasn&#x27;t life changing - as some of the reviews could lead you to believe, but I was overall impressed with the results.  Takes about 14 days from the start time to fully see results.  From about days 5-10 your feet peel so badly you need to wear socks all of the time.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt though and is easy to follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;You can see my detailed review, along with pictures, on my blog at www.chiefhouseholdofficer.net/babyfoot/</li>
    <li> Bad design of bootie puts exfoliating gel all over feet. This ate away the thin skin on the tops of my feet and around toes. I had followed the directions. I could not wear sandals as they cut through the thin damaged skin. I had to wrap my feet in gauze. Blistered and bled for a month. Very painful. Now the tops of my feet are scarred. I contacted the manufacturer. They requested receipts and pictures. After I sent them and they saw the damage to my feet the company ignored me. It is ridiculous to put the strong chemicals that remove callouses on the tops of feet. Horrid careless design. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Great does everything it claims to&lt;br /&gt;At first you will think it&#x27;s not working but after about five day that skin is falling off. ( make sure you have a hand held vacuum you&#x27;ll find skin all over the place LOL)&lt;br /&gt;Feet will continue to peel for about two weeks but you can really feel and see the difference</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have I am usually in sandals and my heels are always a mess, this worked MIRACLES! I already did a reorder for when I need to use it again, but even after a few months my feet are still in great shape.  It does mess with polish so don&#x27;t do your nails before you use it :)</li>
    <li> This just removed my nail polish. Maybe I gave baby feet.</li>
    <li> As effective as promised, and as disgusting as you can imagine. But fascinating if you aren&#x27;t too squeamish about dealing with quantities of your own dead skin. It didn&#x27;t get totally rid of my most seriously built up calluses, but there was dramatic improvement, especially to heels. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I go barefoot a lot so my feet are usually a mess. After an hour in these booties all the ugly dry skin just peels away in about 5-7 days. I&#x27;m going to put it in my routine. My shoes even feel better because there aren&#x27;t any callouses making pressure points anywhere. I experimented with the presoak. One foot was soaked, one was not. The presoaked foot peeled sooner and more completely. next time soaking them both.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and this is the first beauty product I have purchased that has exceeded my expectations.  My heels have never been this soft!  The product did fade my toenail polish and the first week of peeling was not very attractive when I wore sandals, but the rsults was well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, but I will absolutely be doing it again. The booties system isn&#x27;t exactly comfortable, but the results are totally worth it. Its been a few days, and my feet have already begun peeling. The skin underneath looks so fresh and soft! But honestly, the best part is the peeling. There&#x27;s SO much peeling. Maybe its the compulsiveness in me, but I love sitting around and peeling up the dead skin from my feet. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you&#x27;re grossed out easily.</li>
    <li> Great product. Beware of the all natural pitch. This product has harmful chemicals. Go to the environmental working group&#x27;s website and plug in the list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> So I made my husband try this and he really didn&#x27;t want to but I put my foot down (ha ha) and for the next two weeks his athlete&#x27;s foot was worse than ever but then all the skin peeled off and now he doesn&#x27;t stink up the house with his yucky foot smell.  Oh, and his feet aren&#x27;t all white and dry anymore - basically he seems to be free from athletes foot.  He said it felt &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; during the one hour that he wore the booties but no pain at anytime.  He did have a flare up of athlete&#x27;s foot so we used some cream for athlete&#x27;s foot and then that seemed to fix it.  That was at day 8 and the peeling continued until day 14.  I plan on doing this again for him in 6 months.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Works well...my feet are still peeling, so not sure of full end result, but so far so good and the best product I have used for foot exfoliation!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work smelled nice. Yes I followed the directions etc</li>
    <li> Is this a joke? I feel so ripped off. (And how do you return an item like this?) If it did anything, it made my feet more dry.</li>
    <li> So I read all the reviews, soaked my feet prior to the application of Baby Foot, soaked my feet in the ensuing days... I barely got a peel.  It did something, but not much.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another product.</li>
    <li> very good product.  I was pleased with the results.  Did what it claimed it would do whch is exfoliate, or remove, the dead skin from my feet.  Was having real problems with corns, bunions, etc but now problem is solved!!!</li>
    <li> I saw excellent reviews of this product. I was left disappointed. Some of the old, dry skin pealed off, but my feet are not any more soft or fresh looking. I&#x27;d rather just spend money on a pedi.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Easy to use. Just put some plastic socks on, wait, rinse. In about 4-7 days your feet will start peeling. Then they will peel more. And then some more. Then a little more. They will just continue to peel until you think you won&#x27;t have any feet left. Then BAM its done, and you realize HOW SOFT YOUR FEET ARE! This product has made SUCH a significant difference. There is nothing else like it that I&#x27;ve tried. I recommend to anyone who asks about it. Give it a shot - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works. Nuff said. Get it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but product does not really work. It does leave feet soft...but does not remove dead skin. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve told so many people about Baby Foot. I&#x27;m probably known as &amp;#34;the Crazy Baby Foot Lady&amp;#34; around the office. But once my coworkers try this stuff I&#x27;ll be known as &amp;#34;the Brilliant Baby Foot Lady&amp;#34;, so whatever. Last laugh and all.</li>
    <li> I already had smooth feet but wanted to try these to see if I could get even smoother feet. The answer: Yes! My feet peeled for 2-3 weeks and are even smoother. Hard to believe. I even had someone recently comment on how smooth my feet were. Great product!</li>
    <li> the tops of feet peeled</li>
    <li> This is a great product...you should do this in March or late April if you want to have pretty feet for the summer.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic but I figured it was worth a try. Besides, I&#x27;ve thrown $25 away on worse things. It blew me away. I kept the booties on for about 2hrs while I watched a ball game and about day 4, this product meant business!! The only downside was that I had to wear socks 24hrs/day but the outcome was well worth the wait. My feet are very rigid. I mean I could walk a mile barefoot over busted glass without flinching but Baby Foot took that tough skin away. For others with similar polynesian feet like mine, I would recommend this product... and continual use.</li>
    <li> I have dinosaur feet.  I didn&#x27;t always have them but after returning from a Virgin Islands trip 10 years ago I began to notice my feet becoming really rough in spots (heel, lower side section of big toe and side of pinky toe).  I went to a podiatrist and she tested for fungus etc but found nothing.  So, my days of scraping and moisturizing and wearing socks to bed because I was embarrassed for my husband to accidentally touch my feet during the night began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best product I had found before I discovered a blurb in a magazine about Baby Foot was pure Shea Butter.  It was a daily process however and if I skipped a day I noticed it would take 3 days of constant use  to \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; with fairly smooth feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read enough positive reviews of Baby Foot to decide to give it a try.  I was a bit leery of it being a Japanese product but then realized I was probably being paranoid because of radiation fears (yeah, that is a whole other story).  The product I received came from Liberta U.S.A. Inc. so I am guessing they are the U.S. distributor now for this Japanese product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received came in the red box with American English print with a photo of a woman&#x27;s feet (not the photo of a leg shown on the red box here at Amazon currently).  It says Lavender scent on the front.  The instructions on the back say the booties will fit Woman size 4-12 and Men 4-13 (American I am assuming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the inconsistent reviews of results I decided to compare the ingredients in the different packaging types and found differences.  Some of these differences were in ingredients themselves and some just in the order of the ingredients (we all know the listed order of the ingredients determines the percentage of the ingredient in the product).  I won&#x27;t go into all the different ingredients or order differences but I will compare here a couple of really noticeable differences in the Liberta USA Inc. product I received and the red box American text with the womans legs and her hand on her calf.  One of the first differences in MY box and the box shown here on Amazon is the ingredient Salicylic Acid.  Now we ladies all know that ingredient from our facial masks and creams.  It is a good ingredient (unless you have ultra sensitive skin or a condition such as Rosacea) to have in a product that promises to get rid of dead topical skin.  Amazon here lists it as ingredient number 9.  My box lists it as ingredient number 32!  In fact, there are so many oil and extract ingredients listed on MY red box list before ANY of the acids (with exception of the lactic acid) that it is clear that the U.S. distributed product is a completely different product than what the Japanese had originally produced.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because our FDA deemed the actual acid concentration too high for sale in the U.S. or if it is just because Americans are just economically dumb and will buy anything made more cheaply even if it is ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that said, I opened the package and found two clear, thin, boxy booty bags.  The gel was visable inside.  I had to use scissors to cut the very top of the booties.  I cut the tops of the booties at the same time.  I recommend you cut and put on one at a time however because it could get messy.  I was very careful and inserted each foot.  I didn&#x27;t notice any type of offensive or chemical type odor but I didn&#x27;t really detect Lavender either (and I use a LOT of lavender products so I am well acquainted with it).  My box came with a strip of plastic sealing tape pieces.  The plastic did feel very thin and I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable walking around in just them or even propping them up for fear that the gel could leak out somehow.  Fortunately, I own a pair of large furry booty slippers that make me look like a muppet from the calf down so I slipped my bagged feet into those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on MY box says to leave them on for only 1 hour.  Then wash feet with soap.  The dead skin cells will begin to peel 2-7 days after initial application.  I left product on for two hours after I knew that the amount of acid was reduced in this version.  I really don&#x27;t understand why the leave on time is LESS time with LESS acid ingredients?  You would think the less effective ingredient list would require MORE time on the feet.  Anyway, after two hours I removed the booties and washed my feet and thoroughly dried.  I didn&#x27;t feel any weird tingling or burning of any kind.  My feet did feel a bit warmer to the touch than usual however but that is probably because they were in baggies inside muppet slipper boots for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dried my feet and didn&#x27;t apply any moisturizer of any kind at first.  The instructions do say that if your feet feel dry you apply a small amount of moisturizer.  It took 3 days to start noticing a bit of sloughing.  My feet didn&#x27;t get scaly but there was not a \\&quot;dramatic\\&quot; amount of peeling after 3 days.  It looks more like if you are in the tub 10 minutes too long and you start getting that whitish soft ring around the edge of the heel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this on day 3 because I wanted to get the differences of the product information out to you guys now.  I will be updating in about 3 more days and then give you my final thoughts/results after a full 14 days after the initial use of this product.  I will let you know what I am using in addition to this product in the next 11 days as well.  I am going to do nothing to one foot (as a \\&quot;control\\&quot;) and then if I use Shea Butter etc I will use it on the other foot exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  It has been 7 days since I first applied the product.  My heels feel like they are sore.  Not a burning sore just like if I have been standing all day.  My feet are finally starting to slough and peel.  However, only the tops of my feet.  A thin layer of skin can be peeled off much like the skin after a sunburn except there is no redness.  The bottoms of my feet are not visably peeling nor are they softer.  I suspect it is because the Baby Foot product I purchased is a different formula then the original Japanese product that comes in the box with the Japanese writing.  I have not tried the product packaged in the Japanese box but I know that there is far less acid in the Baby Foot product that I received.  I think this less acid is the reason there is no sloughing on the bottom of my foot.  The way the bag booties fit with the gel inside makes it impossible to concentrate the gel solely on the bottoms of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  9 days after applying product.  I woke up this morning to the bottoms and sides of my feet finally peeling!  I am peeling off large pieces of skin to reveal new baby soft skin.  I had to scrape with my nail a bit to get the heel sections off but my skin didn&#x27;t tear like I was afraid it might.  So, it worked after all. It just took longer than I expected.  I do recommend this product but as others have mentioned, make sure you give yourself a good two weeks after initial application before you have to reveal your feet to anyone.  I would like to have the gel formula in a jar or bottle so that I could apply it to my heels only sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Someone asked me today if I noticed my feet getting rough again after the initial effects of the treatment. YES. Two weeks after the initial smoothness (meaning after all the peeling was done) my feet were close to being right back to where they were before the treatment. This is why in my review I mentioned that it would be nice to have a bottle of the solution alone for periodic maintenance. I am back to having to apply creams such as shea butter nightly. As it stands now, plan on this method of softening to be for an event or vacation because it isn&#x27;t a long term solution.th soap.

    <li> Like the other reviewers of this product I was amazed at how well this product works! It really did leave my feet super soft and supple, but it took several days of shedding dead skin to get to that point. I followed the advice of other reviewers and soaked my feet before using the booties, and then continued to soak my feet nightly thereafter in order to speed up the exfoliation process. It took about 10 days to go through the entire exfoliation and finally get to the point where I could comfortably show my feet in public. In the meantime, going to my regular yoga classes was a little awkward. I didn&#x27;t want anyone looking at my peeling, flaking skin. Plus, my boyfriend was curious to know why I all-of-a-sudden started wearing socks around the house when we&#x27;re normally both barefoot. I suppose I could&#x27;ve just explained that I was wearing the socks to keep all the dead skin that was peeling off my feet from being tracked all over the floor. However, I think that even after being together for a very long time there are still some things about a woman&#x27;s beauty routine that should remain a mystery to her partner. Over all, I would recommend this product to anyone who has neglected to keep up with a regular exfoliation routine. This will help you get back on track. But its not a product that I want to use on a regular basis just because of how much time it takes to get through the whole process. Now that I&#x27;ve been through it once I&#x27;ve worked to keep up with a regular soaking and exfoliating routine so that hopefully I won&#x27;t have to go through the process again. I&#x27;m at least glad to know that I have a fall back plan in case I need it.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly - presoaked my feet, used a timer, washed my feet off with soap and water. It&#x27;s been 8 days and nothing has happened except now my feet are REALLY dry and cracked.</li>
    <li> Awesome treatment for dry &amp; rough feet. I left my feet in the treatment booties for 2 hours. I also soaked my feet in water for 10 minutes prior to starting &amp; dried well. I soaked my feet in water everyday or every other day for about 20 minutes after initial treatment day also. Did not do anything else to feet as I waited for peel to begin which occurred about day 5. Feet start to look funky in a few days while building up to day 5, but no peeling until day 5 for me.  If you have an event or somewhere special to go in the days following the treatment, don&#x27;t expect to wear open shoes!! You start molting and it goes from about day 5-10. End result is soft feet though!! Purchased a second box to repeat treatment in a few months! One box is for 1 treatment.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I thought it would not work, but I was wrong!!!! Great smell, easy to use and the skin peels off within a week. My feet were in major need of this and after a month I am now doing it again, for maintenance. Recommended this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Feels very good and very nice lavendar scented for my foot treatments. I recommend for anyone into foot care to consider. I will be a returning shopper and great shipping ad packaging.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how much dead skin came off my feet! Really loved baby foot</li>
    <li> This product saved my feet! I was going for pedicures year round about every three weeks. After I saw someone post this product on FaceBook I ordered them. I have used them twice now and are so happy with the results. I had cracked and sometimes bleeding heels. Once healed I used a pair of these booties. It took four to five days for them to start to peeling so don&#x27;t get discouraged. Since my feet were so badly callused I used them and two week later went for a pedicure. Then used them about a week after the pedicure again - then another pedicure. My feet are healed and so much softer than they have ever been.</li>
    <li> Took the full 7 days before I started peeling and about 5-7 days before it finished. But WOW!  Great results!!!</li>
    <li> Results were great.  My feet started peeling on the 5th day an continued peeling for 2 weeks...not good for summertime.</li>
    <li> Tried this product six months ago and my feet are STILL in good shape.  Has become my favorite gift for my female friends and family.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. It was a very big disappointment to me. It did not work at all. I did not get one skin cell to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was the best experience.  As the instructions state the peeling starts about a week after applied.  I did my first treatment in the summer.  This would be better done in the winter as my feet are still a bit ruff from going barefoot.</li>
    <li> I will hail this product from the mountaintops!  my feet are generally very dry and calloused.  All the women in my family have similar feet.  I have tried everything to make them soft and pink.  No pedicure, pumas, scraper, ointment, wax or moisturizer really worked for me... then I. discovered Baby Foot.  After 2 applications, my feet are piggy pink with all new fresh skin and no calloused dry ugly horrible looking skin!  My sister&#x27;s feet were worse than mine and now thay are piggy pink, too!  I will be giving this to all my girlfriends, from now on.  THANK YOU BABY FOOT!!</li>
    <li> I did the Baby Foot on Sunday....looked down tonight.  I have never seen my feet peel like this!  I wish those chemical peels on my face worked like this :)  Highly recommend.  I am ordering one for my daughter who is a bride to be in 3 weeks and a few extras for friends.</li>
    <li> My feet never looked so good!</li>
    <li> The product came on time . It is very easy to use and the instructions are easy to read and clear.&lt;br /&gt;I still waiting for the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is exactly what I read about it!  It painlessly makes your foot peel layers of the calluses your feet have created over years of use.  There is NO burning feeling nor tenderness at any point.  I tell every woman I know about this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so my husband has some nasty feet. He works in the Louisiana heat all day in steel toe boots, so naturally his feet get pretty sweaty in his socks. He had layers upon layers of dead, dry, wrinkled skin that would itch as soon as he got out of the shower. I tried, in vain, to get him to go for a pedicure. He refused- not because he felt it was too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; for him, but because his feet are so incredibly ticklish that he just couldn&#x27;t handle it (I can&#x27;t even graze the bottom of his feet at night by accident without him having a full body spasm and freaking out). After searching for something to help him, I came across this product. He agreed to try it- he was all for being forced to sit down for an hour and letting the acid do its work. So, I ordered and we followed all of the steps on the package as well as the tips from previous reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome results. A few things you may want to know, though:&lt;br /&gt;1. Your feet will peel for about 2 weeks. Constantly. You will have chunks of dead skin in your socks by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;2. This product not only removes the dead skin on the surface, but it moisturizes the new skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is not a long-term solution. Hubby&#x27;s feet were back to looking ragged about a week after the peeling stopped. The itching is gone and hasn&#x27;t come back, but I can&#x27;t see ordering this and doing it once a month- which is what we would need to do in order to keep the initial results up. For people who get what is essentially trench foot every day at work, this product isn&#x27;t for you. If your feet aren&#x27;t constantly exposed to harsh work environments, if you have a desk job, if you have otherwise normal feet, you will love this.</li>
    <li> I wish it was as strong as the japanese version. It did make my feet itchy. This was one of those few times I wish I had read all comments before use. If you soak your feet every day after for a few minutes, it will help your feet peel better. With my hubby&#x27;s manly feet, i talked him into using this so as not to feel like I&#x27;m sleeping with sandpaper every night. His feet did not peel until the 12th day when I finally read he should soak his feet. Then they peeled a bit. Second time I got him to use it, which was a battle and a half, whenever he was in the shower we stopped up the tub a bit while he washed his hair. Giving him a bit of a soak without him feeling like he was doing something girly. It worked well. So soaking is the way to go! They worked for me easily and I was peeling without soaking, then again I keep my feet really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d still like to try the stronger version, if possible. But if not, I&#x27;d simply buy this one again. I think twice a year would be great for anyone who keeps their feet nice. If you have foot issues, you might want to do it far more often? But I am no expert.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, I said never again this is disgusting, then I saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every 6 to 8 weeks in the winter.  I don&#x27;t know how you can use this in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the easiest way to use this is to put the bag on your foot,I put duct tape around the ankle ( the pieces of tape that come with it are basically useless)  and a pair of socks on top. I leave it on for about an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Your feet start peeling about 5 or 6 days after you use this, and they keep peeling for about a week. Then you have baby feet !!!</li>
    <li> bought it after reading reviews and hoping it would work.. however it actually made my feet more harsh.. aquaphor worked better than this product.</li>
    <li> Well, I did not follow the instructions to the letter- I actually kept the squishy boots on for about 2 hours, I soaked my feet for about an hour prior to putting on the booties. Nothing happened for about 5 days and then my feet were sloughing like i poured elmers glue on it. It was grossly satisfying to peel off strips of skin. I soaked my feet probably every other night and used a one of those cheese grater type foot files- my feet were considerably smoother but never became like baby foot smooth. They also looked just as bad as they ever did in about 2 weeks. The sloughing period is extreme- don&#x27;t even think about wearing any kind of sandals for a while. My feet were pretty calloused, fissured and so icky I could pick up lint walking on carpet- maybe I would need 2 treatments? More likely a professional belt sander. Did some of what it said it would but ultimately I did not end up with baby feet.</li>
    <li> It really works as described. My girlfriend loves these. Soak your feet before wearing the booties. She closes the tub drain when she takes a shower in the mornings after using Baby Foot. The repeated daily soakings help.</li>
    <li> best i have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy. I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does. Prepare to be amazed.</li>
    <li> worked worderful. i was some what anxious at first but after the fourth day skin started to peel.  after about a week i saw positive results and my feet are truly baby soft.</li>
    <li> This product did help my wife&#x27;s feet to some extent, but not anywhere near peeling off the thick dry calloused skin she had hoped. About 6 days after application, a lot of skin did peel, but the thicker stuff may need an atomic product to help it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Cleared all my calluses!! My feet are very smooth!! takes about a week to 8 days.</li>
    <li> I watch videos of everyone using this and I expected it to do way more than it did. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what is claims to do. I get pedicures often, but salons don&#x27;t file or scrub hard enough to get all of the dead skin off of my feet. I had a lot of calluses on the ball of my foot and especially my heel. It was so bad that no matter what I did (bathed, scrubbed, and even soak in bleach), my heels ALWAYS looked dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently on day six of my baby foot treatment and as two days ago, the peeling has started. Last night, large sheets of skin came off my heel as well as the sole of my foot. My feet were extremely bad. This is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product recommends using the booties for an hour. Wednesday night, I slept in mine. I did not soak me feet prior. I inserted my foot, taped, and slipped socks over them and went to sleep. In the morning, I washed my feet and wore closed toe shoes with socks. Note: Overnight it ate the gel polish off my toes nails. I experienced no pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later I was skeptical, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work on feet as bad as mine. The 2nd day, the peeling started on the top of my foot. I used it Wednesday night. I soaked my feet for an hour everyday, dried them, and then put back on socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the fifth day, the bottom of my feet peeled like CRAZY! I began using a metal foot file, and pumice stone to help get the skin off. It even peels the extra skin off of your toes. I wish I could upload a picture, because it is amazing. The skin underneath is new soft, and it feels so good. Now, after I soak, I dry, file and scrub (because my feet were just that bad). I also use Glytone before I put my socks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try not to pull the skin off and be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Use it. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> It worked very well. Be patient it does not start to peel for 5 to 6 days. I take great care of my feet and was surprised how much skin came off for about 2 weeks. I will purchase again and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ok ya&#x27;ll - this stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used it four or five times in the last couple years and loved it every time. I don&#x27;t like to get pedicures so being able to get all the rough skin off of my feet at home now and then is fantastic. My feet felt a little dry and the skin felt just slightly tight for a few days after the treatment but nothing that I would consider uncomfortable. My feet start peeling 5-7 days after the treatment and it takes 4-5 days to complete the peeling process. My feet are so soft afterwards. I love this stuff and I&#x27;m due for another treatment soon!</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed by I this product. I soaked and used as directed, and while there was peeling, ther was very little improve the over all in the appearance or softness of my feet. I have a lot of thick skin and cracks, and this did. To peel off at all.</li>
    <li> Used as directed. Didn&#x27;t work for me. Only the top part of my foot peeled-and only a small area. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Well it works as promised. Within about 5 days all the dead skin will peel off! But keep in mind your feet will feel itchy too! It is a little pricey, and you might want to speed the peeling process up with a pumice stone in the shower.</li>
    <li> Followed some of the advice given in the reviews (e.g., soaking the feet for an hour or so prior to application.) Pretty sure that helped. As advertised, in a week or so considerable shedding of dried skin started - painless process. It removed 90% of the dried skin on the heels, which was pretty thick. Ordered a second pack for a quick follow-up.</li>
    <li> if you follow the directions and then soak your feet for at least 30 mins each day after, this works.  It works so well that your feet will peel for about a week.  It does the job although you might not want it to after days and days of having peeling feet.  However, just plan ahead and make sure you don&#x27;t mind having gross peeling feet for a week.</li>
    <li> Using Baby Foot was easy and - as long as you don&#x27;t mind hiding your feet for a few days - it&#x27;s TOTALLY worth it!  My feet are MUCH SMOOTHER than they&#x27;ve been in years (even though I get pedicures every few weeks.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I use it twice a year to get the dead skin off that always seems to be there even after a pedicure.. It takes about a week to ten days to start peeling.  Your skin will literally peel off like a bad sunburn.  I suggest after your shower routine, rubbing it off with a washcloth.  Just before it gets ready to peel, the skin on your heels may get a little harder, allowing it to come off.  The results are truly amazing.  I have always had very dry cracked heels, and at 60, my feet are as soft as a teenager&#x27;s. No exaggeration. Perfect for sandal weather or just having soft nice looking feet!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a gift from the gods. I am a teacher- I&#x27;m constantly on my feet. My beautiful shoes give me an array of calluses so I order this product on an annual basis to get ready for flip flop season. Like the previous posters have disclosed- your feet look pretty disastrous for a week and then they look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous the first time I used this product. I was skeptical after I used it and nothing happened after a couple days, but on day 3-5 is usually when your skin starts peeling. Once you&#x27;re finished with the process, your feet will look so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful- I had a cut on my foot and it burned pretty badly as I was doing the soak in the gel. I had no bad side effects though!</li>
    <li> It worked as stated.  I had my doubts but it was great.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Okay....sooooo I was optimistic and skeptical all at the same time! So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. My feet were a mess....dry skin everywhere! Nevertheless, baby foot has helped quite a bit. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t quite take care of my heels the way I&#x27;d hoped. Mmmmmmmm that may not be due to the product though because they were a disaster! I just ordered another treatment and am hoping that it will do the trick now that the wolverine layer has been removed! We shall see. I have pics, I will post all of them after my second treatment is complete.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product. I have runner feet that are not pretty until I used this product. I like using it just about once every 2 months especially in the summer. I&#x27;m a lifelong fan!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Followed directions exactly including per soaking feet and soaking everyday from two days after to beyond. Absolutely no peeling.</li>
    <li> This is by far the very best item or service I have ever had done to my Flintstone feet. They look amazing and the callus&#x27; are not coming back like after a pedicure. I have Hoda and Kathy Lee to thank for finding Baby Foot</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said it would. Shed all that dead skin... kind of made me sick when I saw it. My feet are SO soft and lovely now though.&lt;br /&gt;As an everyday wearer of uncomfortable shoes, my feet suffered a lot of punishment and had gotten some pretty nasty calluses over the years. Its crazy that one product was able to undo all of that and make them like new!</li>
    <li> After following the product&#x27;s directions (as well as the advice of fellow Amazon reviewers), this didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as advertised. There was some peeling on the soles, but not much.</li>
    <li> Excellent results and lasts over a month</li>
    <li> My feet peeled for days and felt brand new once they were done. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It  removed the rough skin from my heels and  the small calluses my husband developed on his feet from playing basketball.  I intend to order several more and make holiday baskets for friends and family.</li>
    <li> The BF and I used these last night. We took a shower, pre-pre-moistening our feet. Then we did a 15 minute soak in water with epsom salt. We wore the booties for an hour then washed our feet. I am so curious to see how this goes. My feet still smell lovely today, which is a perk, if nothing else. He and I both deal with stinky feet, so I am really hoping this helps combat that for us. His feet are way worse than mine when talking about dry skin, but I have some rough heels and balls of my feet from running and wearing high heels almost every day to work. I will post an update once the peeling process is underway.&lt;br /&gt;*******Here we are 1 week later. MAJOR peeling has been happening. We soaked our feet 2 days after the treatment and the BF&#x27;s feet were already peeling. Mine started about 4 days in. My feet sweat a lot when I run, and I think this has helped along the peeling process. Yes, I have still been able to wear open toe shoes and sandals. You just have to spend a little time removing dead skin after a shower. My heels and the balls of my feet are by no means baby soft where the skin has peeled. I think those areas were just too rough to begin with. However, overall, my feet are smoother and it got rid of some tough callouses on my toes from running. I need to closely inspect the BF&#x27;s feet to see how his look. Overall, I think this was a worthwhile purchase. Based on the reviews, it clearly works differently for different people. If you didn&#x27;t have bad feet to begin with, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see good results.</li>
    <li> This product works just as it said it would. Its awesome. From walking around on cement around the pool my heels were quite rough and cracked. Once I went thru the peel phase my feet are incredibly soft,  especially the heels.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. A must!</li>
    <li> It works, which totally surprised me.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!! It was amazing and so worth it!! I checked out the YouTube reviews as well!!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite so sure about this product but then on the fifth day after use WOW!&lt;br /&gt;Skin began to peel off and now I have soft Baby feet!</li>
    <li> great buy, great service</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Wish it didbg</li>
    <li> Amazing! My feet are really soft like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have always had tough calluses on my feet and heels and have never found a product that works well.  I&#x27;ve tried many expensive creams, but frankly hate having to put it on every night, especially when the effect is minimal.  I have every scrub/foot file imaginable and have an array of callus removers.  I have regular pedicures and found a master pedicurist that really works on the calluses and makes my heels feel better....for a little while, but within a couple of weeks, my feet are rock hard again.  So, I decided to try Baby Foot.  I did soak my feet in water first since I&#x27;m a tough case.  At first I thought this product didn&#x27;t work, after a week or so I had some minimal flaking on the tops of my feet where the skin is already soft.  I&#x27;d given up but then, around 2 weeks....HOLY COW, it was like I had some kind of skin disease!  My feet peeled like crazy.  I didn&#x27;t read the instructions very well so after showers I scrubbed the hard calluses with my ped-egg (you are not suppose to do that) but it didn&#x27;t seem to cause a problem.  My feet have never been so soft and they look great!  There is still some slight thickness to the skin at the heel and balls of my feet but it is soft.  I suspect a second application will get most of this.  A word of warning.....my feet peeled for well over a week and they looked horrible.  I would not do this during sandal weather and would suggest using this 3-4 weeks before a warm weather vacation unless you want to scare everyone off.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best thing I could have done for my feet! I LOVE this product! After using baby foot, I will NEVER go back to a salon for a pedicure EVER again! I google searched what this stuff does and the pictures are real. First my feet looked very dry and I could see the skin cracking after a few days the dry skin started flaking and around the 5th or 6th day it started peeling. It also helps to soak your feet everyday to help the process. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft in a long time. I started mine on March 13th and my feet are still soft. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> It works! Be patient - took 2 days after treatment for skin to peel but now feet are soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Does remove some of the hard skin, but I will have to retreat some of the more difficult areas. Good idea for a product, though!</li>
    <li> I used Baby Foot exactly as instructed.  My feet were very bad and the product did not work at all!  Very disappointed and I feel it was a total waste of my money!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I first thought my calluses on my feet were too tough to get through. But as promised on day 7 the skin was peeling away! This is 100 times better than a pedicure!!</li>
    <li> I would and have ordered again. You really need about 10 days for all the peeling to finish.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much and allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I bought baby foot peel because of the before and after photos I was seeing online, the product reviews on amazon and also how many people blogged about it on their personal blogs.&lt;br /&gt;I am a distance runner and I have pretty nasty feet. I get a lot of thick calluses on my heels and around my toes from running. In the summer, my heels crack. Baby Foot peel worked, it peeled lots of skin off my feet and my heels are in much better condition. I might do another peel in a couple of weeks to really get it all off. It was awesome. For it to work best, it&#x27;s imperative that you soak your feet daily and scrub off the skin. Also, leave the peel on for 2 hours, not one.&lt;br /&gt;If you want any more information or my before/after pictures, I blogged about it. Rather than me retyping everything, you can check out the blog entry at igotbirds dot com/tried-tested-baby-foot-peel-gross-amazing</li>
    <li> I followed the directions. Nothing happened, except I lost $20 and got stuck on my couch for over an hour, unable to walk in the plastic boot thingies. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I so, so, so wanted this product to work as well as all the reviews said it would. I soaked my feet for half an hour before using it and then soaked my feet in the little booties for 2 hours. My feet peeled a bit, and it&#x27;s better than nothing, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as dramatic as everyone said it would be. It was easy to use, but I have some serious calluses on my feet. I&#x27;m disappointed that my feet aren&#x27;t baby soft, but it was a worthwhile experiment.</li>
    <li> Great works just like the demo. I have purchased several times.  Much better than a pedicure from the salon at 35.00/</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Love what it did to my feet.</li>
    <li> I had so much confidence in the reviews for Baby Foot that I bought 4 to also give to friends.  Well the product did make my feet feel smoother, but so much of the dead skin did not come off.  I religiously followed directions.  So now I am going to try it for a second time since I have additional product anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Day-Now NOT Disappointed in OKC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews where you need to soak your feet to actually get the sink to come off.  So last night I filled a dishpan with hot water and soaked my feet for 1 hour. Well it worked!! Had I done this before the using the product and after,  my results would have been much better.  It was amazing how 8 days after using the product with little results, that soaking made such a difference.  When I took a shower this morning additional skin came off.  I am now pleased with the appearance of feet, especially the heels.</li>
    <li> My feet are greatly improved.  I had cracks in my heels that were really ugly and now they are gone.  The peeling wasn&#x27;t too bad and I had feared that my feet would itch like crazy, but they didn&#x27;t.  I still have a few rough spots, and may try this again in a month or two.  Overall, I really liked it.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hopes were too high after reading other reviews, but I didn&#x27;t have the success that others have. I followed the directions exactly and after 5 days, my feet started peeling, but mostly in areas where it didn&#x27;t need to peel, like the tops of my feet. My calluses didn&#x27;t  see much improvement at all, and that is what I was hoping for. I&#x27;ve seen other users say that they soaked their feet prior to using and if I try this again, I will certainly do that first. but I&#x27;m still on the fence whether or not to spend more money and try it again.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions but it didn&#x27;t see much skin flake off.  I think you have to purchase several to make it do what it advertises that it does.  I replaced this with an Emjoi Micro Pedi and it did a great job using it the first time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how it would feel...or even if it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My particular package arrived with a leak.  So, when I pulled the &amp;#34;socks&amp;#34; out of the tin foil package, there was product ooze everywhere.  There would be no way I could put these on and sit on my cough while I waited.  I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it so...I sat in my tub and put on the booties and waited.  A very uncomfortable 30 minutes, I waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, it worked.  After about a day and a half, my feet started peeling (no pain, whatsoever).  It took about 5 days total, to peel completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is, even before my feet had completely peeled, I was already getting rough skin back on the parts that started peeling on day 1.  After about a week, my feet were almost completely back to the way they were before.  :o(  That was a lot of money to spend for a week&#x27;s worth of smooth (ish) feet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing. It&#x27;s similar to when you have a suntan that is peeling. My feet peeled fully for almost two weeks though so if you have an event, definitely give yourself enough time. I only wish it lasted longer but the nature of feet... they can&#x27;t stay soft for long. It does make upkeep much easier. Really great find.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!  Do NOT let any of the liquid gel inside the bootie touch anything except your feet.  I accidentally grazed the gold-tone finish on my bathtub spout and it immediately ate away the finish.  Just be careful.  Hope it is worth the $25.00 plus cost of new spigot and possibly plumber.&lt;br /&gt;Too soon to know if it works but will give it 5 stars for ease of use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical...2 days into the peeling process I stress this is not for someone with OCD! I can&#x27;t stop peeling...my feet feel amazing and let me tell you after years of neglect and being on my feet as a nurse...I truly believed there was no hope for my dry, cracked heels! Think again my fellow nasty foot friends! Wish I took pictures! I will def be reordering if my feet ever need this again!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty dang amazing when you find a product that delivers precisely all it promises.  This one does just what it says!</li>
    <li> It did what it said it would do, but I need something else.  My feet were not terribly calloused, but this didn&#x27;t get as much off as I was hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peeling began on day 3.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product since I have pretty thick calluses, but this product worked better than any pedicure I have ever gotten at a spa.  It was completely painless, my feet looked 100% better within a week, and it was cheaper than getting a spa pedicure.  That having been said, here are a few tips that I found that helped me get optimal results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Soak your feet in plain warm water before putting on the plastic booties.  Soak them for at least 15 minutes (longer if your feet are really rough, like mine were.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Find a spot to sit in where you plan to hang out for awhile before you put the booties on.  Once they are on, they are really slippery and it is very hard to walk around.  Gather up all of the stuff you will want/need before you open the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Open the booties and put them on one at a time.  The gel inside tends to leak out if you open the package and then lay the bootie down.  This mess can be avoided by putting one bootie on before cutting the second one open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Once the booties are on, put a thick pair of socks over the booties.  This holds the bootie on more securely and helps the gel penetrate your calluses more deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The package says to leave the product on for only 30 minutes (I have seen on other reviews that some packages recommend 1-2 hours.)  To get the best results, decide how bad your calluses are, and then leave the booties on for the amount of time you need.  If you have nice, pretty feet, you won&#x27;t need to leave it on for more than an hour.  If you have nasty thick calluses like I did, you will want to leave the booties on longer.  I left the booties on for 6 hours with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) When it is time to take the booties off, wash your feet thoroughly with warm soapy water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Your feet will start to feel tight, like your skin is very dry.  This is totally normal and is part of the process.  DO NOT PUT LOTION ON - this will stop the peeling process and will defeat the whole purpose of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Your feet will start peeling within 3-7 days, and will keep shedding dead skin for at least a week.  This is normal.  Do not apply lotion, or it will stop the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) As tempting as it may be, do not manually peel the skin off if it is not yet peeling.  This can damage the healthy skin underneath the dead skin.  Trust me, the dead skin will come off all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) Each person is different.  Some shed skin in small pieces, while others have entire sheets of skin come off at once.  Be patient with the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11) I applied this treatment to my feet about 5 days ago, and my feet are about 85% done peeling.  If you are doing this to prepare for a wedding/cruise/special event, give yourself ample time for the peeling process to complete.  Don&#x27;t apply this treatment just a few days before a big event, or you may still have ugly feet on the big day.  Give yourself at least two weeks for the process to be complete.process and will defeat the whole purpose of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Your feet will start peeling within 3-7 days, and will keep shedding dead skin for at least a week.

    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. Although the peeling was gross the end result is worth it. My feet have always been rough and cracky. Now they are smooth and soft. Totally amazing.</li>
    <li> It worked just like it said. After I used it, I noticed mild peeling the next day followed by major peeling over the next week. My feet kept peeling for almost 2 weeks. It got really embarrassing cos when i went for a pedicure, I had to explain to the lady that I didnt have some sort of foot condition and even then, I don&#x27;t think she believed me. Would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Baby foot was amazing! I do not remember the last time my feet were this soft. It superseded my expectations.</li>
    <li> It does take a layer of skin off your feet, leaving them feeling softer.  But, it does not seem to work any better on calloused areas of the feet versus softer areas of the feet.  Also, your feet are basically a gross, shedding mess for a week.  I get better results being able to concentrate on callouses with a scrubber and a callous-removing gel.</li>
    <li> It works just the way it says, but be prepared for lots and lots of peeling. I had to sleep in socks for 3 days but afterward, my feet were so soft. Definitely soak your feet before you put on the booties.</li>
    <li> This actually works!  I started peeling on day 5 and continued to for about 2 weeks.  My feet are so smooth, however my heels are still really bad.  They are definitely better, but I will probably do another round and see if I can get my heels soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  It removed al of the cracked, thickened skin on my feet, and revealed beautiful, pink new skin underneath.  My advise, make sure you soak your feet first, and after the treatment, soak them each day for 15 minutes or so, and the results will be great.  I spent time in a pool and hot tub, and I think it really helped.</li>
    <li> I was slightly skeptical with these, so I knew not to get my hopes too high. After a week and a half, I didn&#x27;t see anything so I was starting to lose hope. However, about 2 1/2 weeks in, I was amazed at what I was seeing. Every bit of dead skin peeled off gradually for about a week. It was messy, so be prepared! When I got out of the shower and walked around on carpet, skin would peel off. When I took socks off, skin would come off. Be careful about where you will be when you plan to do it. I didn&#x27;t know how long it would take and I ended up being at someone else&#x27;s house for my holiday vacation, and had to be careful about where I took my socks off, and make sure I was careful not to walk around barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;I am about to buy another pack!</li>
    <li> My feel peeled a little. I don&#x27;t know, maybe they weren&#x27;t in bad enough shape to completely peel. It is an expensive product for 1 use, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Started working within one week. All the dry skin is gone. All my friends are going to try it. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This product does EXACTLY what it says. Its a great product and gives wonderful results. The price is amazing and beats a spa pedicue on any given day. I love my new baby soft feet!!!</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet prior and it has been 9 days. My feet haven&#x27;t even begun to flake. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions exactly. So far, no peeling at all. My feet are the same. Waste of $22 and mostly the many hours of soaking.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t touch the heel callouses but otherwise worked as it said.  A good pedicure definitely beats the results I have.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing.  The large pieces of peeling skin was disturbing but at the end, I had a new set of feet.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome results!!! I was skeptical by day four and on day five the party began. Peeling lasted for about a week, now I have baby feet! Just soak your feet before applying treatment and every other day after, which is optional. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to shedding years off my feet but it just didn&#x27;t happen. I did get some peeling but not much. I am thinking that I already do a good job of removing dead skin, so there just wasn&#x27;t that much to get rid of. If your feet are really gnarly I bet this will work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with the product... This is the 2nd time trying this product with so far AGAIN no results...lol</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie, my feet are a challenge. I&#x27;m eight days out from application, and while my feet are peeling like crazy, it&#x27;s just happening to the smooth parts that didn&#x27;t really need help in the first place. This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work on thicker calloused spots. They remain just as they were before the treatment.</li>
    <li> Preparation was easy.  Treatment time passes quickly with the TV playing.  After a few days my feet are scale free and feel softer than they have for years.  I&#x27;ll certainly use this stuff again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have problems with thick skin build up on my feet.  I saw Baby Foot on a local TV show so I thought I would give it a try.  I wore the booties for 1 1/2 hours then washed my feet as instructed.  It took 8 days for some dead skin to peel.  While it took off a thin layer of  dry skin the majority was left.  I have not had further peeling since.  This product might be ok for someone who gets regular pedicures to maintain your feet.</li>
    <li> This product was expensive, and did not work.  The only skin that peeled in 7 days is one layer from the top of my foot where my sandals rubbed.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me....heard so much good reviews but sadly I got hardly I inch of shedding. ...guess I&#x27;ll try the at home remedies</li>
    <li> My nasty crusty feet peeled revealing soft new skin. The heel and toe cracks healed once the thick skin was gone. Took ten days and requires soaking daily but was worth it.</li>
    <li> i purchased baby foot on a tuesday and received it on friday. i did the application on saturday. when i opened the box, the product wasn&#x27;t the one in the picture, it was the one with the japanese writing on it. i didn&#x27;t mind because the japanese version contains more amounts of the products and you are instructed to leave the gel packs on for a longer period of time. it is the following thursday and my feet are just now starting to peel. the peeling looks nothing like the pictures i have seen. i was looking forward to that honestly (lol). but at least there is some peeling! after four days had passed, i was worried this product wasn&#x27;t going to work for me, so i took some of the other reviewers advice and soak my feet in warm water for 30 minutes. after five minutes had passed, i took at foot sponge, wet it and began softly scrubbing my feet in circular motions. i then noticed some peeling happening (CA-CHING!). i will continue to do this everyday and i will come back and update you guys (if i can figure out how) saturday or sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: it has been a total of 16 days since i put the gel packs on. my feet are smooth, but there is still some problem areas. i plan on buying another pack next month and doing it again to see if the rest of the dead and dry skin will come off,</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product every once in a while to exfoliate her feet. It removes all the dead skin and calluses from her feet and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Hello my name Geraldine Haywood To everyone who has doubts about this products let me tell you it work just like&lt;br /&gt;the products says I started using mines on 8/2/2103 by 8/5/2013 I saw were my feet has began to peel its 8/8/2013 I started to really see it doing it work my feet is peeling like crazy I tell you its really really working only thing is that my arm and back itch a little and it do burn a little under my feet but not were you can&#x27;t stand it I soak my feet twice a day in plain water I don&#x27;t dry them roughly I pat my feet dry I did just what the direction says.If I was ask to try a another products other then Baby Foot I would say NO its better then going to the shop were people putting razor on my feet I rather wait the 2 weeks out again THANK YOU BABY FOOT GOD BLESS THE MAKER PLEASE LOSE ALL DOUBTS THIS WORK WELL KNOW I&#x27;M SAYING THIS FOR KNOW SELL REP I&#x27;M FROM THE HOOD STOP SPENDING MONEY IN SHOP AND GIVE THIS PRODUCT A SHOT YOU WANT REGRET IT PEACE BE WITH ALL&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, and I know it didn&#x27;t work for some... But it totally worked for me! I did not soak my feet before, I know others have. I just took a shower and throughly washed them with a wash cloth. I put on the booties, taped them up and put socks over. THE SOCKS HELP! Because you cannot walk around in these things, it&#x27;s difficult. However, you can stand in place because I baked cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product. I washed my feet and forgot about them for a day. And then day two, I thought &amp;#34;oh man, I wonder if it will work&amp;#34;?? After I showered that night, I saw some peeling in the toes. Big pieces!! In between, and around the nail. Then day three, it really started to happen. I&#x27;m only on day three now, but wanted to share because I&#x27;m happy it worked!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG pieces of dead skin all around my feet, peeling off in stripes!!! I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s all gone and to get a pedicure, I&#x27;ll have the best feet ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I may never go back.  This stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to friends.  If they made other exfoliates I would buy also.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. I use it every 3-4 months. Leaves my foot nice and smooth. recommended by my doctor</li>
    <li> It did make my feet peel .. but it didn&#x27;t really effect the troublesome areas for any length of time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. If you have very dry cracked skin it just makes your feet SO much worse</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money. My feet are much smoother than they been in a very long time. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, overall. It worked well for me. I will probably have to do two treatments to really get my feet to where I want them, but my feet were pretty bad off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had horribly rough feet that would leave scratches on my legs. My heels had deep cracks. This didn&#x27;t make everything perfect, but it sure was a good start. I used it on a Friday night and my feet started peeling by Monday. The whole process took about 9 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely made a difference on my rough feet. While not exactly &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; smooth, they are much more presentable and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Was pretty easy to use; I wore an old pair of my husband&#x27;s socks over the bags and that made it easier to keep the bags in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Messy! When your feet start peeling, you almost have to wear socks. For a week, I really couldn&#x27;t wear strappy sandals or anything that showed my feet.&lt;br /&gt;My bed was full of dead skin because I always take my socks off in my sleep. So, that was kinda gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take a nice rough washcloth and scrub them while your are in the shower, it will hasten the skin removal.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to resist peeling the skin, but you should try...because it is definitely possible to peel too deep and wind up with a wound.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me. No peeling of callous skin.</li>
    <li> This product works great!! it takes 10-14 days for the peeling to take place but it does work. I used the motorized Ped-Egg to help remove the peeling skin and smooth out the skin but my feet look 100% better- even the top of my feet and my toes.. It has been about a month and I am going to give them a second treatment!</li>
    <li> Save your money.  This product is worthless.  I followed the directions completely and NOTHING!</li>
    <li> I love Baby Foot!  I put them on one evening and waited an hour as directed.  At first I didn&#x27;t think they were working...boy was I wrong!!  By the third day I felt like I had &amp;#34;skin socks&amp;#34; on.  Sounds strange but it&#x27;s a strange feeling!  My feet peeled completely and I had to wear real socks around the house to avoid leaving bits of peeling skin on the floor.  After a week I had the softest feet ever.  I immediately ordered more.  I recommend it to everyone who loves having beautiful feet...and especially to those who have fugly, dry, callousy feet!</li>
    <li> It worked like a charm. It started to peel about 4-6 days later, I almost thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me but it did, and my feet was very soft once all the dead skin had peeled off. That process took about a good 2-3 weeks but was worth it. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff was awesome!  Did exactly what it said. I did peel for 2 weeks, my heels were the worst! They look awesome now! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It did take a layer of skin off my feet but didn&#x27;t do much for my heels.</li>
    <li> Yes your feet peel but after your feet are the same as when you started. This product does nothing on the calluses. So really it&#x27;s just causing your feet to peel. I see no difference before or after.... Not worth the money and definitely not worth the time of having peeling feet for a week and a half especially in the summer. I thought it would be worth it but then I realized it wasn&#x27;t. Spend the money for a pedicure at least they remove the calluses.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Do not do a week and a half before a big event.  It takes about four days to even start peeling and then peels for about a week. Loved the results.</li>
    <li> Too bad that *zero* stars is not an option. I got these for my daughter who has severely calloused feet. She used them as directed on Monday. Today is Sunday -- a full week later -- and there is no peeling at all. Actually there is no effect at all. It&#x27;s a complete sham. I would like my money back.</li>
    <li> i have used this before and it works great! Be ready for peeling, but that&#x27;s what you wNt for smooth feet.</li>
    <li> i have heels that tend to crack during the summer, although i do get monthly pedicures and treat my feet when in the shower it doesnt seem to help.  i bought this product after reading an advertisement in a British Magazine for a similar product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only really wanted my heels to be treated, but you have to do the whole foot.  yes the peel does start to work after 5 days or so, per other reviews.  firstly it was the underside of my feet, and around the toes, i started to look like a snake - shedding its skin.  my heels really could do with another treatment but hopefully the pedicure i have booked this week will take care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would say the only downside is the tops of my feet peeling and they are still peeling 11 days later.  i put cream on my feet and sleep in socks hoping to moisturize them and the peeling not to be so noticeable.  looks like i have a few more days to go though..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think i will order this again in a couple of months, scoop some of the product out - just apply it to my heels and save the rest for another time (like some of the nail salons do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so basically YES it works, i just don&#x27;t like the tops of my feet peeling.</li>
    <li> Helped but I think my feet need a second application. If you gave rough skin and a lot of thick dead skin you will need a second application</li>
    <li> This took a few days before it began to peel.  For almost a week after it started I was constantly peeling off skin.  But the results are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know it worked this good!  It sThis tarted working on my left foot first, since that foot was worse for whatever reason.  A couple of days later my right foot started peeling.  That part is kinda gross, but after 10 days you really have baby feet, just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Awesome pedicure product! Loved it! Will defiantly be getting more!</li>
    <li> my feet were in terrible shape. It did help some but not as much as I had hoped. But, again, my feet were really bad. I may try a second treatment.</li>
    <li> Although the skin on both the bottoms and tops of my feet peeled tremendously, I didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference in the softness of my feet. Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, especially given the price.</li>
    <li> Great product use it a few times a year to get rid of serious hard and cracked heels.</li>
    <li> It works!!!! Follow instructions, not hard and see the transformation!  I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; after use just took regular shower but I did read that soaking makes a bigger difference...</li>
    <li> this stuff is the greatest.....works exactly as claimed ....my feet goes from jagged to smooth in about 7 days. crazy!</li>
    <li> Omg this was amazing!  Definitely will buy these again!</li>
    <li> It was great.  Would buy again. Also bought two for gifts.  Would use in March before sandal season as feet do peel!!</li>
    <li> FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.SOAKED EVERY DAY 30 MINUTES. ONLY SKIN THAT PEELED ARCH OF FOOT AND TOP OF FOOT .WOULD NOT RECOMMENT THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This did not work as advertised. I was not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Works great! 4th day and peeling started. Definitely soak your feet every day to help the process a long. Still in the process but the exposed fresh skin is really soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product, It&#x27;s just my skin on my feet is so bad.  It didn&#x27;t feel like a baby feet.</li>
    <li> No luck here. Did as directed and no results.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these for me and my mother each. We soaked our feet for an hour before then and then did the treatment. 4 days later this happened to her!! My mother has never gotten a pedicure and never kept up with pumicing her feet so this happened. My feet were a lot less dramatic but still peeled a LOT- my calluses are peeling right off</li>
    <li> Wife used this and worked amazingly - if you can commit to the time and process you WILL see the results everyone mentions</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, it had been about 3 days and only minimal peeling was happening on the top of my foot. But now they are peeling like crazy. The skin underneath is super soft, I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s done and I have smooth feet again!</li>
    <li> May have just been a fluke but my booties arrived leaking into the packaging and did not work at all. I&#x27;ve used this product several times before but did not work at all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased again and product was not damaged and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I read the comments posted, saw the pictures of how this product worked, and immediately ordered it.  I used it as directed and within five days I saw dramatic results!  My feet were soft, softer than I thought possible.  This is a fantastic product and I have recommended it to friends.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;m still peeling a little after a week. My calluses are pretty thick and scaly, and Baby Foot took care of all that! I did not peel on top of my feet, but all over the bottoms and toes. I soaked before and just about every day until the peeling has mostly subsided.</li>
    <li> Ruined my feet- worse than before i started</li>
    <li> This is the greatest.  After a few days my feet started peeling and were so smooth.  It was kinda strange having your feet peel but the results were worth the peeling.  After a few days I used a washcloth to help the peeling along. If you are like me and feel that your feet are too ugly to get a pedi give it a try and then go get a pedi!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice now and it really works wonders.  I followed some of the previous comments and soaked before applying the foot bags.  Then after a few days I would soak daily to speed up the peeling which works well.  It is actually a miracle for your feet and I would recommend it to everyone.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  Oh and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have to admit after I first used it I thought nothing was going to happen but after 4 days I noticed a change. My feet started peeling and I was embarrassed to show my feet even to my husband. After all the peeling my feet are so soft and feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I have heels that always require extra time and attention when I get a pedicure.  They tend to be downright nasty!  I was pretty excited about trying the Baby Foot Peel after reading about it.  Turns out it was almost as wonderful as I&#x27;d hoped.  Easy to use, I just followed the directions.  Soaked my feet, stayed in the booties an hour, rinsed it off, and went about my business.  After 4-5 days I was thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to work because I saw nothing different except my feet seemed dryer, but then the magic happened and they peeled like crazy (I&#x27;d give myself a good 2 weeks between using this product and wearing sandals).  My heels are not pristine, but they are WAY better.  I&#x27;m planning on using it again sometime soon.  Already passed the good news on to several friends.</li>
    <li> This really works as described!</li>
    <li> Loved it! And it was nice to have an excuse to sit down and be still for a while when the booties were on.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money. I&#x27;m a runner so my feet are terrible and this product worked exactly how it said it would.</li>
    <li> Read through all the reviews, including the helpful one from the girl with 2 friends who tried this with varying results depending on if they took baths.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet before using this product, used it for the recommended hour, and made sure I soaked my feet periodically after use. It worked really well!&lt;br /&gt;The thick, dry skin around my heels just sort of crumbled off if you used a wet washcloth on it in the bath. The thinner skin on the bottoms of my feet peeled off, sort of like a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remaining skin is (so far!) much smoother and less rough than the old, but I am going to do another dose shortly because i feel that the effective ingredients didn&#x27;t penetrate into the thickest skin on my heels - probably because it was much thicker than the other skin. I&#x27;m really excited about this product!</li>
    <li> Works so good.  My feet as brand new.  I don&#x27;t know how I got through summer without it.  Goodbye pricey pedicures!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida, sandals all year..(only the kind with the heels covered) always working on my feet via pedicures, ped egg, razors,etc.  Nothing worked until I tried Baby Foot.  Did it last week..nothing happened until the 5th day..then snake city!!  I shed very thick large areas of skin for about 4 days, then just mild flaking.  I&#x27;m amazed, and thrilled...telling everyone about it!!  I&#x27;ll do it again in a few months to maintain this wonderful look and feel..thank you Baby Foot!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after falling for a cheaper imitation that completely ruined my feet.  This peel started working within just days and my feet are nearly back to normal.  I&#x27;ll never buy anything else again.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and am obsessed with having pretty feet.  This is an amazing product!  I am rough on my feet and have giant callouses.  I did not think this would work as well as it did.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my feet are.  I love how it worked on my toes.  it&#x27;s hard to &#x27;pedicure&#x27; toes so this was great for getting the tops and middle of my toes looking smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again.  I will also be buying one for my husband.  He is super ticklish and I have not been able to give him a pedicure without getting kicked in the face.  Hopefully this will be the first year I will not be embarrassed by his feet at the pool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I should also note that I am allergic to all kinds of products: scents, lotions, chemicals....and this did not bother me at all.  I was more nervous about having a reaction than anything else and I am happy to say I had no hives, rashes or itching (other than the mild itching that comes with the dead skin peeling).</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed since I thought this product was the answer to my problem feet. I read a lot of reviews and followed package directions exactly. My feet are now drier than ever, so they actually look worse, but no peeling at all.  I&#x27;m happy for the people who are in love with this product, but I threw away $25 away and wasted my time. If I see any results in the next 2 days, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I reader advised that I soak my feet for an hour or more and that did activate the peeling process. It&#x27;s now been eight days since the application and there is an improvement, not as dramatic as I had hoped for, but it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect instant results, Do expect to spend some time, pre-soaking, sitting still and waiting for the stuff to start working. But I have not found anything any better before re-entering the sandal zone for summer.</li>
    <li> I used the product according to package instructions, soaked feet left on for 30 minutes, washed feet. I should have read more of the reviews on this site because I didn&#x27;t know people had left it on for several hours. So I retrieved the booties from the trash (they were the only thing in there) and re-applied them for an hour. Three days later, only saw minor flaking after soaking my feet for 5 minutes a day. I decided to do a very long soak (1 hour) the 4th day and everything changed. My feet were peeling and massive amounts of dry skin came off. Did another hour soak the next day and my feet were looking good. Nothing left except a few callouses on the ball of my feet.  The next day I used my ped egg to get rid of them and they came off very easily because of the softening and now my feet look great! I will use this product every few months to maintain the results.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions, from soaking my feet before putting on the booties, to wearing socks and shoes daily afterwards (they&#x27;ll stay too dry in flip flops). On the fifth day, dry skin was peeling away like crazy. i Used a pumice in the shower that night, and the next day (sorry for the visual),  I almost needed to vacuum everywhere in the room that I had been. Today is one week exactly since I used Baby Foot-my feet have not been smooth like this for years.</li>
    <li> I used this product exactly as directed, and also soaked my feet an hour daily to make sure that I maximized the results.  After spending $25 and countless hours with my feet in a foot bath, I got some flaking from the top and bottom of my feet that took using a Ped Egg to get off.  Frankly, I could have just soaked my feet and used the Ped Egg and gotten the same results.  There are no Baby Feet over here...unless we&#x27;re talking about a baby gorilla.  I&#x27;ll spend my $25 on a a pedicure next time.  It was worth a shot, but this product definitely has mediocre or no results for a large number of people.</li>
    <li> Left my feet smooth and soft.  Be sure and soak your feet prior to using, and then daily--you&#x27;ll be amazed when the dead skin starts peeling off your feet.</li>
    <li> used these before the winter started, got my feet nice and smooth, now that winters just about over, and its flip flop season, will need to do it again to get nice, smooth, shiny feet!  the smell is VERY pleasant, thought it didnt seem like lavendar to me, more of some kind of fruity almost citrus-y scent.  i put these booties on, put some socks over it, to make sure all the stuff inside is always in contact w my skin, and sat back on the couch and watched tv.  took it off and rinsed when i was supposed to, and watched as the skin peeled off days later.  yeah, it can get pretty gross, w all that skin peeling off, but i&#x27;m always picking at my skin, so nothing new to see here.  don&#x27;t use it on cracked skin, it&#x27;ll burn, burn the way peroxide burns an open wound.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. I soaked my feet before application and daily afterwards for one week. I was so disappointed. My skin basically just turned drier and flaked a little - not at all the results I expected. I won&#x27;t purchase this again in the future - waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work.  I followed the directions exactly. (Didn&#x27;t really notice the lavendar scent though) and the dead skin began peeling off my feet in about a week.  It took about a week for all of it to flake off so I would advice doing this at a time that you aren&#x27;t planning to wear sandals or go barefoot for a week or so.  I also ended up wering socks to bed to avoid the big pieces of callous and dead skin between the sheets.  My feet ended up perfectly smooth and baby soft.  The effect lasted for about two months and I&#x27;ve ordered to reuse again.  My husband was so impressed that he&#x27;s decided to try it as well.</li>
    <li> My mother, sister and I each tried this a few months ago and felt silly about all the hype. After soaking our feet in water, then the product, we were tired of sitting! And the next day- nothing happened! It took a few days to get started, but then the peeling did not stop! All kinds of gross dead skin was sloughing away day and night. It took almost 2 weeks for my new &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34; to appear, but once they did- It was awesome! So soft and callous free!&lt;br /&gt; We used the product in October and now, in April (6 months later), my feet are still pretty soft. I plan to use the product again in June, right before sandal season starts.&lt;br /&gt;This was a fun, useful product for girls to use together!</li>
    <li> It took about a week to see the results.  The peeling took also another week. However, the product worked and I will purchase this again as my feet are near normal again.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says.  My dry, cracked feet are, simply, soft as a baby foot after use.  As other reviewers have recommended, I soaked my feet daily to accelerate the process and had peeling in less than 72 hours.</li>
    <li> I got this because of recommendation and youtube video. I put my feet into the socks for over the hour as instructions are simple and easy to follow. and waited, after 5 days I expected to see the old skin and thick skin to fall off. Nope. I wasted the $25 and the week of expectations. save your money. Buy a pumice store at your local pharmacy and shape away before showering or a bath.</li>
    <li> I saw this on other web site and decide to give it a try.  Nothing happen for about 10 days after I wore them as instructed, then my skin started peeling off.  The peeling process took about 10 days.  It did remove quite a bit of dead skin.</li>
    <li> It peels but I thoufht it was extreme for my feet. Nothing a daily moisturizer couldnt handle.nit was also disguting and caused sensitivy for newly exposed skin so dont plan on running anytime soon. Took a week to work and peeled another week. Also trashes your polish so dont do after a fresh pedicure!,</li>
    <li> MY MOM LOVE IT ,I&#x27;LL BUY MORE FOR HER</li>
    <li> I really really like product I will be ordering this product again works wonders on my bed rock feet....thanks baby feet</li>
    <li> My second set of Baby Foot. It really works. Be sure to soak your feet, if only for 15 minutes a day. Rough skin just sloughs off.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My feet are like they were when I was a kid again! I didn&#x27;t quite understand exactly what I was getting myself into though,  I knew my feet would shed off old skin, but I didn&#x27;t realize it would remove the entire top layer of skin over a two week period.  Not only the bottoms of my feet, but also the top and all of my toes.  If you have to where sandals wait until you don&#x27;t because it gets pretty gross. Read the instructions carefully so you know what to expect and how to get the most out of the process and you&#x27;ll have brand new feet in the end!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work,  not even a little.  followed all directions and didn&#x27;t do a thing.  Looks like I fell for it again..</li>
    <li> I caved and purchased this after my co-worker raved about it!!! I began using the product on Saturday morning, by Thursday I saw so change whatsoever.  Friday evening while in the shower i felt something under my foot thinking I stepped on something, when I looked there was a huge piece of skin falling off.  It is now almost 2 weeks and after alot of shedding my feet look beautiful!!!! I am very pleased with this producted and have already made my other friends buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Note, definitely soak feet every night for the best results.</li>
    <li> All my old skin peeled off effortlessly.  Salon pedis were a breeze!  Will def recommend!</li>
    <li> Meh. I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss in the 5 star reviews is about. It didn&#x27;t really work as well as they say, especially for the time and cost. I was hoping for something more effective and easier than a pumice stone. It was gross and fun and weird but not worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I soaked my feet before hand. Yes, I allowed the proper amount of time. Yes, my feet did peel but while the tops peels several times, the bottoms didn&#x27;t and that is where the toughest skin is. First, my skin didn&#x27;t start to peel for 6 days. When it did, some skin came off in hunks like the pictures show but mostly it peeled just like a moderately bad sunburn in fits and starts. Never did the really tough skin on my heels and on the calluses on my big toes ever really slough off. By the time the tops stopped peeling, the bottoms had been done for two weeks and hardened back up. Just not worth the price and the weeks and weeks of having seriously disgusting peeling tops of feet. (Posted by Dave&#x27;s wife, Becky)</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!  This really works!  Peels the dead skin off of your feet  in to reveal baby soft skin.  I&#x27;ve used it twice in the last year with perfect results.</li>
    <li> Most awesome product I have ever purchased!.. I had the crustiest feet ever!.. LOL!.. I have tried everything from Ped Eggs to foot creams to soften the dry skin on my feet and nothing worked!.. Baby Foot did what no other products could!.. If by chance you read a negative review of this product just know is a lie,  because this product is the BOMB!.. It has been over a month since I used Baby Foot and my feet are still silky smooth!.. It even took care of cuticles around my toes!.. I will definitely repurchase this product!</li>
    <li> So this stuff is nuts. I did the hour treatment and saw nothing for 4 days. I thought it was a bust. But day 5 i saw a little peeling. Then I got a call from my sister who told me it works better for people who soak for 30 mins every other day in hot water. I did that on the 5th day and HOLY SHAMOLEY!!! Skin was coming off my feet like crazy. But now day seven my feet are still peeling. It looks insane and is embarrassing to wear sandals in public due to my feet looming like they belong on a decaying zombie. I would recommend this product for use in fall and winter months to avoid scaring strangers.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This product really does the job.  Yes, it is messy once your feet starts peeling but it&#x27;s worth it.  The cracks on my feet are gone and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works</li>
    <li> Works great except on old, thick calluses. Second application a month or so later didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> The dry skin on my feet peeled off in layers. The bottoms of my feet were done peeling in a couple of days. Took almost a week for the tops to finish. I know it removed a lot of dead skin but my feet are still dry, I think that&#x27;s just how they are though. It wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had REALLY bad feet.  Very dry, plus I run and there were some crazy calluses.  I used this and had very little peeling after 2 weeks.  Another reviewer suggested that if you shower, instead of bathe, you won&#x27;t have as good results unless you soak your feet every couple days.  I do shower, but I also swim 4 times a week for at least an hour. I expected better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a 2nd application after 2 weeks.  4 days later, after I got out of the pool, I saw a lot of peeling.  It has continued to peel (though not even close to what the photos show) for several days.  Most of the skin on my feet is very nice.  I still have a bit of the calluses and some cracks on my heels, but they&#x27;re much better than when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make this a regular routine every few months.  Hopefully with that and my Ped-Egg, will get rid of the cracked heels and calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating a month after the peeling stopped:  I am VERY happy with this product.  I moisturize my skin whenever I get out of the shower or pool, and I am using the Ped Egg on my heals daily.  My feet are softer than they&#x27;ve ever been.  What needs to be noted here is that I&#x27;ve ALWAYS moisturized my feet - since I was in my early teens (I&#x27;m now 46), and they&#x27;ve never been soft enough where I haven&#x27;t been embarrassed to get a foot rub unless I&#x27;m wearing socks.  I still have cracks on my heels, even with the Ped Egg everyday.  But they don&#x27;t go deep, like they did before.  The calluses are gone after a couple weeks with the Ped Egg, but I also have taken a break from running, which is what causes the crazy calluses in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is being moved to my Must Have for my grooming routines.  In fact, I think I&#x27;m going to order my next application now, since I see they&#x27;re low on stock.</li>
    <li> Works!  Do read and follow the instructions especially the recommendation of staying seated and yes you should follow this advice as the gel is slippery and the booties are really just large plastic bags so you will slide around. I put a pair of socks over the plastic booties so I could move the short distance from the bathroom to my recliner, but it is certainly not something you want to walk around in. As others have pointed out after two days nothing and you don&#x27;t feel any difference. Peeling did not start till around the 5th day. First a thick layer from the bottom of the feet then a thin layer off the top of feet. The peeling continues for about a week and a half so keep that in mind when deciding when to do this as you will have terrible looking feet for that week and half so you probably have to keep them covered during the time period.</li>
    <li> My feet had some very minor peeling nearly 2 weeks after the treatment. The peeling was so minor as to be insignificant. I was hoping to get rid of my dry heel skin but only my insole peeled slightly. I have used Amlactin lotion for my feet before, and when used regularly it has helped my feet the most.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I was very disappointed in the results. I would not recommend anyone buy this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works - make sure you read all the reviews and use the daily soaking - best to use in the fall/winter when feet can have socks on during the &amp;#34;peeling process&amp;#34; -- I have extreme dry feet that crack and hurt this helps.</li>
    <li> The peeling feet is disgusting and just when you wonder what you got yourself into, you get the soft skin shining through and almost forget about how gross the peeling stage was.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly as printed.  I also took the advice of the other reviewer who suggested soaking your feet before and after application.  One full week later, I have noticed absolutely no change, no peeling, nothing.  I hope it works better for you!</li>
    <li> Applying the product is easy; the booties make it easy and mess-free.  Within a few days of using BabyFeet, my feet began to peel – much like skin does with sunburn.  It was a bit odd and maybe even disgusting, but it did not hurt at all.  It took maybe 5 days for the peeling to be done and the end result was mostly-smooth feet.  I was a bit disappointed that it didn’t smooth out my calluses more; it got the “easy” ones like my heel but did little for the hard one at the ball of my foot.  I found that my feet got extra sweaty the next few weeks and this is the only thing I can attribute it too.  Also, the effects of the product were short lived.  It does admit to this, however after peeling for 5 days and having nice feet for maybe 20 days – it just doesn’t seem worth it to me.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! I was one of those customers that thought everybody was making a big deal out of nothing. I tend to be a hard sell. So I bit the bullet and bought, hoping for the best. I soaked my feet for 30 minutes, then put the booties on as directed and left on for 1 hour. Day 1,2,3 nothing. And I&#x27;m thinking yep, just as I thought, all hype. But then day 4 hit and there is some slight peeling. Then day 5 there&#x27;s more this goes one for about 8-9 days. It was yucky to look at and you definitely don&#x27;t want to wear sandals during that time; but afterwards...oh baby! My feet are so soft now. I do have to be careful to moisturize at night and not run around barefoot all the time just to keep the feeling but solar so good. I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase. And so are my feet.</li>
    <li> Might just want to wait until sandal weather is over....  lots of skin peeling that takes place over several days.  Great results</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Crazy, but great gift my wife got me. Heavy walker and athlete, so I tend to build a tough callous.  This keeps my feet comfortable(to keep it in manly terms)</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased and used this product. Nothing compares when trying to rid the feet of unruly calluses.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping to over the seaes&lt;br /&gt;Thanks .. Recommended</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product you will ever buy.  Hard to describe in just a few words - watch the youtube video.  It is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy. Go watch the videos, it really works as advertised. You will be both disgusted and completely intrigued by the peeling that happens while your old scratchy, callousy, crappy old feet molt and soft, smooth new feet emerge. No joke.</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully! My feet were very bad. I did need to use this 2X, but the second time pulled the remainder of anything that was left. My feet are a bit tender, but that is my fault for using it too quickly from the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Japanese version better than the English version.</li>
    <li> After I  wasted 15 minutes soaking my feet I found out this product can not be used by nursing women. This warning is all over the product but not all over the internet. At least it&#x27;s expiration date is 2017 or I would have already sent this back. Let me also mention this product can not be used if you are pregnant, have open sores on feet/foot damage, using other foot products and if you are diabetic consult your doctor. They emphasize that natural ingredients yet this product is still not considered safe for some people, very misleading if you ask me.</li>
    <li> This product really works!!!! It does what it claims it will do. I now have baby feet.</li>
    <li> the product was delivered as expected and worked perfectly. I was shocked that it worked as well as it did. I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> This really works! Dead skin starts peeling fast! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought several of them. It works quite as what it said on the carton. However, the result can not last as long as what it promised. I guess it still has something to do with the individual&#x27;s feet. I would still buy this product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product it worked ok.  A few months later I tried it again.  I was very disappointed with the results.  My feet never fully peeled. I followed the same procedures both times.  Very inconsistent product.  Would NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it&#x27;s so gross what comes off your feet. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Works just as described, however it is up to you to maintain the exfoliation (only stays smooth about a couple of weeks afterward).</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!!  It took exactly 7 days for my feet to start peeling.  It&#x27;s a little gross when they do but hey isn&#x27;t that what you want.  I used it twice, 2 weeks apart and my feet feel wonderful.  I think the price is a little high but you do get what you pay for because it really works.  One thing I did when my feet started peeling was soak them in Epsom salt and then it was easier and cleaner to roll the skin off my feet.</li>
    <li> Amazing product - removed a ton of calloused skin.  I read reviews saying it was critical to soak feet for a good hour before using it and periodically until they begin to peel.  I did it before but forgot after.  The directions don&#x27;t stress pre-soaking and I suspect that folks who didn&#x27;t find it helpful didn&#x27;t know about this tip.  On day 3 it felt like I had a piece of paper stuck to the bottom of my foot, but it turned out to be a flapping piece of skin.  I was leaving a little trail of them!  I quickly put down a sheet and gently rubbed off all that was ready to be removed. Over the next couple of days a disgusting (but fascinating) amount of dead skin and callous sloughed off.  I had to keep on socks or I would have left trails all over the place.  The bad news is that I found out my callouses actually served a purpose.  Shortly after treatment I spent 2 different days working on physical projects that kept me on my feet a lot.  Both days I had on shoes that normally were very comfortable and supportive for this sort of activity - and both days my feet were very uncomfortable before the day was over. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just one of those delightful things we discover as we age, or if it was the Baby Foot treatment. I let my callouses grow back I could do those types of things in those same work shoes without discomfort.  So while I loved how my feet looked, lack of pain trumps pretty in my world so I won&#x27;t be using this again.  Well, maybe if there is a very special event coming up then I&#x27;ll just let my feet go back to the wild :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it a pretty high score because I think my reaction wasn&#x27;t standard and that most folks will be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet but the description is deceiving.  It&#x27;s really only one use on both feet not two</li>
    <li> Definitely peels the dead skin, as long as you remember to soak your feet every night for at least a week after use.  Since buying this product I have tried the Japanese version and like that MUCH better.  Not sure if the ingredients are different/stronger, but the Japanese version seemed to slough more skin off.</li>
    <li> Works!!! Nothing will leave your feet this soft. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this so happy u did</li>
    <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t get the spot I want it to get. I guess I will have to go to a doctor after all.</li>
    <li> amazing beauty product. Probably in my top 5. Works great. The only thing is that it&#x27;s a little gross having all the skin peel off your feet so I wouldn&#x27;t do it in the summer. Definitely need 2 weeks in socks!</li>
    <li> Works like crazy! I was skeptical but it works. I used mine and then saved the booties in a ziploc bag and reused them again 3 weeks later and they worked great. You could even open one booty at a time and get four uses out of this! Feet peeled for 2 weeks, nothing drastic but gradual. My feet look great after years of struggling with cracked heels. I did soak them in hot bath several times a week which helped skin come off. Im buying more!</li>
    <li> It really works! In about 4 days the dead skin began to peel. Given I soak and exfoliate my feet pretty regularly, I was shocked that there was so much shedding. The pictures only show skin coming off the bottom of individual&#x27;s feet, so I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the skin that continued to peel on top and to the ankle. Even my toes were smoother and softer. At 2 weeks there was still some shedding, but then subsided a little after the 2 week mark. These results may not be true for others.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (6 weeks later):&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true the shedding process did work. But since that time, I notice my feet appear to be dryer than before using the product. Before I didn&#x27;t have cracks in my heels and now they are dry and not as smooth as before. Perhaps this should only be used by those with extreme dryness or cracked heels. Since I usually don&#x27;t have that problem, I will not be using this again.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my husbands feet</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I felt like I was a reptile shedding skin.  My feet were much softer and are 10x&#x27;s better than any pedicure I have ever gotten. In fact, when I went for a pedicure I didn&#x27;t even have to get callous remover or anything just a basic pedi.  The Baby Foot really works and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> &amp;Agrave; great product, can&#x27;t believe how awesome this works!</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased this on my account for her feet. It worked but just did not last long. It took 7-8 days for her feet to begin to peel and they peeled for a week or so. Her feet stayed smooth for 2-3 weeks. So from application to rough feet again was about a 6 week process. I just don&#x27;t think that makes this a good value, but my daughter loves and wants more.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my feet. I purchased this product to see if it would help my condition out at all. It definitely did the job. After a few days, my feet started peeling and a lot of my psoriasis had cleared somewhat and they were super soft! However, about a week later it started back again. Probably a great product for people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product - definitely works best if you soak your feet for a half hour at least before the treatment, and then daily for a half hour after the treatment for a few days. I can&#x27;t believe how much dead, rough, crappy skin came off!! So awesome.</li>
    <li> Loved the product.  Did exactly what was advertised.  I will order again and I am telling my friends about this.</li>
    <li> My feet, and especially heels, were ROUGH (and thick). This worked perfectly... But I put in the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaked my feet for 15 minutes prior to using, put the booties on, put some fuzzy sleep socks over them, and settled in for some grey&#x27;s anatomy. Rinsed it off and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day 3 I started using the pumice stone in the shower - a few minutes per foot - really working at the heel. Once out of the shower you could see all of the roughed up skin. I&#x27;d pick at it for a few minutes (for fun, obviously), then slather on some cracked heel lotion and go about my day. I&#x27;d add some more lotion right before bed. I&#x27;ve been repeating this everyday and now on day 8 my foot is literally  transformed. Just some peeling to finish around the toes and ankle. I didn&#x27;t do any additional soaks, just the shower scrubbing and lots of lotion. On day 8 I did also use a mixture of melted coconut oil and plain white sugar to scrub the tops of my feet to finish off that peeling. I plan to continue using that for the next few days as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly: I&#x27;m not sure why the directions say not to use lotion... Maybe it just means right after the application??? I feel like lotion after exfoliating was the key to this whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff definitely works, but if you&#x27;re expecting to just wake up one day and peel large sheets of skin off your feet, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product works very well and the vendor provided quick shipping. My skin is dry and my feet are terribly rough and now they are finally soft.</li>
    <li> This product works great but you have to make sure to follow the directions. Also, the other review person was right on the money concerning soaking the foot in warm water before and during the week. Also realize nothing will happen until (about) day 3. Do not expect to take the booties off and see perfect skin. This is the obvious case of those who are complaining it didn&#x27;t do anything. You have to give it time. Also daily bath soaks help you get the most bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT add lotion to your feet. The dead skin is supposed to dry and fall off. If you use lotion the lotion prevents the peel process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you have clean socks on (or shoes) at all times. When all the dead skin comes off you are at risk of infection either bacteria or fungal if you don&#x27;t keep your feet super clean while its working.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive at first...but this product does everything it claims. my feet have never been so smooth! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product and kind of fun to use, but clearly not worth $25.00!  It does make your feet peel, but mostly the skin that&#x27;s in decent shape already!  the top of your feet, the toes, the middle of the bottom of the feet.  any place there is a callous or thicker skin such as the heels - exactly where you are hoping it does something - that is where it does very little.  the skin that peels is like getting a sunburn and peeling - think about how much good that very fine layer of skin peel will do on your heels!  Almost nothing.  Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product really delivers results. By day 3 I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to do anything, but stepped out of shower on day 4 and the magic began. My feet started peeling from the bottom first and gradually peeled all over in a 10-12 day period. Results-baby soft skin! It&#x27;s miraculous and gross at the same time. I wore closed toed flats during the process in warm CA weather but finally went back to sandals before it was done completely with a little moisturizer to hide the dry peeling. I took pictures during the process and showed my friends to prove it does what is says. Worth the time and money if you want beautiful soft pretty feet.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I left the booties on for 2 hours. Two days later my feet started peeling and the process was complete in a week. Dont force the peeling, it will happen. This helped incredibly with my foot odor and athletes foot. The results lasted about a month.</li>
    <li> I used this as instructed and even followed some reviewers advice and soaked my feet every day. I has minimal peeling the 4th day and nothing more after that. The peeling did not even remove all the dry skin I had.</li>
    <li> I followed the other reviewers recommendations and soaked my feet in water before using the foot wraps. A week later my feet started peeling. It did a pretty good job removing most of the dead skin and my feet are considerably softer.</li>
    <li> Never a good idea to mess with the skin on your feet. anything you peel off or trim (cuticles, callouses etc.) will just return - only worse. 5 weeks out from my peel I now have peeling old blister-like areas that never existed before. I have feet that have never had callouses and rarely had blisters. My mother NEVER EVER  allowed us to be barefoot anywhere other than in the house where we always wore socks anyway. I wore socks in bed after using this product so that I would not have the bed mess reported KLG and Hoda. You want nice, soft feet? Never ever be barefoot outside, ALWAYS wear socks, moistures after every showers/bath etc. NEVER EVER! wear sandals.  We have all seen those women with the horrible cracked and dirty heels - by that point all the &amp;#34;Pedi Eggs&amp;#34; etc. will only delay the return of same. NEVER let your children wear sandals, flip-flops or any other shoes that put fashion before their safety.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but you definitely need to soak your feet daily in order to get the process kick-started. I will use again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and LOVE IT!  Both times I used the product exactly per the directions and the dead skin sloughed off within 5-7 days.  I didn&#x27;t change my showering habits (daily morning shower) and I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;tubber&amp;#34;.  My 19yo moved to Phoenix last fall and after 8 months of daily sandal-wearing her feet looked almost as bad as...well, my 50+ yo feet.  I gave her a box, she followed the instructions, 5 days later her &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34; were back.  My theory?  Every &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; is different.  It doesn&#x27;t mean you didn&#x27;t follow the instructions explicitly it simply means the product  doesn&#x27;t work for you.  What works for one, may not work for another.  Granted, this product is not cheap so if you don&#x27;t have $25 to potentially waste then don&#x27;t purchase it.  However, if it works for you, it&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my 2nd set.  Nothing gets my feet as nice as these.  I love the peeling effect.  LOL  The last time I did it, I was soft and smooth for almost 2 months with no real worry in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s flip flop season - I gotta get my heels fixed ASAP!</li>
    <li> The product really works. I recommend it for people like me who don&#x27;t like communal pedicure basins, but want smooth feet. I wore socks on top of the bag and marinated for about 75 - 90 minutes. My feet peeled from top to bottom. (Soaking them in warm water every other night sped up the shedding process, but it took about 2 weeks for the peeling to stop.) It&#x27;s crazy how much skin rubs off - your DNA will be all over the place so don&#x27;t commit any crimes. I will do it again when sandal season is over. Co-workers have already ordered the product - even a guy.</li>
    <li> have extremely rough feet. did not make completely smooth and did not last long. better off using pumice stone daily. would not buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited to write this product actually worked.  I totally recommend it..😊</li>
    <li> Even though your skin peels off. It was painful for me, and it didnt remove all of it at the same time. Some was left behind so I looked like a partial mummy. I should have saved the money and just got a nice pedicure.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t like it and honestly I didnt. I watched some videos where people saw results right away and that is what I expected. I didn&#x27;t see results until a week later. I woke up one morning and thought to myself I need to get a pedicure but then I noticed my feet were peeling and I was like oh lol. This is really worth it! My feet are way softer and I spent a third of the price! The only set back is your feet peel for a few days and it&#x27;s really hard not to peel it all off.</li>
    <li> Scary stuff with all the peeling.</li>
    <li> Worked OK but my feet are in bad shape</li>
    <li> Love it! The product really works.</li>
    <li> Loved it. It took four days to start peeling but it works great!!!</li>
    <li> This took several days to start working but after it finished peeling my feel were wonderfully smooth and soft for a few weeks.  I will use it again.  Maybe best in winter because your feet really peel.</li>
    <li> Yes, It did wonders for my feet.  I had very dry skin on my heels and they were really hard from going barefoot outside and wearing sandals.  I need to do it one more time to truly get the results that I need from so much abuse to my feet.  I will be ordering this again.  It really works!</li>
    <li> Not working at all, waste of money!  Will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used for two hours and then washed feet!  It took a good week for my feet to start peeling!  Peeled for another week!  Finished peeling now and feet look great!  I will do again in a month or so!</li>
    <li> Best foot product ever !!  I liked it so much I ordered 2  more to give to friends.  It arrived a day earlier than promised.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist told him to try it for his &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; feet, so he was the family&#x27;s guiena pig. YES! He shed so much skin no one could believe it. It does take several weeks before the peeling stopped, but then VOILA he now has super soft feet, just like a baby&#x27;s!!!! Everyone in the family has tried it since then and we have a whole clan of pretty, healthy looking feet!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as the package says but its not a permanent fix. You will need to do the peel every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Took off some of the dead skin.  I think it works better when they use the razor device when I get a pedicure.  Given the price and effort, a pedi might be a better deal.  Fun but I won&#x27;t do again.</li>
    <li> This is really a excellent product for your feet. Made my feet real soft. The dead skin peel off. Made my feet feel baby soft.</li>
    <li> My feet are the worst but this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of hyperbole, but there really aren&#x27;t enough superlatives to express how much I love this product. Keep in mind that dry skin and cracks can return, depending on how you care for your feet. I&#x27;m terrible about remembering to moisturize every night before bed, so I use this product every two or three months. Love, love, love. Pedicures didn&#x27;t work. Pumice stones were meh. Nothing else removed cracks from my heels. This does. No more nasty feet - well, except for the week when I&#x27;m leaving pieces of my feet everywhere as they peel. That part is kind of gross, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> So gross but works better than anything else!  Just make sure you give yourself time to comepletely shed before a major event.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Love it. My feet have NEVER  been so smooth!</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my feet.  Might be that I keep my feet in good condition.  But, NOTHING.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, i had read all over about it, soaked my feet for 30 minutes in warm water before hand, put the booties on, and they feel like slime. I put socks on over the booties, and waited an hour and 15 minutes because my heels were terrible. You wash it off with warm soapy water and wait. By wait i mean i waited for 4 days before my feet began to peel, and boy did they peel. My feet peeled for about 5 days solid. I would soak my feet each night when i got home and just plugged my shower drain. Once all the dead skin came off my feet were soft and lovely. Waaaaayyy better than any pedicure ive ever had EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed.  My Feet peeled 2 weeks later for over 2 weeks.  It looked gross and then, my feet didnt really seem very soft.  If they had, it would have been worth all the peeling.  Plus, before they started to peel, they itched from being dried out so... disappointed.</li>
    <li> For years, my feet have been a dry, callused mess despite moisturizers, scrubs, bi-weekly pedicures, trips to the podiatrist... It&#x27;s not uncommon for my cracked heels to begin to bleed, which began again a few weeks ago and lead me to search Google once again for a cure.  I came across Baby Foot and thought &amp;#34;what the heck...it&#x27;s only $20 and worth a shot!&amp;#34;  I read all of the reviews of fabulous results but was still a bit skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived on 08/12 and I got excited.  I soaked my feet for 30 minutes before applying the booties, then put on some thick socks over the booties and settled in on the couch (&#x27;cause you certainly can&#x27;t walk around with these things on you feet) where I let the magic happen for the next two hours.  I know the package insert says to use them for only one hour, but many reviews recommended an extended period of time.  So, two hours go by and I carefully made my way to the bath to wash away the goo.  I was SHOCKED when I removed the socks and booties...my feet were huge!  Swollen to the point where my feet were like blocks.  Given that the product is made of fruit acids, I thought it would be gentle, but it was powerful enough that it ate the polish right off my nails.  The next morning, the swelling was down somewhat but didn&#x27;t completely resolve for four days.  Swollen feet &#x3D; sore feet so no heels for me that week!  For two days, nothing (except the swelling, oh and some redness) happened.  My feet felt dry and tight.  On day three, my feet started to peel, showing extremely red skin underneath, as if they were sunburnt.  On day 5, I started to get worried...I looked like I had leprosy!  There were huge pieces of skin falling off my feet, up my ankles, between my toes.  It was disgusting to look at and I quickly learned that I couldn&#x27;t walk around inside the house barefooted because I was leaving a trail of skin behind.  I continued with nightly soaking of my feet for about thirty minutes, followed by a gentle rub to help remove the excess skin that was hanging in tattered strips on my feet.  Now, 10 days after I started, the worst of the peeling is over with just a little flaking left behind on my ankles and the tops of my feet.  My toenails are a bit of a mess; the product dried them out terribly so I&#x27;m applying oil to recondition my nails.  But my feet?  They look AMAZING!  My dry cracked heels are a thing of the past.  I am so excited with the results and despite the swelling, soreness, dried out nails and the horrible sight, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to do this again.help remove the excess skin that was hanging in tattered strips on my feet.

    <li> This is the only product that actually works!  This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased Baby Foot.</li>
    <li> Still trying this out, and have provided my daughter with the product to test as well.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I loved this! I did exactly what the directions said. I soaked my feet first, just in plain warm water. Once I put the Baby Foot booties on, I then put socks over them. I sat for an hour with out getting up. Then once the hour was up, I rinsed me feet off. After about 4 days there was a little peeling that started. And then it was coming off the bottom of my feet and it worked itself to the top. I would say that a little over 2 weeks is what it took to get all the dry skin off. Great product and I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This definitely works. I don&#x27;t know about baby feet but maybe high school feet? Do this in the winter! I did it during the summer and after about 5 days my feet started peeling all over, bottom, top, toes. Totally gross and it was a hot summer and I was at the beach everyday so I received quite a few stares to say the least. The skin was peeling off everywhere. My feet are definitely softer and less caloused. And I will do it again maybe in 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> had NO results.waste of $$$</li>
    <li> Worked real good but it takes 2 days and skin starts t o fall off.also wash your feet twice a day with soapy water.hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product is a prayer answered!  It works so well and does exactly what it says it will do.  Easy to use (come on, you can sit still for 1 silly hour while the product is working!) .  In about 5 day&#x27;s the peeling began and lasted another 7 day&#x27;s.  I was skeptical as to whether it would peel those rough, dry, cracked heels of mine, but it did.  I have not had soft, clean-looking feet like this for over 30 years….really!&lt;br /&gt;I have always had pedicures and in between pumiced my feet to try to keep them nice, to no avail and tried every single heel and/or foot repair cream known with no luck.  This product is amazing.  Follow instructions exactly…..soak feet 15 min. in warm water, dry off then put booties on for 60 min., wipe dry then go wash them.  Do NOT leave the product on for longer than 60 min.!!  This is an acid-reactive product and the manufacturer has tested it.  More time does not equal more results and could burn your skin, then you will blame the product and manufacturer unfairly.  The amount of peeling will be based, of course, on how much dead skin you have so if you didn&#x27;t get much peeling, your feet might have been in better condition than you thought, perhaps.  Also, be prepared to forego your open sandals publicly for about 7 day&#x27;s while the peeling process happens….it&#x27;s not a pretty sight, but so, so worth it.  Wearing lightweight socks around the house and to bed will eliminate flaking skin all over the place and grossing your family out! LOL!  Truly, this is a product I was very impressed with….I just bought 2 more for the future.  Thank you Baby Foot for an excellent product!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried tons of products promising new skin and heels so fancy, you&#x27;ll never want to wear shoes, again. Nothing worked. My heels are probably typical of most women who go to the gym, wear sandals all summer, and wear those &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; shoes that kill us. I use the Pedi Egg and various &amp;#34;sanders&amp;#34; from Beauty Brands each time I shower. Though the simple things like homemade foot scrubs, sanding, and lotion can help, nothing, and I mean nothing, worked like this product! After weeks and weeks of researching and humming and hawing, it went on sale and I bought it. Here&#x27;s my tip to success: Soak feet. Take a nice long bath. I used bubbles, made myself some nice tea, brought in my iPad and watched about 40 minutes of TV to pass the time. (I hate baths. This part was the hardest for me.) Then I dried my feet a little, and while still prune toed from the bath, slipped the pre-gel booties on and put on a pair of my husband&#x27;s socks over them to help keep them in place. I left mine on for 90 mins (suggested by a blogger) and then rinsed them off. My feet had a sheen to them and smelled nice but that was it. A watched foot does not peel. Day 2: Soaked just my feet in a foot bath for 30 mins. Nothing exciting but my feet felt relaxed from the hot water. Day 3: Whoa. My big toe, previously callused, peeled a little. I couldn&#x27;t help but pick a tiny bit to reveal all this new skin under what felt like a giant mound of dead skin. Day 4: The sides of my feet started to peel some along with my heels a tiny bit. I continued to soak daily from 20-45 mins. I also have been wearing socks and sneakers all week. I&#x27;ve also sent out texts to multiple friends who were disgusted. Day 5: The magic starts to happen! More peeling...even around my toenails where I thought nothing bad was happening. Apparently, dry dead skin resided there, too. Right now I&#x27;m on Day 8: The majority of the peeling is over. I have been taking daily foot soaks/baths, using a washcloth to rub off dead skin during the foot bath, and today I peeled a little by hand because I couldn&#x27;t help myself. Not much more peeling is happening. There&#x27;s a few bits here and there but as I lay in bed, rubbing my once sandpaper feeling feet together, images of silk feet pop in my head. They feel so nice and the cracks and calluses are gone! I&#x27;ll probably shed another day or two and be done with it. I&#x27;ll buy this product, again, and will recommend this over any expensive pedicure any woman dare try (and I&#x27;ve even done the pedi where they razor cut your skin off your heels!). This is worth it. I have felt no pain. My feet look amazing. There&#x27;s really nothing to it besides trying to hide your feet during the molting. If you&#x27;re diabetic or have allergic reactions to any of the fruit acids or alcohol, it&#x27;s not recommended. If you &amp;#34;help the peeling&amp;#34; along, you could hurt yourself. Those are just some warnings on the package it comes in.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well for me. After 6 days, minimal peeling and mostly in spots that were already soft</li>
    <li> Great product! Try it even if you have good feet...I did! Just wished the peeling process was faster, my feet peeled for almost 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Did as instructions stated.  No peeling of the dead skin.  Waste of money.  Could have gotten a pedicure.  Was looking forward to smooth feet.</li>
    <li> Did a tremendous job on 95% of my feet. On a couple of really rough spots it didn&#x27;t quite remove all the rough skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and have had better results than the most expensive pedicure.  The trick is to soak your feet before, after and every day to get the most peeling.  Don&#x27;t use lotion otherwise it will cut down on the effect of the product.</li>
    <li> it really does the job.it takes 7 days to have your feet look great again! i would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product was fascinating....in that I followed directions exactly, nothing happened for five days, then all of a sudden, my feet starting shedding off icky dry skin at an astounding rate (you&#x27;ll definitely want to do this on a week you&#x27;re not doing something special or wearing sandals)! The product was fresh and seller sent it promptly...it was also packaged well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this product would help my extremely dry feet. Living in Colorado, where it&#x27;s dry most of the time, my feet get cracked and dry often, especially around the heels. I followed the directions thoroughly, soaking my feet first before putting on the booties. After an hour I rinsed off the gel, and about 3-4 days later, the peeling began. It can be a messy affair, so I made sure after each &amp;#34;peeling session&amp;#34; to vacuum up the debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 75% of the skin around my feet has peeled. The only area that is not affected is my heel, which is the area I was hoping would rejuvenate the most. The skin around the heel is white, but it&#x27;s not coming off yet. Not sure if it will eventually, it&#x27;s been 6 days since I applied the treatment. Overall, it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to, but the heels of my feet are going to require some other type of treatment.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! I want to do this again! made my feet feel so much softer. will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice because it works.  Here in Texas I run around in sandals most of the time and bare feet in the house and my pedicurist has to deal with the rough skin that results.  Baby Foot takes about a week to soften and release dry and callused skin.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> It really works!! Would recommend to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!!!  Left my feet feeling better than a pedicure and longer! Love this product and will be using it from now on! Be forwarned that this does take a few days, so be patient.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. But, you must time your use carefully. Your skin will start peeling off about 3 days after you use the product. Your feet will look frightening for about a week after that, as they continue to peel. You will need to soak and scrub your feet daily to deal with all the skin that will come off. Follow the directions about soaking your feet in warm water both before and after the treatment for best results. Your feet will be much smoother in the end, it&#x27;s just that you won&#x27;t be able to show them off until they stop peeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I know I will purchase it again to get my feet sandal ready for summer! While the entire process is a bit yucky since watching your foot peel isn&#x27;t my idea of a good time but the product delivers! At the end of it all, my feet were much softer.</li>
    <li> Look no further this is it, I&#x27;ve tried tony moly&#x27;s twice, one a day after another and nothing happened( just shiny feet no peeling), But with Baby Foot I started peeling right after and going on... be sure to follow the tips, put your feet in hot water before, keep product on for two hours, wash them with soapy water, then clean water after...repeat for the next days until no more skin is peeling off... if you are feeling too dry put on some Vaseline and socks at night...by the way I bought this product myself nobody is paying me for review or discount for review is my personal experience... I was looking for a product that really works...this is it...  Hope this helps. Thank you</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.  This stuff did nothing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It takes about 2 weeks to get all of the dead skin off and it&#x27;s a really gross process....However so well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Takes a few days to start to peel - but worth the wait - excellent results!</li>
    <li> Fabulous effect. I didn&#x27;t expect to see my baby feet.&lt;br /&gt;Be ready for not an immediate result, it will take a few days once it starts peeling, but the result is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to use the product again.</li>
    <li> Omg, this product really works!  It took approximately 5 days until my feet started to shed the dead skin, but when it did, all the gross stuff came off, my feet were left baby soft and gorgeous.  I will definitely order this product again.  This product does what a pedicure wont do, it penetrates to at least the 2nd layer of dead skin on your feet, the results are amazing.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I run around in my barefeet alot and end up with dry, scaley, unattractive feet.  I have seen this advertised everywhere, and being an adventurer, I decided to try it.  This did not disappoint.  My feet started to peel around day 4 but really began to peel on day 6.  I still have a small amount of peeling on the tops of my feet and it has been 2 weeks.  My feet are definitely softer and less scaley.  I will definitely use this every month or so to make my pedicure last longer.  Seems pricey but definitely works as advertised.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything at all. I wrote a review saying it might as well have been water. Boy was I wrong. It was about 5 days after I did it that my feet started peeling like crazy. I know they say NOT to peel off all the dead skin but who can resist? It feels so satisfying, so freeing. The skin underneath is actually as soft as a baby&#x27;s. It hasn&#x27;t affected my heels yet but my toes and the balls of my feet had dead skin coming off in sheets. My toe tops haven&#x27;t felt this good in a long time. And I take care of my feet. I thought that when it wasn&#x27;t working in the beginning that maybe it was because my feet weren&#x27;t in bad shape. But then everything started to peel. Even my ankles! We&#x27;ll see what it looks like in a week but so far... WOW! It&#x27;s doing its job. i&#x27;m a convert. Especially since no animals have been abused in the process. Win win!</li>
    <li> The product works very well. It does what it claims and I&#x27;m satisfied with my results. This product is awesome</li>
    <li> My feet have always been horrible due to my aversion to wearing shoes. This product is a miracle solution! Soak feet, or take a shower prior as it helps soften your skin. Be prepared to keep feet flat on the floor for a full hour!!! The results are amazing. I do the treatment every four or five months. No more cracking, ugly, nasty heels and balls of feet!!!!</li>
    <li> This is INCREDIBLE this has to be the best product in the entire world.  My 59 year old feet are in fact like Baby Feet now!  Super cost effective.  I soaked my feet in warm water for 30 minutes then dried them then put on the booties for 2 hours because I had super calloused feet for years now.  10 days later my feet are pretty as they could ever be.  I am sooooooo happy about this product!  Putting my feet in public foot baths is a thing of the past never again.  I&#x27;m not even going to tell you what kinds of health problems you can contract in spas and gyms, just goggle it!  I&#x27;ll will use this every 2 to 3 months for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This worked astonishingly well for me and my formerly dry and scaly man-feet, which were ... yes, soft as a baby&#x27;s a week or so after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As detailed in the top comment for this product, the key is definitely soaking and resoaking your feet in warm water before and after treatment. I&#x27;m glad I read it and took the advice before trying it the first time. I started seeing results three or four days after wearing the booties and dead skin continued to slough off my feet for about a week afterwards. Pretty sure that folks who left negative reviews on here might have had better results had they followed that advice more closely, though to be fair it does differ somewhat from the procedure recommended by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results lasted about four to six months before I felt it was time for another treatment. At $25 per treatment, it&#x27;s definitely cheaper and more effective than a professional pedicure.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the mr pumice bar to help assist with the dead skin when peeling off.. This is a wonder worker but to maintain results, it should be done every 2 months...</li>
    <li> Followed the directions, not much happened. Maybe my feet were in better shape than I thought?  Slight sloughing of skin, but not much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before and enjoyed it, though it didn&#x27;t take care of rougher spots on the heels or balls-joint on the larger toe. It most certainly gets your skin to peel over the course of a week-- I couldn&#x27;t wear anything revealing of the feet until the peeling process was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are easy, though it&#x27;s not easy to sit still and do nothing for an hour (unless you&#x27;re on Amazon, then it&#x27;s easy). When you first boot the booties on, it feels like your encasing your feet in cold snot, which is unnerving. During the hour, I highly recommend wiggling your toes to hear the sloshy, ucky sound your feet will make while encased in this deceivingly sweet-smelling slime. Wash-off at the end of the hour is easy and leaves your feet feeling smooth and smelling like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, you may notice your feet look and feel about twenty years OLDER than they should be, considering all that stuff has absorbed into your skin, and now you&#x27;re just waiting for the skin to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peeling process is pretty fun, if not a little gross. It&#x27;s way more fun and rewarding than peeling off sunburned skin, though. Afterwards, your feet do feel pretty good if not a little naked. I&#x27;d recommend wearing socks during the peeling process so you don&#x27;t gross people out. It&#x27;s pretty funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got a major case of biscuit feet (rough heels, etc), then this product may not be for you. It didn&#x27;t work all that well for me on the rougher areas. Then again, I&#x27;ve got heels practically made of stone, so it might just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;ll be a major peeling experience you won&#x27;t forget.</li>
    <li> I really did like the way my feet felt after using it</li>
    <li> i have dry, flaky feet, with a few callouses from years of dancing. unfortunately, this product did nothing for the callouses. most of the flakiness is gone, but i could&#x27;ve easily done that with a foot scrub. i followed the directions completely, including many additional foot soaks throughout the week. not much to fuss over. and definitely not worth $25!!!</li>
    <li> I like most was weary of this miricale treatment, but within 5 days my bed, couch etc were covered in dead skin falling off my feet, for the first time in years my feet are smooth and not yellow and dry.  I have tried the pedi egg, Listerine, etc nothing worked until now it is defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me...I take showers and had read the reviews that you needed to soak feet before and after. I soaked my feet before and several times after over a period of a week to 10 days, hoping to get the results that others did.&lt;br /&gt;Very little removal of dead skin...nothing like others had or that I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> I found the booties easy to use and there was not an unpleasant smell at all. I was very skeptical that I would see much improvement on my feet as I live in a warm climate and live in flip flops all year round. After a day or two my feet started peeling and it has continued for a week. My feet look so much better than I ever thought they could. I might add that you really can&#x27;t wear sandals while this process is going on as you look like your feet have some gnarly disease...lol. My feet look the best they have ever looked.</li>
    <li> Got bad feet with being really dried out, and decided to try this, and wow it does work quite well, my feet were peeling for over 2 weeks and got to a new layer of skin!  Was shocked how well it did work but so glad I Took the chance, literally 1 hour in the plastic bags sealed up and took them off, and washed my feet off and let the magic begin which was about 3 days later!</li>
    <li> I love them. My feet feel so good. Now I will soon will buy my husband some. Great product!</li>
    <li> Seller was great . Got product fast but product didn&#x27;t work. If I were you I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
    <li> Having read so many positive reviews, I was confident that this product would work and that I would have baby soft feet in a week. Followed the package instructions, as well as the advice of other buyers and.......nothing. It looks like I fall into the second category of reviewers, the ones who -- for no apparent reason -- see no results at all. The product is intriguing so I will likely monitor the reviews and see if anyone comes up with a conclusive answer to this mysterious fail.</li>
    <li> Wow, they are not lying.</li>
    <li> Works just as described.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers by soaking the feet for a while before and after and using socks to cover the bags from the box.  I used it on my husband who&#x27;s got a funky layer of skin on the bottom of his feet because he wears work boots all day.  He did not believe it would work after a few days of nothing, and I was beginning to think it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but come 3 days later and the peeling began.  Then, 4 days, 5 days, it was coming off EVERY WHERE!  It was absolutely disgusting, and I was  constantly vacuuming, but it made a HUGE difference!  My husband want me to order another pack since the thick skin is coming back, so I plan on doing that soon.  Definitely worth the money if that&#x27;s also what holding you back from buying.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t clear my callouses , however it did make the top of my feet feel smooth ( the skin portion) . I also used this on my hands , same results . The skin is smooth but the the surface is not. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money or the time. I used exactly as follows, I even soaked my feet for two hours in the booties! Also took a very long time to ship!!!!!!!! N</li>
    <li> I have purchased this twice. It is an excellent &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; foot peel.</li>
    <li> Awesome foot softener! My feet were so bad &amp; cracked, I tried everything. This is a miracle product.  After using the mask &amp; peel; it actually took longer to see the full results; but now weeks later; my feet feel good and look good.  I will trying this product again just to keep my feet in top condition.  This is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I followed the weirdly written directions exactly (poor Japanese translation maybe). This product did nothing for my feet!  In fact I think they look drier.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!  Totally satisfied with BABY FOOT and plan on ordering again in the future.  I would highly recommend this product for problem feet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! My feet started peeling off close to the second week ( I was starting to wonder if it was going to work). DO NOT PEEL OFF your feet the same day you put it on. Some skin will kind of come off, do not pull it off because although it will feel nice, when you feet get dried you are going to end up with a sore (which is what happened to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very important not o peel your feet if they are not peeling off by themselves because you are going to hurt your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your start to peel off, just apply lotion and it will look okay. Now, I developed OCD over this! The peeling feels so good and compulsive! When I took a shower, I would scrub my feet with a brush (those used to clean the bathroom/walls) and the skin would come off. I would then sit comfortably and have a blast peeling off the rest (disgusting for some people but relaxing for me :-) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on before going to sleep. If you do it this way, make sure to tie it securely around your ankles so it won&#x27;t stain your sheets. I  couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than two hours because sleeping with my feet tied gave a sensation of asphyxia. For next year, when I buy them again) I plan to seat comfortably and read a book :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are not reusable, after your take it, you can give it to your partner (or anyone) to use right after because the thing is still good.</li>
    <li> It works well. Leaves your feet smooth after all the skin peels off. Lasts about 2 months before you need it again, at least for me anyways.  I wear sandals a lot.</li>
    <li> Followed the other purchasers instructions and the product worked perfectly! I thought that my feet weren&#x27;t that bad. I was SOOOO wrong. My feet started peeling on day 3. Don&#x27;t pull, no matter how much you want to. Wear socks at all times or you will have a vacuum the &amp;#34;foot chips&amp;#34; up all day long. Will purchase again to prepare for sandal season.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the strangest things, but boy were my feet smooth! I&#x27;ll definitely do this again in the future. Please heed the warnings from others- follow the instructions from the top rated review- give a lengthy pre-soak, and follow up with baths or foot soaks later, it&#x27;ll make the peeling process much easier.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product but ti works just as advertised. The soles of my feet were rough from a tendency to walk around barefoot for years. A few days after applying the booties, the dead skin began peeling off! A week  late, my feet were soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Would not recommend for heavily callused feet. It took off the top few layers of skin, but left most of the callus intact - but much drier and painfully cracked. One of my feet now hurts quite a bit - three weeks after using.</li>
    <li> It works good, peeling off dead skin, but if you already have cracked skin, which i had, its not going to work, you need to treat crack and then use this product.</li>
    <li> I saw this on someone&#x27;s blog a few months ago and thought what the heck, I&#x27;ve tried everything else I could find and nothing helped.  This product was either the coolest or the grossest stuff I&#x27;ve ever seen, it worked miracles for me. I&#x27;ve told so many of my friends and family I wish I could sell it!  If you have problem feet this product is for you, and for all you ladies that think no one notices those funky cracked heels and alligator skin feet you&#x27;re wrong we do notice. Everyone should do themselves and their neighbors a favor and use \\&quot;baby foot\\&quot; or keep their winter shoes on!!  Pretty feet in Mississippi</li>
    <li> Product just works and works great. unlike some we did not have to perform any rituals. no waiting for a full moon while soaking in imported waters from the Nile river. just soaked feet for 20 minutes and put on bags for an hour as instructed. around day 3 skin started to peel and that lasted about 10 days. we now have smooth feet.</li>
    <li> Took a little longer to work than advertised but works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST!!! But, for those that wait for results and never get them, remember that this is a Japanese product. Socks and slippers are almost always worn there. After you use this, do NOT go barefoot for at least 2 weeks. Also, twice a week for the 2 to 3 weeks after doing this, do a warm water foot soak in soapy/olive oil water. I fill a plastic container that&#x27;s big enough and deep enough for my feet with warm/hot water, 2 tablespoons of dish soap and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I soak my tootsies for about 30 min. You should notice the skin just gets all nasty and starts to slough off.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> OMG!!  The best foot product EVER.  I work on my feet 8-10 hours a day and my feet are horrible.  Very think callouses around the heel and ball of my foot.  I&#x27;ve tried everything!!  (I am diabetic as well)  I used baby foot for the very first time 3 weeks ago.  I first soaked my feet in warm water for 30 minutes, then put on the baby foot booties.  I did socks over the booties and left them on for an hour.  Washed the gel off and realized I should have removed my toe nail polish before putting on the product.  The toenail polish looked kind of dull and smeared onto my toes a bit.  No big deal just went ahead and removed with polish remover.  It was a bit hard to get the polish off my skin.  Ok, then I waited and waited.  Maybe 5 days before the magic happened.  Really gross peeling of all that dead skin!  At this point I started soaking my feet once a day or at least every other day for 30 minutes.  The soaking really helped the process.  In 2 weeks time my feet looked so great, I didn&#x27;t even think they were my feet any more.  I just ordered another box to use tonight.  I think after this second go round I will truly have baby feet.  Considering how bad my feet looked and felt I&#x27;m just one of those people that will need two treatments.  Very worth the money.  A pedicure can&#x27;t begin to come close to these results.  Just be patient, soak, soak, soak, and don&#x27;t pick at the dead skin.....let it do it&#x27;s thing :-)</li>
    <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
    <li> amazing. You won&#x27;t believe it!</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product.when the peeling started, I was surprised at the skin shedding.my feet were softer and smoother. I plan on using it again in about 4 months.yes it works well....</li>
    <li> Serious results from this product are soft baby feet! Just what they promised I&#x27;ll be buying it again after my dance season ends.</li>
    <li> Waste of money barely worked.</li>
    <li> What a mess.  Peeling my feet for 2 weeks.  AND not where the dryness was a problem.  Not what  expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I would advise to soak your feet before using it and try to take baths for two weeks after using it.  It makes the peel deeper if you soak your feet in the bath or water, however is easiest, for about 30 minutes a day.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, foot peel all over the place, but baby soft feet after the peeling was over!</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely manner.  As far as the product, GREAT.  My feet were SO cracked for YEARS, and I&#x27;ve tried the typical creams, like the Neutrogena Norweigan Cream and it didn&#x27;t work.  This is the only thing that has work.  I plan to purchase this again once Spring and Summer comes next year when it&#x27;s time for sandal season!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and really didn&#x27;t expect this to work- BUT IT DOES! I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and true to most of them, it takes nearly a week after using this for you to see peeling. But once it does, it doesn&#x27;t stop until you&#x27;re left with baby soft smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;One package comes with 2 booties, the package says use one time, but I use mine 2x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by soaking my feet for 30-45 minutes. I put the booties on and fasten them, the put big fluffy socks over. I time it for 1 hour, no more and then take the booties off and soak my feet again. I click the top of the booties together with a chip clip to use again in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have time, I will try to soak my feet for 30 min sometime in the first 6 days. By around day 6 or 7, you will start to see peeling and it will continue for a few days. I will buy this again and again and again! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a strange product. It&#x27;s very slimy - no goopy - on your feet, and it&#x27;s heavy, too, because the gel is inside large plastic booties. You cannot walk. You must sit on the couch and have a glass of wine because it feels...gross. And then after the hour that my feet were encased in this very disgusting slime booty, after I had washed the gel off, I waited for the miracle to occur. And waited...and waited...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 4 weeks later, all of a sudden the skin on my feet began to shed, not unlike the shedding of the skin of a snake. Again, this experience was...gross. After every shower, and vigorous rubbing with a towel, the shedding abated. But hours later, my feet again looked like they were emerging from a crypt. This turned into a cycle - crypt feet, vigorous rubbing with a towel, beautiful baby feet, crypt feet, vigorous rubbing, you get the idea. About 6 weeks after the initial treatment, the shedding stopped and gradually, over the course of another 2 weeks, my heels returned to their original, calloused selves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again? No. What unearthly chemical brew is in this gel? It can&#x27;t be good. And since the results aren&#x27;t permanent, why bother? I&#x27;m no sucker.</li>
    <li> This stuff peeled off dead skin I didn&#x27;t even know I had. It took about 5 days to start peeling and another week to completely finish peeling, so keep that in mind if you have any thoughts of wearing sandals anytime soon. Totally worth it, and yes, my feet are baby soft!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. But your feet WILL need the treatment again.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m a guy .For the last handful of years my feet have been dry and cracked and I&#x27;ve had athletes foot in the past which I don&#x27;t have anymore,but I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the dry cracked heels and the itching. I&#x27;ve used the razor scrapers almost always cut myself. Tried the ped egg useless for my feet.Even the micro pedi worked a little but they wear away to fast I would need industrial grit sandpaper lol. This product worked wonders and I read the reviews before hand, someone suggested soaking your feet in plain water before you put the product on your feet, which it does state on the label and soaking them for 15-30 minutes after and every other day. It definitely helps. In less than 2 weeks a thick layer of skin has come off my feet. I think the direction state to leave them on for 45 minutes, I kept them on for an hour .My feet are smooth and they don&#x27;t itch.They only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it s to much time for a guy to spend on his feet.</li>
    <li> I contracted Hand, Foot and Mouth disease, which left dry, painful, cracked blisters on the bottoms of my feet. It&#x27;s important to follow the directions. I soaked my feet in a bath for 20 minutes before putting on the booties. Because it had so many cracks on my feet, the gel in the booties stung in spots. But I kept them on for the recommended time then rinsed. BEWARE: this doesn&#x27;t work over night. And when it does start working, it&#x27;s disgusting. Skin peels off in layers for days and days. Eventually, however, I was left with very soft feet. This is an intense treatment but worth the time for those with extremely dry, cracked skin on their feet.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. it did not help my feet at all. waste of time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Performed as advertised!</li>
    <li> waited 14 days and still nothing.  i followed directions and stayed in once place since wearing them makes it dangerous to walk!  now 20 days later and nothing.  not sure i couldeven get a refund since of course i thre the box away.  dont throw the box away people! rookie mistake</li>
    <li> It was great  also do it  10 days before sandel weather  it peelis for a few days  but the softness an exfoliation is last longing  my feet are still soft  I would do this at spring and fall  for beautiful feet  it is worth it</li>
    <li> within five days of treatment significant peeling occurred and it was complete within seven days.  Product works to remove a layer of skin but does not significantly affect calluses from running, etc.  Skin was smoother after use.</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended. It definitely surpassed expectations. Delivery was brilliant, received the product earlier than estimated.</li>
    <li> I followed directions and after 4 days nothing, day 5 it kicked in, day 7 I was shedding like a snake, it almost scared me with amount of skin that was exfoliating. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this good in years. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting the product for a while and decided to take the chance. I soaked my feet first and left it on for 1.5 hours and here I am a week later with no results. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it had minor peeling nothing like what I had seen on the today show or on any other commercial. The second time I used it for over the recommendations for an hour and it is currently peeling off sheets of dead skin.</li>
    <li> This product did what it said it would do and three weeks later I am still happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Works as good as advertised.  I left the booties on for 2 hours while I watched a movie.  No issues keeping them on longer than the recommended 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also followed advice of others and soaked my feet each day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly amazing, like the other reviewers stated, you def. want to soak your feet for about 15-20 mins, then find a great movie to watch, put on the baby feet for a full hour, then rise your feet, thats it! Within the next 5 days or so watch your feet exfoliate with no effort at all... this stuff is awesome... the only downside is, as your feet exfoliates you probably don&#x27;t want to wear peep toe pumps or flip flops for about a week, the peeling is not the prettiest thing to look at....</li>
    <li> Love Baby Foot. It does exactly what is says, but the callouses come back pretty quickly. As a few other users have mentioned, the peel does work better and more quickly if you soak your feet a few days after you first use it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes and low expectations for this product.  The gel mixture smells lovely, and about 3 days qat red the treatment I saw the first hint of peeling. It was on the top of my foot, which isn&#x27;t really where all the thick dead cracked skin is so I was a little worried. But not to fear, over the next 3-5 days major amounts of skin started to slough off. It&#x27;s now just over a week later and the peeling seems to be close to done.  All the dry cracked skin on my heels is gone, and my feet look fabulous!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great in fact I&#x27;m getting another one.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Was skeptical at the beginning but once I tried it I will definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I had the ugliest cracked heels in town. I was embarrassed to wear sandals or flip flops. I got regular pedicures and they would shave lots of skin off there but within days my heels were back to UGLY. After hearing this product talked about on the Today show, I had to try it for myself. And am I glad I did! I soaked and exfoliated my feet before using. It took almost 5 days before anything happened, but when it did... WOW! After 8-9 days I had brand new feet! I love this product. It&#x27;s been a little over a month and I can see they are getting a little ugly again so it&#x27;s time to order another one!</li>
    <li> I love the Baby Foot Easy Pack. My feet are so soft now, I can&#x27;t believe their my feet.</li>
    <li> Slight stinging during use. Feet were painfully dry and itchy until peeling started on day 3. Most of the peeling was on my toes, and tops of feet. Only slight peeling on the heels. I purchased it for my dry thick heels, so disappointed. After peel, feet were very red and sore. This product reminded me of a chemical burn which then peels before healing. 2 weeks later, my feet are dry again even though I use a thick lotion daily. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> OMG is this stuff disgusting!! I managed to gross out my 7yr old boy!! It does exactly what you want it to. Be sure to read through some of the other reviews to get the best use. Soak your feet first, and then again for a bit each night. You&#x27;ll get the best results.</li>
    <li> It is amazing how this works, it does take almost a week but then they peel your skin is like brand new!!! I love this its so easy and it works!!</li>
    <li> ***revised*** took 10 days but started peeling! My feet feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to read about a product that would magically make my feet super soft. I&#x27;ve used foot files, ped egg, every different salve and lotion on the market. What&#x27;s $20 for magically soft feet? I used the product exactly as instructed. I left my feet in the booties for 70 mins, then washed and then waited. NINE DAYS later Im still waiting and nothing has happened. Zilch, nada, nothing. I have no idea how some people get this product to work but I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted $20 plus shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic. My feet weren&#x27;t horrible...no major calluses or weirdness. However, I go barefoot a lot and my heels and balls of my toes were very dry and a bit cracked. I get pedicures frequently, but the smoothness after the pedi would go away within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the Baby Foot on a Sunday, and noticed nothing for 3 days. No redness, no unusual dryness and no peeling.  Almost thought it didn&#x27;t work.  Then, on the afternoon of the 4th day I noticed some itching, like my feet were excessively dry.  That night I took a long, warm bath and when I got out of the tub the fun began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most difficult thing is not &amp;#34;helping&amp;#34; the process by picking at your skin. It&#x27;s sooo tempting. Also, NO lotion or oil, which is also difficult. It&#x27;s really gross the way it all falls off.  I didn&#x27;t have much peeling on top of my feet, but around toes and the sides of my heels and lower ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 days since application, my feet are really beautiful.  There is only a slight bit of peeling left in my instep, but most everything is gone. I did use some tea tree oil mixed in Cerave on my feet this morning, but they feel so soft and look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll do this when I can wear my UGGs. Not good to do when you have a work event or date, on a summer evening when sandals are appropriate. Could be really gross. But, definitely works as claimed. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> My feet did peel as practically everyone has said they would but they&#x27;re already back to where they were before the treatment. It&#x27;s been a little over a month. My feet weren&#x27;t horrible but I do get rough heels and my big toes get calloused on the side. Didn&#x27;t seem like it worked all that great on those areas for me. Some areas came out super soft, but my real problem areas were still pretty rough. I&#x27;m considering trying it again. Maybe I&#x27;m just one of those people who need more than one treatment even though my feet don&#x27;t seem that bad to me.</li>
    <li> my feet are more dry than before, it did not work as expected. i followed as described but did not work</li>
    <li> I have to say I was a little skeptical after 2-3 days without anything happening but then on the 4th day, it started to work. It took about 2 weeks from application day to go through the complete process but it is totally worth it!! For immediate results, this isn&#x27;t your thing. But if you&#x27;re willing to go through the process, the end result is like having &#x27;baby feet&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I soaked and washed my feet like it directed. It took awhile for the peeling to start, but when it did, it was kind of terrifying. However, my feet came out the smoothest they&#x27;ve been in years. I still had some rough spots left, which is apparently common if you have places with thick calluses. I will buy this again and again to keep my feet nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Super effective! I love this product! Healed me terribly dry and cracking feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from terribly dry skin for many, many years. My heels would crack, I&#x27;d file it (I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING: ped egg, pumice stone, metal files, expensive Diamancel, and all foot lotions) and moisturize it like crazy, but cracks and ugly calluses would still appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby Foot HEALED my feet. No more cracks. Clean, normal, soft feet.  I had to do two rounds of Baby Foot to fully heal my cracked heels, but it did the trick!I do this every three months or so as maintenance. I maintain my clean health feet by washing it everyday, moisturizing, and wearing socks.</li>
    <li> I used this product and followed the instructions of many of the users on Amazon.com and left the booties a little longer than it said on the package and soaked my feet everyday. It worked really well, at first and my feet peeled quickly unveiling new skin. However my right food has not quite recovered. Two monthes later it is very dry and peeling. I also keep getting skin splits on my foot. Its very weird because the other foot still looks great and I did the same things to both feet. Anyways because my right foot looks way worse than before, itches, and some of the splits are painful--I could not suggest this product. Before using this product I did not have the peeling problems or splits, just some calluses.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good but next time I will soak my feet for the recommended time of 15 minutes. I didn&#x27;t see that instruction until it was too late.</li>
    <li> Great product, Just kind of expensive tor only one time use</li>
    <li> Day 1: I soaked my feet for about 30 minutes and then dried them. I then put the booties on and put socks over them for a bit over an hour and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: I have no peeling or have noticed any difference at all. No bad side affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Some slight itching and the feeling of dryness, but nothing too extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: The inside arches have become itchy. Not severe just to the point of annoyance, a small bit of lotion resolved this issue. After my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nightly shower I noticed the peeling started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: Not itchiness and peeling continues, there is no pain with the peeling. The new skin looks great. dec 29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6: Peeling complete, feet look great.</li>
    <li> Except for one small persistent place on the side, (on which we will use a Pedi egg) it worked wonderfully just like they said it would.  We are very pleased with this product and will use it again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I had a $25 gift card (and feet desperately in need of TLC), so I decided to give these booties a shot. It&#x27;s been a very snowy winter, so I haven&#x27;t exactly been eager to put on flip flops for a pedicure. Following the advice of other reviewers, I assembled all of my supplies first. I had a soaking tub for my feet, a towel, the booties and a pair of slippers so I could walk if necessary during the treatment. I soaked my feet in soapy water for 15-20 minutes, dried them, and then put on the booties. The booties come with adhesive strips that did a good job of securing the plastic around the ankle. I left the booties on for an hour or so -- the gel didn&#x27;t feel gross as i feared -- and then I soaked my feet again for another 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the treatment on a Thursday. I didn&#x27;t see any results until I came home from work on Tuesday and took off my socks. Holy cow! My socks were full of dead skin (eww) and one foot was REALLY peeling. After my shower the next morning, the other foot was really peeling. It was really gross but fascinating. The directions say not to peel off the skin but it&#x27;s kind of hard to resist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 9 days since the treatment and the peeling is almost all gone. My feet are really soft, especially the heels. My big toes could use a bit more softening but I can take care of that myself. I&#x27;m going to buy another set of booties so I have them on hand. I&#x27;m curious to see how long the results will last.</li>
    <li> OMG the peeling was gross but well worth it.  My bf even noticed my winter feet disappeared.  Now he wants one. lol!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I had tried a few other products and nothing seemed to soften or heal the dryness and cracks.  After reading several reviews on Baby Foot I decided to take a chance on it.  I followed the directions from some of the other reviewers and did the pre-soak for 30 minutes before application and also did the 30 minute soak the following days after application because I am a shower person.  In about 7 days, all of the dry, cracked, thick, rough skin sloughed off in the water.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to have healthier, smooth, better feeling feet.</li>
    <li> Maybe my feet are already baby soft but this didn&#x27;t really peel for me the way I expected.  I soaked my feet regularly as recommended and maybe a little skin pilled off but not the huge sheets pictured.</li>
    <li> Just adding to the positive reviews here. I used it with the guidance of one review that offered great advice and about a week later, my feet were seriously baby smooth. Before, they were a bit dry and chapped, I guess (?)--the skin on my foot would catch on my stockings and bed sheets (sooooooooo embarrassing and annoying!) and that has been 100% remedied. Very satisfied and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I loved the results of the Baby Foot product. My feet were dry and started to peel. I had tried lotion and oils and nothing worked. I then tried Baby Foot and it peeled off all the dead skin on my feet and it left them baby soft.</li>
    <li> I am pretty unimpressed.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it worked, 3 weeks after application my feet peeled and it was gross.  But I wouldn&#x27;t say it was baby soft skin that was uncovered.  Softer, sure, but not baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the process messy, lengthy and pretty gross, actually.  I had skin shreds staying behind in my socks and shoes, under my blankets in my bed (yuck!) and all over my floors.  It was gross, just flat out gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.  I&#x27;d slather my feet in some heavy duty lotion and use my paraffin bath.  For the price and the results, you can get better results faster, cheaper and with no ongoing horror show using lotion and socks every night for a week.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It left my feet very dry for weeks. I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> This product was AMAZING!!! I was lured in by the YouTube reviews. I had some reservations because my feet were so dry and built up with callus. I&#x27;m glad to say it worked and after a month later my feet are still baby soft.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical as to if this would work.  My heels were pretty rough after this long winter.  I soaked my feet for half hour before wearing the booties for two.  My skin began to peel first on the top of my feet.  By day 10, they were peeling everywhere.  I am surprised how soft my heels now are.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this and applied 10 days before a cruise. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but it did AND HOW. I read the reviews before I bought this, but I still wasn&#x27;t prepared for the magnitude of peeling. Wowsers. And it continued to peel much longer than I expected. So what I would add to previous reviews is my recommendation that if you have somewhere to be when your feet will show, do this at least 3 weeks prior. My feet didn&#x27;t stop peeling for a week after my cruise, which kind of de-feet-ed (get it?!) the purpose.</li>
    <li> Oh ma Gah! this stuff is AMAZING! Day one, post soak, I was having my doubts.I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference. Days two, three, and four, my feet just felt scaly and really dry. Then I woke up on day five and the skin was literally falling off of my feet. I am well into day 8 and my feet are still peeling. There is NO way a pedicure can replicate these results. I will be stocking up and doing this every so often as I see the need. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It arrived a lot quicker then expected and works beautifully. I will be buying this again in a few months</li>
    <li> I choose those product out of desperation to have nice smooth soft heels for the spring.  The past few years I tried  to cover up the ugly heels of my feet in order to wear the cutesy cut out shoes. The hard calloused skin around the heels made it very difficult to smooth away the ugliness of the heel, even professional a pedicure couldn&#x27;t do it. This product did it, however it is something that will have to be done in intervals because unfortunately the calloused skin tends to want to come back within about 6-8 weeks which could get to be expensive if I only rely on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would and have recommended this product to family members.</li>
    <li> I use these about one a quarter. Doesn&#x27;t even compare to a pedicure. I just use pedicures to shape my nails and change my polish</li>
    <li> Product worked so well I had to buy more to give as gifts, will be using this again. Happy, happy!</li>
    <li> I randomly came across this product while looking at foot scrubs on YouTube. There was very little to no negative comments so i decided to check it out.This works like magic! Honestly it took a while for it to work (started to peel on the 5th day) but the wait was worth it. I&#x27;m super excited for spring and summer this year thanks to Baby Foot</li>
    <li> better then anything else iv ever tried takes about 6 days to work but its the best&lt;br /&gt;i will keep repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, so I gave it a whirl and here was my experience. I went for my standard pedicure on a Saturday AM. Later that evening, prior to using the prior I soaked my feet in a hot/warm soapy foot spa for 20-30 minutes. I rinsed &amp; towel dried my feet. I opened the package - there are (2) booties with the product already inside of them. Opened up each bootie, one at a time and inserted my feet. It feels kind of cold and strange at first, but you acclimate. I used the provided tape to secure my booties and massaged the product around my foot - heel, toes, etc. I put big fluffy socks on over the plastic booties in case of an emergency, so I could walk without falling. It also made my feet extra warm and comfy. I sat in a recliner with my feet elevated for approximately an hour, maybe a little bit longer. (I watched one episode of Project Runway and answered some emails.) After taking off the booties, I immediately rinsed my feet in the foot spa (water had cooled by now). I dried off my feet with the towel and walked to the shower for a full rinse/cleansing. Someone else&#x27;s review recommended doing daily foot soaks, so every night after work, I&#x27;ve been soaking for 20-30 minutes. I did this for several days. I didn&#x27;t see anything happen until day #5 when I started to see a tiny hint of peeling under one of my big toes and a small area on my heel. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. At the end of Day #5 I did another foot soak and there was SUBSTANTIAL peeling. The warm water clearly has loosened up a lot of what was happening under the skin. I used a washcloth to gently rub down my feet prior to getting into bed. I left a trail/pile of dead skin all over the floor. Be prepared to do some vacuuming/sweeping. This morning is day#6 and I&#x27;m pretty sure I have full-on leprosy. It&#x27;s amazing how much my feet are peeling. My toes, full bottoms of my feet, the sides, heel, everything is peeling. I work from home on Fridays, so I was able to soak my feet this morning for about 45 minutes during a conference call and WOW, so much more skin started coming off. I am sort of disgusted and also pretty gratified to see the process/product working. I&#x27;ll be curious to see how it continues to work over the next several days and the final result. I&#x27;ll post pics if I can figure out how!&lt;br /&gt;7.ing a conference call and WOW, so much more skin started coming off.

    <li> So when this product recently hit my email news banner, I had to check it out. Everyone knows, or should know, that the whole pedi egg, scraping,filing, shaving etc. does little except prepare your feet for more hardened skin and callouses. Having once had a macho musician boyfriend who stood a lot at work and at gigs and had terrible feet and to whom I gave secret homemade pedicures using my own magic remedy and to my feet whose favorite activities are getting the paper on the driveway in the morning and walking all day everywhere in bare feet, my curiosity was piqued. It is pricey for what it is. I am not going to do the day by day results approach as this has been fairly well covered by other reviews; instead I am going to add a few tips of my own to the process, should you decide to purchase Baby Foot. First off, it is way overpriced for what it is, and no, the lavender aroma is hardly noticeable. So....have you ever marinated meat before cooking it to break down the sinewy veins etc. and open up its flesh? Well, same thing here. Wash your feet with soap, and dry. Do NOT apply lotion as this blocks the next step. Put a towel on the bottom of your container and fill it with water as hot as you can stand it. Add about a ¼ cup of Epsom salts, white vinegar, pure cane sugar (this is the alpha hydroxyl acid ingredient mentioned in the product&#x27;s list), and baking soda. Do NOT add soap as it is a drying agent. Add lavender oil to get that psychological boost that you are being infused...after all you just spent @$25 for this indulgence to make yourself feel special with this one-time use product, and you do want to feel \\&quot;infused.\\&quot; Rub your feet against the towel as you soak for additional exfoliation, and when the water cools, remove your feet and dry them thoroughly. Again, do NOT apply lotion. Use the pricey product as directed...I also put plastic produce bags over the booties secured with rubber bands and tilted my feet at an angle so the gel would congregate around my heels, and I rested my feet on a dry towel just in case there was any leakage. After using the product...as you have read, there may be varying results...I purposely let my feet get real bad before I tested Baby Foot so as to give it a fair playing field. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going to any soirees or events at which you will be exposing your feet as they will not be something anyone will want to see, and we ladies all know that we (and many men as well) always check out the footwear other women are wearing. Your feet at this stage will not be a thing of beauty that will be even promise to be a joy forever, and the gossip will be bursting at the seams. If you must reveal your feet however, apply and reapply a good sunscreen. Your skin is actually in a healing process, and like every peel process, the sun&#x27;s rays will cause damage. Do not go barefoot at all, for any reason, except in the shower or pool of course. There is dirt everywhere which will get in your healing skin&#x27;s pores, irritate it, and actually cause re-hardening (which yes, IS going to happen, even with Baby Foot.) While showering, use a pumice stone and a quality sugar scrub, and you know quality does not mean the Wallyworld&#x27;s sale item. Finally go to bed looking sexy, with a good shea butter slathered on and clean socks over this....which is also a good way to walk around your house too or to apply before putting on closed shoes. I would recommend Baby Foot if you really need to spend money on yourself in a manner that does not include buying a ten pack at the same price. Or you could just follow the marinating instructions above and apply a paste of the same cane sugar, a bottle of aspirin, (the salicylic acid),  apple, orange, lemon, and grapefruit juices, and baking soda, wrap up and make your own how-to You Tube video as you proceed. Most importantly, remember that this product, like any skin care one, is not a one time cure-all, and will need to be used repeatedly as maintenance. Overall, notworth the price....obviously a LOT of their profit is going into advertising.worth the price....obviously a LOT of their profit is going into advertising.</li>
    <li> After reviewing the opinion of others, I decided to try this product.  This product is real.  It fits peel the dead skin away, I&#x27;m not certain of the layers of porting though. I feel and see a difference in my feet....so does my husband.  I plan to keep this in my feet care regime.</li>
    <li> It worked in that some of the dead skin on my foot came off - but the skin on my heels didn&#x27;t really come off and that is the main problem area.  Based on some of the other reviews I read I expected more dramatic results</li>
    <li> It worked better than most foot scrubs etc. it did soften my feet it but not baby soft</li>
    <li> Took off all the dead skin from my feet. Easy to use but put socks over plastic bags if you need to move around or else you will slip.</li>
    <li> If you are skeptical because you have tried everything without success, try this.  It works.  I soaked my feet for 30 minutes or so in warm water, then used it as directed.  I noticed that the skin peeled off faster if I soaked my feet each day thereafter.  It took about 2 weeks for the skin to work itself off, leaving me with soft feet and brand new skin.  It only lasted about a month, though, and I already need to do it again.</li>
    <li> My 3rd time using this product and it works great, consistently.</li>
    <li> Very happy with out come!</li>
    <li> Ok, so it does work, but no baby feet for me.  I used the enhanced directions.  After 3 days I started to notice peeling after soaking.  Day 5 I had the greatest amount of peeling, then started tapering off.  A layer of dead skin did peel from my feet, however, this didn&#x27;t do much for my heels or callused areas, which is why I purchased the product in the first place.  For me, the appearance of my feet was no better than when I use my regular routine and use the microplane colossal pedicure rasp on my heels.  I don&#x27;t regret the purchase though.  It was kind of interesting.  I may even try this again at the end of winter to see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - will purchase and use every few months as needed.</li>
    <li> It actually does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> It unbelievable.  All the skin and calluses just peal off and it doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit.  My feet are baby soft.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly like it says it would.  Fun peeling the skin off later, lol.  However, the results only lasted a few weeks for me before it was like I never used it.  I do walk around bare foot and in flip flops/sandals a lot though.  It made my feet feel really hot and like my skin couldn&#x27;t breathe during the week after application before it starts to peel.  Once the skin breaks and starts peeling it went back to normal for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I followed the directions to the letter. I even soaked my feet daily...and nothing.</li>
    <li> It worked efficiently yet it didn&#x27;t take about 10% of the remaining calloused skin on the heels.</li>
    <li> I  really had high hopes for  this  product to fix my bad foot. It  does remove the skin, all  of  it!  My  good foot  looks great. The bad foot,  not so much. So yes the product is like a loofah  without  the loofah. Lots of peeling, even  the top of your feet! I  advise  to do in the winter or fall because wearing sandals out in public can be challenging. I  literally had skin hanging from my sandals at  the  movies!</li>
    <li> It got the job done. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am excessively ticklish and a pedicure is out of the question.  I also am really leery of the sanitary conditions of most salons and places where one would get a pedicure.  Baby Foot is good in that 1) No tickles 2) No issues with cleanliness 3) I can do it at 10 p.m. while zoning out to my favorite TV series.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times now and have ordered the generic version ($8 vs $21) about 3 additional times.  Baby Foot works better than the generic, but the generic also works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the product it took about 10 days to work to a level I thought was acceptable.  At that point there was 35 years of love on my foot.  It made my foot feel really uncomfortably tight for those 10 days.  When it finally started to peel it was pretty significant, although not YouTube video worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After multiple uses, I begin peeling by day two and am done by the end of the week.  I really like how smooth my feet are, especially my big toes.  I will continue to alternate between Baby Foot and its generic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reasons for 4 and not 5 stars is that 1) it&#x27;s expensive and 2) I don&#x27;t like having to do multiple soaks through the peeling week</li>
    <li> What is the point of a product that makes it so you need to HIDE your feet for two weeks? Not to mention leaving scales of dead skin everywhere while they peel is DISGUSTING. I had no idea what they meant when they said peeling, but I never thought it would be as bad as it was. Everything peeled for weeks. I figured that it would peel on my heels or something, but my whole foot for a VERY SOLID two weeks...... After I had the two weeks to ponder what was going on with my feet I had to ask myself, what is in this to do that? I don&#x27;t even want to know. And in the end, I&#x27;m actually barely different than when it started, so I was shedding dead foot skin for two weeks, twenty dollars and nothing is better. So disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have indicated, it is very important to soak your feet in water before, after and during the peeling process. I found an epsom salt soak 2x a day for 20 minutes at a time was the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peeling is strangely satisfying, but I felt as if my feet were back to being rough within a few weeks. I am not sure that these are a great longterm maintenance solution as they only treat the top few layers of the skin. I am sure the treatment would last longer for those who do not wear flats or flip flops (like me) almost daily.</li>
    <li> Your feet feel brand new after using this.</li>
    <li> Terrible, didnt work. I used it as directed and no skin fell off. I was really excited but will not spend to buy another. I wrote to the company and they did not seem to care. I should have gotten a refund or another one to try again. It was too expensive to not work.</li>
    <li> Worked great but be ready for peeling to last 3 weeks after using the product. During the &amp;#34;molting&amp;#34; your feet will not be pretty in sandals, but they&#x27;ll look great when it&#x27;s all finished.</li>
    <li> amazing, it leaves you feet like a babyfoot</li>
    <li> This is the weirdest thing ever. Your foot skin will peel off in sheets essentially a few days after application. It&#x27;s gross, and disgusting, and I loved every second of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were the kid that loved to put glue on something just to peel it off, this is for you. Or really if you just want super soft feet and aren&#x27;t freaked out by peeling skin. :)</li>
    <li> If possible, I would give Baby Foot a 100++++++++++.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use of this product was around July 5th at which time results were fantastic. Also, had a few spots that needed extra attention but those could await later application of which the instructions (2/wks. earliest) inform depending on how much dead skin build-up has accumulated..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use. Just, (1) clean and towel dry your feet; (2) unpack the booties which contain the deep peel solution; (3) put the booties on securely (with the tape but I used rubber bands) [NOTE: In the future, I will put a pair of sockettes or footies or socks over the plastic boots to ease getting around.]; (4) wear the booties for 1/hr.; (5) remove the booties; and (6) rinse and dry your feet. Then apply lotion, or foot cream, or petroleum jelly to your feet. WATCH: How to Get Rid of Cracked, Dry, Stinky FEET! Baby Foot Review!

    <li> This works great...was skeptical when I first purchased but it worked exactly as described!</li>
    <li> satisfied with results, as advertised!</li>
    <li> Loved it that&#x27;s why i reordered</li>
    <li> I used it as soon as it arrived. After about 3 days skin started to peel off feet like crazy. Very interesting product. Plan on trying again.</li>
    <li> This product was great! My feet looked so disgusting for at least a week as the hydroxy acids ate away at dead skin I didn&#x27;t even realize I had. Of course, it says not to peel the skin off, as it might damage the tender skin underneath, but it&#x27;s such fun to pull and peel off those huge chunks of peelings. While it didn&#x27;t do a mind-blowingly amazing job on certain calluses, it did state on the information pamphlet that it wouldn&#x27;t do anything at all to those. My feet look so much better! I could honestly compare them to my two year old son&#x27;s feet. I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the scent of lavender, but it was my fault for not paying enough attention to which one I had bought. They do have other scents available. I will undoubtedly purchase this again,</li>
    <li> Did a good job!  I would suggest you do it prior to sandal season because your feet look flaky for several days as the skin peels.</li>
    <li> Amazing product . Works best then all other products I tried .The dead skin just falls right out  leaving your feet soft and smooth but you do have use it again  in a few months .</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Was very surpised how good these worked.  It took about 4 - 5 days before my feet began to peel.  It was gross but it got all the tough skin off.  Do not do after pedicure because your nail polish will peel off in a few days too.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I purchased this product. The official website claimed that it was a &amp;#34;gentle process&amp;#34;  I am very familiar with AHA&#x27;s and how they work. I do weekly Lactic acid peels for acne scars so I know what an actual peel feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet, opened the booties up, taped at the ankles, then put on a pair of socks. I was planning to read a book while waiting for the peel to process. On my way from the bathroom to the living room some of the gel leaked from the top on to the sock. So I took the sock off, and a little gel rubbed on my finger tips. For people that have done peels that are 50% or higher getting acid on your fingers is a big no-no. The acid can quickly spread to other parts of your body from the oil on your skin and can cause burns. So, after changing socks, washing hands I was about 20 minutes into the peel. At that point my feet felt warm and cozy like a gentle peel BUT I noticed a warming sensation on my hands, arms, and face. I must have inadvertently touched my face in the process of changing my socks and washing my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty much game over at that point. The small amount of acid that leaked out felt like 85% Lactic acid peel. With our feet being one of the most porous parts of our body I did not feel comfortable continuing the peel. I washed my feet for about 15 minutes with soap and water, and my feet burned. I rinsed with baking soda and water to help neutralize the acid but the only relief was walking bare foot on my cold tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I just had a bad batch and the formula was wrong, but it was far from being a gentle peel. Do not plan on doing anything for the day if you have sensitive skin or have never used AHA&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on using this product use gloves and duct tape the top of your booties.</li>
    <li> I dont think this product does enough to warn you about conditions of your feet. I had cracks in my feet from dead skin NOT sores and this product burned those cracks.  I dont think anyone buys this product if they have perfect skin on their feet.</li>
    <li> Loved it...it did just what it said it would. My feet are much more softer now than before, I will be using this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!!! I can not believe how well this worked. I have horribley dry feet. they would get deep cracks that no moisturizer would ever help. I seen this and read some reviews about it so I thought I would give it a shot. it takes about 7 days to see it start to work,but when it did it was worth the wait. All the deep cracks I had just peeled right off of my foot and under was the smoothiest foot I have ever had. the skin dose just fall off in big pieces. But it is amazing! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone that had dry feet</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and sister-in-law after I had used the Japanese version.  You can see my review of that at Baby Foot 60mins Japanese Version L Size. I loved it. They love it as well.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was skeptical - I&#x27;ve tried a lot of glycolic/lactic acid lotions on my feet, but this seemed different, so I gave it a try.  I followed the directions on the box - and to be fair - it said to wait 5 days for results.  But did I mention I was skeptical?  So on day 4 there was the tiniest patch of slightly flakey skin and I thought - &amp;#34;yeah - I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work&amp;#34;.  But you have to wait for day 5.  Then the skin on my feet started shedding in sheets - for about 3-4 days. Now, the cracks in my heels are GONE, as are the calluses!  My feet are unbelievably soft and smooth.  This stuff REALLY WORKS.  Now, you might not want your feet being seen during days 5-8 - I recommend you plan on wearing socks for those days.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions carefully and it was a wonderful time break sitting there with the booties on, but it did absolutely nothing for my feet.  They may have been too far gone to help with this product, I don&#x27;t know.  I did not even lose any of the dry crackled skin that was already kind of loose.  Did not feel comfortable recommending this product to any of my friends and family after I used it because it is an extravagance and I found that I could get better results with a $30 pedi.</li>
    <li> I soaked my feet yesterday in water first and then in the booties for 2 episodes of Vampire Diaries. Wore socks over the booties and was able to walk around somewhat squishily when I had to - although for the most part I stayed put.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 -&lt;br /&gt;After 24 hours nothing seemed to be happening but after a good foot soak it seemed as though the pads on the bottoms of my feet are thicker - maybe lifting... Also I can still detect the faint smell of lavender which makes me think that the solution really soaked in through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 -&lt;br /&gt;Still nothing.  Soaked my feet again and now skin seems plumped up and more rough looking.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 -&lt;br /&gt;Nothing&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 -&lt;br /&gt;After my shower this morning my skin seemed to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; off when I rubbed it but no really good pealing like I am hoping for. My fingers are crossed that I didn&#x27;t waste my money...&lt;br /&gt;Day 7 -&lt;br /&gt;The peeling really started day 5. Every once in a while I would take off my socks and have to shake them out - when barefoot I left a trail.  It was pretty gross - in a good way...&lt;br /&gt;Right now everything has peeled and looks great EXCEPT for the hard calloused ring around my heals (that is the important part!) I will soak again and hope it continues to work.  If my heals do not peal I will lower my rating for sure.  I think I would do it again but it is cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Feel and look like baby feet</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I read all the other reviews and the hints and tips and did everything to the letter and I barely had any peeling.  I guess my rough feet were too rough!</li>
    <li> You will think they are not working...give it time.  Soon your feet will start peeling like a snake!  Works great, feet feel soft for the first time in a long time!</li>
    <li> Not a complete disappointment, but still did not meet my expectations. My feet did indeed peel a lot, and I am sure that many layers of dead skin were removed. However, I still have calluses that appear unaffected. It did make me feet softer and less cracked, but it seems as if my feet have been more prone to dirtiness since I used this product (although that could be my imagination).</li>
    <li> This product came on time and is doing exactly what its supposed to do</li>
    <li> I Have Been Trying To &amp;#34;Fix&amp;#34; My Feet For Years...They Have Been Steadily Becoming More And More Callused And Cracked. The Only Thing That Slows It down Is Daily Exfoliation And Frequent Pedicures, But Even Then, It Is Never Enough To Fix The Problem!&lt;br /&gt;Enter Baby Foot...&lt;br /&gt;I Washed My Feet Before Putting The Bags On And I Just Used Socks To Keep Them In Place. After An Hour, The Bags Came Off And Feet Were Washed Again, Just Like The Directions Said. I Decided That The Leftover Goop In The Foot Bags Might Be Worth saving For A Second Application, So I Carefully Folded Them, PlaceD Them Inside A Gallon Size Zip Lock bag And Gently Squeezed Out As Much Air As I Could. After About 4 Days, My Feet Started Peeling A Bit, Like Other Reviewers Reported. Now, At Say 6, I Notice That A Good Soaking At The End Of Each Day Helps To Loosen The Dead Skin, And I Am Able To Use A Towel To Help Remove The Dead Skin Without Disrupting The Process Or Causing Any Pain. The Skin That Is Being Revealed Underneath Is Unbelievably Soft And I Can&#x27;t Wait For The Rest Of The Dead Stuff To Come Off!&lt;br /&gt;My Maintenance Plan includes Applying Moisturizer Nightly And Sleeping With Plastic Bags &amp; Socks On My Feet At Least A Couple Of Times A Week. I Will Also Be Using My Reserved Baby Soft Foot Bags Again To Help Make Sure My Feet Never Get As Bad As They Were! I Am Going To See If I Can Get 3To 4 Uses Out Of My Purchase Before Buying Another Set.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! Used it on my husband&#x27;s hooves and they came out looking like feet again. He said it tingled quite a bit, I kept it on him the max time and a couple days later when it started peeling it was really disgusting but well worth it. The skin around his heels was really dry and cracked, Grand Canyon-like and the rest of his feet weren&#x27;t much better. If he&#x27;d let me I would have done another one a couple weeks later to really get the baby foot look, but as it is, 4 months later, his feet are still looking really good!</li>
    <li> I got INCREDIBLE results from using Baby Foot.  Of course there&#x27;s always skepticism when you hear about amazing results, but I am living proof that this product works.  My feet were in such bad shape, I was so embarrassed every time I would wear sandals.  I would slather on the lotion, hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t all soak in and show just how dry, calloused, and cracked my feet were before I got back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby Foot worked exactly as was described.  About a week after application I noticed some spots on my feet were beginning to peel, especially after I&#x27;d shower.  As the skin peeled, (like when your skin peels after a sunburn) it revealed beautiful, soft, pink skin.  Even the most calloused, dry, and cracked areas peeled away -- those areas took a bit longer than the other areas, but it did all come off with very minimal rubbing.  It is an amazing product, and I can&#x27;t wait for Spring to come so that I can wear my sandals proudly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitating at all, don&#x27;t!  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> it does exactly what it says purchase twice got rid of the crust on your feet was shedding dry skin for about 2 weeks will purchase again for upkeep</li>
    <li> This product will leave you literally with baby soft feet. I am a bit impatient and I peeled most of the dead skin off instead of letting it fall off but it still left my feet smooth for weeks</li>
    <li> my daughter loved it she thing on getting more when she can afford it</li>
    <li> I found this product on a beauty blog and figured I&#x27;d give it a try, especially since the cost is less than a pedicure.  OMG, this is AMAZING.  I followed the instructions; kicked my feet up and watched a DVR show for an hour with the booties wrapped on my feet.  It took about 4 days - it took about 4 days.  I think I did it on a Saturday and by Wednesday my feet were peeling.  A good week for the peeling to end and OH BOY my feet were so soft.  The peeling, does not hurt simply peels on its own.  The best part is peels the yucky skin around your toes that the pedi ladies cant ever really get rid off.  I have used this 2x and love it - I tell all my friends about it.  TRY IT!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I have a problem with very dry feet.  It took a little longer than the package said for my feet to start peeling, but once they did...it was a week progress.  Just don&#x27;t use right before you might have a special event and be wearing sandals. Do it 2 weeks prior to sandal wearing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Takes like 2 weeks so do it before summer. Gets rid of everything! A must have!!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product. I followed directions and other reviewers suggestions about leaving it on and it just did not work. A few weeks later skin was not peeling off of my feet. I have been using a single blade disposable razor and it has been working like a charm.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the peeling like some of the other reviews said but all I got was super dry feet. Took a pumice stone to them everyday for a month to get it off. Very happy with my feet now.</li>
    <li> I used it and after 4 days it started peeling but very little .. During the week the sole and toes of both started to peel and around the edges but not the Heel of my feet, which is what i wanted... But other than that, it did feel soft the parts that did peel off.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had to order a second one , but am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Will use it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It truly exfoliates all the skin on your feet, including around the toe nails. What it doesn&#x27;t do that I was hoping it would is remove deep callouses.</li>
    <li> This product really works well if you follow the directions. Make sure to soak your feet in warm water for several nights after the initial application. The dead skin comes off like a snake skin</li>
    <li> This is the first review ive ever written.  Only because ive never had such a good first time expierence with a product before. I dont think my feet were overly bad, but I love to be bare foot and work on my feet all day long, so there was some pretty good rough spots on my feet. I purchased this only after reading enough good reviews to qualify it as a product to try and boy was I not dissapointed.  The first week nothing happened and just when I was starting to doubt if it was going to work for me I started peeling on the sole of my feet. It was kinda fun to peel it off. The top of my foot took a bit longer to fully peel but it was very worth it. I love doing little things for myself being a mother of three and this is def. A new add on to my beauty regimen as small as that may be</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work and while there was some peeling overall it was a big men...legit baby foot product though.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!!! I wear flip flops every day at work and my feet get very callused and cracked. My pedicurist was blown away by how well it worked and now everyone who works in the salon is recommending it to their clients!</li>
    <li> This really works!! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I have leather soles for feet basically. Went barefoot more than not all of my life because I hate shoes. This made it very difficult to ever have normal feet. ;)  My daughter turned me on to this product and wow! My feet looked almost normal the first time out. I&#x27;m doing one more and I should be feeling pretty good when I look at my feet in a week! Just know, something they don&#x27;t tell you to do. Soak your feet 30 minutes before and for 30 minutes each day after (1 time per day) for a week.</li>
    <li> I can only say great things. I would never go to another nail shop again because of this product. If you really have bad feet I strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> I use these every three to four months now. They make your feet so unbelievably soft. Make sure you follow the directions on the package and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to leave them on a little longer than what they say. After a few days the skin starts to peel off and your feet will be as soft as they were the day you were born!</li>
    <li> What a mess these are.  My feet did finally peel on day 5.  It is now day 11 and my feet are still peeling and flaky.  The new skin is ok.  Don&#x27;t use these close to any time people will see your feet as they look gross for what looks to be close to 2 weeks or more.</li>
    <li> I have the worst feet and using Baby foot once a month has changed them from the hoofs they are, to nice, smooth, regular people&#x27;s feet!</li>
    <li> It worked great but not  too well on my heels. Any one else feels the same way or just me ?</li>
    <li> Its awsome!!!!!!! I love it! :) I was kind of skeptical, but baby foot did just what it was design to do. Im totally converted!</li>
    <li> I just tried Baby Foot two weeks ago. My heels were particularly rough and flaky, if I had to wear pantyhose (which I try to avoid) they would snag on my feet. My heels sounded rough on the bed sheets. I had tried for years to get them smoother with a punic stone, cream, even  using a food grater to scrape off the dry skin, nothing worked. I read  about  this product on a blog somewhere and debated whether it would be a waste of money. Another commenter wrote a  tip about soaking your feet well every day and that&#x27;s what I did. By day 4, no sign of peeling and I was feeling like I had wasted my money, but on day 5, as I was rubbing my feet dry, they started peeling. I continued to soak them for an hour or so every day, then buff with a towel to help remove the peeling skin. Now, my heels are as smooth as a peach. The callus areas didn&#x27;t peel off completely, that might take more applications, but I am very pleased with the results. Now I just have to keep my feet smooth and not let that dry skin occur again. I saved the plastic booties with the tops folded down and clipped to keep them from drying out, so I put them on my feet again just a few days ago. Hope I can get rid of the few tough thick areas.</li>
    <li> Omg! On days 4-5 I lost about 30 years of struggling with bad looking feet. My pedicure lady could not believe the result and ordered a case for her spa. Atfer bathing, I left it on 75 minutes, just to be sure. When I bathed on Day 4, dry skin and the whole thickness of the callouses was falling off in the tub. I had to wear socks to bed to contain it all. By day 6, I had baby feet!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, cracked skin on my heels. I actually use a Dremel with a sandpaper attachment every week or so on them. I also have a prescription salicylic acid lotion from my derm for my feet for when the heels get too cracked. This product did not touch the skin on my heels. It did peel the skin on the top of my feet and my toes. Those areas were already soft and did not really need much exfoliation. I followed the advice in another review for maximum effect and soaked my feet daily (for about a week after the peel) in hot water for at least half an hour. I then could rub the upper sections of my feet and my toes to slough the skin off. I never experienced a true peel anywhere but that could be because I vigorously rubbed off the dead skin on my feet after each soak. If you don&#x27;t have severe skin thickness, this product might work for you. I unfortunately purchased two kits so I will use this product one more time and then never again. The soaking and rubbing are just an ongoing pain and not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on many reviews here in Amazon and YouTube. And actually it does what it say. My feet became incredibly soft and clean. Yes, like a baby skin. I&#x27;m so Happy</li>
    <li> it worked but maybe my feet were just tooo dry so it seemed that it didn&#x27;t peel as much as other people stated but i would love to try it again.</li>
    <li> I put these booties on my feet Sunday night and my feet finally started to peel sometime the following Friday...</li>
    <li> did nothing, took forever and parts were missing&lt;br /&gt;there were no tapes included to hold the flimsy bags closed and on your feet</li>
    <li> I too was excited to try this product after reading the reviews.  Count me in as one of the consumers this product did absolutely nothing for my feet.  I followed the directions and looked forward to the results.  The results never came, my feet looked the same after using this product as they did prior to using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much my feet shed. At first I didn&#x27;t think that it was working but by the 4th day after using my feet were peeling and so soft. It is pricey but cheaper than a pedicure without all of the scrubbing. This is a great pedicure staple. Please sell in bulk.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. It did work however it took longer than 5 days to start and it lasted almost three weeks.</li>
    <li> My friends and I never laughed so hard!  We all had to try this.  We shared photos, texted comments, and the fun of it was gone after a few weeks.  You can get the same result with good foot care, but if you want a bonding experience about what lengths we all go to in the name of beauty, this is it!</li>
    <li> For Valentines I treated myself to a facial,massage and make-over at my local Spa. The lady doing my facial asked if I would like to try Baby Foot I said yes to complete my total decadent experience.  I had bathed before I went to the spa (i.e. pre-soak) and she asked me to use it as part of my facial time. So I sat for 60-90 minutes with it on my feet.  When my facial was complete we washed my feet and rewrapped the footbooties and sealed them with tape to be used again after about a 2 week rest. I enjoyed my day and did not even think about my feet for another week.  On the 7th day from when the procedure was done my feet started shedding like a snake. I was very impressed and sad to realize how badly I needed it! I will re-use my Baby Feet product since I was told it would be OK to do so. I think this may become a favorite girlfriend thing to do and it will make a fun present for others.</li>
    <li> I am on my feet 10-12 hours a day and as a result have thick callous on my heels that crack and bleed. I saw baby foot mentioned on a morning show and deceided to give it a try. WOW, THIS WORKS GREAT. Simple to use, I soaked my feet for 20 minutes prior, put the little booties on, put socks over top to keep in place. Watched tv for an hour, took off booties, washed my feet, 5 days later the skin started peeling off my feet. It removed most of the callous except the very thickest, so 3 weeks later did 2nd treatment (don&#x27;t know if this is recommended or not) and now I have feet as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> Eh... it&#x27;s okay. It LOOKED impressive at first -- lots of peeling and soft skin, but it was temporary. Within a couple weeks it looked like nothing had been done. Not really worth the time and effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to have baby feet</li>
    <li> While my feet looked nothing at all as bad as their photos show it was still nice to slough off  and have nice soft tootsies that have no roughness at all!</li>
    <li> I took a long shower and skipped soaking my feet as directed because i was lazy.  I stuck my feet in the bags for one &amp; 1/4 hours then rinsed them off.  I noticed no change for 2 days.  On the morning of day 3 i saw very little peeling on top of my big toe.  That night i saw very little on the top of my foot.  That was when i came home and showered.  I crawled into bed and moved my foot across the sheet and it felt weird.  I turned on the light and lo, there it was.  Skin everywhere.  I am shocked.  Can&#x27;t wait until morning and tear into my feet.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this needs to be said. Baby Foot is frighteningly effective. I followed others&#x27; advice and soaked my feet for 15 mins. before and after the 1 hour treatment. I tried to soak every day after, but I&#x27;m lazy. In a day or 2, my feet became very dry. There was no flaking right away, but the bottoms of my feet became very ashy, and I felt  like they could crack open. It wasn&#x27;t painful, but the skin felt tight. On day 4, the flaking began. At first it was minor, but then it was insane. Like, seriously insane. I&#x27;m telling you, if that crazy guy from The Silence of the Lambs had had Baby Feet, he wouldn&#x27;t have needed to kill all of those women to make that skin suit. If you&#x27;re a yogi, plan to be in the back of the class for a stint. Nobody deserves to have your dead skin in their face. I see new skin and cannot wait for the final results. Just buy this item, already.</li>
    <li> Awesome, works exactly as advertised, will definitely use again soon.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  this is my 3rd or 4th order.  i generally leave mine on for a few hours (I put the plastic booties on, put socks over the booties and take a nap).  Rinse really well after the 1st use.  And every couple of days, soak your feet for about 10-15 minutes.  In about a week, you&#x27;ll notice the peeling...peeling...peeling...peeling....even the tops of my feet peeled off.  Once the peeling is completed (please dont force it, you dont want to break the skin) you&#x27;ll love the way your feet feel.  Great stuff.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I have super ticklish feet and I hate them being touched so I never get pedicures, needless to say my feet are not the cutest with lots of skin issues.  I used baby foot about 5 days ago and my feet are peeling like crazy and the new skin underneath is smooth and soft, its amazing how well its working.  I must admit its kinda gross the amount of skin coming off but I cant wait until its all finished and my feet are like new!  I will be using this product again and recommending it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Amazing.Gives you baby smooth feet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I began a week ago and followed the directions and the comments of others, i.e., keep the footies on for 90 minutes instead of the hour, and within 4 1/2 days the old skin started sloughing off and now a week later I am totally impressed.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Was not that happy with the product. Was not that effective. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pre-soak, just put the masks straight on, wore them for an hour then washed my feet.  Five days later the bottom of my feet started peeling. I soaked my feet for an hour that evening and took an emery board to the loose skin and voila, &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; enough for a pair of 42-year old feet.</li>
    <li> Although the peeling process is really really gross, it leaves your feet super soft and surprisingly not overly sensitive or tender.</li>
    <li> If you are too grossed out about peeling foot skin, then obviously your feet weren&#x27;t disgusting enough to purchase Baby Foot. This product is amazing. I&#x27;m on day 4 after the soak and the shedding is ON. Soaking your feet in lukewarm water daily is a must. I&#x27;ve been stopping the drain while I shower in the morning and that counts towards my daily soak.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done baby foot twice now and holy moly does it work! I recommend soaking your feet in a tub of warm water and soap or in the bath tub with shower gel for maybe 5-10 minutes because I didn&#x27;t do that the first time and I did the second time and it was far more successful. Bottom line: THESE WORK! You will have shredded skin all over your house so have your vacuum out and at the ready for the week you&#x27;re shedding but seriously it is worth 5 or 10 pedicures for 25 dollar booties.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Results are just like the pictures. I have used it 4 times, and every time it does just like the pictures.. Feet stay soft for a while. I recommend soaking feet in warm baking soda water for about 30 minutes prior to using it.</li>
    <li> We discovered that if you do this, Baby Foot works perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak feet for about 15 minutes in plain water (in a large bowl or bucket or sink or bathtub: whatever holds warm water &amp; both your feet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Use Baby Foot exactly as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash feet with soap and water, rinse, then soak feet again in plain water for about 15 minutes.  So, schedule about 2 hours for the process listed in #1 through #3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. If you don&#x27;t see any sloughing or peeling after 2 to 4 days, then soak feet for about 30 minutes in plain water.  When you take feet out of the water &amp; blot dry, you will definitely see sloughing &amp; peeling.  If you continue to soak for another hour then you will see even more sloughing and peeling that you can begin to rub off.  Sloughing &amp; peeling will continue well-enough for several days without further soaking, and most of the dead &amp; dry skin will come off, BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. if you continue to soak your feet in plain water for 30 minutes to an hour every other day or so, you will continue to see even more sloughing and peeling up to about two weeks AND it will thoroughly remove ALL dead &amp; dry skin from your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two friends &amp; I discovered this after we used Baby Foot once (we didn&#x27;t know about the above directions at that time), and Baby Foot worked perfectly for the one of us who takes daily body-baths (doesn&#x27;t shower), worked well-enough for the one of us who took daily showers &amp; occasional body-baths, and didn&#x27;t seem to work at all for the one of us who Only takes showers (never body-baths).  We were comparing notes a few days after we first used it, and the shower-only friend was complaining that it didn&#x27;t work at all, absolutely no peeling whatsoever, and her feet looked exactly the way they did before she used Baby Foot.  We carefully went over every detail about what we had each done to our feet since applying Baby Foot, and carefully went over the Baby Foot instructions, which included this one little item written only in the little Instruction Manual sheet included in the box, \\&quot;Note: We recommend taking a footbath to enhance the effects BEFORE (sic) and AFTER (sic) using this product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we got out a large bowl, filled it with water, and had our shower-only friend soak her feet for 30 minutes, and voila! the dead &amp; dry skin on her foot looked white &amp; \\&quot;loose\\&quot;, and she rubbed it with her finger and it started sloughing off. She put her feet back in the water &amp; soaked for another hour, and when she took them out &amp; blotted them with a towel there was peeling all over her toes and peeling &amp; sloughing on her heels &amp; the ball of her foot.  The shower-only fried didn&#x27;t soak her feet again, and after two weeks most of the dead &amp; dry skin had come off well-enough.  The other two of us soaked our feet every day (the bath-only friend) or every other day (the occasional-bath friend) for the next two weeks, and both of us ended up with every single bit of dead &amp; dry skin removed, and had completely baby-soft feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At different times all three of us have used it a second time after the initial use (shower-only friend after 3 months, occasional-bath friend after 6 months, bath-only friend after 8 months), we all followed the above instructions including soaking our feet for about 30 minutes every other day for the following two weeks, and we all three had perfect results the second time.  We Highly recommend this product, but also recommend that product instructions be modified &amp; clarified by the marketer.little item written only in the little Instruction Manual sheet included in the box, \\&quot;Note: We recommend taking a footbath to enhance the effects BEFORE (sic) and AFTER (sic) using this product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we got out a large bowl, filled it with water, and had our shower-only friend soak her feet for 30 minutes, and voila! the dead &amp; dry skin on her foot looked white &amp; \\&quot;loose\\&quot;, and she rubbed it with her finger and it started sloughing off.

    <li> Worst purchase I have ever made!  Did not peel at all, not even a flake.. I followed the directions so I can&#x27;t explain what happened or should I say DID NOT happen.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!  Wash and soak your feet for the 15 min.. I LOVE THIS STUFF… OMG!  I have baby skin under all the peeling.. I don&#x27;t like nail places because of the stories… and the product does a better job!</li>
    <li> works wonders on forgotten feet with layers of skin &amp; calouses.  my spouse loved it and so did my son.  men who are always in boots should definately try this.</li>
    <li> I am in my bare feet a lot, so I get dry cracked heels very easily.  I have tried spendy pedicures, files, ped egg gizmos and other spinning sandpaper gadgets.  They worked some, but not like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I tried a patch test for 48 hours before I used the booties.  No issues.  The day after I sat with the booties on my feet the skin felt dry and tight.  Within about 4 days, the peeling process began.  It took about a week for it to finish up, the thickest callouses taking the longest to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t do that I know I will do next time is to soak my feet for at least 10 minutes in hot water to soften up my heels first.  I think that would allow the gel to penetrate better to do its thing.  I did help the process along by soaking my feet and then rubbing them with a wet wash cloth to remove the worst of the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Wow! This thing is AMAZING. I bought two, one for me and one for my husband. We both were amazed at the results. Our feet were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. We both have dry, cracked, peely feet but this changed everything! Will definitely buy again! :)</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  It has been 7 days and nothing has been removed from my feet.  The only change is that they are dry and I have to moisturize them two or three times a day.</li>
    <li> It takes a while but it works pretty good</li>
    <li> Amazing! Skin literally peeled off! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend during flip flop season bc kind of gross until peeling process is done.</li>
    <li> OMG it works!  I was leery because, as everyone knows, there is not a lot of truth in advertising.  So I ordered this because of customer reviews.  I soaked my feet for 1 hour prior to using as others suggested.  And definitely don&#x27;t try to walk with the booties on because of the gel in them.  Within the specified time my feet peeled like they were supposed to and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I would definitely recommend this product and will probably do it again at perhaps 6 to 12 month intervals for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Purchased this a second time, I used it about 2 months ago and just did treatment again as my skin has been getting rough again on heels and tips of toes. Works as it says, def soak your feet 30-60 min before for full effects, and I noticed that the dead skin was easily sloughed off while I was in the shower soaking my feet about a week after...</li>
    <li> I used Baby Foot one week ago, following the instructions to the letter.  I soaked my feet ahead of time and every day since then and have refrained from using lotion.  I had a little peeling on the top of my feet, like a sunburn, after soaking them but otherwise nothing.  The skin on my feet has started cracking and bleeding and it&#x27;s so painful, I can barely walk.  I have tried to contact the company for help, but they do not pick up the phone.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well, it certainly made my foot skin completely peel off. Just be careful not to wear shoes that may give you a blister or do anything that may scratch your feet for the next 2 weeks after you do the treatment. I got a small blister from new sandals and it was pretty tender from the peel. Also, my dog scratched my foot lightly and it ended up cutting me worse than it would have normally.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Baby Foot a little over a month ago.  I gotta be honest: I love the concept but I am disappointed with the results, or in this case... the lack of results.  My feet feel and look much worse now after this treatment.  I have cracks on my heels and my heels feel extremely dry.  It has been over a month since I tried the product and the dryness is getting worse and worse, the cracks are getting deeper and the calluses are getting thicker than before.  My feet were never bad enough to make me so self-conscious about them.  Well, thanks to Baby Foot I am self-conscious about my feet now, and I have to hide them!  Baby Foot lightly peeled my feet in some areas, but took off absolutely nothing from my heels.  The heels looked like they were getting ready to peel, but they never did and stayed in that &amp;#34;half-peeled&amp;#34; state until now. Eventually those &amp;#34;half-peeled&amp;#34; areas turned back into much harder calluses.  And as a result I have painful and embarrassing cracks covering my heels now.  My feet are the complete opposite of Baby feet now.</li>
    <li> Although typically a shower person, I made a point of soaking my feet for fifteen minutes or so each day. After approximately five days my feet began to peel. After ten or so, it was done, and aside from the rough outer edge of my heels (which were particularly bad) my feet were incredible soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is about the wording of the sales listing. I feel like it should say &amp;#34;one set&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;1.2 fl oz per foot x2&amp;#34; as I feel like it&#x27;s awkwardly worded into making a quick glance think you&#x27;re getting two sets. Maybe I&#x27;m a cheapass, but I don&#x27;t think I would have paid $25 if I really comprehended I was only getting ONE set for my feet. My own fault, perhaps, for not reading more carefully, but I can&#x27;t help but feel like it could be marketed more clearly for idiots like me.</li>
    <li> I am VERY pleased with this product. I have placed a second order.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS LIKE ADVERTISED. HOWEVER, A RECOMMENDATION I HAVE WOULD BE FOR YOU TO SOAK YOUR FEET NIGHTLY FOLLOWING THE USE OF THE PRODUCT. IT HELPS THE PEELING PROCESS. ALSO DON&#x27;T MOISTURIZE FEET. MORE, YOU CAN PUT SOCKS OVER YOUR FEET WHEN YOU PRODUCT. ANOTHER GREAT BRAND TO TRY FOR FOOT PEELS IS TONY MOLY.</li>
    <li> I followed the suggestions of the commenters here who recommend a foot soak before and after the gel treatment. During and immediately after pregnancy, my feet were badly neglected and had gotten to the point where they embarrassed me, I didn&#x27;t even want my husband to see them. I had painful, cracked heels and thick callouses built up on the outer corners of my feet. Baby Foot put an immediate stop to that - I suddenly have soft, healthy pink feet again. One benefit is that I discovered that a mysterious pain I&#x27;ve been having in one foot is actually because I have a wood chip or something embedded in my foot!! Apparently it went through that thick callous I had and I never even felt it until it had worked itself deeply in - I&#x27;m seeing a doctor about it this week. It&#x27;s taking some time to adjust to the fact that I can actually feel things with my feet now, but I am so glad to have found this product in time for sandal season.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as stated and the result are results period great product. I&#x27;d recommend this product for those looking to refresh and maintain the apprearence of your feet.</li>
    <li> this works, it can take up to 7 days like it say on the package, but it works and does a good job. Used this as a starter on my mum&#x27;s feet, she soaked her feet and dried them, applied the booties, put socks on for about 1-2 hours, used a pumice as she rinsed the gel off. About 5 days later her feet started peeling and she kept doing soaks and pumice scrubs and her feet look really good....she&#x27;s a nurse on her feet 12+ hours.</li>
    <li> This product did NOT work as promised AT ALL. I think my package was defective. Looking for a refund or a replacement.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  Cleaned and soaked feet for 30 minutes prior to use, then wore product for 1 hr 50 minutes with socks on then placed my feet on heating pad soaking and peeling feet 4 days later amazing!</li>
    <li> It worked well. It didn&#x27;t totally get rid of the dead rough skin, but I think with another application they would be baby feet soft.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product and it didn&#x27;t work. I received a knockoff product. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me how it worked for others.  I was expecting a snake like peel, but instead, it just flaked off, little piece by little piece.  I think that I will stick to exfoliating the bottom of my feet with a pumice stone.  I get better results with the pumice stone, and the process is less dramatic.  My feet looked a crazy mess for 3 weeks using this Baby Foot product.</li>
    <li> It does really work and I have &amp;#34;Hard as rocks&amp;#34; feet.  I really does what it says.  It make your feet peel for a few weeks after application.and then your feet feel really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I love the product!!</li>
    <li> I swear a whole cup of skin came off of my Yabba Dabba Doos!  Left my feet sandal ready!</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money! I followed instructions to the letter on my very calloused feet and 14 days later I&#x27;ve seen no peeling at all. One evening there was a little bit of flaky skin easily rubbed off with a washcloth, but that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> $25 for nothing. My feet never peeled away. I am still staring at dry, sandpaper feet after 6 days.... They sure itched like crazy for a few days, but no peeling...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. It had been 3 days since applying and my feet have not even started peeling at all.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works  great  the best  thing  ever. ..will  definitely  get it  again</li>
    <li> Ok I will come back and edit this review if it works, for now not at all for me I see no difference, i hate buying products with mixed reviews for this reason because I&#x27;m usually on the losing end, and this is how i feel this time.</li>
    <li> I tried this and I love it :) worked very well.. but then when my husband used it.. Nothing happend.. O.O so I guess it work for some but not for all.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  After about 4 days dead skin started falling off!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Needs better instructions but read other reviews and soaked my feet a few days after and saw great results! Will definitely buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product.  I really didn&#x27;t expect the amount of peeling but the end result very pleased with. Repeat customer for sure.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Really will peel the entire foot. Not really doing a whole lot for extremely dry heels.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out. I read about it on another website and I didn&#x27;t believe it worked the way they lady claimed. The dead skin started peeling in three days just as she said. I will use these once a month. They work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I use it about every 6 weeks and it works great!</li>
    <li> the best product for dry , cracked heels. My feet are so soft , already purchased a 2nd box.</li>
    <li> I have never in my life had a product work on my summer sandal calloused up feet like this product! It is exactly what it says BABY FEET SOFT! Now mind you your feet will look like a shedding snake for a good week plus but the results are WELL worth it!! I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t going to work but on day 5 BAM skin peelin all over....I&#x27;d take pics but it was nasty lol.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised. I was skeptical about spending $20 for only one application but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a shot. the peeling started about 2-3 days after I did the treatment and continued for about a week and 1/2. I was worried that when it was done peeling it would be uneven but that wasn&#x27;t the case. It&#x27;s been about a month now and my feet are still soft. I haven&#x27;t even been putting lotion on them everyday and yet they haven&#x27;t appeared dry or cracked. I did give into peeling them even though the directions advised not to but nothing terrible happened. One thing I did notice is now my feet are a bit more sensitive without those extra layers. Thinking of purchasing again and giving it to my mom as a gift.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. I&#x27;ve used this twice over a couple of months, and my feet look great.  My heels tend to crack (especially in winter), and that can lead to infection.  No longer!  I plan to use this every few months as needed to keep the cracks away.  Be careful to use sunscreen on your feet if they will be exposed to direct sun.  I have a sandal pattern on my foot tops because I forgot.</li>
    <li> This just hardly did ANYTHING. I have pretty rough feet and I guess Babyfoot was no match for them.  A week later, I have finally noticed some shedding,, but I&#x27;ll still need to soak it and use a scrub to really get the skin off.  No &amp;#34;snakelike shedding&amp;#34; where the skin just comes off on it&#x27;s own. Maybe I should have soaked them more, I don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> It finally working after two weeks</li>
    <li> As advertised it took a full 5-days before exfoliating occurs (which continues for a week) but the end result its certainly worth it.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this the second I saw what it could do.&lt;br /&gt;No pain during the soaking.&lt;br /&gt;The next two days to follow my feet were a little swollen, and in pain. More of a pain like I have been on feet all day. But that stopped the third day in. I didnt start to peel till day 6, and the peeling lasted a good week or so. But I love this and look forward to my next application!</li>
    <li> This is a good product didn,t have enough I have to order some more.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of them. Did not work very well. the soft part got softer but the rough heels didn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> This fixed my foot problems going on 6 months now. but it is time for another application (this is a man btw)</li>
    <li> If you are going to use this product, definitely use it in the fall or winter when you can wear shoes and socks to hide the gross peeling that your feet will endure for a good two weeks. It did make my feet incredibly smooth, but I only give it one star because my feet only stayed smooth for a couple days and then were right back to where they were before. If you are thinking of buying it, one package will do 2 people. I soaked my feet and then let my fianc&amp;eacute; put the bags on his feet and his feet peeled right along with mine. What a gross process to endure for only a couple days of smooth feet...</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have very dry/itchy feet. My feet peeled but theyre still itchy. But, if you need a something to get rid of your dead skin, this is the product to buy. I was surprised how much my feet peeled.</li>
    <li> It took a few days for exfoliation to begin but when it did, it ate away layers of dead skin. It is not attractive for a week or so. I will do it again in closed shoe weather.</li>
    <li> I love these!  My feet are totally transformed.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable! I can not stop talking about Baby Feet!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband&#x27;s feet.  I enjoyed watching the relief he felt when he soaked his dry, cracked feet.  This is the second box we have purchased.  Will continue to purchase regularly as needed for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Love this products and it really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before but this time it worked in half of the time.My feet started peeling within 3 days!!!  In about a week most of the peeling was done with... I love this product!</li>
    <li> I read about this and had to have it. So, I did what reviewers recommended and I soaked my feet thoroughly first. I left on for two hours. I showered daily and about 7 days later - voila! Admit it was fun to peel. I think I will do this once a year, in the fall, after my little feets are calloused by summer sandals. And stay put when you wear them. I slipped pretty badly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> So cool &amp; so gross at the same time. But my feet feel great. I wish the results lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Everything it said it would , I was shocked lol</li>
    <li> Every good review is true.  My feet were disgusting and now they are soft and lovely.  I&#x27;ve often seen other women&#x27;s feet and wondered how they keep their heels looking so healthy.  Now I know!  The molting process was interesting and totally grossed out my children....an extra benefit in my book ;)</li>
    <li> the best foot care I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It delivered just as promised.  my feet are soft and no longer putting holes in my pantyhose.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My feet have never been softer</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  Skin on my feet fell off after 5 days.  I will be using this every few months for maintenance!!!!</li>
    <li> I loooooooved this! My feet were left in amazing condition and I would definitely do this again. It&#x27;s gross to see how much comes off of your feet but that&#x27;s easy to get over.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  It did a great job, plan on doing it one more time for maximum results.</li>
    <li> This product delivered!! Peeling started day 7.my feet are smooth and soft. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Seriously. I purchased one from another site (cheaper here!) and had read a few reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work that well, but it did if you doubled the time. I got excellent (well, gross, but at the same time, cool) results by leaving this on for two hours. You get a packet of the gel and two plastic &amp;#34;socks&amp;#34; with tape at the ankles. I put the gel on, pulled on the foot bags then added the biggest pair of socks that I could find over all that hot mess and then *carefully* waddled to the bed to my soda and BLT and watched tv, folded a few loads of laundry and read a little. After rinsing, the skin on my feet felt weirdly thicker and ended up a little rougher but that was it. I kept moisturizer and a big pair of socks on for most of the days after (afraid to look). Four days later, nothing...and felt like I had wasted my time. By the seventh or eighth day the peeling began and...just wow. I&#x27;m not patient, hated waiting and really loathed spending that money. And that peeling thing is just freaky...but in the end, the soft feet thing lasted over three months and gave me better results than in shop pedicures. Ok, I admit that I DID go get a pedicure right after just so I could sit in the massage chair, because massage chairs are awesome. :D</li>
    <li> My friend said it lasted about 6 months but it didn&#x27;t, I belive I got about 2 months out of the look. Now my heel look like they always do.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  My feet are so soft and beautiful for the summer!  I bought on a referral and she was right. I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I have bought and used this product for several years. This was referred by another girl that loves it! Amazing!! Great shipper too!</li>
    <li> my second order.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! First time I ordered it, it took longer for peeling to begin than some of the reviews say. I do not have extremely bad rough feet but I have dry cracked heels. It took about 2 and 1/2 weeks before I noticed peeling. I do not believe I soaked my feet in water first. So I highly recommend doing so prior to beginning. However, the peel was incredible once it started. I think my feet were ready to peel sooner I just didn&#x27;t notice it because it was a complete layer of skin to peel off. I would soak my feet in water for 30 minutes every day until I finished peeling. The peeling lasted for about a week and 1/2 to 2 weeks. Now I am starting my second order approximately 3 months later.</li>
    <li> I always had problems with athlete&#x27;s foot , calluses, and dry skin. Doctors would prescribe me ointments for athlete&#x27;s foot and it would help but my feet would still be cracked and ugly. I was always so embarrassed to try on sandals and heels at stores so I never did. I had enough and decided this fungus had to go. I soaked my feet everyday with white vinegar, hot water, and tea tree oil. Then twice a week exfoliated and daily applied my prescription cream. It helped tremendously but my foot was still cracked no matter how much i exfoliated and cared for them. I discovered baby foot and a miracle my feet have neverrrr been better and beautiful. They might not be perfect but I feel so much confident. I can wear flats and try on shoes without feeling embarrassed for my cracked feet. It took two weeks to peel. I soaked every single day. Did not peel it myself at all! Leave it alone. Till the very end my right foot with the fungus never peeled but it was cracked and soo ugly. I carefully peeled off the skin myself. I have photos with my results only of my right foot since my left is perfectly fine. Sorry for the black I dont want anyone to know its me haha. I am highly satisfied with the product although its very messy! be prepared.</li>
    <li> my feet never felt better</li>
    <li> Wish you didn&#x27;t  have to wait so long for the process to be completed, but it did peel like crazy and my feet are soft!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I discovered this product on beauty blogs but wanted to wait until &amp;#34;sock season&amp;#34; before trying them out.  I read some of the other reviews that advised soaking your feet before and immediately after application of the booties.  I didn&#x27;t do it as much as advised by reviewers, so I will probably try that next time.  It took about one week for my feet to begin peeling.  I had so much fun freaking out my friends with my gross looking feet!  All in all, to get ALL of the skin off the tops and bottoms of my feet, it took two FULL weeks.  This is definitely NOT a summer beauty product. Wearing socks and boots helped the sloughing process along.  But definitely do it.  My feet are super smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! My boyfriend and I love how it worked lol 😊😊😎😍😍</li>
    <li> Best product for feet exfoliating.</li>
    <li> My feet peeled so much I got scared . Lol I didn&#x27;t know I had that much dead skin on my feet . This brand is the creator of this product and the generic brands aren&#x27;t ass effective . Definitely satisfied</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I excepted. But I think you should try it and see for yourself. Some people it has worked for. Me it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this product. Obviously it worked, but naturally callouses reappear.  Much better and longer lasting than any pedicure I have ever had</li>
    <li> I have SERIOUS callus issues. The Baby Foot didn&#x27;t take them away completely, but it cleared out a lot of rough skin elsewhere. I will still have to see the miracle workers at my local pedi palace to get my nasty calluses to go away. But the rest of my skin on my feet is very smooth, even weeks after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend giving your feet a good soak before you put the little booties on. I also put the booties inside some old fuzzy slipper sox while I laid in bed reading while they did their work. This was to keep the liquid from getting on my bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on foot size: I have fat, wide, hobbit feet. I&#x27;m a 8 1/2-9 and I barefly fit into the booties. If you&#x27;re any bigger, you&#x27;ll need the bigger size.</li>
    <li> This product did not do what it claims. It did not remove any callouses. It is shameful to charge that much money on a product that does not do what is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The product did remove one layer of skin, but left the callouses untouched</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have tried everything on my alligator feet and this worked!!!I know have amazingly soft feet!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this, because it seemed too good to be true. But, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. The peeling happened one week after I did the treatment and the rough patches literally rolled off. Fortunately for me the peeling only last one day. Peeling may last longer if you dont scrub the skin off. Amazing product. Model approved.</li>
    <li> Ok, guys, so I read all the reviews that I could find on this product before buying it.  What concerned me most were the few reviews from people who said it didn&#x27;t work.  I thought that either they were lying or all the other posters who said it worked great were lying.  Well, the truth lies somewhere in between.  I followed all of the directions to a tee, then waited for the peeling to begin.  It never happened. I was on the fifth day and nothing, my feet were simply dry.  So then I went back and read the reviews here again and decided to follow the advice of one poster who said that you needed to soak your feet in some olive oil and dish soap.  And, that&#x27;s when the peeling began. But, it&#x27;s a lot of work. I had to soak my feet each night for 5 more days before I was able to peel off all the dried skin. But, this product made my feet new again, even the skin around the toes, the sides and the top of my foot came off with my help.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that truly works...this IS IT!!!  I soaked my feet in one of those Johnson&#x27;s Soap foot bath/oatmeal things first and then I put these plastic gel filled booties on and but some non-skid footies over them, be careful walking.  The instructions say leave on for two hours, but I fell asleep and it ended up being three hours.  Not a big deal.  My feet weren&#x27;t tingly, in fact you don&#x27;t really feel anything at all except the slippery gel on your feet.  I took a shower to wash off the gel and then I waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also soaked my feet every other day for the first 4 days in a foot bath with just warm/hot water...I read this could help expedite the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only two days, the top of my feet began to peel.  I was worried at first thinking this was all that was going to happen...but, lo&#x27; and behold by Thursday my toes and my ankles were peeling.  I realized that the thicker the dead skin (ie: rough skin) was the longer the process for that area would take.  Well today, it is now 10 days since I used the treatment and my feed are BABY SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely peeled and so smooth.  Can&#x27;t wait to get a pedicure and get my toes polished and show off my babysoft feet...well, it is winter...so at least I know what I&#x27;ll be doing to get summer ready!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already made my second purchase for summer...because I also read that this is something you will have to continue to do because the skin will get rough again...but it was so easy, so no problem there!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions from a review that said you should soak your feet for about 30min a day and I had great results. I have some really bad calluses so I got two just incase. I have only used one but I can see a big difference already so when I use the next one my calluses should almost be completely gone. Like I sad my calluses where really bad so it may take 3 or 4 times for me but I am really happy with the out come.</li>
    <li> After the process is completed, my feet are beautiful. The process lasts about two weeks (for me) and is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> It gently removed layers of dead skin within two weeks of application without discomfort. I was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
    <li> It worked very well, only downside would be your feet have to be kept hidden for 3 weeks while they peel.</li>
    <li> Baby foot is a great product. I had used previously but this formula seems a little different. More slippery, but effective when used as directed.  I used on Sun Dec 15 and today is Tues Dec 17 and my skin is starting to peel. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Maybe my dry skin wasn&#x27;t dry enough, but $25 later, a tiny short lived peel and still have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Well, I ordered this product hoping it would work. I didn&#x27;t soak my feet before hand for very long ( the directions arnt that good) so after the fourth day with absolutely nothing peeling I was mad that I spent the money. The fifth day oh my god!! I&#x27;m a flipping lizard! It&#x27;s so gross, I&#x27;d take pictures but the skin coming off my feet is making me so sick to my stomach. My toes are also peeling like crazy. I&#x27;ve been soaking my feet now after I read more reviews and it&#x27;s really started the process, like I said the directions are poor but the product really does work...</li>
    <li> This product works AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I have really dry and flaky feet and no matter how many times I go to the nail salon to have them &amp;#34;cared&amp;#34; for, the hard husk on the back of my heels would still be there :(  I received this product on a Monday night. I soaked my feet for approximately 20 minutes before putting the booties on (I soaked my feet in warm water). I sat on my couch with my feet up doing homework for about an hour and 15 minutes. Once I removed the booties and rinsed my feet off, I noticed that it made my feet even more drier than before!!! My first thought was &amp;#34;I  hope this doesn&#x27;t make it worse!!!&amp;#34; For the first 4 days, nothing happened and I started to think that the product was a fail. But then on day 5, the magic began!!!! As I took my socks off to get in the shower, it felt like the whole bottom of my foot fell off!!!!! I felt like a baby snake shedding it&#x27;s skin LOL. I eventually started to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; the process along by peeling any skin in those hard to reach places (like between your toes) and it was pretty gross at times. In all, it took about 2 weeks for the process to end but it was well worth it!! I&#x27;ll probably do another on next month until the summ</li>
    <li> So ive always had really rough feet and ive never been able to find any products that work for me. I almost gave up until i found this! Seriously my feet were in the worst condition theyve ever been in and ive tried literally every cream, lotion, or OTC product you can think of! Finally i came across this product and I read the reviews and thought hey, ive tried everything else lets give this a shot ive got nothing to loose and spring is coming! Man this stuff WORKS and it works FAST! I saw another customer had wrote on here to continue to soak the feet every other day, and thats exactly what i did and i soaked for an hour every other day, boy did it enhance the way it works! You want honest advice, if you have &amp;quot;problem feet&amp;quot; or what i call &amp;quot;dinosaur feet&amp;quot; BUY THIS PRODUCT! You will be amazed at the results, my feet have never in my life felt soft and NOW they are like a babys bottom! Love this and will be buying more for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought this peel because my feet are callused and cracked pretty much all the time, but especially in the Winter. I read the past reviewers comments about soaking feet every night or taking baths and it working better. I didn&#x27;t take a bath every night, but almost every other night and this peel did nothing for my feet. I experienced a little extra cracking the night of the peel and maybe an additional night, but nothing happened during the two week time period that it states in the package. I would spend your $20 on a good exfoliation instead.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!It took a couple of days and it is amazing!</li>
    <li> This was a great product, worked wonderfully! I couldn&#x27;t believe the end result, I wish I took s before picture!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this product because I&#x27;ve tried everything for my feet and cracked heels. This product actually got rid of all of the cracks and calluses that no amount of moisturizer or pedicures could fix. However it took two applications, two weeks apart for me to see baby soft results. Don&#x27;t plan on wearing sandals during the peeling process though. The amount of skin that peels off is pretty intense.</li>
    <li> Did not work.  At all.  I soaked and did everything mentioned in the other reviews.  For me, a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this product after seeing it on GMA. I figured what the heck I had nothing to lose. I have tried every product under the sun to heal my cracked and callused feet but nothing ever fully worked. OH...MY...GOODNESS!! This product is insane! A couple of days after I used it I thought to myself, it probably won&#x27;t work. My feet are probably too bad. Then the peeling started lol. I think I have showed everyone I know the pure nastiness that I find fascinating hahaha!! I will definitely buy again and tell everyone I know to buy it!!!</li>
    <li> After your feet stop peeling the softness will last for about 4 days. After that your feet are back to the way they were.</li>
    <li> If you have callouses, then buy this product!  I use it once a quarter!  You stick your feet in some weird goo for an hour, then a week later, your feet peel like a snake. It&#x27;s kind of gross, wear socks.  Then, about a week later, voila, magic!  Soft feet!  I totally recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Again, kind of weird, but TOTALLY worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work completely, but it got some off</li>
    <li> Works better that a pedicure and results last much longer as well.... Will order again as needed</li>
    <li> wonderful work as they say</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take all of my dead skin off..so I tried it again and same results. I&#x27;m disappointed in product</li>
    <li> Product worked exactly as described.  Very happy with results!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing it featured on people.com. I used it as directed and have yet to experience any results 6 days post use.  I will amend this if that changes in the next few days (today is Dec 10, 2014).  Failing that, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. The process took a little longer than I thought it would but then I just assumed that meant I had more to be removed than the average. This is a definite addition to my normal regiment.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend it! Used it over two weeks ago and my feet are still really smooth!</li>
    <li> Gross, effective, worth it. Do not do this in the summertime or anytime you can&#x27;t commit to 24-hour sock wear for a week!&lt;br /&gt;Took my feet 5-6 days after treatment to peel, but after a long bath on day 6, they were reborn. A month later, I was able to skip a pre-cruise pedi because my heels are still gloriously soft and all of the callousy skin around my toes is gone so a quick coat of polish and I was all set!&lt;br /&gt;I am a dog walker, so my feet take a lot of abuse, this treatment made my feet look beautiful. It did not hurt at any time, just felt dry and rough for the days leading up to the peeling (I soaked them every day and applied no lotion) and after the peeling, they felt soft and glorious. Do not hesitate to buy this! You will be disgusted, but so grateful!</li>
    <li> Make sure you do this in the winter or at a time when you wont be exposing your feet a lot because your skin sheds for about a week or so after you do this foot mask. Did a fabulous job though.</li>
    <li> my results were not as dramatic as some of the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> This. Stuff. Is. Amazing. The only suggestion I have to offer is SOAK your feet for 10-15 min before you put on the booties, and each night after. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product! I run 6 miles a day and it is hard on my feet. I have a shoe getting that is unrivaled so dry cracked heels are NOT an option. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I am now on day 5, my feet started peeling last night after a 20 soak in water.  This morning when I got out of the shower skin was coming off in sheets.  As other reviewers mentioned it is important to soak your feet daily if you take showers versus baths. Although the peeling isn&#x27;t complete parts of my heel are baby soft. Product does exactly what it promised.  I will definitely have this on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> These are awesome  I had my doubts, but after about 5 days the dead skin this started  coming off.  It even did a great job on my heels after wearing flip flops all year.</li>
    <li> Please take the advice of others and make a habit of soaking your feet every day. Hey, it&#x27;s like a foot vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet could have been confused with the bottom of a statue; incredibly nasty, and wearing anything open toed or healed was just never an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked...WELL. The first few days, I didn&#x27;t soak, but around day 3 I took about 10 minutes per day, soaked them in warm water, and by day 4 stuff started happening, 5 I was shedding, 6 I was frantically looking for the vacuum because even a walk to the shower would leave layers of me all around (gross, I know, but it&#x27;s true).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the outer heels...those need additional work; they made fine fine work of it, however a second run of these should make it all better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been embarrassed about my feet for years. I&#x27;m happy to say, I&#x27;m not anymore:)</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this didn&#x27;t work for some people. Either they didn&#x27;t have any dead skin on their feet or they&#x27;re not doing it right. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS for the optimal results and a nightly soak for about 30 minutes everyday or every other day wouldn&#x27;t hurt. Or even staying in the shower a little longer will definitely help get the peeling process going. When I first tried these, it said you&#x27;re supposed to leave the booties on for an hour, but I nodded off and ended up having them on for 2. I&#x27;m convinced that&#x27;s what got my feet peeling so soon (about 2 days after). It worked great in getting A LOT of dead skin off and my feet are loads better than they were, but I think I&#x27;m going to do it a couple more times to get that REAL baby foot feeling. I had a bad callus that is now way softer than any pedicure could ever have gotten it. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs serious foot help!</li>
    <li> It baffles me that this hasn&#x27;t worked for some people.  I was getting impatient because the peeling didn&#x27;t kick in for a full week, but when it started, holy cow.  I&#x27;m barefoot at home and outside, and my heels were just a tough, cracked disaster.  Wish I&#x27;d found Gwin M&#x27;s review beforehand though - her instructions should be included in the product box.  Taking a bath or at least a foot bath first is a good idea, and every day for the duration until it&#x27;s all done. One thing - do NOT peel still-attached skin... if it&#x27;s still connected, it&#x27;s because the layer underneath isn&#x27;t ready yet.  This is not instantaneous; it takes a few days and works a lot better if you&#x27;re patient.  (Be sure to wear closed shoes, socks or tights for a while because trust me, nobody needs to see this action.). When it&#x27;s over, you have brand new feet!</li>
    <li> Initially it worked great, but now my feet are muuuuxh dryer and hard than they have ever been. I never had much of an issue before with this and now I regret having used this product.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as advertised! Beware of grungy looking feet for a week after actual peel begins!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Yes it peeled my feet until they were soft and pink.  I also got a raging cellulitis (skin infection) in both feet a few days later.  I had to go to the emergency room because my feet and lower legs were swollen and red and painful.  The doctor explained that the peel had caused microscopic tears in the skin and as it began to peel a buttload of staph bacteria entered my feet which caused a raging infection.  It is 3 weeks later and I just finished antibiotics, but my feet are still swollen and red. My doctor told me to NEVER EVER do  that again.  So all I can say is use at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Leaves feet soft and pretty. Make sure you soak in warm to hot water before application and every day after to speed sloughing as you will start shedding dead skin. Fast.</li>
    <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER!  As a self-professed beauty junkie with feet that could refinish furniture, I am always on the lookout for new foot products.  This product failed to deliver any of the promised results.  DO NOT BUY........</li>
    <li> The item that was sent wasn&#x27;t the item they displayed on amazon. The item that was sent to me was in Chinese or Japanese but the item i ordered was in English. I felt i didn&#x27;t get the item i ordered. I should have sent it back but kept it and gave it a try. The product didn&#x27;t do anything for my feet. Didn&#x27;t have any peeling at all. It will be awhile before ill make another purchase from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This does not work like the picture shows it just dries and flakes a little. I soaked my feet like some of the reviews say to do and it still does not work. Not happy</li>
    <li> I was very anxious to try this product as my heels are extremely dry. I followed the instructions to the letter. I did see a lot of peeling. But, the driest areas did not peel and only got drier. After I finished the process, I  had to slather on lotions.But, weeks later, the dry spots are still extremely cracked and dry. Also, once you start to go through the peeling, if you don&#x27;t want dry skin everywhere, you pretty much have to wear socks all the time. If you have a similar problem, I would not recommend this product. It may work for some people. But, a pumice stone and lotion would probably work equally well and be quicker, neater and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Several times on the box and in the instructions it says to do a patch test.  Well I would like to know what you are supposed to used for the patch test?  It says once opening the product use immediately, however it says do a patch test and wait for 2 weeks.  So what are you supposed to use for the patch test??  Also there was only 1 pair in the box.  Even though it says x2 it must be one for each foot.  I&#x27;ll update with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: My feet never peeled at all.  They did feel smoother after a week or so but no peeling.  Dont think i&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I expected, very disappointed..</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions closely and observed no change whatsoever. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> First the best \\&quot;HOW TO\\&quot; IMO after using the product every few months for at least a year. THEN my original review. It&#x27;s long to read but detailed ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cosmetologist, so, I know about the majority of the salon peels out there and how to use them. A lot of them are extremely dangerous. BABYFOOT blows those away. Follow these steps for best results. REMEMBER TO RINSE THOROUGHLY AFTER THE TREATMENT. IF YOU FEEL BURNING WASH WITH SOAP. DO NOT ADD LOTION TO SOOTH, SOAP STOPS CHEMICAL REACTIONS OF PEELS LOTION WILL BURN DEEPER. I DO NOT THINK BABY FOOT WOULD EVER CAUSE THIS PROBLEM BUT IN CASE IT DOES KEEP THIS IN MIND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Prepare to relax! Set up a relax station before you get started. Either with a book or your favorite movie (but I don&#x27;t suggest having electronics near water)&lt;br /&gt;2. Prepare a soak using a mixture of 3 cups White Vinegar, 1 dollar store bottle of Listerine,1 cup Epsom salt put it all into the foot bath container and add a tea kettle of boiled water mix with a wooden spoon and let cool until the heat is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;3. Soak your feet for 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;4. While still using the foot bath scrub your feet over it with a prepared mixture of 1/3 cup White Vinegar, 1/3 cup Listerine, 1/4 cup Epsom salt, 1&amp;3/4 cups white sugar. Rinse in the foot bath. Then rinse in clean clear water.&lt;br /&gt;5. OPTIONAL use a ped egg to free the loose skin and expose what needs the magical work of baby foot WASH&amp;RINSE FEET&lt;br /&gt;6. Wear the booties 1 to 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;7. RINSE WITH WATER AND PUT SOCKS ON LEAVE YOUR FEET ALONE, AND LOTION FREE FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;This works wonders. After a few treatments I got the hang of it. Below is my first time experience using BABY FOOT.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dry feet (deep callouses,cracks,sandpaper feeling) so I had to wet my feet for it to work. The product requires patience. It won&#x27;t work instantly it takes at least a week! I like to use two treatments spaced five to seven days apart.I was mind-blown that it actually worked. It is pricey but beauty comes with a price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any one who knows me, knows that my feet are gross...But I am sick of hiding them~ my whole body is a freaking  dry scale. So, in the summer I tell my flip-flops \\&quot;join my dry cracked feet and lets make them cruddier!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve tried everything since age 11 to get luscious/bodacious feet. I&#x27;ve even considered harvesting the dead skin devouring fish found in some high end salons. Being a cosmetologist I have access to every pedi \\&quot;cure\\&quot; in the book. And you know what? They all failed! My feet were soft for minuscule moments and almost immediately dried up again! 16 years of trial after trial later here comes Baby Foot. I&#x27;ve never seen a method quite like this! Baby Foot claims to be a a deep exfoliating foot peel that takes 2-14 days before any results are seen. Scrolling through photos and testimonials it seems marvelously promising. Almost too good to be true actually. At first glance, I thought \\&quot;A very overly priced version of my softening socks.\\&quot;. Yet, I can not get over the before and after photos plastered through out the site! Sometimes beauty comes from the most disgusting of things (child birth for example) lets see if these tired, over-worked mommy soles can be reborn! join me in my 2-14 day journey to newborn feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tops of my feet have started to be painlessly peel and what has been revealed truly does feel like baby skin! The soles are softer, but no progress has happened as for peeling/exfoliation. Lets see how day 3 goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36 Hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 24 hours had my feet itchy and they slightly flaked. Now 36 hours later I took a soak in bubble-less water and dead skin just started to roll off into little beads I took some photos to show you the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 48 Hours I did not see any changes my feet are dry with no peeling left. I&#x27;m supposed to wait 2 weeks before finalizing results but I think the process is done. I&#x27;ll let you know if I have any more progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks and lotion my feet are softer than when I was a child! I&#x27;m hooked!izing results but I think the process is done. I&#x27;ll let you know if I have any more progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks and lotion my feet are softer than when I was a child! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. This product did nothing for me and I followed the directions exactly.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good BUT your feet will peel for about a week</li>
    <li> Works but takes some time. Need to soak feet every night for 20-30 minutes for 5 to 7 days&lt;br /&gt; then rub as much dead skin off as  you can. Would do again. Feet look great after but don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; plan showing them off for till you are done.</li>
    <li> Weird but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> Did very little. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Babyfoot works. My feet had hard thick crust on the heel and balls of the foot. I would get pedicures but they just couldn&#x27;t get all of the crust off. I used babyfoot and it worked. It takes a while before it really starts to work mine didn&#x27;t work for 9 days. My foot peeled and all the dead skin came off as promised.  The thick crust didn&#x27;t peel off but it did get really soft and came off with very little effort using a pumice stone. The back of heel wasn&#x27;t perfect but it looked like I had a pedicure. I did go get a professional pedicure and I finally saw the back of my foot for the first time in years.  It is a great product. Be patient it will work.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this purchase. I followed the instruction perfectly and had some very light peeling on the tops of my feet and got very dry feet elsewhere. No peeling like I had seen on live. Not remotely. Now a month later I just have REALLY dry feet.  I can not believe all the positive reviewers used the same product?I am disappointed for believing there was an easy way to get rid of calluses. I would not give even one star if it was an option!</li>
    <li> the process is not the best - but the affects have now lasted over a month and my feet have never been this smooth. Recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product previously and enjoy the results. But this batch must have been tainted. After 2 weeks, not foot peeling in any way, shape, or form.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it said it was going to do and in the amount of time it said it would. I was amazed how well it worked.  I did soak my feet before the gel application and nightly in a foot tub whirl bath, which is very much so out of my routine BUT it was so well worth the effort and time.  I was sending flaking feet photos to my girlfriends and daughter to &amp;#34;prove&amp;#34; how well it worked.  I  will purchase again and give as a gift to my daughter!  Thank you Baby Feet!!</li>
    <li> First time buyer of this product and absolutely love it.  The peeling took about 1 1/2 weeks to stop but actually fun to take off the dead skin.  The results are amazing. I have beautiful, soft, youthful feet again.  Much better than a pedicure which is very temporary.  My feet have have been great looking now for close to a month and no roughness beginning.  I bought another package just to keep on hand for when I need it.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try Baby Foot …. it does not hurt or take long to have the footies on your feet and is actually quite soothing.  Smells great.  I love in NYC and I am still wearing sandals and therefore very proud of my feet.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I was kinda hoping it would remove a couple of my callouses, but it didn&#x27;t. It just got rid of some of the dead skin leaving my feet much smoother than before.</li>
    <li> really works but takes weeks to finish peeling</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it says!! I LOVED IT!! I would by more!! I recommend this for anyone who want smoother feet and heels without the harsh scrubbing from a pedicure!! :)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. As long as you don&#x27;t get grossed out easily from peeling skin. No pain and it removes layers of dry thick skin, but you do have to peel and scrub your feet.</li>
    <li> it did a pretty nice job. Loved sitting still for one hour!</li>
    <li> Well let&#x27;s say took 10 days for it to start peeling it felt great for those 10 days but on the 12th day it started getting rough again this is a very short-term solution I think a pedicure for the same price is much better</li>
    <li> Crazy how this works!</li>
    <li> Omigosh, this stuff is so good it&#x27;s scary.  I soaked my feet in water for an hour, then left the booties on for two hours while I watched a movie.  After I washed it off, my feet felt very dry, as others have mentioned.  Don&#x27;t use lotion on them.  Nothing at all for four days, then, on the fifth day, the peeling began.  I couldn&#x27;t resist trying to peel it, but you can take off too much and it hurts.  It was like a lizard shedding its skin, it was so dramatic.  Whole sections of skin just came off.  I took pictures, but they are too gross to post! :)  Your feet are so smooth afterwards, and they have a pleasant lavendar scent for over a week.  It easily removes the skin from the bottom, sides and top of the feet, and although it removes one layer of hardened skin on the edges of the heels, you will probably need to do it more than once to get your heels really smooth.  Also, your feet will be more tender if you walk barefoot for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered a few off of beautysage.com and it was GREAT... So great that I ordered 4 more for other family members and I but off of here instead of beautysage. I ended up so disappointed, my feet didn&#x27;t peel at all after using them and it was a complete waste of money. I would never buy from this particular seller again. As a matter of fact I still have two that&#x27;s just sitting around and has been for the past year bc they are no good.</li>
    <li> It did not work. I think my mistake was soaking my feet afterwards, as it washed most of it off.&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I did it, having read many reviews first. Soaked my feet, then applied booties for ninety minutes, then showered my feet, then soaked them again.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting dried skin even on top of my ankles, as I lay down while having the booties on. I did not get any of the lovely peeling skin. This is the eighth day. I do want to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;My best advice is to get the professional foot rasp for about $10 here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Worked as described in the previous reviews.... Some said it took 3-5 days but we noticed shedding the next day! My husband&#x27;s feet were horrible from years of vending indoor/outdoor and factory work. If you are OCD at all I recommend throwing some old sheets on your bed and keeping an old towel handy for you to prop your feet on when sitting so that you won&#x27;t have to vacuum/sweep as much as I did! We are tickled to have found something that actually works! Next best thing to a pedicure, Lord knows I would never have convinced him to go in and have one done.</li>
    <li> it peeled a lot of dead skin off.  I was amazed.  My only complaint is it didn&#x27;t take enough of the thick calluses off of my big toes.  Even still, I really liked this product.  Wish I would have gotten a two pack :)</li>
    <li> It worked amazingly well.  I should have soaked my feet first (which the directions say to do) Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working. I didn&#x27;t think much of this because I didn&#x27;t have a lot of callous on my feet. Six days after I used the baby foot, old callous started shedding. It took several days but all the old callous came off. My feet were so soft it actually hurt to walk on them for a few days.</li>
    <li> Took 5 or 6 days,but it works great!</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff was AMAZING, it was gross and cool at the same time.  I looked at a lot of pictures on-line before I purchased and thought &amp;#34;yeah right&amp;#34; but YEAH RIGHT it did exactly what I saw on-line.  I even took my own pictures because I was so amazed.  My heels are really bad so probably doing it a second time would have been best for me but not doing it now that we are in sandal season.  But still it improved my feet like NOTHING else EVER did!  Highly recommenced this if your have bad calluses, completely painless and amazing.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected, some sloughing, but not enough</li>
    <li> It did what it said it would, I was just hoping it would have gone a little deeper. I have really dry rough feet and thought it would have worked better the first time around.</li>
    <li> Awesome, a little expensive but great for summer feet, in sandals!!!!!</li>
    <li> these things WORK!! It takes a few days I did mine over the weekend and today is wednesday and they are really starting to peel today..The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the are rather pricey</li>
    <li> I realize the company won&#x27;t appreciate this, but I am very frugal. I used a set of these in December and it was awesome. In preparation for sandals I wanted to use this again. I opened one bootie and put it on one foot after soaking. Each bootie is individually sealed. After the time passed and soaked my other foot, I removed it from first foot and placed it one the second one. There was plenty of product in the bootie for both feet and it worked like a charm. It&#x27;s a little time consuming but well worth it. Now, I have one bootie left to apply later 😊</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!</li>
    <li> Came VERY quickly in the mail.  I read the directions and decided to wait until after my 4 mile charity walk to try it out, though.  They recommend you do not do excessive walking during or right after doing the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet in warm, soapy water for about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Slipped on the booties.  Make sure to do one at a time!  Don&#x27;t cut them both open at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I wore them for about 2 hours while I watched a movie.  (I gathered up snacks and a drink before putting the booties on, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to walk around while wearing them.)&lt;br /&gt;After taking the booties off, I rinsed off the gel, dried my feet and put socks on.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet every night for about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My peeling began on the 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;I wore socks at all times unless I was soaking my feet or showering.&lt;br /&gt;My peeling was done in about 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;There was no pain, but my new skin was a touch tender, which is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;Trouble zones were heels, big toe and right below my little toe.  All three areas were MUCH softer.  Not perfect, but they were pretty bad to begin with, so I&#x27;m happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;My husband was rubbing my feet the other night and he commented how they felt much better.&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to do this one more time to get perfectly smooth baby feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend this product!  I HATE putting on lotion, so I never put any on my feet and I go barefoot inside and wear sandals outside most of the year. (I live in SoCal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put up some pictures of my before/after heel and some of the peeling process.  Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I filled the shower with water as i showered to &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; my feet initially. I didn&#x27;t soak everyday like others said. It took 4 days to start peeling but on that 4th day i will say that my feet were &amp;#34;soaking&amp;#34; in my shoes for a couple hours because it was raining and I stepped in a huge puddle. That probably helped it peel. The skin came off in a huge sheet on the bottom! Pretty gross. Huge chunks of skin hanging off. The sides took longer to peel and are flaking off slowly. Not sure if the top comes off too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the bottom of my feet feel less hard but are still not &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; soft. I didn&#x27;t have huge calluses so I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t a bit more effective.  I can stilp feel hard skin around my heel. I&#x27;m thinking about doing it again.  I wish I could target an area... maybe if I scrape the gel out of the boot and apply it where I want, I can do it once a month till its gone.</li>
    <li> It works. Your feet will peel. You must wear socks. It will be gross. Really do try to soak your feet before and in the days after. When it&#x27;s all over, it will only last with proper maintenance. Not a cure all. If you don&#x27;t keep taking care of your feet, you can easily find them in the same condition they were before within a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now.This stuff works. I soak my feet before using them, I think it helps the product work better. I also soak my feet each day about 2-3 days after the treatment. It helps to soften the peeling skin. You will be peeling a lot so flip flops aren&#x27;t the best choice for a week or two afterwards. But once the peeling is done your feet still be so soft! Definitely worth the money, better than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
    <li> okay I must update my review as my last review stated that the product was terrible however after 3 weeks my feet have started to peel ... they should change the expectations in the packaging!</li>
    <li> My two daughters and I did these on a girls weekend. We had fun doing it and they worked great. We spent the next two weeks calling each other to see how our feet were progressing. We&#x27;ll defiantly do them again!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my results, it did take four days but the peeling was very satisfactory and left my feet looking pretty!</li>
    <li> I normally have the kind of calluses that are so tough I can walk barefoot across a bed of Legos, and not feel a thing. I wore the plastic booties for an hour and a half, just in case. After a day, the skin on the soles of my feet turned shiny, and slightly grey. After two days, with periodic warm water soaks, nearly all the callus has sloughed off. I scarcely recognize my own feet they look so pristine, and I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying the surprising softness of my fuzzy slippers, which I normally can&#x27;t feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product regularly, and buying sandals to wear for summer, for the first time in my adult life.</li>
    <li> My feet didn&#x27;t look too bad, so I was skeptical. Plus, despite all the positive reviews, in my experience, I am usually the one person most products DON&#x27;T work for! I followed the directions exactly, and a little over a week after use, My peeling is almost done, and my feet really are soft &amp; pink! There was no discomfort at all, &amp; I placed an order for another box!</li>
    <li> This is amazing! All of these years I have been soaking and filing,etc....I am still in the peeling process, but will def order again before flip-flop weather</li>
    <li> Item arrived as scheduled &amp; in good condition.  Product worked well, however, I agree with a previous post that it is best to soak your feet in the evenings &amp; scrub with a pumice stone to promote the peeling effect off the external layers of skin. Mine did not start to peel until about the 5-7th day with the entire process lasting almost 2 weeks! Other than that, very pleased with this product &amp; will order again if needed.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do. I was very happy with the results.This product is excellent. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this because I had seen it used on you tube and thought it would work well for me. It did not remove the skin on my cracked dry heels. I guess you would need to use several times to get results. I have found something that does work extremely well O&#x27;Keefes Healthy Feet. In less that one week my feet are not cracked and are nice and smooth, it also costs less.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this product really worked.  I need to be more patient next time and allow the skin to peel on its own, but my feet look and feel so much better.  No burning or allergic reaction for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried this because I have seen review from Youtube.  I don&#x27;t really like the out come as my cracking and rough skin mostly on my heels.  After use of the treatment my skin started to peel allover my feet around 3 days later only on the thinnest skin portion first.  When it start peeling it troubled me because is it peels into small part (along the skin lines). I have a medium color of wood floor so I can see my dead skin allover my floor.  End up around 7-9 days later when all old skin peeled except on the rough skin my heels, what a disappointment.  Also I want to mention it is kind of too  strong on top of my feet skin, it burned my skin (it&#x27;s kind of painful with redness and itching and after a month it still have scare  (darker skin color) from the recover.  If you don&#x27;t have too rough of skin usually on the heels, you can try this with care and don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did.</li>
    <li> I like the way it made my feet feel, after the 5-7 days of waiting for it to peel. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try Baby Foot.  I read almost every single Amazon review and followed the modified instructions offered by many reviewers to soak feet beforehand and after using.  While Baby Foot did cause peeling on my feet, it didn&#x27;t really touch any of the drier, grosser spots on my heels.  It also didn&#x27;t cause the mass amount of peeling I expected - I wanted to peel off large strips of skin and that just wasn&#x27;t happening.  After soaking each night (which was a pain), I was able to scrub off a good amount of skin, but it took effort.  Once the peeling was completely done, I felt like my feet just looked okay - not much better than what they were before.  Maybe you have to have really disgusting feet to see the effects of Baby Foot?  I&#x27;m glad I tried it but it&#x27;s not worth the cost to do it again.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to take the plunge.  I read the review that suggested soaking your feet before you apply the baby foot so I did soak for about 30 mins.  It took 7 days to see the peeling begin.  I applied on a Friday and the following Friday morning I noticed major peeling.  I had actually forgotten about doing the treatment until I saw all the peeling.  Against suggestion I peeled away some of the skin and did notice a very very slight burning so maybe the skin is too new and thats why you should not peel.  Anyway I am very pleased, I had cracked heels and it obliterated the skin.  I will follow up with one more treatment and then do it maybe once a year thereafter. The name is right, baby foot because the skin is just like a baby&#x27;s literally.  I am very pleased and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great product, very easy to use.  I read all the reviews; soaked my feet in warm sudsy water for over 30 minutes, dried briefly, then applied product as stated.  Five days later, the peeling began.  I will use again, as a lot of the product seemed to end up on the TOP of my feet (yep, they peeled).  Thinking I will &#x27;warm&#x27; the product (tuck it under my arms while soaking my feet!) in addition to kneading/working as much of the product as possible to the bottom of the bags, prior to application.  I think it worked well enough to be worthy of passing on to others, which I have.  Did not completely soften my two worst spots, or else there would be five stars, but love how well the product worked overall.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my parents so they can experience soft feet. My dad used one as directed but keep the booties and reapplied after 2 days. His feet peeled just like the pictures! I was so shocked and his feet were undoubtedly smooth!</li>
    <li> Great product will definitely purchase again. Recommend it to all my friends and family. After you use you will too.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product.  It works just as it states and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! it works just as stated.I would purchase this product over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are almost ready for the summer thanks to Baby Soft...</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it every 6 months or so!  The peeling is a little hard to get used to at first, but my feet are so soft afterwards!  And it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two days and I am already seeing results. Tuesday night I settled in and decided to do the peel. I had read several reviews online from a few different sites and saw that the people that were saying they were getting the best results were&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)soaking their feet prior to application and nightly while waiting for results (usually bath people)&lt;br /&gt;2)wearing the booties for 1.5- 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;3) NOT putting lotion on their feet during the peeling process&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled out the footbath, towels, socks, wine and laptop and was ready to go. I had taken baths as opposed to showers in the week prior waiting for the peel to arrive, so my feet were getting nightly soak time. I soaked them for an additional 25 minutes prior to wearing the booties (dry them first). Once I had the booties on I pulled a pair of socks over them (a tip from a beauty site that reviewed them) and that really helped. The liquid within the booties squished into all of the tight spots and my whole foot got coated. Plus the two times I did need to get up, I was able to walk (slowly) without the plastic booties sliding all over the place. I pulled up a movie and watched the whole thing, so I soaked for almost two hours. After I cleaned my feet and went to bed. I took a long bath Wednesday and a long bath today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packet tells you that if your feet become too dry, then you can use a SMALL amount of lotion, but I think some people are misunderstanding this and thinking they are supposed to use lotion each night. You do not want to use lotion. This product is going to make your feet dry out, that is what causes the peeling. So it may be uncomfortable, but suck it up and have some dry feet for a few days! The next day (Wednesday) I noticed that the areas that needed the most &#x27;work&#x27; were a bit more sensitive. Today (Thursday) I noticed that my feet looked noticeably worse. The heels were super dry and turning a white color. After my bath, I rubbed one heel gently and a giant, disgusting chunk of skin just fell off. I rubbed the rest of my foot (no scratching, no pulling) and my entire foot began to flake off bits of funky dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 DAYS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this in a few more days and give details on how long the process took for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been30 minutes since I wrote my review. I went to bed and quickly realized that it is necessary to wear socks to bed when using this product! So gross, but it&#x27;s what I paid for. Also looking at my feet after they had totally dried out from my bath made me see exactly how much is peeling. The heels, balls of my feet and sides of my toes look like they have tiny bubble forming under them. Ewwwwww&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Friday Night*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is disgusting- in a good way? I absentmindedly reached down to scratch the bottom of my foot (did notice a slight itch today) and a huge panel of skin as long as my hand and half as wide came off like it was nothing. The terrible calluses on my heels and balls of my feet are peeling in gross thick layers. The ball under one big toe is not quite at the peeling point, but the rest of the area has peeled so much that the variance in thickness is visible to the naked eye. Plus today I started to see all the areas of my foot that I thought were &#x27;ok&#x27; start showing how gross they were without me knowing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soaking is a must. The more you soak, the more peeling occurs. I will suggest that you refrain from peeling when you get in the tub if you are taking baths. In fact don&#x27;t touch your feet at all when you get in the tub. Either wait until the end of your bath and then sit outside of your bath and scrub your feet or shower and use a foot bath for foot soaking and scrubbing. There&#x27;s a lot of skin coming off and you don&#x27;t want it floating in your tub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**April 18 Update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks I thought that it must be finished. Most of the calluses were gone with the exception of a bit on the side of my big toes and the center line of the ball of my feet (those of you that frequently wear higher heels will know exactly what that line is) and I was VERY happy with that. It was by far better than any pedicure result I have ever had. I decided that my heel addiction had left my feet in pretty bad shape and that I would do a second packet in a month to get that last bit taken care of. The thing is...I still am seeing slight peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a month and while I don&#x27;t see peeling every day, and it usually is not much, I am still slowly losing that area by my big toes. I have made sure to use baths as opposed to showers at least three times a week and every time I am able to scratch a bit more off. I lost a huge chunk off the last of the callus on my right big toe today and (sorry, this is so very, very gross!!!) I had to clean out my nails 5 times just from scratching my feet after my bath! I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had these type of long results or if it is just because I left the pack on longer and continued to soak weekly, but this is pretty phenomenal. I will be buying this again in the future.ide of my big toes and the center line of the ball of my feet (those of you that frequently wear higher heels will know exactly what that line is) and I was VERY happy with that.

    <li> this product is amazing. takes several days and then the dead skin rolls off. about every 3 months is a lovely treat for tired feet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this stuff does what it does, and maybe I don&#x27;t want to know, but it has changed my life!  My feet belonged in a horror movie.  I have always loved going barefoot, but that&#x27;s kind of like sun exposure - you might look good in a tan, but you&#x27;ll pay the price eventually.  When I first used it, there seemed to be nothing going on.  You follow all of the directions and . . . nothing!  But about the time you forget you ever tried it, maybe 4 or 5 days later, suddenly you&#x27;re growing a new pair of feet.  The old feet just peel away and, yes, it&#x27;s baby foot time!  I truly think that my feet haven&#x27;t looked or felt like this since I was a baby.  From other reviews I&#x27;ve read, some other products may call themselves Baby Foot but don&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t know.  This worked like a miracle!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it took 5 days for my feet start peeling and they kept peeling for close to a week later. Let me tell you, my feet have never felt so soft!!!!</li>
    <li> I followed all directions and kept these on for an hour, but only peeled slightly on the sides and tops of my feet. The bottoms did not peel at all. I don&#x27;t know if I should have kept them on longer as I have very thick callouses. I&#x27;d love to try it again, but don&#x27;t want to pay $25 again for less than desirable results.</li>
    <li> The product worked...it took 4 days for the foot skin to start peeling. I am just let it peel away naturally. Hopefully the end result will be baby feet in a 56 yr old lady&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..Impossible to leave nature takes its course...foot still peeling after 3 days and it&#x27;s just fun to help the process and peel away chucks of skin.  Be prepare to pass the vacuum a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The heels are more stubborn than the rest I think I will need another treatment after a month or so.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This product totally works and my feet feel (and look) fantastic!  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five star product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid, after reading some of the reviews, when I received my order of Baby Foot. But not to worry!  I will order this again.  And again. And again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE: I also received a package with Japanese writing on it.  More importantly, at the top corner, it indicated it was a \\&quot;size M.\\&quot; I wear a size 10 shoe (well, what can I say, I have a big heart, you know).  One reviewer said she wears a size 9 and had trouble getting her foot into the bootie.  NO WORRIES HERE!  The booties are big enough for an American Size 10 Woman&#x27;s foot, though you still have to be careful putting them on due to the amount of gel inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROCESS: I decided, also based on other reviews, to a) soak my feet for 15 minutes (which turned into 20 because I was catching up on phone calls) before putting on the booties and b) to soak in the booties for 2 hours, rather than the 30 minutes the box recommends. It&#x27;s true that you should be very careful walking in the booties, since the insides are slippery and could make you lose your balance.  Buyer beware! and use caution!  I put some acrylic socks on over the booties, and also wore my rubber-soled sheepskin bedroom slippers over that, and this stabilized things somewhat.  I still needed to step carefully, and so here I am, sitting for the next long stretch until I&#x27;m done \\&quot;soaking.\\&quot;  I think anyone using this product should plan to sit still with a good book or a laptop or TV while \\&quot;soaking.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having the booties on for almost an hour, I felt a slight warmth or tingling in the outer part of my foot.  Nothing to be concerned about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read the review that said the woman&#x27;s box had gel with much less acid listed in the ingredients. Mine seems to be the original recipe, with glycolic acid listed as the fourth ingredient (after water, alcohol and isopropyl alcohol).  Lactic acid is fifth, salicylic acid is further down the line, followed by citric acid and malic acid.  Following those are the herbal ingredients that seem more soothing.  The box I received says nothing about being \\&quot;lavender scented,\\&quot; nor did I detect any scent remotely like lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT: I never had much problem with callouses on my feet until I reached a certain...ahem...age.  Perhaps because my skin is not as moist as it used to be, or perhaps because I have fewer hormones, I have a greater problem keeping the callouses on my heels under control.  My weapon of choice has been one of those paddles you buy at the drug store with the pumice-like surface in two levels of roughness.  I used the higher level on my heels before showering, and always get a bunch of callous shavings off.  Then I put cream on my feet.  I have one frustrating area I can never get to sufficiently: an oval area in the center of the ball of my foot.  The \\&quot;pumice paddle\\&quot; tool doesn&#x27;t get to that area.  I&#x27;ve also used a Dremel with a smoothing head, and, while that works, it doesn&#x27;t get all of it.  I&#x27;ve tried cutting it, with some success.  And I&#x27;ve had the podiatrist remove it, which works best.  I&#x27;m hoping this treatment takes away all my callouses, completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, 2 hours later:  I have now removed the booties and washed the gel off.  I already have quite a bit of softenED callous rolling off of my heels when I rubbed with the towel.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this much would not have come off after a two-hour bath soak, though the longest I ever soak for is about an hour.  I just haven&#x27;t seen it this soft after just a water soak, so I&#x27;m sure the gel is already working. It&#x27;s not a peeling or flaking at this point, just a good amount that rolled off with the toweling. I&#x27;m here with comfy clean socks on, just waiting for the miracle to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Day 2: no peeling yet or shedding.  About 2 hours after I wrote the last update, I realized why some reviewers are saying the product made their feet \\&quot;worse.\\&quot;  My feet, especially at the problem callous areas on my heels and outer edges of the sole, started looking and feeling really rough.  Yesterday and today, the skin feels sort of stiff, and tingly almost to the point of sun-burny, probably because I left the stuff on for 2 hours.  But they don&#x27;t really hurt, just a strong tingly feel. I soaked my feet for about 10 to 15 minutes last night, and towelled them off, rubbing the skin well.  Not much came off.  The heels and sides still look rough today. Socks are necessary today, for sure.  Waiting patiently for the peeling to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Day 4: The tops of my feet are starting to peel.  Nothing on the rest of the foot, meaning the bottoms where the callouses are, where it&#x27;s really needed. I have soaked my feet for 20 minutes twice since using the product, most recently last night.  I have not used lotion, for fear it would interfere with the process.  I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if I will be one of those on whom this product does not work very well.  Wonder what will happen tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Day 6: My feet started peeling seriously last night, the evening of my 5th day.  A couple hours later, they were absolutely shedding.  Huge strips of skin started sloughing off, on the tops of my feet and on the bottoms.  I did read the review suggesting you shouldn&#x27;t pull the skin off, but I could not resist.  I sort of wanted to control where all this skin was going to land.  I did not pull it off if it did not come easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Day 6, the peeling and sloughing continues, though not as wildly.  My heels and that pesky oval callous on each of my insteps are still there, though better, and are rough, not \\&quot;baby-soft,\\&quot; and I am hoping I can look forward to more peeling in those sections.  Otherwise, I will do another session in a month or so - after whatever the recommended waiting time is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Day 7: Late yesterday, a few hours after writing the Day 6 update, I noticed the callouses on my heels were sort of crumbling, but not peeling off.  I decided to soak my feet again, and this time ran hot water into the tub.  It was warm enough that I had to put my feet in and out to get used to it.  After putting my feet in, I did cool the temp down by running some cold water, but still let the water be warm.  I soaked for 20 minutes, then toweled them, rubbing firmly with the towel.  The remaining callouses just rolled away, and I am left with beautiful feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am now noticing that some places on the heels still feel \\&quot;thick\\&quot;, though they look great.  Also, there is still a \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; area on the balls of my feet, in the center where that tough-to-reach callous was.  I think I had a lot more callous build-up than I ever realized.  I am definitely going to order another kit and do this again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this product all 5 stars. (I wish I could give it 6 stars.) It&#x27;s fantastic, and works just as promised.  I&#x27;m wondering if they will come out with a similar product for hands, though, yes, I know you would have to hide away for a couple weeks or wear gloves!  It just would be great to get the thin callouses that form on one&#x27;s hands as life goes on.  The thin, thicker skin that the manicurist does not or cannot remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review again after I try another session, or if there is more to report with this session in the next week.ly at the problem callous areas on my heels and outer edges of the sole, started looking and feeling really rough.

Otherwise, I will do another session in a month or so - after whatever the recommended waiting time is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Day 7: Late yesterday, a few hours after writing the Day 6 update, I noticed the callouses on my heels were sortof crumbling, but not peeling off.  I decided to soak my feet again, and this time ran hot water into the tub.  It was warm enough that I had to put my feet in and out to get used to it.  After putting my feet in, I did cool the temp down by running some cold water, but still let the water be warm.  I soaked for 20 minutes, then toweled them, rubbing firmly with the towel.  The remaining callouses just rolled away, and I am left with beautiful feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am now noticing that some places on the heels still feel \\&quot;thick\\&quot;, though they look great.  Also, there is still a \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; area on the balls of my feet, in the center where that tough-to-reach callous was.  I think I had a lot more callous build-up than I ever realized.  I am definitely going to order another kit and do this again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this product all 5 stars. (I wish I could give it 6 stars.) It&#x27;s fantastic, and works just as promised.  I&#x27;m wondering if they will come out with a similar product for hands, though, yes, I know you would have to hide away for a couple weeks or wear gloves!  It just would be great to get the thin callouses that form on one&#x27;s hands as life goes on.  The thin, thicker skin that the manicurist does not or cannot remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review again after I try another session, or if there is more to report with this session in the next week.</li>
    <li> I bought this about two months ago and to this day nothing has happened to my feet ... absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  The way your feet peel like a snake shedding it&#x27;s skin may creep you out, but once all the peeling is done, you truly do have baby feet.  Soak your feet in a foot bath and dry well before applying for best results.  Do not apply any lotion afterwards untill all the peeling stops.</li>
    <li> I tried this after I saw a review in a magazine.  I thought it would be a fun thing for my stepdaughter and me to do together. I had moderately calloused feet.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all! We soaked our feet for 15 minutes before in warm water, did the 30 minutes in the booties, and waited. It took about 5 days to start---&gt; then about 5 for it all to peel off. Most Excellent!! My feet are now super soft.</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions exactly how they said. Feet didn&#x27;t start peeling until the third day. Just a little here and there on the top and bottom... but &#x27;m nothing on my heels where I needed it the most. Waste of money...</li>
    <li> great results..but your feet PEEL all over the place..I don&#x27;t use this in the summer !</li>
    <li> This product is definitely as advertised, and your dead skin will peel off in sheets 5 days after application.  My heels were especially hard, and it didn&#x27;t get everything, but it definitely made them softer so that my pedicurist could get the rest.  Can&#x27;t wait for the next treatment!</li>
    <li> If you can deal with several days of huge skin peeling this is for you!! It does work GREAT! but a little gross until all that dead skin comes off. Once I did this, it took just a day or two before the peeling begins, so plan to cover up those feet for a week or so!! NO OPEN TOES PLEASE! I got one for myself and my husband. Once the peeling is over, your feet ARE literally baby feet, I would say that lasted for a good couple months so perfect to get you through summer. I would recommend getting the Amope pedi to just keep up the smoothness  or  get a few pedicures here and there too. My husband has terrible scaly feet and this is about the only thing he can use that works!</li>
    <li> My feet look years younger and feel so much softer!  Ladies, you must allow two weeks in your schedule for the complete process!  No open shoes when out and about, until shedding is complete!  Totally, worth the wait!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry feet with dead skin, calluses &amp; cracks.  Baby Foot is a miracle.  I now have decent looking feet.  If I continue to use lotion twice a day, my feet stay moist.  If my feet get dry, I use Baby Foot again to take the dead skin off!  Yes, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;CG, Anarillo , TX</li>
    <li> Ordered this after hearing on Kathie Lee and Hoda...OMG!!  love this product!!  Was skeptical, but after the 5th day my feet were like &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34;..lol</li>
    <li> OK my callouses are bad.  This product is great!  Use it as instructed and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I would recommend that you do it prior to the summer season as the molting of the feet is pretty impressive and lasts for about 7-10 days.  The skin just sheds and sheds.  It would be embarrassing to go out in public with feet looking all peeling and such.  Also, I hear it works on athlete&#x27;s foot fungus.  That doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all as it peels off the skin impressively and it would be a great adjunct to the cream medication for athlete&#x27;s foot, in my opinion--well quite frankly I had good results with that on one foot.  I would also comment that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I followed the instructions on the package but in addition, I put my winter slippers on over the booties you wear.  I felt more stable wearing my slippers with them walking around the house than just the plastic booties.  I am really quite surprised this isn&#x27;t marketed better here in the US.  It would virtually replace a pedicure, save the nail painting.  I have never had a pedicure that has been better than the results I get with BabyFoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the tip*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP:  In between uses, as in every other day, I use shampoo or conditioner on the bottom of my feet and use Gillette Fusion razor to shave the bottoms of my feet.  I have not cut myself once.  It keeps the feet very soft.  For my feet, I spend about 3 minutes shaving and reshaving each foot.  I have used other brands of razors and have found that the Gillette Fusion razor is the best.  After about a month, I switch razor heads.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Sometimes I use just conditioner on my feet instead of shampoo to shave.  Now, with that said, I really don&#x27;t have to start shaving my feet until a week or so after my foot has exfoliated because Baby Foot is so good.  I bought two packages of Baby Foot this time and I can probably shave my feet for about 5 months or so before needing baby foot again.  This is great for pretty summer feet.  Thank me after you try it!ummer feet.  Thank me after you try it!</li>
    <li> First 3 days didn&#x27;t think it was going to work,then the 4th day I was shocked by the layers of skin coming off.Love the final results,amazing.</li>
    <li> Considering all the rave reviews, I thought this would work great. My son used it and barely anything happened. Maybe he has to try it a second time.</li>
    <li> Useless!!!this did nothing for my dry cracked callous feet. I followed instructions to the T. I had such high hopes cause my feet are the worse.@@@@@@update@@@@@... I have to say I was a bit too quick to review, on the 8th day for me my feet started the peeling and hopefully will do what its suppose to do. I will update @@@@@@ update@@@@@@ I take back all the bad things I said. This really works. I found by reading some of the other reviews that soaking your feet or bathing really does make a huge difference. My feet have finally stopped peeling and I have to admit that they are softer than they have been in years. I however still have a little hardness left on my heels but going to get a pedi, I&#x27;m sure that will help.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Really works!!! I use it about twice a year.</li>
    <li> This product, baby foot, actually does what it is intended to do.  However, I gave it a low rating because it was a very messy process.  I soaked my feet on October 3, 2014 and applied the booties for an hour.  I rinsed my feet after removing from the booties. The soles of my feet began to peel 4 days later on October 7, 2014. The shedding or peeling got worse as days went by.  Large pieces of skin was hanging from my feet and it was really gross.  I would find skin in my sheets and on the rug.  The peeling went from the soles of my feet to the toes and then up my ankles.  During this time I had to try to hide it by wearing closed up shoes which I do not have many of.  My skin finally stopped peeling on October 21, 2014.  You can help to peel some of the skin but you have to be careful you don&#x27;t pull and tear living skin.  I just felt it was a messy, awful process.  But my feet are baby soft.  I would not use this product again or recommend it to anyone based on my experience.  However, if your feet are really bad and a pedicure does not help, this product is worth the stress and torment.  It really works.</li>
    <li> I read reviews fervently, followed instructions to a T, but was disappointed with the results. Maybe I expected to shed skin like crazy (so many reviews made it sound so exaggerated) or maybe I had high expectations, but although my feet did shed, it was only thin layers that shed (even from areas that didn&#x27;t really need to shed), instead of where I needed it most. I have had way better results from an aggressive pedicure than from baby foot on a good day.</li>
    <li> Makes my feet feel and look great.</li>
    <li> While it didn&#x27;t make my feet &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; the first time around, I&#x27;d purchase this product again to see the results after repeated use. It gently took a layer of skin off the tops and bottoms of my feet, and it peeled the way that a sunburn peel does. I was a little disappointed that the roughest heel skin didn&#x27;t peel, but maybe that will happen once I try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of advice, though - soak your feet in warm water with epsom salt for about an hour prior to wearing the booties.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I read all of the reviews &amp; suggestions.  My feet didn&#x27;t peel.  Really, really wanted it to work but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Works great! It takes a few days for it to do it&#x27;s thing, but it works.</li>
    <li> It works really well but give it two weeks to fully peel off</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> It was a complete waste of money.  Followed the instructions to the letter and it didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, just go spend the extra 10 for a real pedi.</li>
    <li> This stuff works there is no doubt about that, however, I can&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because of that fact that you will leave a nasty trail of flesh everywhere you go!  I did it and had baby soft feet for a few weeks.  It didn&#x27;t last long enough to make me want to go thru the shedding phase again!</li>
    <li> Excellent did its job</li>
    <li> My wife loves these.  This is my second time to order this.  I am sure I will be getting her more of these down the road.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Do it in Fall/Winter when you won&#x27;t be wearing sandals or going barefoot as you do look like you have some sort of disease going on with all the peeling!!</li>
    <li> After an ill-advised attempt to callous my feet for a modern dance class, I&#x27;ve struggled to get normal, soft feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this, it worked well-enough. Now, on my second time, I know to SOAK SOAK SOAK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak &amp; exfoliate your feet before your first application. Then soak your feet every night.  You&#x27;ll definitely see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peeling process is really messy and ugly, so plan ahead. You&#x27;ll need to wear shoes and socks for a couple of days while you shed, but the results are real!</li>
    <li> I used this product twice, and I got immediate gratification; however after a week my feet were back the same. I will not waste money on this product again.</li>
    <li> This did not do what the description said it would.</li>
    <li> Definitely resulted in a lot of peeling, but I had the same dry spots after as I had before: heels and big toes. I suspect Baby Foot killed off some skin, which peeled, as opposed to sloughing off already dead skin.</li>
    <li> I have really bad foot cracking due to always being in sandals.  I&#x27;m really not ready to give a review because it hasn&#x27;t been a full 2 weeks from application. But I don&#x27;t have any further cracking and pealing and I am beginning to see that my skin is scuffing off.  My husband is a doctor and he has tried every cream available with no results.  So far this seems promising. If it can keep my skin from cracking then I say this is a winner.  I am certainly not going to stop wearing sandals.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve had pretty bad calluses on my feet for about 2-3 years now and I&#x27;ve tried using Vaseline etc... and wearing socks at night while also soaking my feet and using a pumice stone and other tools and that still didn&#x27;t completely help. My feet started peeling about 3 days after using baby foot and it peeled for about 3 weeks straight and right now their pretty much done except for small parts but the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I loved this. There is a commitment, however. As the skin starts to peel away, it is a little gross and don&#x27;t expect miracles on the first day. Soaking of the feet before and after treatment is essential and in my experience, soaking in warm (hot) water for 15 minutes twice a day after treatment speeds up the process (a pumice stone or a firm rub from your hands under running water is also a pretty good tip) In about 1.5 weeks, my feet are truly as soft and callous-free as they have ever been in my adult like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note... once you obtain your desired results, all you have to do is use Aquafor on your feet (wearing socks of course) to bed every night to maintain your newly gorgeous feet.</li>
    <li> I spend the summer in flip flops and as you can imagine my feet are dry around the heels and cracked to he point of bleeding.  I have tried moisturizers  and foot stones with nothing lasting long.  It took me 5 days after I put the booties on but once my heel started to peel my entire foot (the top and around the toes) started peeling off.  The skin is soft my foot is no longer cracked and I am not embarassed and trying to hide my feet.  This product does exactly what it says it will do.  I soaked my feet for 10 mins before putting on my booties and I put ankle socks over the booties for the hour.</li>
    <li> It worked great, except for the heals, still rough, but I&#x27;m going to do it about once a year.</li>
    <li> Oh my god. This is....crazy. I knew my feet could use a good shedding but woooooah, I was not expecting that! Definitely soak your feet for 20 minutes before putting the socks on, and ABSOLUTELY soak your feet for 20 minutes each night after the first application. The skin will ONLY come off if you soak your feet. And when I say come off, I mean REALLY. I was scrubbing at my feet with a loofah for 20 minutes just waiting for it to stop each night. The end result, baby soft foot skin, amazing. It&#x27;s been about a month since I used it and my feet are still pretty reasonably smooth, although the extremely smooth skin feel only lasted about 2 weeks or so. Definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> You will be AMAZED at how soft your feet are after this!  You have to live through a pretty nasty peeling phase (maybe 5 days) but it&#x27;s WELL worth it!</li>
    <li> Little skeptical at first. My feet were in pretty bad shape to begin with,  so I left the booties on an extra hour and a half. Was not let  down one bit,  however. Light peeling began the next day and the rest  followed shortly after. In about a week all the dead skin was gone  and I had normal looking feet again.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> 3x a year, loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  It works exactly as it states.  My feet began to peel about 7 days after the treatment.  You must use a moisturizer as it doe dry out your feet.  Will order it again perhaps when it is on sale.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do if you follow directions and soak your feet in water every night for 5 minutes.  It does take off the dead skin but don&#x27;t use if:&lt;br /&gt;1.  You have to wear sandals or flip flops in 1 week.  Your foot is still peeling and looks gross&lt;br /&gt;2.  You have medical issues with your feet or diabetes&lt;br /&gt;3.  You are a worry wart about being allergic to anything that&#x27;s in there.  Too late, it&#x27;s on your foot and the ingredients are in Japanese.  I had a fleeting thought on this and therefore can&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Works well. Skin as good as new.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I really enjoyed that!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your reply!</li>
    <li> Removes a light skin layer.  If you have thick calluses, you won&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Left the booties on for 2 hours instead of 1, after reading many reviews. Soaked my feet in warm/hot water every day. It took a full week before I saw any peeling. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work since I noticed no change at all! I kept soaking though, and after a week I pulled my feet out of the water, dried them off, and it was peeling! Going on 2 days now of the peeling and it is amazing, just like the pictures. I had really hard rough calluses on my heels and the balls of my feet that are gone and it really is baby smooth underneath.</li>
    <li> Amazed at the results!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product worked well but a little expensive.</li>
    <li> Amazing how it worked. I let my feet soak in these for an hour and about five days later, all the thick skin began to peel off with just scrubbing with my fingers under running water. That lasted about two days then my feet were soooo smooth and not itchy anymore. I plan to do it again soon!</li>
    <li> Totally does what it promises!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My feet feel so smooth after the peeling is done</li>
    <li> Works as said but the process is gross!</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased one for me, and was amazed at how well it works.  Purchased a second one recently for my daughter!! Really works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pre-soak--just followed the box directions. Sure enough, 3-4 days later, the old skin peeled off and new, baby-soft skin was left. I love this product and hope to do this at least a couple of times each year!</li>
    <li> Product worked great! Did everything by the directions, the first 3 days I saw no signs, but literally the 4th day was like a sick joke! The pictures on google are true and not dramatized.&lt;br /&gt;I regularly spray tan myself too so be warned if you do! It&#x27;ll look like you wore socks while laying out for 2 weeks in Bermuda!&lt;br /&gt;But in other words, product works great, it peeled the most whenever I would get out of the shower and walked around while my feet were still moist to really loosen up the skin. It finally stopped peeling after about 8 days.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I definitely buy every year, maybe twice, to really get these crusty feet I gawt back in tip top shape for brighter days!</li>
    <li> Well the product worked perfectly, exactly as discribed. But... There was a x2 after the product discription, and I assumed the $50.00 I spent was for TWO applications. Not so, I recieved one box with one pair of booties. Live and learn!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it says on the instructions.  Many people have said that their feet never peeled.  You have to wait at least five days before you start to see them peeling.  Great product for use in the winter!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first heard about Baby Foot.  I figured it was just another gimmicky quack medicine product like those &amp;#34;detox foot pads&amp;#34; that were the in thing a few years back.  But I kept reading reviews from people who said it legitimately worked, so I figured what that heck?  My feet are all nasty from the winter weather... I&#x27;ll give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it actually ended up working as advertised.  It took about 6 days for the peeling to start, and by day 8 it just looked downright gross (plus I had to do a lot of extra vacuuming while I was peeling), but it worked.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about using it at first.  I have very rough feet but this did the job a must try</li>
    <li> While it did take a thin layer off, it did not do much for the calloused skin on my heels.  I guess my feet just weren&#x27;t so bad that the improvement made a big difference.  My heels were not that bad to start with either - no cracks at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took over a week before any peeling, and then it was more like little flakes as opposed to large sheets that some other reviewers have experienced.  I&#x27;m going to try a heel callous remover next time.</li>
    <li> Great product, baby soft skin. A little messy with all the peeling, but the results are worth the waiting and mess</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband. It worked great taking off the dead skin and the cracks have healed up. Just remember to keep it up with a filing product and moisturizer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised and I have learned I can re-use at least once to save a few dollars. I soak and clean my feet prior to use to get the best result and save the products in a zip lock bag. 2 or 3 weeks later, I re-use to keep those callouses from returning. Keeps dry winter skin under control.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised and delivered quickly!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I love it and have already bought more for myself and my husband!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I am ALWAYS bare foot and thus my feet are SUPER dry. This made so many layers just fall off. Kind gross and kind of amazing. It even smells nice. Definitely will do it again soon.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome !!! My feet have not been this smooth for many years. Great way to start the summer.</li>
    <li> very good product; outstanding company</li>
    <li> how often can I use this product</li>
    <li> Some people have those heavily calloused feet, the heels are in particularly bad shape. My heels are not in the worst shape but they are also not in the best. Before I go any further I will say that I did NOT soak my feet for a while before applying these boots because I tend to have sensitive skin and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to feel some burning or over do it. That said, I kept the boots on for an hour, (after getting out of a hot 20 minute shower)  washed and moisturized my feet, put socks on and waited. It did take about 6 days for me to see anything, but I know that it takes different amounts of time for everyone. My feet then started to peel and it was kind of interesting. Looked like I had put Elmers glue on my feet and was then able to peel it. It was unique, and a novel idea, but my heels are just as rough as before, my feet don&#x27;t look particularly better and frankly I&#x27;m more impressed when I find the right foot cream. The directions say that you may need to use it again in order to get the best results. It also says to never use the same boots twice. That would mean I would have spent 50 dollars to get my feet looking better, if indeed the second treatment did make my feet look that much better.</li>
    <li> completely peeled dead skin from feet</li>
    <li> My feet molted. Now have Baby Feet</li>
    <li> Worked wonders! I&#x27;ll surely repurchase again</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product !!!! I bought some for my sister she loves it too. Highly recommend to anyone with feet issues. Totally does what it says it will do. My feet look brand new</li>
    <li> I followed the directions explicitly, soaked religiously, lousy results.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I used this product to remove some calluses that weren&#x27;t that bad, based on other reviewers results. I wanted my heels and calluses on my big toe and the edge of the balls of my feet to be softer. I followed the directions to the letter. My results? After a couple weeks, what peeled most was the tender uncallused area on the underside of my foot, while the callused part pretty much remained the same. I would say that it did NOT perform as described. I have actually had better results with Pretty Feet, which you apply only to the areas that are callused. Baby Foot has you soak the entire foot in their solution inside a plastic bootie. Also, be warned: don&#x27;t try to walk around with the booties on. They&#x27;re very slippery inside. All in all, I think Pretty Feet is a much more effective product, and way less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love.  You&#x27;ll get baby feet with this miracle mask.  You won&#x27;t believe how beautiful and soft your feet will look after the treatment</li>
    <li> I was really having high hopes for this product. I found it to be just okay.  I followed the directions to a &amp;#34; T&amp;#34;.  After the 5th day I did notice that my feet were smoother, but I had barely any shedding or peeling.  I still have a lot of rough spots on my heels. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> It was great, it have my feet feeling nice and soft. Also my boyfriend likes it. I will be buying it again soon!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Had seen product on Today show...they raved about great results.  I followed directions to the T and absolutely nothing happened.  I have really dry skin on my feet.  They crack and bleed every summer.  Was very excited to use this product and get &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; results and got nothing.  Sad that I spent $20 and nothing happened!</li>
    <li> buy this.  i just couldn&#x27;t believe just how great this product turned out to be.  I was sceptical, i will admit.  i am a busy woman who owns her own landscaping business, and i had resigned myself to a life of work boots and sneakers.  the last time i went to have a professinal pedicure, a look of disbelief and shock came across the salon staff employee.  i could hear her thinking &amp;#34;OH NO!  THE CRUSTY FEET FROM HELL!&amp;#34;.  i felt so embarassed that i left an outragous tip....and never went back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;summer sandles, sling back pumps, peep-toes???...out of the question!  my BABY FEET arrived, and i was so excited.  i followed the instrutions...all but one...i left my highly caloused feet in for an hour and 30 min.  i rinsed.  i waited...anxious of what was to came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i waited, and waited, and waited.....5 then 6 then 7 days....just about when i thought i had wasted my money on a promise of beautiful, soft, lovely feet...it happend.  AND BOY DID IT HAPPEN!  i peeled like a banana, or a snake, or....well you get the idea. i peeled in places on my feel where i didn&#x27;t know i should have been peeling.  even the most meanest of calouses were no match for BABY FEET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just love this product, and i really love my feet!  i can&#x27;t wait to wear sandals this next summer, and i amy going to order a kick-ass pair of sling back pumps that will really rock my wardrobe.  this makes want to buy toe nail polish, put it on, wear it, and then take it off and do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P&amp;#62;S&amp;#62;  a HUGE piece of advise...invest in a purchase of aquaphor...try to wear some socks after application...even if it&#x27;s only for 10-20 min.  it helps alot.  this will keep your pretty feet looking pretty much longer, and also cut down on the number of times that you have to fork over the bucks for this product.&lt;br /&gt;P&amp;#62;P&amp;#62;S  using this product was not painfull at all.</li>
    <li> I have hobbit feet. Sad, but true. The callouses on my heels are thicker than the soles of a pair of Toms knock offs. So, I thought I would give this a try. And sure enough, it exfoliates like crazy. Large areas of skin just sloughed right off after a couple of days. However, my gnarly heels remained gnarly. Actually, the stark contrast between the perfectly soft parts of my feet and the heels made the heels appear even worse. Is this the fault of Baby Foot? No. Will i use this product again? No. Would I recommend this product? Yes, but only to someone who has relatively normal feet to begin with. I&#x27;m back to soaking and exfoliating the old fashion way - shaving off the callouses with a razor blade.</li>
    <li> While the sheer grossness of this product keeps me from saying &#x27;I love it&#x27;, Baby Foot does everything it claims.  The gel feels absolutely disgusting, the skin peeling off a week later looks and feels equally disgusting... but holy cow!... it works.  Totally gross... but I&#x27;ve already recommended it to friends. :)</li>
    <li> It was grossly amazing!! Loved it did exactly what it was expected to do! The actual process took about 13 days.  The only annoying thing was the peeling after the first big peel!! But overall I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> The package was delivered in a timely manner.  I followed the instructions contained in the package and also the suggestions from those who have previously reviewed this item.  However, my experience was different.  Instead of seeing flaking or peeling within 4-7 days I saw peeling/flaking by the 10th day.  It wasn&#x27;t an exorbinate amount and some areas on my feet feel smoother.  Baby feet no!  I will try this product again to see if my problem areas, perimeter of my feet, soften.  But for now...ehhh!</li>
    <li> Kinda gross, but it works super well and got rid of a lot of the dead skin on my feet. For what it&#x27;s worth, my feet were never particularly rough or calloused, but this definitely made them softer, and the peeling part, while a bit gross, was also pretty satisfying.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as described. Both my husband and I have used it and had wonderful results. Your feet will once again feel soft and silky. You can hold your head up when in your bare feet!</li>
    <li> Loved it. I will be using this product once a month until summer.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I put socks over botties and let it sit for two hours instead of one.</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions as written but nothing happened!  Has been 3+ weeks since application.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Yes.  This works great.  I followed a reviewers advice and soaked my feet first and I think it helped.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product works truly as advertised!  My husband found this and I read up on it.  I can&#x27;t believe that I found something that does exactly what it says it will.  The one thing the packaging doesn&#x27;t say, is that to further enhance the product, soak your feet for about 1/2 hour prior to putting the booties on.  My feet weren&#x27;t that bad, but bad enough to have dead skin on my heels and be rough and cracked.  Just about the 5th day I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but I put my feet in a bucket to soak, and thats when I noticed the skin &#x27;falling&#x27; off.....</li>
    <li> I have used both Baby Foot and Grace Foot....first time was Baby Foot. It removed most callouses but not the tough heel callouses. I waited a month and used the Grace Foot. This time it took nearly all the rougher spots off. Both applications began working in 4 days and all the scaling was over 3 days later. So I don&#x27;t believe one brand is better the the other but I do think if you have tough callouses it will take 2 applications several weeks apart.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY GOOD AND THE RESULT WAS JUST AMAZING. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT NEXT TIME I NEED IT.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this product and my feet haven&#x27;t looked and felt this good in years!  I&#x27;m actually no longer embarrassed to walk around with bare feet, and that&#x27;s saying something!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This works great, loved the peeling so gross yet so cool, must do it again, left my foot nice n smooth, baby foot! I Recommend this highly</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product I have the pictures to prove that it works. I soaked my feet for 3-5 minutes then I put the booties on and sealed them with the tape and sat down for 60 minutes as instructed without moving also I put socks over the booties. Within 3 days my feet started to peel by day 5 my entire foot was peeling badly which was a great thing. It looked terrible but it wasn&#x27;t painful at all. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Now my mom and aunt bought it. The only draw back is I had to wear closed toe shoes and it&#x27;s hot here in az in the summer but so worth it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always been extremely embarrassed by my feet. For the first time in recent memory, I am not scared to wear sandals due to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see results for almost 5 days. However, I had read other reviews that it may take that long. I followed the instructions exactly, went to the gym and worked out for at least an hour (sweaty feet seemed to help the process!) and then soaked my feet for about 30 minutes every day for the first week after application. I am now nearly 2 weeks in and am still seeing slight peeling. And my feet look fantastic! Once the peeling stops, my feet will look better than they ever have!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on TV and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I read the reviews first because my feet didn&#x27;t peel very much after the initial application, but I soaked them 2 days later and was amazed at how much dead skin came off.  I have paid a lot of money for pedicures and my feet have NEVER looked this good.  I would recommend soaking your feet for a week after the initial application.  I am giving this product as gifts to my girl friends and will use it again.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever pay for a pedicure again.  Warning-- you will have to reapply nail polish after you use this product it removed mine.</li>
    <li> I probably need to do a couple sessions. Mine didn&#x27;t pull as many layers off as you see in the pics but it did make my feet softer.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written, but I just had to with this stuff! I was skeptical about it and even threw it on a shelf in my bathroom for over a month before even giving it a try. I was certainly happy I did! I continued to be skeptical for about 4 days after I used it, as nothing seemed to be happening. By the 4th day, I noticed some areas beginning to slightly peel and throught, well maybe I will just get a little bit of peeling like some people had mentioned they got. That evening, I decided to soak my feet in warm water for about an hour. From there, the skin began to just fall off! As many mention, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or feel tender underneath, it just takes off those top few layers of skin that are already dead. My feet continued to peel for a couple more days, and each evening I would soak them. About 7 days after I had originally applied the baby foot, the peeling stopped and left me with completely smooth skin on my feet! I have pedicures pretty regularly and they have never been able to take care of the callouses and cracked heels but baby foot did it in a matter of a week. I HIGHLY recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Tried this a week ago - smell was great NOTHING happened after use.  I followed directions to the letter - not happy</li>
    <li> I HAD REALLY BADLY CALLUSED FEET...........THIS PRODUCT ISN&#x27;T PERFECT BUT IT HELPED ALOT!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL USE IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE!</li>
    <li> Like you stated the dry skin started to shed in 5-7 days. Next year will begin the process in Jan./Feb.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have a good 7 days you don&#x27;t want people to see your feet because they don&#x27;t look very pretty!  I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and soaked my feet for an hour every other day or so to help the shedding process.  After 7 days, my feet are much softer than any pedicure I&#x27;ve gotten.  I already bought another one to do this again as needed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. My daughter said it was the best stuff she&#x27;s ever used. I will try tomorrow</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised if you soak your feet first.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it will do, it did. I will be using this every few months. Just be prepared, because you will be peeling for a few days or until you rub all the dead skin off.</li>
    <li> This product works just as it says it would. It just takes about 7 days to start to peel. Like it!</li>
    <li> I was so worried that I would have to wear tennis shoes for a week while my feet peeled. I wore sandals every day, though!&lt;br /&gt;Last Saturday I soaked my feet, put the booties on, let them sit for 1.5 hours, and then wiped it off and soaked my feet in warm water again.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked again on Sunday night, Monday night, and Tuesday night. On Wednesday I noticed that the bottom of my feet were peeling slightly. I soaked them and then gently scrubbed with a pumice stone. That was it! They looked great and I had no peeling after that.</li>
    <li> My only caution is that Baby Foot REALLY works. Skin was still peeling off my feet a week after I tried these, and I do not have a lot of callouses.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying that this did work to a certain degree. Perhaps my expectations were too great as I was hoping it would remove thick built up calloused heels on my husband&#x27;s feet. It did remove some dead skin and his feet peeled quite a bit. However, it really did nothing on the bad callouses. It did make him pay attention to his feet and it did motivate him to want to get rid of the callouses that remained so that was good. I don&#x27;t know if a second application is necessary but, at $25.00 a pop, I think I am going to try something that might be more aggressive. In my opinion, this works about as well as an extra scrub during a pedicure, which at my salon only costs an extra $7.00. I really think Allure was wrong to tout this as one of the top 10 beauty products of 2013.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend  this product to anyone with feet issues. I had severe calluses which would lead to my feet cracking and bleed which at time was very painful. I did have to wait till my cracks were healed however worth th wait.  My feet started peel within 48 hours and continued  for the next 4 days. It seem I left a trail of skin every were I went so I had to wear sock and shoes every day. Following the recommendation  of others I  soaked my feet every night and it did help speed up the process. Because  of this product  my feet are 70% back to normal. One more round will do the trick to get my feet 100%.</li>
    <li> I missed the notation where the product was lavender scented. This is my fault, obviously, but I wanted to warn people with fragrance sensitivities that the smell is very, very strong. By about 30 minutes in, my nose was running and I was developing a headache, and I had to take the bags off. I folded everything up and left it in an unused room until I could dispose of the packaging. Even more than 12 hours later, the room smelled strongly of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that people who try this product maybe put the unopened bag in a warm towel for a few minutes before using. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s something like sticking your feet in sandwich bags of cold, viscous, strong smelling water for an hour.</li>
    <li> Makes no difference after all the hassle. I would not buy it any more and would not recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Totally LOVE this! It took 5 days and a whole layer of skin came off the bottom of my feet. I am so happy with this product and cannot wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It lives up to it&#x27;s name and everything it promises.  My feet feel so smooth after just five days after treatment.</li>
    <li> This product only takes off the first thin layer of skin, something i dont need. what i need is to get the hard skin off but it does nothing to get that off. complete waste of money</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve used this product and when used as instructed it absolutely works.  The peeling doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it does take several days to take effect.  So, if you&#x27;re hoping to have softer, smoother feet for a special event, plan far enough in advance, about 1 week.  My only question is how often one can use this product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! I put the booties on 5 days ago, followed the instructions and NOTHING! NOT A THING has happened. The only thing that has occurred is the tops of my feet are now dry, they weren&#x27;t before.</li>
    <li> Worked!! My feet didn&#x27;t fall off!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week and a half and nothing has happened. I followed the reviews on here saying to soak your feet more often but all I got was a little peeling on the top of my foot. Complete waste of time and money in my experience and my feet aren&#x27;t even that bad so the dead skin I do have should have been affected.</li>
    <li> did not do what it said it was going to do. and i followed the instructions plus read reviews and incorporated those and did not get results</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try these after reading the reviews... but they didn&#x27;t make my dead skin peel. The top of my foot peeled and that was it. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I started to have my doubts, but after a week the old dead skin just peeled off. My feet are ready for sandals or the beach. Now I have to maintain them.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Feet shed old dry cracked skin in about a week, resulting in extremely soft and smooth skin.  I was a little worried that there might be some pain or sensitivity associated with using the product  but there was none at all.  I liked the product enough to buy an additional one for a family member who has also suffered from rough feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no maintenance (no lotion, exfoliation,etc) results lasted about two months for me.  I was hoping for results to last a little longer than they did.  I think I will buy this product again and try adding some routine maintenance and see if that extends the time between treatments.</li>
    <li> I tried this.  I was pretty sure I had athlete&#x27;s foot (gross, I know) and my feet were cracked from running, and I couldn&#x27;t get an appointment with a doctor until after the holidays.  It made the tops of my feet peel but the rest of my feet were still cracked and now bleeding.  I showed it to my podiatrist and he pointed out an acid peel doesn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s healthy tissue or not.  He didn&#x27;t seem impressed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Gormel cream at night (wrapping feet in plastic and socks) and used the ped egg to exfoliate (doc said to do this).  Now my feet look almost normal and I can run/ walk without pain.</li>
    <li> My feel peeled for a week but they were baby smooth after it was over. plus the lavender scent lasted for a long time on my foot like 2-3 weeks</li>
    <li> I used this the year before last around Chriestmas and it worked just as the box said.  I then used it this past year at Christmas without much results.. I&#x27;m not sure why.  Any suggestions or thoughts please reply..</li>
    <li> I bought it 18 days ago and used it 16 days ago. On there 3rd day there was the slightest sign of peeling. Two more days later, nothing. And I still haven&#x27;t seen any results. I&#x27;m so disappointed, I really wanted it to work. Had it worked the way so many reviews suggested, I would have been thrilled and bought 3 more (Christmas is coming) but instead I just wasted $20. I even tried showering about 20 minutes before wearing them because some other reviews suggested soaking feet before using.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Really works!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now. The first time I used it, I followed the review of Gwin (the first one that shows up on my list of reviews). The results were nothing short of amazing and truly disguisting!! I didn&#x27;t realize how much &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; skin I had on my feet and watching it slough off was quite intriguing. It is not a long term fix, but gets you SUPER soft feet. If you keep up on dead/dry skin it shouldn&#x27;t get too bad. It does take a couple days to see results, so be patient. And plan ahead for aprox 2 weeks before its all done peeling to show them off in the summer, going on vacation etc.  If you are questioning this product, I can&#x27;t stress enough that you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was some what skeptical of this, however I have been pleasantly surprised. I have awful looking feet, no matter how much lotion I use or buffing they still look dry and cracked. This stuff worked wonders, after the pealing part my feet look wonderful and feel soft. Definitely do not do in the summer when wearing lots of open toed shoes or flip flops.</li>
    <li> LADIES....LADIES....LADIES! When I tell you this is the BEST thing you will ever encounter to have soft smooth feet HANDS DOWN! You will never look at a pedicure the same. I was a little hesitate at first but this is Amazon&#x27;s #1 BEST SELLER in its category AND it has rave reviews. So I tried it. Super simple to use. You just put on these booties that have a liquid in them for 1 hour. Rinse and Dry. Your feet will peel after 3-4 days for about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its like it removes the entire top layer of your skin leaving you with silky smooth feet! I absolutely LOVE this! The only downside is your feet will peel for about 5 days. Now I just wonder how long it will last. I will update you later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this isnt just for the ladies, its for the men too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link if you want to check it out. I am telling you WELL worth the investment.....So I tried it before you buy it.....YOU&#x27;RE WELCOME! #SharingisCaring;-)</li>
    <li> I have always had calloused feet. I get pedicures but they don&#x27;t get it all and I am still stuck with some rough skin. This is fantastic. I put it on 5 days ago and so much of my rough skin is gone already. I am going to purchase it again when needed.</li>
    <li> Follow everyone elses instructions, and don&#x27;t plan to go barefoot during the week of the peel. I took before, during and after pictures.  Its pretty gross like a science experiment but also amazing because I had terrible splitting cracked and dry heels after my pregnancy.  My feet are pretty again!</li>
    <li> Baby foot is the truth. I applied it and 7-10 days later the dead skin peeled of my feet in easy to remove pieces. My feet were smooth as babies feet.</li>
    <li> This product has not done anything for my calluses. Though I personally would not recommend it, if you are about to use this product there are some very helpful suggestions within the reviews. I suppose my biggest problem here is that customer feedback is much more helpful than the directions on the bag. It seems I could have gotten better results if I had thought to read the reviews before trying the product.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the bomb. I&#x27;ve done it twice now and love how my feet feel afterwards. I&#x27;m weird and like to peel sunburns, so this is right up my alley!</li>
    <li> Fast service, correct product, amazing product! The only product that worked for my feet, way better than getting a pedicure at the salon!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my husband who wears boots 99% of the time and would never set foot in a salon for a pedicure, but he asked me to try it first.  I had great success and was grossed out but completely amazed and satisfied at the same time! It took a full five days before I saw signs of any peeling what-so-ever, but once they started, it was clear this product works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did fall asleep while wearing the booties, so they were on for 2 hours, and I soaked my feet every other day (for a total of 2 times) in warm water for 30-60 minutes because I am a shower-er, not a bather and some of the reviews I read recommended it. Peeling started around day 4, and by day 6 my feet were half peely/gross/covered-in-dead-skin, half new/pink/soft skin. After about ten days, they were &amp;#34;good as new!&amp;#34; My husband is putting the booties on tomorrow, so I&#x27;ll update my review upon his completion of the process.  His feet will provide the ultimate test! :-)</li>
    <li> Did not like this product -- wish I could return the 2nd one purchased</li>
    <li> Update 3/4/16:  I ordered this again expecting the same great results.  It&#x27;s been a while so I was excited.  Again it took days for any sign of exfoliation to begin.  When it finally did it was wildly UNremarkable.  The barely peeling at all process lingered on so I took a pumice stone to it.  After several weeks, ankle socks can slough off skin around the cuff of the sock even though it looked smooth just hours before and this is irritating.  Will it ever stop?  My feet do not feel baby soft.  The thick patches I&#x27;d hoped to address are still very much there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have titled this review &amp;#34;Worked As Expected&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t know what else to expect besides a gnarly skin sock forming on my foot.  There was no odor, no pain, no real discomfort beside the sensation of the skin sloughing off. If you want your feet smooth and pretty for an event I would suggest doing this treatment 2-3 weeks in advance.  It took a few days for the exfoliation process to begin and it didn&#x27;t end completely until 2 weeks after that.  Yes, my feet were baby soft but there were some areas like the big toe and the ball area that had layers just too deep to affect.  I might add that my tootsies get regular maintenance and I wasn&#x27;t ashamed to show them before I used this treatment.  At first I thought I might do this every 6 months or so but now I&#x27;m wondering if every season might be better.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing.  I had cracks in my heals that we&#x27;re getting painful.  I seen the review of this product on YouTube and bought it.  So worth the money.  It takes a while for the peeling to start but when it doe it looks so gross but when it&#x27;s done your feet look brand new and soft again.  When I went to get a pedicure the we&#x27;re asking about the product amazed by the results as we&#x27;ll</li>
    <li> Love this product use it 2-3 times a year. Best product to exfoliate your feet!</li>
    <li> as I am typing this I am wearing these plastic booties with a pair of socks over them to insure that it stays secure. I soaked my feet for roughly 25 minutes, and washed them off. There is  a slight tingly feeling. I actually like the feel of it. The smell of the product is not all that bad. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that it is lavender and such. in fact, now that i&#x27;m really looking at the box there is no indication of lavender scent anywhere like it does in the picture. box is slightly different than posted. That&#x27;s really not an issue for me... I didn&#x27;t buy this for the box.&lt;br /&gt;my shoe size is 7.5W the booties are a medium fit me better than expected. I figured they would be all loose and floppy. there is about half an inch to an inch of room left around my toes. again, my feet are wide, and flat. there is enough room for these to slip on with ease. out of the 6 pieces of tape it came with, I only used one on each foot. the way I folded it over and taped it seems secure by its self. however, putting a pare of socks on is probably a good idea. before I put the socks on the plastic fit loosely and didn&#x27;t seem like all the gel stuff was surrounding my foot. when I put the sock on it pushed the foot juice around my whole foot which in the end feels a lot better to me.&lt;br /&gt;I will post again later to let you know the end result. so far, I am pleased. minus the lavender and the style of box , I got what it said I would get, and so far it&#x27;s feeling pretty darn good on my feet. hope this was of help to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/2/14&lt;br /&gt;update one: It has now been a day since I used this product. it&#x27;s too soon for my feet to start peeling, but there is a noticeable difference with how my feet feel. they feel nice and soft... the calluses on my feet even feel smooth. I hope this stuff works like it says it does...so far i&#x27;m pretty impressed with the overall soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/4/14&lt;br /&gt;update two: my toes are starting to peel. this is good news for me because I am one of those sick people that likes to peel off dead skin after sunburns, HA! my heels are starting to look like they are going to peel soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5/14&lt;br /&gt;update 3: I cannot begin to tell you how awesomely disgusting my feet look right now. i&#x27;m shedding like crazy. my 3 year old keeps telling me I have owies on my feet and persistently asks if he can pick it. this product is definitely doing what it says it does. I think I will wait a few more days before I do another update now. still pretty thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/6/14&lt;br /&gt;final update: 95% of all dead skin has been peeled off my feet. there are some patches that I don&#x27;t want to force off. I just want you all to know that this feels like my feet are feeling textures for the first time... i could feel things with my feet before, but in comparison, everything felt dull prior to using babyfoot. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it well. i guess it&#x27;s just something you need to experience in order to fully understand what i&#x27;m talking about?&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks for reading, and happy peeling.of those sick people that likes to peel off dead skin after sunburns, HA! my heels are starting to look like they are going to peel soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5/14&lt;br /&gt;update 3: I cannot begin to tell you how awesomely disgusting my feet look right now. i&#x27;m shedding like crazy. my 3 year old keeps telling me I have owies on my feet and persistently asks if he can pick it. this product is definitely doing what it says it does.

    <li> It really really works! This stuff was so easy and worked as it was supposed to. I will probably do again in a month and use as a refresher before summer. My tootsies feel soft snd im on them all day! Don&#x27;t be afraid of it. Never stung or tingled. Its far less invasivethan a pedicure at your local nail spa. The girls scrub hard and if you have ever had callus remover its basically the same idea except your feet lose all the hard skin!</li>
    <li> I  was expecting the calloused skin to just fall off,  it softened the skin but that&#x27;s it. You still need to use a pumice stone or callous remover. I will not buy this again</li>
    <li> Good exfoliant. It was about three weeks before the peeling stopped.</li>
    <li> this does exactly what it says! My feet looked exactly like the pics. It takes about 5 days to start peeling and lasts about two weeks. My feet look brand new!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on the callous part, only peels the soft skin, i cant tell you how dissappointed i was. actually peeled the soft skin i didnt have a problem with. save your money for pedicure</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it said it was going to do. I was amazed at how much it started to peel. It only took about 5 days for me to start seeing results. I did soak my feet every other day after application. I would purchase this product again. And recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, which I read extensively before and after purchasing this item - I was really excited to try this out. The package arrived and was exactly what is pictured in the picture. I waited a few days and then took my chance. I put my two year old to bed and got started. I soaked my feet beforehand as many reviewers suggested. The booties were plenty big for my (female, size 9 in US) feet. The gel was cold and it felt a bit icky but I grew used to it in time. As other reviewers said, it is not pleasant or easy to try and walk anywhere in these, so have everything ready at hand before beginning. The smell was not unpleasant. It reminded me of something from my childhood but I still cannot place that smell! It nags at me... My package said to leave the booties on for one hour. My feet are very dry though with large calluses on my big toes from having bunions. My heels were cracked and dry. So, I left the booties on for an hour and a half. After I was done I washed my feet under running water with soap, and went to bed. I never felt any tingling or discomfort. In the coming day and a half my feet got incredibly dry. I did not moisturize them because the instructions said not to.Around 3 days later I began to notice that my feet felt strange when walking on carpet - it&#x27;s hard to describe but it felt like one layer of skin wasn&#x27;t my skin anymore. Like there was a pocket between my skin and my foot. At that point I was sure it was going to work like it said it would! When my foot did begin to peel it was a real let down. It did not peel on the top of my feet at all, despite what some reviews have stated. And unlike the pictures I&#x27;ve seen online, my dry skin seemed to flake off in miniscule pieces. I could not peel them off in one piece. I had to rub my feet to get them to come off. And sadly, there was not baby soft skin underneath. The calluses on my toes and the dry cracked skin on my heels were not affected in the slightest. I was disappointed, to say the least. I have had much more dramatic results with a softening foot bath followed by a callus razor and pumice stone.least. I have had much more dramatic results with a softening foot bath followed by a callus razor and pumice stone.</li>
    <li> No such luck for me. None of the rough areas of my feet peeled only the sides</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I had had a foot surgery so foot  was in a cast unfortunately I used on one foot so,that visible foot looked awesome and peeled like a snake in 4 days well after my foot had gotten taken out of the cast it was dreadfully ugly so I put on the other foot it took a week and a half for it to take effect but when it did it was beautiful thank you baby feet now I have a matching pair of feet</li>
    <li> This completely resolved the dry, calloused skin on my feet.  It did not come off in sheets, but over the course of 7-10 days the skin flaked and peeled, revealing soft, fresh skin!</li>
    <li> Followed instructions to tee and even soaked before/after the peel as well as every other day and did not peel. Made my feet worse!!!</li>
    <li> Lotion is EXTREMELY slippery. DO NOT try and walk around in the booties and DO NOT try to walk on the bathroom floor with the lotion on your feet after application. Take the booties off, wipe the lotion off the bottom of your feet with a paper towel, then go to the bathroom to thoroughly wash them. TRUST ME! I busted my ass. -____- Anyways, it DEFINITELY works! I&#x27;d forgotten I&#x27;d used it freaked out when I saw my skin peeling 3 days later. :D My feet are baby soft now!</li>
    <li> This product works better than I imagined - no more getting my feet scraped at the salon!  Now I can do my toe nails at home and do the Baby Foot as needed.</li>
    <li> This wil definitely make your feet peel. Large chunks of skin will come off and your fret will be soft. It takes 2 or 3 days for the peel to work. You wear little plastic booties with the solution already in them.</li>
    <li> Followed all instructions. Soaked feet every day afterwards - the only skin to slough off was skin on the arch of my feet (which wasnt rough at all) and a tiny bit from my heels and soles. I experienced no peeling like I have seen in many pictures. Worked far less efficiently than a pumice stone, which was the point of buying this product - to avoid using manual exfoliants. Also, the only time I could get skin to slough off was after the daily soak - no peeling occurred for days independently of the soaking. For me, this was a waste of money. I might just buy a high concentration of lactic acid (80%) and use that on my own (since lactic acid is one of the main exfoliants).</li>
    <li> Took quite some time to start peeling, but when it did I was left with nice soft feet for awhile. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, made my feet peel in the course of a about a week, it was nice to have them be smooth for a little while.</li>
    <li> It really works!!!  My feet started 4 days after I wore the booties.  It got a lot of dead skin off but I think I am going to do it again to get the rest off.</li>
    <li> product does everything it advertises.  be patient, as the final shedding of dry dead skin can take as long as two wks, which the product indicates it may take.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift.  This worked for me but took 7 days to really get peeling and took me 4-5 days to get through the peel process so it does require patience.  The pictures on Pinterest will give you an accurate view of what the peeling process looks like if you are wondering.  I will be purchasing this for myself to keep up the results.</li>
    <li> This product is a scam!!  It barely did anything at all!!  My results were nothing like the advertisements.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He said that he didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the money.  It may have helped very slightly but definitely did not put a dent in those heels!</li>
    <li> I loved it!! Left my feet soft and lovely! I would be happy to purchase baby foot again very soon.</li>
    <li> Worked just as advertised. Just wish there was a way to keep dead skin from returning. But feet were so soft once peeling finished.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected, Baby Foot only exfoliated the softest skin on my foot.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will reorder!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it as directed and aside from some minor peeling on the bottom of my feet, nothing spectacular. The price is quite high for the value received. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Takes too long to peel.  I used this two weeks ago and my feet are still peeling.  If it is summer time, wearing sandals, my feet would look terrible with all of the skin shedding.</li>
    <li> I have fought heavy callus on my feet.  I have tried everything out there for 40 years!  This removed all but the small amount on my heals.  I will use it again to finish the job.  I will use this product forever.</li>
    <li> I understand why this is called Babyfoot. A pedicure could not possibly give you these results.  I&#x27;m purchasing again for my hubby. Great Product.</li>
    <li> best ever put the nail saline to shame lol i love it made my feet really baby foot  ; )</li>
    <li> I used the product as directed and also soaked my feet prior to its use. I experienced very mild exfoliation on my feet. I will not be buying this product again nor recommending it to friends.</li>
    <li> i thought i had wasted my money but 5 days after treatment it started working. you may need more than one treatment depending on your own feet and each box has a pair for one treatment. was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My heels were so scaly looking and I had very thick skin on them. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to get smooth heels and they only slightly worked. This works! About a week after application my feet started peeling and peeled for one whole week. My heels look perfect, like they did when I was a teen. Nothing ever hurt my feet, no stinging when applied, no pain during the peel stage. Be sure to wear socks with your shoes during the peeling week because it gets messy with all the skin falling off.</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping from this vendor, product is *amazing*.  Follow the for best results tips people have posted and you will be so pleased with your own Baby Foot feet!</li>
    <li> I plan to use baby feet twice each year so my feet look nice in the summer and are rejuvenated before being stuck in sox all winter.  Some of the reviews I read indicated the callouses, etc. return after a period of time and this is true.  This will happen unless you change the way you walk, the shoes you wear of whatever is causing the callous.  I already knew this so wasn&#x27;t surprised.  My feet did look and feel great after using Baby Foot.  Your feel will peel so you should apply about a month before sandal weather.</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to fix my awful, crusty feet.  Pedicures, listerine, soda, hot soaks, scrubs, anti fungal creams, Vaseline and socks, nothing worked.  This works!! I will never have cruddy feet again.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I was another sucker customer.  Days 1-4 absolutely nothing happened my feet started shedding day 5 &amp; 6.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  I want to do a second round for optimal results.</li>
    <li> When I got this product I immediately used it after I took a shower on May 8. You keep the booties on for 2 hours then after the 2 hours are up you wash your feet and don&#x27;t put any lotion on your feet. I noticed the peeling starting on May 11 around my toes and the 12 I noticed even more peeling starting over my entire feet. Also to help the peeling I soaked my feet everyday for at least 30 mins. As I&#x27;m writing this review I&#x27;m soak my feet.</li>
    <li> My very favorite pedicure product… You have to try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare that I try a product that is a total flop, but this was one. I followed instructions to the letter and soaked my feet every evening. About day 10 (yes, 10), I noticed some very light peeling on the tops of my feet, aaaaaand that&#x27;s all I ever got. Granted, I have less dead skin than average to start with, IMO. Obviously some people have great luck with it. Unfortunately, I was not one of those people. I&#x27;ll stick with my Ped Egg, which does a much better job and only takes about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Have used it three times. Easy to use, works great, love it!  You&#x27;ll be shocked at how much skin comes off.  Wish they made same type of product for face and legs.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY works. After about 5 days, your feet just shed and are soft. Great for hard calouses</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when. I bought this product, but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive so I tried it. The gel smells lovely and feels nice on the skin (no burning or itching). It took about four days for the peeling to start on my feet. Like other reviewers, I recommend soaking your feet, it helped the process along. My feet are now much softer than they were, lots of layers of dead skin are gone. However, I still have some rough patches and callouses that may just have been too thick to penetrate. i wiil probably use this product again.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this, as my feet were really, really dry prior to using. However, it takes 2-3 weeks or more for all of the skin to come off. My feet felt really great after it was all done, but not long after, my tfeet started to get dry again. I think I have more success with the Miracle Stone from beautysage. I will continue to buy this product, but only 2-3 times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. dont do this in the summer if you like to wear sandals. your feet look CRRAZZY!! :)</li>
    <li> Worked great. Feet feel wondeful</li>
    <li> Baby Foot was the answer to my prayers!! My feet were so damaged nothing was working. And I tried EVERYTHING! I heard about this product from a friend who said she didn&#x27;t really get the best results from it but said it helped. I saw all the raving reviews and decided to give it a shot. Let me tell you I was pleasently surprised! Like the box says, it takes 5-7 days to start working so be patient! I would definitely recommend soaking your feet 30 minutes a day for the first week. It allows them to peel a lot more and a lot quicker. Also don&#x27;t go barefoot. I wore shoes and socks during the entire process. Made a huge difference. Try this product and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> After 5 days nothing happened &amp; I was about to call Amazon for refund. Then all of a sudden my entire foot peeled off the first layer. Just as expected.</li>
    <li> I have super thick callouses on my feet from years of dancing and this product got rid of them. I applied on a Friday after a 20 minute soak in a bath (versus standing in the shower). Every day after I soaked my feet for 10 minutes. By Mionday my feet started to peel. I contued to soak through the entire peeling process. By Friday my feet were almost completely done peeling, leaving behind soft, new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peeling process between Monday and Friday was very intense. A few suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;1) Read the pamphlet and testimonials. The info is important!&lt;br /&gt;2) Soak your feet in a bath every day for the best results&lt;br /&gt;3) Make sure your feet are well washed and dried before applying&lt;br /&gt;4) Don&#x27;t forget to massage the product between your toes (after you put the bags on)&lt;br /&gt;5) As tempting as it may be: DO NOT PICK AT THE PEELING SKIN. I can&#x27;t stress this enough.&lt;br /&gt;6) For a bit of entertainment: While your feet are peeling intensely wave your feet in the face of a loved one and gross them out. My husband had nightmares for weeks! Good times!</li>
    <li> This was amazing and my feet have not been this soft and smooth in all my adult life.  If I had not tried it for myself, I would not have believed how effective Baby Foot is.</li>
    <li> Awesome product it&#x27;s as advertised!! It took a little longer for my feet to peel but when it finally did all the dead skin came right off.</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical about this product. I saw it on a buzz feed post and figured id try it out since my feet feel very rough during the summer after walking barefoot all the time. You won&#x27;t notice a difference after you take off the foot bags. The peeling starts 5-7 days after. And beware...they completely peel. It may not all peel at once, but the whole foot will peel. Its freaky, but awesome. My feet are so smooth. Def worth the money.</li>
    <li> Holy cow!  This stuff is great!  My feet were DISGUSTING and this is the way to go.  You will not be able to show your feet until the exfoliation is complete but a small price to pay!  Great product!  I&#x27;ve already ordered another one for next time!</li>
    <li> does pill off dry skin, but not as clean, nice and even as it advertises.&lt;br /&gt;an easy enough product to use.</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully! I am on about day 8 and the most dramatic peeling is done, still some stubbon parts, but my heels and toes and upper foot are smooth as can be! The skin under my arch, which I guess never gets rubbed away. was like a thick piece of leather (sorry to be gross!!) My husband has been complaining about all the skin laying around on the floor. It is pretty groody, and I have to admit, fun to peel!! I don&#x27;t really expect it to be a permanent solution, but it takes off way more than you get in a pedicure. I think if I maintain it, I won&#x27;t have to reapply for a while.</li>
    <li> I am a total fan of this product after the first use! It worked exactly as described and my dry, cracked ugly feet look and feel great. Two months after use they still look great with regular moisturizing. I will be a return customer!</li>
    <li> Have used several products that claim to work on dry skin but in 4 days after use this stuff really comes through and gives you baby feet.</li>
    <li> First time I have tried this product and it worked very well. I did wear the booties all night, instead of just 1 hour.  Most of the thick skin on my feet came off in about 2 weeks.  I do still have a thick area on the side of my large toe, but I plan on using this again in about 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for pampering the feet.  It provides a good amount of moistre and smooths them out.  It also has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I looked this product over a few times before finally purchasing it.  I read reviews and tips from others who used the product and decided to give it a shot.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to use, but I put some peds on over the plastic baggies so I could walk around some.  It was the longest hour of my life.  Once I washed it off, I really didn&#x27;t notice anything different.  I followed what others had recommended in reviews here, and soaked my feet every evening, but after three days didn&#x27;t seen anything happening.  Then, on day four, all heck broke loose.  There was skin coming off all over the place!  I kept up with the daily soak and rolling off of chunks of skin for several days.  Just when I thought it was finally over, more would start coming off.  It was awesome.  The peeling lasted a good seven days.  The down side is that you must keep your feet from public view the entire time.  There is no way to hide what is happening, and it&#x27;s not pretty.  Don&#x27;t plan on wearing sandals in public.  I will likely use this product again (in the winter), but next time I will probably put a little Aquaphor or petroleum jelly on the tops of my feet, as the skin there really didn&#x27;t require a peel and it was itchy and uncomfortable in that area for several days.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and within 4 days your feet will peel and the new skin will be amazing.  Moisturize well and consistently and you can keep this baby soft skin for several months.  I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely works! I was shocked. Even the thick rough callouses on my heels peeled away in one sheet after just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> WOW! My feet haven&#x27;t looked this good for 20 years!  It works better than I could imagine. Totally worth the money. My feet had gotten really dry and rough and even starting to crack. It was embarrassing; my feet looked and felt horrible and nothing I tried did much. And I tried creams, lotions, exfoliators, scrubs, peels, socks. I bought baby foot and followed the directions as described in the most popular review- soak your feet before and after application, and again every day until it all comes off. And boy did it come off. It was pretty gross as you are shedding your skin like a snake. But I don&#x27;t care- after 5 days of gross sloughing I have my former soft feet back again! I will definitely buy this again for regular maintenance. I would give it a hundred stars out of 5!</li>
    <li> Follow other commenters directions and this product works well.  Soak feet in water 30 minutes every day and your feet will completely peel.  I put this on monday night and by friday afternoon my feet were peeling.  It took an additional 5-7 days for the peel to finish once it started.</li>
    <li> its been a little over a week and after a few 30 min soaks as suggested by previous reviewers and lots of time rubbing layers upon layers of dead skin off....my feet are much much softer. Maybe not baby soft but after 40yrs of being barefoot, theyre softer than they have been in years. There&#x27;s still a little peeling going on around the edges &amp; toes but hopefully that will be gone by the end of the week. All in all very happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I had horrible feet before hand. It has complete stripped the dead and rough skin off of my feet. But I would suggest wearing socks to bed and around the house unless you dont mind skin all over your place.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Did exactly what it was supposed to do...remove dead skin from feet and heels and leave them looking smoother, softer and pink!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and just what the wife wanted</li>
    <li> Followed the directions that I read in other reviews about soaking your feet every other day.  Did 1 application and thought it worked well, but my heels weren&#x27;t as smooth as I wanted.  I waited about two weeks and did a second application, soaking every other day and WOW!  really like the way the product works!  Now I will wait to see how often I should do this to keep my heels as smooth as they are so soon after the second application.</li>
    <li> Did not live up to the hype.  Results for me were disappointing.  Some rough skin came off over a few days, but I have to say it was not baby soft or completely callus free.</li>
    <li> it took a week to stop peeling but the results were great</li>
    <li> Peeling started within 4 days but didn&#x27;t seem to get thru the thicker layers of my sole. Toes, top of foot and ball of foot felt very smooth.</li>
    <li> in a world where things just don&#x27;t do what they say they will I am happy to report THIS WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it really worked, but it did say that within the next week the dead skin will start to come off and boy were they right!  I definitely will use again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mother as a birthday present and she loved it. She said she didn&#x27;t know what to expect at all as she had never heard of this before and she as just amazed on how this worked for her. She wants me to get this for her again next year for her birthday. She did have a bit of pain on the side of her big toe due to too much walking on our trip to Disneyland a few days after but she said that was her fault. I believe the packaging clearly states beware of excessive walking after because the skin is very sensitive. I have not tried this product for myself but after seeing my mother&#x27;s results I would like to try this myself one day also! My mother recommend&#x27;s this product to anyone wanting smoother softer feet!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the reviews and checked out others who had used online.  Long story short, it does a great job!  Takes about 8 days before foot skin starts to come off, but be patient, it comes off in large sizes.  Soaking your feet after the process starts helps.</li>
    <li> Happy it came fast. Product did not do anything to my feet at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does as said but immediately the problem areas harden back up, just like when you get a pedicure</li>
    <li> This definitely work. Im going to buy more. I think you can do this every 6 months. That way you can keep you feet really soft. :)</li>
    <li> The shedding part was gross but afterwards my feet were super soft</li>
    <li> Loved it. Works wonderfully</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and advice. I presoaked my feet and followed the directions. I soaked my feet every other night for the following week, but I never got any real skin falling off. I was expecting the big callouses and my rough heels to do something. It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks, and using a pumice stone in the shower would have worked way better!  I should have lit the $20 on fire instead.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed. I did the one hour foot soak before putting the Baby Foot booties on. My feet did not begin to peel for almost a week when I had given up and went and got a pedicure. Maybe the key is to soak your feet a couple of days later. It took a good week for them to peel and not all of the skin on my heels came off.  I went to Sally Beauty supply and bought this stuff called Gena Callous Off. That stuff worked like I thought this would work. I put it on and then used a soft file and it rubbed the hard, dry, cracked skin right off my heels and feet. I even used it on my hands. That stuff is great and if I had to do it over again I would not use this product. The callous off is half the price on here on Amazon and quicker results. I realize everyone is different so maybe some people will have better luck.</li>
    <li> Do Not wash your feet before using this product. It will burn. I used this product once before and the results were great. The second time I washed my feet before using it  and it started to burn so I could not ke it on the recommend time.</li>
    <li> So when I first heard about this in passing I was hoping it would be the answer to my prayers. It seemed like this year my feet were getting worse and worse as I was teaching and working part time retail, so I had 14 hour days on my feet. I hated the rough hard callouses on my feet and scrubbing and lotion did nothing to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read tons about baby foot and finally bought it here. It came very quickly, way before the expected date. I waited until I had the few hours to do the whole process and did what many reviews here  talk about. I soaked my feet for probably half an hour, I do this most days to help with foot pain, and then slipped on the booties, taped them in place, and slipped some socks over them. The socks helped tremendously when I went to the bathroom to rinse. I left the booties on for longer than it said, probably an hour and a half and then rinsed in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no immediate change but it only took a day or two before I saw little bit of peeling around my toss and sides of my feet. I soaked my feet every night when I got home from work as I usually do and on the third and fourth day saw a lot of my feet turning ghostly white like it was about to come off. I think I was the fifth or six day I was at work and on my break itched one foot with the other and felt my skin slough off. Which let me tell you was disgusting and awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I soaked my feet and tons of skin to started coming off! I rubbed my feet with a wash rag and it just fell off. I&#x27;ve continued doing this for the last couple days and  my feet are probably 75-80% smooth. It is even taking off the rock hard callouses on the edges of my heels. There are just a couple spots on each foot that are left but they are lifting around the edges and I&#x27;m sure they will soon be gone as well. This stuff seriously works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy this (and you should if you hate your feet like I did!)  make sure you do what other reviewers and I did, soak your feet before and after every day, leave the booties in for longer than the printed hour, and be patient! I am looking forward to finishing out the two weeks, so I can were sandals without looking like a snake, and I will definitely use this product again if and when I need it!k your feet before and after every day, leave the booties in for longer than the printed hour, and be patient! I am looking forward to finishing out the two weeks, so I can were sandals without looking like a snake, and I will definitely use this product again if and when I need it!</li>
    <li> if you like getting the calluses off your feet, this sure is a fun way to do it.  you put it on for an hour and about 5 days later you begin a 2 week peeling process.  i would not do it in the summer because it makes your feet really ugly for awhile.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  Be sure to soak your feet at least once a day for a week after applying the original gel; this is NOT in the directions but works better AND faster!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet so I can&#x27;t review them. I did read the directions and am trying to plan for a time to use the booties. Will write more later.</li>
    <li> This product sucked.  I don&#x27;t know whose baby feet they are referring to, must be shreks!!!  This product did nothing.  I would have gotten better results with soaking my feet and using creams.  A whole lot of hype for nothing.  Save your money.  It&#x27;s not worth it!!  And I followed the instructions completely.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for myself and also one for my husband.  Both of us had good luck with Baby Foot.  One hour sitting with booties on while watching the news, then a quick rinse.  We both noticed peeling started 4 days after the application, and continued for about 4-5 days.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This may have been a fluke but the booties sent supposedly contain lactic and glycolic acid did not work as claimed. One should have peeling with these two acids . It did not happen. I asked for a refund or a replacement through Amazon. Platinum&#x27;s representative Justine sent me an email that was rude.  I can understand one bad set of booties in the thousands manufactured and I was willing to try it again. However after the email from Justine at Platinum I instead voiced my concern to Amazon. I wanted Amazon to know vendors like Platinum have no place on their site.</li>
    <li> Despite getting monthly pedicures, the soles of my feet constantly produce mega-thick hard, dark, dry heels and skin that my pedicurist cannot get rid of.  I&#x27;ve tried many products like hot wax, Heel-tastic, the Clarisonic pedicure system, Footlogic ... you name it -- which have delivered mediocre and temporary results.  Now, thank goodness for Baby Foot!  This product is MAGIC and miraculously restores your soles to baby-like softness, just as the name implies.  Sit in the booties for one hour (watch TV or play on the computer), rinse well, then wait .... that&#x27;s all you have to do.  For me, on day 5, all of a sudden the skin of my soles started peeling off (like a suntan peel) all by itself, no need to rub or pumice, with no pain or irritated feeling.  The peeling-off period lasted about another 5 days for me after which the soles of my feet were transformed into baby soft  soles --- I don&#x27;t remember a time when my soles looked so fresh, clean, pink and were so soft.  It&#x27;s now 8 weeks later, and my soles look as great as they did right after using Baby Foot.  If this product cost 5 times more, I&#x27;d still buy and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Baby Foot is an interesting product -- you put your feet into gel-filled plastic baggies shaped like little boots and tape them closed.  Put a pair of socks over the top to keep everything where it belongs.  An hour or so later, rinse the goop off your feet.  And stand by.  Within four or five days, patches of skin will start peeling off of your feet.  If you want, you can spend countless hours picking off dead skin, pulling it off in inch-wide strips.  Or you can just scrub it off with a washcloth or exfoliant scrub.  About a week later -- voila!  Baby Feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the one-week sloughing period, you feet aren&#x27;t going to look so good.  They may look like you have a nasty case of eczema or some bad infection.  Your feet will be scaly and flaky and not so pretty.  But bear with it -- they will look great in the end!  Another word of caution -- best not to try walking around much with the booties on.  The gel-filled plastic boot is like a little slippery slide under your feet and it is hard to get traction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained that this doesn&#x27;t do much.  I soaked my feet for about ten minutes before I used it and it worked exactly as advertised.  I will definitely use this again!</li>
    <li> Bought two - for me and Hubs.  Followed directions carefully but I had no results at all.  Hubs goes into a sauna and a steam room every day and he had very slight peeling after a week. I was very disappointed but have since bought the Emjoi Micro-pedi Callus Remover (also from Amazon) and my feet and heels couldn&#x27;t be softer.  Happy the Baby Feet worked for others but thumbs down for me.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm.....shedded  like a snake and underneath was soft skin. I went for my regular pedicure and the ladies could not believe the results I got.....they had never heard of this treatment......will for sure do Baby Feet again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dry, callused, cracking heels for 10-20 years now. Whether due to walking miles each day on NYC streets, wearing sandals all summer, or the dryness of winter, my heels were bad year round. Maybe once or twice a year the cracks would be deep enough to bleed. I&#x27;m sure many of you know exactly what this is like. I&#x27;ve tried SO many things, beginning with basic filing (like a giant nail file), the Ped Egg, full foot gel \\&quot;socks\\&quot; to wear at night \\&quot;impregnated\\&quot; with whatever, heel-only gel booties (to be worn at night), various foot creams with big promises also worn at night with spa socks and also in the day, Heel-Tastic (a waxy great smelling foot stick that did nothing for ME after two months of daily use except for make the dirt of summer New York streets stick to my heels when I used it with sandals creating black greasy grimy heels!), Amlactin foot cream, and both a Pedi-Spin and a dremel grinder.  Ugh!  All labor intensive and simply not effective. The grinders would of course grind off the callus, but somehow my foot skin would then actually be MORE susceptible to splitting :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August this summer I read about Baby Foot and was both skeptical yet cautiously optimistic, and ordered a pack. I took the \\&quot;before picture\\&quot; (which you can see in the customer submitted pictures at the top of the page) while excitedly awaiting my delivery. The after picture that you can also see, speaks for itself.  However, I will note that the after picture represents 4 treatments - approximately one (3 hour) treatment every 2-3 weeks.  At that point my calluses were probably one treatment away from completely gone. Don&#x27;t expect to have 100% callus removal in just one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method: Fresh from a long hot shower, I immediately put on the booties while my skin is still hydrated and soft(ish). Wear them around the house for 3-4 hours. Rinse off with water.  Don&#x27;t bother with slathering on lotion - I experimented with Amlactin foot lotion on one foot and left the other alone, and they both peeled at about day 5-7 at exactly the same rate and amount, the cream did bubkus. Which is good news actually, the less effort and fuss for me the better.  At about 5-7 days the layers of dead callus start peeling (I use a pumice stone in the shower to help it off so I wouldn&#x27;t track it all over my apartment, and because it&#x27;s just so gratifying to watch it all slough off - the box says not to force it off, but go ahead and help it off, just be gentle. I think your nerve endings know if you&#x27;re pulling off skin that&#x27;s not ready!). I discovered calluses peeling from places I didn&#x27;t even realize were callused (the tips of my toes for example), which is all very satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering a \\&quot;teaser\\&quot; pack each for everyone in my family this Christmas - once they try it, I know they&#x27;ll be hooked like me. To finally have smooth, soft heels after all these years (and all the other failed products) is just plain wonderful.d left the other alone, and they both peeled at about day 5-7 at exactly the same rate and amount, the cream did bubkus.

    <li> I really wanted to love this product. My results were ok. My feet are a bit softer. My feet certainly did not peel off in sheets as some have advertised. Instead my feet dried out a lot and peeled of in itty bitty annoying pieces. It took about a week to start peeling and another week or so do stop.</li>
    <li> Okay, I tried baby foot about 6 times in the summer/fall 2014 and then two more in the winter.... and I can honestly say that I hate myself for spending so much money on this product. It works to peel the skin but if you have really bad callus problems (as I did) you will regret ever wasting your money on this. I will tell you right now that you will be looking at a good 12 purchases to get your feet even remotely close to a smooth as a &#x27;baby foot&#x27; foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to last month when I was strapped for cash but REALLY needed my foot-peel fix... so I ordered one box and made it last for two uses by using a single bootie for each treatment. I had to sit twice as long and as I sat I started to think. Thinking lead to questioning myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to question WHY I was continuing to waste my time and money on this product. I mean, at this point I was 8 treatments in and I was STILL just as embarrassed by my feet as I was before I started. They were STILL dry and callused- admittedly it wasn&#x27;t as bad as before I used it but it sure as hell wasn&#x27;t a baby smooth foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sulking and thinking about how much money I wasted using their product the past 8 times I decided to search for alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then found this thing from &#x27;Etude House&#x27; called bebe foot mask pack. It was roughly 7 dollars total for one treatment with free shipping and I was skeptical but figured what harm could trying it do. The worst case scenario would be that it does nothing and I blow 7 bucks, best case it works as well as baby foot and I can get three treatments of theirs for the price of ONE box of baby foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased from another popular auction-based site since it was 3 dollars cheaper there with free shipping) and surprise, surprise it ended up working BETTER in ONE USE than baby foot did in five+ uses... and it is 1/3rd the price. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morale of the story? This stuff is way too overpriced and overall not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve found something that works better for about $7 a treatment I won&#x27;t be back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks anyway, baby foot. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- For Those Who Want To Get The Most From Baby Foot Treatments --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you DO decide to purchase this I will suggest SOAK YOUR FEET before using it.

    <li> Doesnt work as indicated. It works a little but not much wpetter than a regular pedicure. I wouldnt ourchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased this multiple times now.  Living in Florida and wearing flip flops or bare feet most of the time &#x3D; cracked dry feet.  The first time I used it I noticed a significant difference.  I still have a few hard and cracked areas so I&#x27;m going to try another treatment to finish it off!</li>
    <li> This product is miraculous! My mom and I both had excellent results Just pre-soak your feet for a half hour or so before application, and leave hte booties (covered with warm socks) on longer than the recommended one hour--even two hours is fine. In about three days, your feet will begin to peel--even in unexpected areas like the arches and up the sides. Soak your feet daily for that first week after application, then help the painless peel along if you like--as you would with a sunburn (for those of us who remember sunburns!) . You will end up with the smoothest, softest feet you can imagine! Just like a baby&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I tried this product 5 days ago. So far, so good. I&#x27;ll try to keep this review going.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day 1 - I didn&#x27;t feel much and was a bit worried.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day 2 - I noticed a little cracking.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day 3 - The peeling started. Not a lot at first. But probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use in the summer during sandal season.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day 4&amp;5 - All I can say is WOW!  I&#x27;m impressed. The dry skin is peeling away and I&#x27;m seeing nice pink skin peeking through.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day 6&amp;7 - I cannot believe how much dead skin is peeling away. It&#x27;s kind of gross. Have to wear slippers or socks,  for sure.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day 8&amp;9 - I scrubbed the dead skin today. Seems to be less on the bottom and now on the sides and top.&lt;br /&gt;  * Day12 - most of the dead skin is gone. Feet are so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would truly recommend this product. I plan to try again in a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you have the same results.</li>
    <li> I have had some feet issues for a while. Growing up I was a dancer, and though it has ben a while, your feet are never really the same.&lt;br /&gt;I got Baby Foot it hopes that it would eliminate the damage that was done to my feet. And it absolutely did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a product for quite a while, and saw an ad for callous clear. After going online and doing some research I found that callous clear had an overwhelming amount of bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But during my research baby foot came up. I did more research on this product, and found youtube channels of people who tried baby foot and got good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 2 plastic booties for which you cut the tops of and insert your foot, and tape to keep the bootie tight and in place.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are on the larger side so if you exceed a 12 in Women&#x27;s or 10 in mens, I do not think you will be able to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;According to the directions in my box it says to leave your feet in the booties for 2 hours. Prior to putting the booties on I took a shower and made sure that my feet were damp.&lt;br /&gt;It was suggested by others that wetting your feet helps the process&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no overwhelming chemical sent. Which I had been concerned about since my foot would be in there for such an extended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;After the two hours were up I rinsed my feet off with soap and water, and dried them.&lt;br /&gt;According the directions the product should take effect within 2-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;When it came to day 3, &amp; 4, I did not see andy change in my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned based upon some of the reviews that said that it did not work for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However day 6 I noticed that my feet were very dry. And to be completely honest I forgot that I had even used baby foot.&lt;br /&gt;It has been exactly 7 days today since I have applied the product.&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the shower today, I went to dry my feet and noticed large amounts of skin peeling off. And underneath is literally baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I know the pictures are quite grotesque, but it seriously it looks exactly like the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will being to peel and fall off.&lt;br /&gt;The directions do mention lightly rubbing your feet with a towel to help the process.&lt;br /&gt;Now that my feet are completely dry the skin is not coming off as much.&lt;br /&gt;So I suggest after showering while the dead skin is moist to begin the towel method to help the process along.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely see that it is working on my foot.&lt;br /&gt;The box says that it will continue to peel for 2-3 weeks, so I will update with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not see results right away give it time. It is working !!!ally baby soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I know the pictures are quite grotesque, but it seriously it looks exactly like the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will being to peel and fall off.&lt;br /&gt;The directions do mention lightly rubbing your feet with a towel to help the process.&lt;br /&gt;Now that my feet are completely dry the skin is not coming off as much.&lt;br /&gt;So I suggest after showering while the dead skin is moist to begin the towel method to help the process along.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely see that it is working on my foot.&lt;br /&gt;The box says that it will continue to peel for 2-3 weeks, so I will update with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not see results right away give it time. It is working !!!</li>
    <li> T was really looking forward to this product. Read all the reviews, so gave it a try. Followed all directions. And nothing, feet remained in  the same conidition as before application of product.  Perhaps a bad box? I dont know. Just dissappointed!</li>
    <li> Perfect peeled my feet within a week I was so pleased</li>
    <li> Revived my problem feet. I&#x27;m amazed. Will be doing this at least twice a year!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe my feet are too rough... I did everything that other reviewers said, Soaked feet, kept on my feet with minimal walking for 2 hours... and nothing... Well, I ordered a second package (it states there that it might be needed), so hope it will work then.</li>
    <li> Works great but soak your feet for about an hour first. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a huge hit for me. It doesn&#x27;t work exactly as advertised and let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been hesitant about getting pedicures because even after they sand down my heels they&#x27;re still pretty thick and gross and I even keep a pumice stone in my shower for everyday maintenance but still my feet are thick and callused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I bought this at a Japanese market and then looked on Amazon for some reviews about the product. Based on the advice of others, I presoaked my feet and then applied these bad boys as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, it&#x27;s true they don&#x27;t instantly peel off. It took several days for the full effect to be in place. First it started with the thinner skinned parts of my feet then eventually my thick calluses also rubbed off. And it did take some effort on my part to peel back the skin in the shower each day. I&#x27;d essentially take a shower and by the end my foot skin was soft enough to massage off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at the end of the week, VOILA! I had baby soft feet and even my hard calluses were softer than they had ever been in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This effect will not last forever. I&#x27;d say after about 2-3 weeks, they started returning to their original form but hey, it&#x27;s cheaper than getting a pedicure which results in no change in the state of my heels. I also think with the proper maintenance (heavy lotioning) the effect could stay for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, they are definitely worth the extra work and I will definitely stock up on these especially since Spring is almost here. Soft feet here I come!</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to be disappointed. 10 days passed and absolutely nothing happened. Then on day 11, a little peeling started. On day 12, a snowstorm of peeling took place and continued for another week. The result is great. I&#x27;m getting ready to order another treatment and plan to use it every few months.</li>
    <li> The product works really well. It took a little longer than I expect but I will buy this product again and recommend it to my friends!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this... As the saying goes, when things appear too good to be true, they probably are.  Baby Foot is no exception!  I did the treatment over a week ago and the only thing that&#x27;s happened is that my feet have become even drier than they were in the first place.  My heels were already pretty unsightly to begin with but now wearing sandals is a true embarrassment.  I followed the directions on the box to a T and also added in foot soaks before and after the treatment in addition to nightly soaks since the treatment as other reviewers have recommended.  Nope, no dice. My feet haven&#x27;t peeled at all. I don&#x27;t have baby soft skin.  Basically, my feet look worse. This product was a total waste of money. Will update review if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I bought two brands/boxes at the same time but unfortunately, tried another brand first, zip, nada happened so I was a bit skeptical about this one.  I tried to pawn this one off on everyone I knew with no luck and there the box sat for quite a while.  I finally decided to give this brand a try.  I am SOoO glad I did!  It&#x27;s been a bit over a week since I put my feet in the bags and they look awful!!  That&#x27;s a good thing!  I take off my socks and they are filled with white flakes, walk barefoot and leave skin everywhere, I know, gross, but this is exactly what is supposed to happen.  I have no doubt that in a week or two, my feet will be soft and just as they are supposed to be post treatment.  I don&#x27;t have major calluses, the side of my big toe is the place I always have a problem and a little bit on my heels so I am astonished to see that my entire foot (feet) is looking like a reptile&#x27;s skin.  The directions and expectations on the packaging and insert are quite clear.  I am getting more than I expected as it stated that baby foot is meant to deal with the soles of the feet, yet it is dealing with my entire foot (feet).  I took a long shower, put my feet in the bags (used my own tape to insure it was a good fit as I have a small foot) for an hour and washed it off.  It was pretty easy and I see my feet going through the change they are supposed to go through.  I will be happy not to be cleaning my dead skin up every 5min once they are finished &#x27;molting&#x27; but am also happy that this product works.  I will be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  my feet ARE soft and wonderful with the exception of my problem spots but I am not at all upset as the box warned that it might be necessary to retreat if one has those types of areas (I had no idea they were that bad until using this product.  I knew they were worse than the rest of my feet but...) and it is.  I don&#x27;t want to do it yet so am using Ms. Oops daily until I am ready but I have ordered another set and will use baby foot regularly from now on.&lt;br /&gt;A note: The outside of the box says x2 which could lead one to think there are two sets in the box, there is one set of two bags, one for each foot.t regularly from now on.&lt;br /&gt;A note: The outside of the box says x2 which could lead one to think there are two sets in the box, there is one set of two bags, one for each foot.</li>
    <li> Well, it was delivered quickly so that&#x27;s a positive.  But, despite following directions AND leaving it on (by accident) 15 minutes longer that the hour, it simply did nothing.  No peel, no baby feet, nothing except the crusty heels I came in with.  I had high hopes after reading the reviews but bummer and a waste of money.  C&#x27;est la vie....</li>
    <li> After 4-5 days, skin on feet peeled off. No pain. Left feet soft. Probably good for someone too embarrassed to try a pedicure in a salon.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical.  Very.  My feet were not &#x27;that bad&#x27;, but I did want smoother feet for summer.  I was amazed.  For the first few days after using the product, nothing happened.  Then on day four my skin just started sloughing off! My feet are so smooth and pretty now! I love it!  Yes, it actually works.</li>
    <li> Works great, but your feet will be peeling and making a mess.  Your significant other might get grossed out (mine did and she&#x27;s pretty chill about everything).</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and waited a couple of days.... nothing happened.  I was not happy.  Then on about the 3rd or 4th day... WOW!! All the dead skin began to peel away.  This continued for several days and now I do have baby-feet again!! Even the tough skin on my heels is gone, gone, gone!!! Just give it some time!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy and use again!</li>
    <li> I found more information on how to use it on the Internet and not on the package itself. Lots of skin peeling but very little change in the skin itself. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I saw this on someone&#x27;s Blog and decided to purchase it for my wife to try out! Needless to say we have repurchased this again due to the great results.</li>
    <li> this took care of the small stuff, but for the larger callouses on my heels and big toe, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  It was messy, but I could deal with that..&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed it didn&#x27;t work better.  I would not purchase again.  I felt like the ped egg does a better job.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders on your feet!!! I would recommend this to any one! When I got the baby feet some was missing out of the bootie I call there 1800 number and they replaced it , and when I tell you my feet is soft and looking good I would get this all the time.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SO MUCH !!</li>
    <li> Eh, tried this twice. I have really bad callouses on the outside of my heels and after using this twice I still have them. Too much money for what it does. If it was less expensive I would use it on a regular basis as it did help with the rest.</li>
    <li> The first time I used baby foot, I was in heaven!  All this dead skin came off-particularly on my heels and balls of my feet.  Using baby feet really helped my get my heels/feet back in shape. I have used BF about once every 2-3 months to keep things in check. In between I use the Emjoi callus remover and go to the spa for a professional pedicure. Baby Foot is an essential tool to keep my callused feet/heels in summer shape.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed on the package and even followed suggested instructions posted by reviewers here and it did not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a manager at Bath &amp; Body works ; I&#x27;m sooo glad I gave it a try because this product turned my dry damaged feet into... You Guessed It !!!! BABY FEET !!!! In 7 days my feet were nice and soft and now I&#x27;m not ashamed to wear sandals .... I&#x27;m a Baby Feet customer for life .....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I followed amazon reviewer instructions exactly, including presoaking in milk and post soaking in water. I didn&#x27;t peel for at least a week, maybe more. I peeled some for a few days, nothing out of control. At one point my big toe was a bit sore for 1.5 days because I rubbed too much skin off myself (if you are going to use a scrubber or pumice, be gentle). It&#x27;s not the miracle I was hoping for, and my feet are really not that calloused....not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. What a waste of $20. Absolutely no Difference whatsoever and I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
    <li> This works so well that I am disgusted. :)  The amount of skin that comes off after using this product is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this product, you first soak your feet, then put your feet into the two gel-filled booties, tape them closed (with the enclosed tape strips), and relax for about an hour.  They wash your feet with soap and water and go about your business for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About four or five days after you use the product, your feet will start peeling, and peeling, and peeling.  It works best if you soak your feet each day to loosen up the skin that is peeling off.  Your feet will be fully &amp;#34;baby-fied&amp;#34; within about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning:  if you have toenail polish on, be prepared for it to be BLEACHED WHITE and softened to the point that it is disgusting looking.  It would be best to take it off before you use Baby Foot.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had very winter-ugly feet and no time/money for a pedicure. On a Thursday evening I soaked my feet for 15 minutes in warm water, then put on the Baby Foot plastic booties and sat like a good girl through an episode and a half of The Borgias, so between an hour and 2 hours. Then I rinsed it off. I think maybe there was a little tingling, but I may be imagining it. So that&#x27;s day 1.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Soles of my feet felt a little weird. Probably imagined it.&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: Back to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Day 6: Nothing, nothing, nothing. I think I threw away $20.&lt;br /&gt;Day 7: What the... ! The bottoms of my feet came loose and started flapping in the wind. It was really gross. Didn&#x27;t hurt, didn&#x27;t itch, just unbelievable. It looks like when you burn your feet on hot pavement and blister them and then a few days later the calluses come loose, only no pain. Underneath the new baby skin isn&#x27;t sore, it isn&#x27;t tender, although my shoes all feel a little odd now, but I&#x27;m really happy with the results. In fact I feel about 2 pounds lighter. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I did soak daily for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I am in the first week of using Baby Foot and I must say I am very happy with my results so far my feet have begun it&#x27;s peel process.. I am a &amp;#34;shower&amp;#34; gal and as other reviewers before me have stated it does help to pre-soak before use and every day thereafter. I think that had a lot to due with my great results. Baby Foot has definitely got a repeat customer in me :)</li>
    <li> Take the advice of everyone else who&#x27;s used this successfully: soak your feet in warm water beforehand, for at least 30 minutes.  And soak your feet every night after you use this.  I did so, and in just a few days, my feet started peeling.  All the rough spots that I&#x27;m always having to attack with a pumice stone?  Super smooth.  I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> It worked fantastic lots of peeling ordered me another one.</li>
    <li> baby foot was awesome. I had very dry cracked heels and even putting lotion on them daily did not work. after using this product my heels are all better and nice and soft. I would highly recommend this product to anybody and hope they come out with baby hands next.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing . I will definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described, and it is kind of magical. I used it last week and followed the instructions pretty much exactly. I soaked my feet beforehand for just a few minutes. Fast forward to four days later, nothing is happening, maybe a tiny bit of flaking skin, and I figure my feet are a lost cause and the product didn&#x27;t really work. But on day five, the flaking/peeling starts ramping up, and then in the past couple of days my feet are just totally shedding skin. It&#x27;s kind of disgusting, actually... but the end result is awesome. Be sure to plan ahead and attend only events where you can wear regular shoes. Strictly no flip flops until the process ends.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect with the mixed reviews, so when I tried this on a Sunday, I didn&#x27;t think anything would happen.  On Tuesday, I noticed just a little peeling, but by today (Thursday), all I can say is WOW!  The peeling looks pretty gross, but my feet really do feel baby soft!  I can&#x27;t wait for all the peeling to finish.  I don&#x27;t think my feet have ever felt so soft.  I would definitely recommend this product, and would definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, helped to rid my feet of that old crusty skin.I don&#x27;t have to feel self conscious about my feet any longer.I have no complaints whatsoever about the skin peeling this is to help remove the old hardened skin.I have read numerous complaints pertaining to the excessive shedding of the skin from the exfoliation process ; this Babyfoot product totally saved my feet.I had very horrible unsightly feet.I will continuously use this product as long as its available.I refuse to go back to the nail salon for a pedicure well only to polish my toes.My feet are in safe hands with Babyfoot.My feet once were scratchy and were very uncomfortable for myself and my partner while in bed.Thank God for this product, my feet mean the world to me.I dont have to hide my feet in shame.I followed the instructions precisely.The only foot product that has given me the results I desired.Thought i was taking a risk purchasing Babyfoot, but to my surprise the best decision i have made.Satisfied customer this was my first purchase.Now I&#x27;m a bona fide user for life.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item twice now, and I will continue to buy it when I need to use it again. It works exactly as it says and does not disappoint. My feet aren&#x27;t particularly gross, but they do get a bit tough and discolored from wearing dyed moccasins most months out of the year. I leave the booties on for an hour and a half to two hours, then walk very slowly to the bathroom to wash the gel off. You have to schedule when you wear these carefully...don&#x27;t expect to cook dinner or do things around the house when you have them on. I find them extremely slippery and difficult to walk in. It&#x27;s not really a problem for me because it&#x27;s so friggin&#x27; worth it. Even though it&#x27;s lavender scented, I detect a citrus-like scent. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s from the citrus peel stuff in the gel. I don&#x27;t feel the need to soak my feet before use like some people suggest. I do, however, try to soak them or take more showers 3-7 days after when the peeling action really ramps up. It&#x27;s not necessary, but I find it helps speed up the process which is nice because taking the dead skin off my feet is all I can think about after I use this product and until the nice soft feet underneath are revealed. Everyone in my family uses this product a few times a year, and that includes people with troll feet and people with normal feet that might not really need the product. Anybody on here that says they have used this with no results must have some superhuman immunity or foot skin of steel...or they don&#x27;t read the directions and review it before it takes effect. I have recommended it to several people that are interested in self care and beauty and also people that just like awesome gross stuff.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to find time to commit to this, due to it taking 5-7 days to actually start peeling. So I would recommend making sure you don&#x27;t plan to go anywhere that requires you to take your shoes off, preferably I would say do it in the winter and during the week. So I did mine on a Thursday evening, it was easy enough to follow the instructions and I made sure I put a timer on my phone for an hour because I read in the reviews not to exceed an hour. After I finished the process, I didn&#x27;t notice anything drastic the first 3 days so me being impatient I assumed it didn&#x27;t work. But when the fourth day rolled around and I noticed that I felt like my skin was stretching and to my surprise my feet was peeling. it was weird to see but amazing that the product actually worked. It took about 3-4 to remove all the peeling but honestly my feet has never felt so soft. I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the picture that was what my foot liked after 3 days.</li>
    <li> It works for a skin peel on your feet!  Just be sure you have a week of not showing your feet...peeling skin in public is not lovely...but the results are.  Mine starting peeling the 2nd day and continued for a full week.</li>
    <li> Baby foot works!! I used to use another foot soak previously but this worked wonders in a different way. I read the other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work right away. I bathed first  I soaked my feet for an hour and put on socks.  The other reviews were correct make sure you don&#x27;t anything to do for an hour or hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 days later, I noticed some tightness and slight cracking.  The next day I didn&#x27;t see anything so I wore sandals.  At about 7 pm I looked down and it looked like sheets of paper were coming off the sides of my feet!  I think I peeled for 2 weeks at least tall over my feet.  Between my toes, my heels, the tops of my feet.  It works but know that you will b extremely dry until you are done!  I will post pics so u can see the actual result!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feet didn&#x27;t start to peel for about 6-7 days after I used it. Don&#x27;t recommend to runners, your feet will by so soft and silky you won&#x27;t have enough cushion to prevent blisters.  But.. Recommended on the off season, OR everyone else!</li>
    <li> It worked well.  It removed almost all of the dead skin from the bottom of my feet.  It was very easy to use.  I would use it again.</li>
    <li> WOW - my feet were not that bad, but now they are super soft.&lt;br /&gt;do this 2 weeks BEFORE you want to wear flipflops or you will gross everyone out!</li>
    <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working. Then all of a sudden on about day 4 after using Baby Foot I saw some peeling. After that my feet peeled like crazy. I loved the results!! Will absolutely order this again. I tell everyone I know about it.</li>
    <li> I will provide you feedback when I  utilize the product. As of this time, it is still in the box- every day lif  - hectic!! I am sure it will be amazing when I have time to follow instructions on the product and actually sit for an hour!!  Until that time, life goes on.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the .message.&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie</li>
    <li> I used this a year ago and needless to say, it does exactly what it says it does on the box.&lt;br /&gt;The peeling happened after 2 days of the application and it didn&#x27;t stop for 4-5 days. I kid you not, I have only had 1 manicure in the past year compared to the 4-6 ones I usually had before using Baby Foot.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry callous skin</li>
    <li> I liked the foot peel brand that I bought at a local spa better. I don&#x27;t see it here on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t find it on Google, but it came in a black and white striped box. That particular brand did a better job than this one, in my opinion. It peeled off more skin (Baby Foot left unpeeled skin I could see) and the effects lasted longer than Baby Foot.  With Baby Foot, I was ready to do another peel within one month. I&#x27;m not sure why the black and white striped box peel did a better job than Baby Foot, but it did and the results lasted longer. The Baby Foot packaging was a lot nicer though.</li>
    <li> Softened my feet for a day, but then feet were coarse again next day.</li>
    <li> Be patient! It took 4 or 5 whole days for my hard, dry skin to start falling off.  After about 4-5 days of &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;, my feet definitely are softer.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tape that&#x27;s included in the package is useless.  I think its 6 strips of tape that are bout .25 inch by 2 inches.  I&#x27;d suggest using another type of type such as masking tap or packing tape.</li>
    <li> Great results. Feet do peel much for about 2 wks but so worth getting old skin off. My feet do look younger and softer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product however I had to research how to get the best results from this product. There are directions but if you follow just that you won&#x27;t be the best results. You should soak your feet for about 10 - 15 minutes before using this product or after taking a bath. If you take a bath everyday you&#x27;ll be fine after the application of the product, but if showering is your things then I would suggest soaking your feet 10 -15 minutes every day or every other day before getting in the showering. If you don&#x27;t do this the product will take weeks before it starts to peel and will continue peels for even longer. Soaking your feet seems to help quicken the process you can have smooth, soft feet even sooner.</li>
    <li> it takes 5- days, but it really does work (well).</li>
    <li> I had nasty feet.  Ton&#x27;s of dead skin.  This product put a dent in what I thought was the impossible!  I plan buy it again.</li>
    <li> If anyone says these don&#x27;t work, they&#x27;re not doing it right. I have THE WORST feet in the world. I&#x27;m talking podiatrist having to shave off corns and prescribe that urea cream type of feet. My husband was jealous when he saw the baby soft skin on my feet after the peeling. You have to soak your feet before you apply the booties and you have to soak your feet every day for at least 20 minutes every day after you apply the booties. If you&#x27;re a shower person, it&#x27;s just not going to work. Do not use scrubbers or buffing stones to help with the peeling. Just soak your feet every day and within a week or two you&#x27;ll see beautiful new skin.</li>
    <li> love it! works exactly like it says</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work SO SAD.......&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!!!!!!  It seriously works, however one key thing that I had to research was after you use the one time application, the next few nights you should soak your feet for a half hour.  Each time your dead skin peels off!  It does really work!</li>
    <li> Now after 2 weeks I am done with the whole process, and Im VERY VERY VERY happy with the result!! I rarely took care of my feet before and wear sandals about 6 months a year, so its easy to image what my feet looks like before. And now it really become soft and looks much much better~ What I did is that I soak my feet in pretty warm water in about 15 minutes before wearing the boots, and wear my socks during the process to let my skin get more gels covered. It started to peel pretty quick maybe 3 days later. Fun experience! I bought AHAVA foot cream for my soft baby feet lol and plan to use it everyday to keep my feet looks good, and use baby foot every other year (maybe more often not sure yet). Try it and you will see a change!!!</li>
    <li> Love! just soak feet prior to use!</li>
    <li> This works AWESOME! My husband put his feet in the bags after I used them &amp; we both peeled for weeks!! It took 4 or 5 days for the skin to start peeling.  I soaked my feet often to soften the skin and speed up the process! I will do it again my feet were Sooo  baby soft!!</li>
    <li> Not quite as expected.  Also peeled off my tan on top of my foot and ankle.  Will I do it again?  Probably not.  The peeling took six days to begin and went on for two weeks.  Made a terrible mess wherever I walked through the house.</li>
    <li> Not much of a lavender scent as the product claimed.  Did peel but did absolutely NOTHING for softness, which is the main reason I bought the product. Also did nothing for calluses. Also, even when it did peel it only peeled arbitrarily--in random spots, not all over. Would never purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice and it is great...but there is something that I read online before my second use that  made all the difference between it being good or great. If you are the type of person that takes regular baths (I&#x27;m not...always take showers) then you can disregard this review because you soak your feet on a regular basis.  I soaked my feet in warm soapy water for an hour before I used it (you may not have to do it that long...I would say 15 minutes or longer) and then used the product the next day. One day after using it I soaked my feet for an hour and then again one week later. Less than two weeks after the use of Baby Foot the skin on my feet starting coming off in sheets. My feet weren&#x27;t terribly bad to start out with but I had some callouses on my heels that were difficult to get off using a pumice stone. It was wonderful. My whole foot eventually peeled off leaving behind soft perfect feet (well, as perfect as my feet can get!). This goes on for a few days and it get a little weird looking (at least as I wear sandals most of the time) so I soaked again and used an exfoliating cloth to get the tiny pieces of skin off. Made my husband do it, too. His feet were calloused up and it worked great. Love Baby Foot. Well worth the price but if you don&#x27;t take baths on a regular basis remember to soak!  It really makes it much more effective.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works</li>
    <li> I have been eying this product for nearly a year. After two decades of rough feet with nasty heels, I wanted something that would work. I don&#x27;t like socks on my feet, the PediEgg only works if you use it consistently (and even then it&#x27;s not 100% great), and I knew that after reading and seeing the pictures of this product that it would be good for me to use. I even had a friend who saw me share a link for it and she bought it for her husband---who it worked on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to MY review. I did lots of research before using this product and when it arrived, I was ready to give it a whirl. I soaked my feet for 15 minutes, dried them off, and then put my feet in the plastic, gel-filled booties. Then I used socks to cover my feet and the booties and sat in my bed, letting the acid stuff do its work for a couple of hours. After the two hours was up, I washed my feet with soap and water and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next three nights after using the Baby Foot, I soaked my feet in my bathtub for at LEAST 15 minutes. After that, I just was kind of over perching on the edge of the tub and decided to forgo soaking. In the meantime, as each day passed and after I soaked my feet and would shower, my feet felt exceptionally dry and borderline itchy---no biggie. By the 5th day, my feet started to flake a little on the bottoms. By the end of week one? HOLY COW! My feet started peeling off in all sorts of layers. What really got me was the skin that peeled at the backs of my heels and at the beginning of the heel of my foot (nearest my instep). A-FREAKING-MAZING! It took off I don&#x27;t know HOW many layers of skin. Then for the next week plus, my feet continued to peel all over. The bottoms, the heels, the toes, the tops, the sides: EVERYWHERE. Now, almost three weeks after using the product, my feet (except my awful heels that will take multiple uses to get rid of) are super soft and baby smooth. In fact, I had to haul across a ton of parking lots at the Royals game this past Sunday night (8/31) and the balls of my feet burned as the calluses had been removed from them due to the Baby Foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS&lt;br /&gt;-Soak your feet at LEAST 15 minutes before putting on the booties.&lt;br /&gt;-If you have extremely bad heels (like me), I think using a PediEgg or whatever you prefer to use to get the layers of skin down somewhat would help the results in the end.&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT walk around if possible in these booties.

    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write lengthy reviews but in this case I&#x27;m making an exception.  Baby Foot is amazing.  There is no other way to describe it.  Here&#x27;s my story:  I normally get pedicures about once every couple months because overall I thought my feet were healthy and I only had issues with really dry skin on my heels.  A lady at the nail salon told me about Baby Foot and I came online to do some research.  I was somewhat skeptical about the product but after reading so many positive reviews I decided to try it for myself.  I received the product a week ago exactly.  From having read other customer reviews I chose to alter the process just a bit for myself.  I did a 20 minute foot soak in hot water then applied the booties.  They felt slimy and cold when I put them on but after  I put on socks over the booties my feet felt better.  After about 10-15 minutes my feet starting tingling a little but it was not uncomfortable and eventually passed at around the 30 minute mark.  I left the booties on for about 90 minutes total, wanting to get the maximum effects then finished the process by washing them good with soap and water and letting them soak another 15 minutes in plain warm water.  Day 3  the tops of my feet looked as if they had a mild case of sunburn and felt a little itchy.  I applied  plain lotion thinking they might be a little too dry.  Day 4  I noticed the bottoms of my feet were starting to peel just a little upon getting out of the shower. Day 5 the top of my feet starting looking even drier and even applying lotion didn&#x27;t help. Day 6 while drying my feet after a shower a whole section of dead skin sloughed off the top of my feet and I noticed the skin on the bottoms was starting to peel off with vigorous rubbing from the towel.  Today is day 7 and I just spent 20 minutes peeling huge sections of dead skin from my feet.  It was almost scary to see how much skin I simply peeled away.  They look horrible right now because it appears there is still much more peeling to come and I won&#x27;t be wearing sandals anytime soon until the process is completed.  I can tell though that even at this point the skin underneath what has peeled away looks healthy and smooth.  I can hardly wait to see the end results but I&#x27;m so excited that this product absolutely seems to be doing what it promised and is removing all the dry dead skin that I wasn&#x27;t even aware had built up on my feet!!!peeling to come and I won&#x27;t be wearing sandals anytime soon until the process is completed.

    <li> This product is amazing!! My feet have never been this soft that I can remember. I have horribly dry heels, they crack open &amp; bleed, even with regular pedicures! Not anymore, this product peeled all the dead skin off &amp; left smooth feet!! I will be using it every couple months to keep them in shape.</li>
    <li> Really amazing results!  Takes about a week for your old skin to slough off, but afterwards you truly will have callus-free heels.  Make sure to soak your feet in water every evening to speed up the process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still shedding skin from my feet!!!!  Been two weeks!!!!  Definitely is taking all the dead, dry skin from my feet.  Could not get that from a pedicure.</li>
    <li> This is a must for hands and feet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! Oh my did my feet peel, but it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> This product works really well, but do not expect total baby feet.  I think if you did it every few months it would be a lifesaver.  It is really fun to see the peeling a little gross though.  Don&#x27;t expect to wear open shoes after you do it for about two weeks.  Also the directions on the box say leave it on for one hour and  all online reviews say two hours.  I would leave it on for two!</li>
    <li> Love this - at first it looked as if nothing happened.  Nothing... I soaked for 30 minutes in a massaging foot bath thingy and applied the product for 1 hour as directed.  Day 2, and 3, nothing happened, so I was a little skeptical.  It says 5-7 days you&#x27;ll start peeling.  On the 4th day I noticed a little roughness and dryness, and then day 5 BAM!  TONS, and I mean TONS of skin started flaking off - now it&#x27;s day 6, and still peeling away.  The skin underneath is baby soft like they say.  It&#x27;s a bit gross, but somehow very rewarding to see all that dead skin come off.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions as written, wait the 5-7 days and it will start working. You will be amazed with the results! I recommend using it when you aren&#x27;t wearing sandals every day. When the magic is happening it isn&#x27;t very attractive to look at. Mine took 2 weeks plus a few days to finally stop exfoliating completely. Loved the results.  Will use again when necessary.</li>
    <li> This made the top of my foot burn and peel.  I only needed it for the calluses on the bottom - next time I try it I think I will cut the top of the boot off so that only the bottom of my foot soaks in the solution.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it is supposed to. should have more information on the peeling process but after two weeks i had super soft feet</li>
    <li> This worked really well. I was hoping it would do more for my heels, but they were pretty hideous. Overall, I was very satisfied and will use it again.</li>
    <li> Works well. As previous reviewers state, it&#x27;s best to soak your feet before using this product (which the directions tell you to do anyway) and to try and soak your feet every day. Once the peeling starts (it took about 5 days before my feet began showing the peel), soaking your feet a little every day just helps the sloughing process work more effectively. I also used a pumice stone and gently rubbed away the dry bits. I do a lot of yoga and I am often barefoot at home, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product I can now use once or twice a year to help keep my feet from turning into crocodile armor.</li>
    <li> Well, it did a pretty good job on everything BUT the callouses on my heels and big toes. Once the peeling starts it is very, very messy.&lt;br /&gt;Peeling and gobs of dead skin everywhere. Make sure you wear socks ALL the time while the peeling is going on. Don&#x27;t know what I will do about the callouses that still remain.  Perhaps they make a stronger product that will help? I&#x27;ll be checking into it.</li>
    <li> It WORKS!  All those years grinding those heels and trying to have a smooth look...(eye rolls) but THIS...You NEED this.  Boys AND girls need nice FEET!</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is a fake. Did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Good product, really works. If you have stubborn callouses, you have to leave it on longer than 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> i was so stinking skeptical about this product. it took me 4 months to convince myself to order it. I AM SO GLAD I DID! i followed all the direction but after a few days i didn&#x27;t see any peeling i was so let down. but i decided to go ahead and take a bubble bath and soak my feets and relax (its been a hell of  week). I am so glad i did! my feet have been peeling in sheets for a few days- it does not hurt at all and they&#x27;re so so so soft! i will happily repurchase and recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How funny that a year later i buy the same product! i cant express how much i love this product. i soaked my feet before and accidentally fell asleep with the booties on for about 5 hours. i am pleased that nothing terrible happened. my hooves are so smooth and soft :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  been one week and no dramatic peel has happened. I have soaked my feet everyday as other people have suggested. Nothing.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Footsies started peeling today, Monday, and I did the boots on Thursday. After you soak your feet, make sure to rub them and get the peeling going. Awesome so far!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all of the great reviews. I admit I didn&#x27;t read much of the instruction sheet other than, &#x27;put on clean feet,&#x27; so I showered beforehand. I&#x27;d also been scaling down my callouses every day of the prior week. It&#x27;s been a week since I used the product and no miraculous scaling here. I&#x27;m disappointed because the callouses on my heels thicken to the point of cracking and bleeding. It was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t peel as much as it says it will, didn&#x27;t help my feet very much. It was very itchy as well.</li>
    <li> It was not the magical foot peel I was hoping for. Yes, my feel peeled, and the dead skin came off, but it did not do as good of a job as I was expecting, and truthfully to have my feet be out of showing commission for 2 weeks and this is all I get, I won&#x27;t be doing this again. I soaked my feet every day for an hour which assisted in peeling. Before I put the booties on I soaked my feet. And I left them on 45 minutes longer than the box suggested (per internet recommendations). It just.... was not as awesome as I thought it would be. Still some roughness on my heels. Did not remove all the build up.</li>
    <li> Feet peeled but still have a little bit of rough heels</li>
    <li> It took almost 2.5 weeks after treatment, but my feet peeled in SHEETS revealing nice new soft skin.  I know this time to use it about a month before my next vaca.  Simple, easy and effective.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dead skin on my feet. The Baby Foot worked very well for me. It took a week before it started doing anything. My feet pealed for at least a week. It amazed me out the thick dead skin would come off with ease. I need to do it again to get rid of all the excess skin. I would recommend trying it but make sure you have time before any type of event. It does make your feet look pretty bad until the pealing is complete.</li>
    <li> This was amazing -- 50% gross and 50% fun. Feet definitely were baby soft afterward!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, I have recommended this to so many friends and they have all used it and loved it, and although the package says to only  use once I saved my booties in a plastic freezer bag in a cool cupboard and reused them after about 10 days because I still had a lot of build up of dead skin on my feet, it worked just as well the second time, I have learned to take better care of my feet so they don&#x27;t get to this point again. and will use a lotion that contains a lactic acid on a weekly basis................but if necessary I will purchase this product again....</li>
    <li> I read ALL of the reviews, followed the steps faithfully, soaked feet every night, didn&#x27;t apply lotion, but, it did not totally work!  My heels are still crusty - less so, but still crusty enough to be embarrassed to wear sandals.  I was so hyped to do this that the disappointment was huge.  The areas that it did work on, inside the middle of the foot, between the toes, and the side of my big toe, was great.  I have decided to try it ONE MORE TIME, because my heels were in bad shape and have been for years.&lt;br /&gt;I will submit another review after the second go-round in August.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this item.  But I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I had a pair of dansko shoes for work that rubbed the side of my feet causing painful dry skin.  I soaked up feet prior and soaking I mean I took a shower that lasted around 15 minutes.  I followed with the baby feet for 1 hour.  I would say I didn&#x27;t notice any change for 3 days and I thought I&#x27;d try soaking my feet since the shower time wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I did on the 4th day 20 minute soak and notice nothing.  The next day I decided to increase 2 times a day for 20 minutes and that did the trick.  I followed everyday since with 2 times a day for 20 minutes and my feet were crazy peeling.  I&#x27;m on the second week and now I&#x27;m just soaking once and I still have peeling.  It&#x27;s made my feet soft.  I will be buying again the do it for a second time for the areas that were too thick.</li>
    <li> In the instructions it says to leave the your feet in the booties for 1 hour.  My feet were pretty bad so I decided to leave them on for 2 hours like some of the other purchasers did.  On the 3rd day my ankles and top of feet starting peeling.  On the 5th day the bottoms of me feet started to peel.  It took 12 days for all the peeling to finish.  I don&#x27;t feel that the treatment did all that well on the ball of my feet but everywhere else I&#x27;m left with squishy baby soft feet.  I will be purchasing again in maybe a month to do again.  Only this time I think I will cut the booties way shorter and not tape them around my ankles because my ankles and tops of my feet didn&#x27;t need any attention to begin with, only the bottoms.  Plus I wear no show and low cut socks so its hard to hide peeling ankles especially during the summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment did not burn my skin but after I washed it all off, my feet did feel somewhat warm.  Not sure how long the warm feeling lasted because I fell asleep right after, but it was gone when I woke up the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I did not use any lotion during this time and I soaked my feet everyday in the tub for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again and recommend it to anyone that wants baby soft feet and that has about 2 weeks to spare from wearing flip flops and sandals.</li>
    <li> This is my first  time writing a review. I can honestly  say this product  works as it states. Soaking feet as directed  is imperative  for best results.  I could not believe the amount of dead skin peeled from my feet. Five stars hands down!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all on my feet. I followed the instructions to the letter but my feet never peeled and never got any better. I was very disappointed. I had high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> My feet peeled for 2 weeks and they are the same as before. This product did not make my feet any softer.</li>
    <li> I thought my feet were beyond help: super rough, cracked heels; callouses and all around dry, scaly feet.&lt;br /&gt;I was at the point where professional pedicures were pointless and embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;so I gave baby feet a try.&lt;br /&gt;yeah it takes about a week for it to start peeling; but once it does!!&lt;br /&gt;omg.&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s very different from a sunburn peel.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really like a snake shedding it&#x27;s skin. all that thick, dry skin just comes right off!! now I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to take off my socks or shoes.&lt;br /&gt;other tips:&lt;br /&gt;definitely do the pre-application soak&lt;br /&gt;take off polish before application&lt;br /&gt;I wore the booties for about 2.25 hours&lt;br /&gt;about 4-5days after application, start soaking your feet to speed up the peeling process</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the letter and this did nothing but make the tops of my feet sore for a few days.</li>
    <li> This Stuff is Great!!</li>
    <li> I was this product on my husbands narley feet.  It is amazing, my sheets no longer look as though a cat has clawed them</li>
    <li> Loved this product!!!</li>
    <li> BABY FOOT!!! This is a must have staple to any womens beauty regime!! I wasn&#x27;t sure this product would work but  it truly does.  I followed the directions on the package and 4 days later I stepped out the shower and looked down to peeling feet!!  the skin came off in thin soft layers exposing incredibly soft feet.  I&#x27;m still in the peeling process ( it&#x27;s been 5 days) but I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product.  I am definitely buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Baby Foot sells for $25 from other websites so the $20 price at Amazon was a considerable savings. I applied it on 1/8/13. (And you really should Remain Seated once you get those booties on! They are VERY slippery to walk in on carpet, wood floors, even bathroom tiles.) The directions said leave the booties on for 1 hour but I have 1/2 inch thick layer of dead, calloused skin on both heels, so I kept them on for 1.5 hours. (I showered before using the booties, so my feet were already softened a bit from the water.) Peeling didn&#x27;t begin until day 6 (the box says peeling will start in 3-5 days). The exfoliation wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as I had hoped. I got some peeling along the sides of my feet &amp; between my toes. My feet even got flaky across the tops where there wasn&#x27;t any dead skin...? I soaked them in warm water &amp; scrubbed both feet with a Ped Egg yesterday to accelerate the process. But the dead skin on my heels is still there, along with that weird, corn-like thing on the bottom of my right foot just below my 2nd toe. (Although it has softened a bit, but not enough to slice it off myself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, BABY FOOT did not work as promised. If it requires 2 treatments (many reviews have said it does, so I ordered another box when I had no peeling by day 5), they should either cut the price to $10 or sell 2 treatments per box for $20. It&#x27;s overpriced considering that the first 3 ingredients are water &amp; rubbing alcohol! You&#x27;ll get better results from a $25 pedicure at your local Asian nail salon than with Baby Foot. But I will post another review after doing a 2nd application tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- RC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BABY FOOT ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Alcohol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Arginine, Parfum, Butylene Glycol, Peg-60 Hydrogenetad Castor Oil, Glucose, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Citric Acid, Malic Acid, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis(Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis(Grapefruit)Peel Oil, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf Extract, Hedera Helix(Ivy) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage)Leaf Extract, Citrus Lemon Fruit Extract, Clematis Vitalba Leaf Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, Sodium Nitrate, Glyoxal, Disodium Phosphate, Linalool, Limonene.inale Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf Extract, Hedera Helix(Ivy) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage)Leaf Extract, Citrus Lemon Fruit Extract, Clematis Vitalba Leaf Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, Sodium Nitrate, Glyoxal, Disodium Phosphate, Linalool, Limonene.</li>
    <li> its really really works, just fallow the instructions and you will have baby skin in your feet, i will use it every 2 or 3 months</li>
    <li> I have one word &amp;#34;AWESOME&amp;#34;!!! This is my sons feet that have been like this for about 10 years. I never thought his feet would heal after many years of skin picking. They are baby soft now! Just unbelievable!!</li>
    <li> It took a few days to start working but then skin started to come off.  Did a good job with skin on bottom of wifes feet but didn&#x27;t do much for tough heel which was her target area.  Also thought 2 sets but was just 1 set for both feet.  Ok but wouldn&#x27;t use again for the price.</li>
    <li> followed directions and didn&#x27;t get results as I had hoped but overall not bad</li>
    <li> Fabulous,my feet are soft and callous free.</li>
    <li> so glad that i purchased baby foot. my feet look and feel great.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot of good reviews before I purchased Baby Foot and watched the videos to make sure I would follow the instructions correctly and what was successful for other purchasers. So I was really excited to order it. The product did not come in the package that was shown on this website. It came in an envelope that was labeled with an online beauty company . I opened the package and the only thing in the package was a silver bag with no instructions just a packaging slip.  There was no box enclosed. No directions either.  I opened the silver envelope and discovered the booties with the solution in it.  I said I had watched the videos and the booties did not look like anything like the ones that were shown.  It had a blue strip across the top with no tape to hold it closed.  I was still determined so I used clear packaging tape to hold the booties on. (don&#x27;t laugh) I soaked my feet for 45 minutes, dried them off and sat in a chair with the gooey booties on for 2 hours.  I rinsed my feet and soaked them 5-10 minutes and dried them off really good.  Here it is day 6 and nothing at all has happened.  I take a bath every day and was looking for some kind of progress.  To my disappointment my feet are rough, calloused  and look basically like they did before I used the product. I honestly do not think I got what  ordered.  Has this happened to anyone else?</li>
    <li> That may be hyperbole, but what this does is nothing short of miraculous. I have clinically dry skin and I live in New England, so it&#x27;s prone to harsh winters. This product peels dry, dead skin off effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, my skin starts to peel within 3-4 days. Keep in mind that once the peeling process starts, it&#x27;s a little out of control. I wear thick socks to help it peel and keep the skin contained. (I know some people would find it gross, but I actually find it so satisfying when it comes off in large pieces!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying this as long as they make it...between this and coconut oil, it makes sloughing feet the old fashioned way obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It says not to use while pregnant or nursing, but I got my doctor&#x27;s OK to use during breastfeeding (I didn&#x27;t want to use it while pregnant, though). I&#x27;m not sure why it has this warning, so if anyone knows, I&#x27;d love to hear it...if you&#x27;re thinking about using anyway, definitely check with your dr.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Soak you feet for an hour before. I put socks over the plastic booties included, didnt bother with the tape included since the socks kept booties on well enough. After 4 days my skin started to peel, it only took 3 days to completely peel off. My feet were baby smooth. I had no overdrying effects &amp; slight itching occurred but not even enough to bother me. I will try this again.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and got rid of my dry, cracked heels!  My feet haven&#x27;t been this soft in years.  Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> this would be a good product but it only worked on the tops of my feet and not the bottom where I really needed it.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions including soaking etc.  it is now 3 weeks and not even a flake.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It works and my feet looked great.</li>
    <li> Seriously - this product is incredible! At first I thought nothing was going to happen. My feet had a very slight burning sensation(nothing uncomfortable) &amp; were very dry &amp; shiny.  I resisted putting lotion on them as another reviewer suggested. Then the morning of day 5 after getting out if the shower I looked down and strips of dead skin were coming off my feet. I could not believe how much was coming off! It is still coming off. I also have significant more feeling in my feet than I&#x27;ve had in years.  My feet weren&#x27;t that bad to begin with as I get regular pedicures every 5 weeks but I wear heels a lot and really abuse my poor feet.  I am going to use this product religiously from now on!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product after being in my pool for several hours. I want to warn you, be careful if you need to walk anywhere once the booties are on, it is very precarious walking in those things! I slipped and slided and almost fell. Anyway, I left the booties on for over an hour. No tingling or burning. After I removed the booties and washed my feet, I did notice a lot of dead skin, but not a remarkable amount. I was starting to think it hadn&#x27;t worked, but on the third day, I had finally begun peeling. Large strips of skin are peeling off my feet and the skin underneath is baby soft!!!</li>
    <li> I followed the recomendation of another buyer and soaked my feet before and after. I also soaked them every night. By the 3rd night, my feet were halfway peeled. I love this product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Product worked exactly as promised! !</li>
    <li> This product is so cool! Fast shipping time too!</li>
    <li> It workssssss.. Its a Little bit gross in The beginning but youll be happy with The result</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to a tee... soaked my feet daily. This product did nothing for me. At all. Total waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I really works! However try not to get the gel on top of your feet or you won&#x27;t be able to wear sandals for a while because ofbthe peeling!</li>
    <li> Will have to order again soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  For me, the process was pretty much finished eight days after application, but the quickness might have been due to what I did during those eight days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application day:  I soaked my feet for 30 minutes, towel dried them, applied the gel-filled booties, put on a pair of socks over that and sat with my feet flat on the floor for one hour.  I then removed the socks and booties, washed with soap and water and towel dried.  I did not soak my feet afterwards because it seemed that would be counterintuitive--I had just spent an hour letting the stuff soak into my feet, so I didn&#x27;t want to dilute the effects by immediately soaking in water afterwards.  My feet felt kind of tingly, but nothing bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1:  The following day my feet felt tight, kind of like how your skin feels with a slight sunburn, but no stinging or anything.  Nothing appeared noticeably different.  I soaked my feet for 30 minutes in a basin of water that evening.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2:  Again, same tight feeling, as well as dry.  Soaked feet for 30 minutes that evening, then applied a little bit of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3:  Not feeling quite as tight/dry, no noticeable appearance difference.  We went on mini vacation to the beach--spent about two hours in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Day 4:  Feels like I&#x27;ve got stockings/hose on my feet.  Noticed a tiny bit of peeling on my toes.  Spent about five hours in the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5:  Back home.  Feet are peeling on and around toes, on the bottom, pieces about half the size of a postage stamp.  Soak feet for 30 minutes in basin of water.&lt;br /&gt;Day 6:  Dead skin is peeling off in sheets, especially across the arch/soles of feet.  Calluses are starting to peel off.  Soak feet for 30 minutes, use a rough washcloth to lightly scrub, then soap and rinse.  Note:  As sheets of skin peel off, the tight hose feeling disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Day 7:  Lots of baby pink, soft skin showing.  Most of the bottom of the feet has peeled.  Minor peeling on top of feet, along sides.  Soak feet for 30 minutes, use rough washcloth to really scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Day 8:  Toes, bottom of feet and up sides to ankles have completely peeled.  There is a slight amount of dead skin still coming off the top of the feet, but after soaking for 30 minutes, scrubbing with a washcloth, towel drying and applying some lotion, it is not noticeable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I noted:  My feet are much softer.  Places where I had thick calluses are not completely callus-free, but they are substantially reduced.  A second application after two weeks would probably take care of the rest.  The calluses were the last part to start peeling.  Toes were first, in-between toes second, soles of feet (minus the areas of callus) third, sides and top next, and calluses last.  I think (though not sure) it might be due to the fact that it&#x27;s harder for the product to penetrate the thick skin of the calluses, hence the thinner areas peel first and the thicker areas last.  I also think my excursion into the ocean hastened the peeling process, since my feet were submerged in water for hours over a two-day period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this product is worth the money, and I will use it again in the future.along sides.  Soak feet for 30 minutes, use rough washcloth to really scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Day 8:  Toes, bottom of feet and up sides to ankles have completely peeled.

    <li> It did not work, at all. I have a really bad problem with dry feet. It did not peel much, just barely.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Several layers of scar tissue was gone in 8 days. Itching has stopped. This is expensive, but it is worth it. Do not get anxious that it does not work immediately. Be patience, it will take at least one week to work.</li>
    <li> This was amazing. So amazing I ordered it again for my mom. If you are on the fence about this at all just do it. Soak your feet first, soak your feet after and soak your feet daily. The results were amazing for me. Give the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; soak an hour.... after that I soaked my feet maybe ten minutes a few days, a half hour a few others and once or twice an hour. When the peeling starts it &amp;#34;slows&amp;#34; down after a day and I would recommend to soak your feet again which will start the process in a new area. Do not use lotion, salts or other things in your soak.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product ever for my feet. My feet are rough from tennis and high heels that I wear to work everyday. I do have sensitive skin so I was a little worried that I might have a reaction from it. I even left the socks on for an extra hour because I feel asleep while watching TV. It worked just as it said it would &amp; my feet stayed soft for weeks. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product.  Paying $20 for something that barely works is so disappointing!  I would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> great product, but they need to sale this in a jar with foot bags</li>
    <li> Definitely worked as described!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Maybe a little heat or slight sensation when using and right after but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> not quite what I expected</li>
    <li> The packaging and use of the product were both positive. I liked how it was a no-muss, no-fuss application. My criticism comes from what happened after. My feet felt soft immediately after removal, but still had hard skin. Over a week later, with no other sign of the product having worked at all, all of a sudden, my feet started peeling -- the night before I had plans to go to a pool party. There were huge sections of skin flaking off the bottoms, tops and sides of my feet. If it were just that reaction, it still would have been OK, because the sections that had peeled really were &amp;#34;baby foot soft.&amp;#34; Unfortunately, the peeling continues for a couple of days and once it&#x27;s complete, some areas (like the heel) had already started hardening again, while others were beautiful. It&#x27;s not a consistent peel and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the product during the couple of week period where your feet will be exposed publicly, through shoes, pool decks, etc., as you might get a few looks, however, if you&#x27;re looking for soft feet in the dead of winter, when no one but you and your housemates might see, then it&#x27;s worth it. Either way, the effects are not long lasting.</li>
    <li> I used this according to directions---put the booties on after soaking my feet and I left them on for close to two hours while watching tv. I did put on a pair of socks over the booties to help them stay in place. I would not recommend walking while wearing these booties--it&#x27;s dangerous I nearly fell (the packaging warns of this but I just thought I would confirm it). Exactly 7 days later my feet starting shedding. The shedding lasted approximately two weeks and my feet were definitely as soft as baby feet. I did not realize how bad the callouses were on my big toes and the side of my baby toe until my feet started peeling. I will definitely use this again. Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gross fun fact:  my three-year-old could not help himself from peeling the dead skin off my feet every chance he got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: the bottom of your feet will be tender; DO NOT GO BAREFOOT if it is really hot outside after use as your bare feet will burn on the hot cement. Even more than a month after use the bottom of my feet are still very tender and delicate (like a baby&#x27;s). I have to wear my flip flops right up to the edge of the pool as I can&#x27;t walk on the hot concrete without getting a burn. I have been using sunscreen on the top of my feet and ankles as I had some shedding there as well.  (Again the package includes this warning but I thought I would confirm it.)</li>
    <li> Does EXACTLY what it says it will. I didn&#x27;t believe it but it does.</li>
    <li> Worked well to remove the skin, but it grew back immediately and my feet are back to being rough.</li>
    <li> My feet were so bad I used to use sand paper on them until I found this product.  I soaked my feet in water for a half of an hour before I used this product, and then kept my feet in Baby Foot for 2 full hours before washing off.  Take other users&#x27; advice and do not use lotion on your feet until the dead skin comes off.  Mine didn&#x27;t start coming off until the sixth day after, but when it did, my feet were just as promised!!!  Baby soft!  :)</li>
    <li> As described it took 5 days.</li>
    <li> I followed all the package directions, as well as the tips of other reviewers. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. I&#x27;m not saying the product itself doesn&#x27;t work. But what I received from this supplier did not work for me. A bad batch, perhaps? Whatever the case, I&#x27;m left disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! You do have to be patient with it. I used this last Wednesday and by Sunday I noticed peeling around my toes. Tonight I just finished soaking my feet and noticed my feet peeling in sheets! I been soaking every other day but tonight I also exfoliate with a sugar scrub.  The key I believe is to soak your feet every day or every other day as others suggested.  I will definitely used this again.</li>
    <li> Not very often do you find a product that does what it says. The first couple of days after I wore the booties nothing happened and I was concerned I wasted my money and time but that third and fourth day I really started seeing the peeling! Great product!</li>
    <li> I must say that this is one of the most disgusting yet fabulous products on the market. I definitely recommend that you watch some videos prior to ordering so you know what to expect. I was extremely pleased with the results and enjoyed the process</li>
    <li> Waste of money...did not work. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I peeled for a full week. Great product I will be buying again</li>
    <li> Soooo disappointed that this product did not work. At all. Followed the directions and suggestions of happy users exactly (soaking before and after treatment, as well as numerous times in the weeks following using product) to no avail. Not one bit of peeling after two weeks of very patiently waiting and soaking. Nothing. Nada. Perhaps a defective box of product? Guess it does not work for everyone. :(</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Have terrible feet, and this was a life saver.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to do this again.  This is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> awesome product.  worked very well.  ordered more to prep for summer.</li>
    <li> OH MY HUSBANDS FEET.  4 DAYS AFTER THEY PEELED, ALOT.  IT WORKS BUT I FEEL THE PRICE IS HIGH.  IT SEEMS THAT THE PRICE WAS HIGHER AS IT GOT MORE POPULAR.  BUT IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> The product smelt amazing. However, I was expecting way to much out of a 20 dollar chemical peel. It did remove the top layer of my skin making my feet softer, but in the end my feet are still not at the place I want them to be.</li>
    <li> I am a believer!!! Didn&#x27;t think this would work on my feet but worked miracles!</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading other reviews.  Used on a Friday and by Sunday was in full peel mode.  Continued for about a week. It delivers just what it promises.  Most of the dead skin came off .  I was amazed by the new skin underneath.  The product is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Worked well, as described, however it came without packaging and not directions. I was very concerned. I ended up researching YouTube videos for directions. I really needed those instructions. It also came without packaging, it was in a foil package with no pictures, directions, boxed package, just blank. This is a problem I hope is fixed soon. I am sceptical of reordering this product from that company.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better results</li>
    <li> Baby Foot worked above and beyond my expectations! I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to friends and family and I&#x27;ll use it again, as needed.</li>
    <li> Great.  My feet were in such poor condition that even the pedicure place hated seeing me.  Boots fit my foot and secured tape to help hold them on.  Great results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.  I did everything that EVERYONE said to do.  All I had was irratating flaking.  I had high hopes! Bi was totally bummed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed after all the hype</li>
    <li> Works as promised but do this treatment in winter when your feet will be covered for a week or so. Not a pretty sight to try and wear sandals or any shoe without a sock, as you will look like a molting lizard.</li>
    <li> What I received was a silver packet with no product identification. I used the product as directed and it had NO effect. I found the real product at a local spa and paid $24. The real product worked great. I requested and received a full credit from Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> I left booties on for more than 1 hour and never peeled.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I&#x27;ve bought it 4 or 5 times now and use it about every 3 months. I now do this instead of getting a pedicure - the softness of my feet lasts way longer with this product than any salon pedicure ever has. It removes all the dead tissue so I can just paint my nails myself and it looks great! It&#x27;s like I have my middle school feet back! Another awesome thing about this is how refreshed my feet feel after the peeling process is done. They feel like they can &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;! Also interesting is how the sensitivity comes back - my feet are much more ticklish after using this product and stepping on cold tiles is much more notable than when the dead tissue layers are on my feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use it: soak feet in water for 1 hour. dry feet and put the booties on for one hour. rinse off the gel and then go about my business. i then soak my feet in water for 10-15 minutes each night for the next 2 weeks. peeling usually starts 3-5 days after wearing the booties. i rub the peeling skin with my hands while they&#x27;re in the water. works every time!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing and I mean AH-MAZING! Buuuuuuttttt.....I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price! The first two times I bought it on here, it cost about $20 each time (granted, from a different seller)! I&#x27;m willing to pay more than $20 because it&#x27;s THAT great, but this is too much. I understand supply and demand, but jeez - this price is ridiculous. Too bad.</li>
    <li> This came highly recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  Do not use when you have an important engagement coming up within a couple of weeks.  Your feet will peel.  My cracked heels were gone after first use.  Wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  My deeply cracked heels &amp; callouses started peeling off about 5 days after I used it. The key is following the instructions to the letter - soak your feet - I did mine for about 10 minutes.  5 STARS!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Beyond my expectations!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try my Baby foot.  I read and followed ALL of the directions.  3 days after I wore the booties my feet started to peel.  They peeled for about a week, but the thicker skin didn&#x27;t peel easily.  I had to scrub that part off.  The whole foot peel was more like peeling a sunburn rather than what the pictures showed.  Once the peeling was mostly finished, my feet were very dried out, cracked and basically how they looked before the product was used.  Since the directions say not to use lotion, unless it&#x27;s really necessary then only in very small amounts, I haven&#x27;t used any.  Once my feet are done with the peeling, I&#x27;ll see if the lotion now will help my new &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34; regain their smoothness.</li>
    <li> doesnt work. looks like all hype.&lt;br /&gt;regularly get the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; with pedicures. not worth the effort or price. pass.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but I am a huge fan of strong peels. My skin came off in layers and revealed much softer skin. My family thought it was really gross, but I knew it was working. It did take 6 days to start peeling.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband because he is always complaining about dry, itchy feet. I understand that it says your feet will peel but I never expected it to look like he was dragging in snow everywhere he walked. His feet peeled for a couple weeks and it would be chunks of dry, dead skin. It was such a horrible experience. And insult to injury, he didn&#x27;t even have baby soft feet after! Disaster!</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it said it would. My feet are so soft.</li>
    <li> Worked awesome!!! Gross at first I recommend soaking feet every night, my feet were so bad and could probably use another treatment in another month but very pleased, no salon could give you the same results!</li>
    <li> i received an imposter product and sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;the directions were xeroxed from the original babyfoot product,&lt;br /&gt;but the product was in the shape of a PED, not a BOOT.&lt;br /&gt;disgusted</li>
    <li> Be patient for the product to work, but it will work and the dead skin just falls off!</li>
    <li> I completely peeled a dead layer of skin from my feet using this product.  The peeling started after one week after application and the whole process took about three weeks for the peel to finish.  I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> Omg! This stuff was the best stuff everrr. My foot has to b the roughest I&#x27;ve ever saw. Its a bit gross when the skin starts to shed. So if your going somewhere important I advise u to do it 3 weeks prior. Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> I tried Baby Foot because I couldn&#x27;t believe anything would work on my callused heels. I was wrong, this stuff works!  It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> This was FANTASTIC!  I am in my 70s and I was always trying to smooth my dry, scaly feet.  This worked exactly as described - heels and all!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stop feeling how smooth they are.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works very well for exfoliating the feet.  You will come back for more, guarantee!</li>
    <li> I had originally given this product a 2 star rating. I used the booties and 5 days later nothing happened. After scouring through all the reviews again; I read a review that suggested if you soak your feet for 15 minutes before and after treatment it will work so much better. It was too late to pre soak, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try soaking my feet after the fact. I soaked them, then the next day as promised I started peeling like a snake. It&#x27;s a week later and my feet are almost entirely baby smooth. I need another treatment and continued soaking for the tough heel area and balls of my feet. These areas are much much smoother and no longer cracking and infinitely more comfortable. After all these years of creams, blades, and cheese grater scrapers which worked temporarily I have found the answer to my rough dry feet.</li>
    <li> This product is like nothing I have ever experienced before. When I used the booties, I first soaked my feet in warm water for a few minutes. I put the booties on, secured them with the included tape, and covered the whole mess with socks as recommended in the instructions. An hour later I removed everything and rinsed off. I was disappointed that my feet, although a bit pruny, felt exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT WAIT!  A few days later I pulled off my socks at the end of the day and my feet were shedding like a happy lizard!  Over the next couple of days, the entirety of both feet lost their top layer of skin and uncovered a new, soft as a baby&#x27;s foot layer underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is half the price of a nice pedicure but five times as effective at softening your feet. I cannot recommend enough!</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to perform as promised.  Sometimes, it&#x27;s great to be wrong.  This stuff is phenomenal!  My feet haven&#x27;t felt like this in eons.  Now I am glad I bought two, although I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll need the second round.  Simply amazing!</li>
    <li> This product ACTUALLY works!!! I did this in the summer and within 2 days the dead and dry skin just peeled off!!! I&#x27;ll will probably be buying again to do a second one before we get to the seasons where my feet are stuck in closed shoes all day!!!</li>
    <li> i read the reviews on this product before buying... i was not disappointed.. started peeling on the 4th day... i do recommend this to everyone...</li>
    <li> Its good to do maybe once a year. I kept peeling for about 2 months which sounds great, but wasn&#x27;t. I live in Miami and couldn&#x27;t wear sandals the whole time because of the peeling.  Another, my feet got softer, but never got baby soft. I expected more.  Mind you I don&#x27;t have corns or heavy calluses either!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off ALL your calluses, if you have calluses like mine, but it does take off a lot.  Also, your feet feel amazing afterward from all the stuff in the exfoliant - it&#x27;s like a spa in two foot baggies.  Price seems to fluctuate on this one.  IMHO it&#x27;s worth $20-25, but not $30-40.</li>
    <li> Really works and feet felt&lt;br /&gt;Looked great. Took about 6 days and feet&lt;br /&gt;Looked&lt;br /&gt;Like a snake&lt;br /&gt;Losing&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Skin.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. My daughter bought me and her one. Worked exactly like it said it would. I do not take baths, I use a shower and my feet still went through the whole process of peeling off all dead skin. I did soak my feet several times through out the process. It removed all calluses and the thick skin on my heels that even a professional pedicure couldn&#x27;t remove. Very well worth the money. For the people that said it didn&#x27;t work....not sure what to say except that it has very clear directions and probably they didn&#x27;t follow them. It worked on me and both of my daughters. My feet are baby smooth!</li>
    <li> No instructions,  had to look up what to do online.&lt;br /&gt;The product worked!</li>
    <li> Feet began to molt after about 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product once a year for the last two years through Amazon.  My feet peeled and looked disgusting for a while, but the product really does work.  My feet are noticeably softer and healthier when the peeling is done.  I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars except for the new price.  Last year I paid $25..  I paid $25 the year before too.  I can see some price increase, but double?  That is not a reasonable increase in one year.  I won&#x27;t buy the product again knowing that this seller is taking advantage of the product being popular.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully.....my feet are incredibly soft and smooth....Luv it!</li>
    <li> Best product ever used for my feet...definitely will purchase again and again...works magically...</li>
    <li> Yep... It works great. Exactly as it says</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product... didn&#x27;t do a thing... couldn&#x27;t believe it after some of the review I have read.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 0 stars because it did nothing.  I followed directions exactly, and it did absolutely nothing!  It was a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ll leave it on for an hour and a half next time but I did like the results and expect to use it again</li>
    <li> Amazed by the difference, will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I love it! I had one problem foot which I&#x27;ve tried everything to get the hard dry skin off. Nothing worked! I ordered baby foot soaked my feet for 15 min before then wore the booties for 1 hr. Started to peel on five days. Didn&#x27;t get all the dry skin off but my foot looks so much better. Just ordered another pair for a second treatment!</li>
    <li> I regularly use an Emjoi Micro-Pedi, and a foot file from Sally&#x27;s.  But as someone who pretty much only wears flip flops and has horrid cracking heels, I was really looking forward to trying this product.  So imagine my surprise when I had ZERO peeling after wearing these silly plastic shoes for 2 hours.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Be patient when using it. Took me about a week for the peeling to stop. Moisturize when done and try to keep it moisturized. Soaking your feet helps in the peeling process.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is it just works. It&#x27;s an awful (not painful) experience for about a week as you constantly shed dead skin. You&#x27;ll find dead skin throughout your house for weeks afterwards, so wear socks as much as you can. It&#x27;ll be at the bottom of your bed, under the sheets, rugs, carpet, bathroom tile...but even though it&#x27;s a mess, it&#x27;s so satisfying to know you&#x27;re getting rid of the nasty dead skin on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one more note, it does not remove a callus. I would recommend using a Ped Egg or other product to remove as much of the callus as you can before using Baby Foot. Also, per the instructions, soak your feet in warm water right before using, I used Epsom salt. After your feet are completely exfoliated, to prolong the baby soft skin, buy foot cream and wear socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a great product all around!</li>
    <li> It took longer that I had expected for the peeling to begin, about 10 days, but good gracious, once it started I looked like a lizard monster!  You can&#x27;t wear any type of shoes that show your feet during the peeling process--which is still ongoing for me.  I can&#x27;t wear my business pumps to work, so you should plan to work for home for at least a week or more, depending on how much longer this peeling continues.  Your feet definitely look unpresentable (and absolutely ridiculous) while peeling.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found that covers it up is socks up to my ankles and tennis shoes.  I mean, it&#x27;s a freaky mess, so I hope it&#x27;s worth it when it&#x27;s all over.  It&#x27;s definitely a product for people who can stay at home a lot.  But, I can&#x27;t really knock the product, it did what it said, and I commend it for that.  It definitely made my feet peel...and peel and peel.  The package just might want to warn people that they will be homebound and their feet will be unpresentable to the public for a long while during the peeling process.</li>
    <li> Good product, just be patient with it. My feet started peeling after 2 days and kept peeling for about a week. Took off callouses and dried skin pretty well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I did have some peeling, but nothing major. I have much better results with a foot file.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy or recommend this.</li>
    <li> My feet have a tendency to get calloused, and it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get rid of the dead skin that develops on the heels. Scrubs are great for light exfoliation, but anyone with dry, cracked heels will tell you that even the most luxurious scrubs do nothing in that department. I was skeptical when I ordered Baby Foot, but the slew of good reviews on Amazon - as well as a few on Buzzfeed - prompted me to give it a whirl. At only $20 bucks, I figured it wasn&#x27;t that much of a risk. Boy am I glad I tried it! Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago,  I used the product. I followed the instructions and cleaned/soaked my feet beforehand, and then slipped on the booties (the smell is pretty wonderful). I put socks over those and watched TV for the next hour (warning: don&#x27;t walk around while wearing the booties, as you might slip and injure yourself). After sitting still for exactly one hour, I rinsed the gel-like residue from my feet and went on with my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few days, nothing miraculous occurred. My feet were still dry, chapped, and gross. Exactly six days after my &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;, I decided to soak my feet in some warm water (peeling occurs within 5-7 days, and I hoped this would help facilitate the peeling process). I filled a foot bath with hot water and Epsom salts and relaxed for an hour. I was not prepared for what I saw when I took my feet out of the water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN. Chunks of rubbery, white, dead skin were hanging off my feet. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all, and as I excitedly pulled away the dead layers (much like a child ripping the paper off a Christmas package), I saw healthy, new skin beneath. It was a miracle! I almost had a heart attack, but in a happy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, beauty treatments can be gross before they work. My feet are still peeling a bit, but I am hooked. This method is so much easier than furiously scrubbing at your dead skin with a Ped Egg, or some other exfoliator. Just make sure you follow the instructions, and 5-7 days after the treatment, soak your feet thoroughly. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.ak your feet thoroughly. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It worked fairly well, but my feet weren&#x27;t THAT smooth after I removed the dead skin, but much more smoother than if I had gone to a nail shop. Be aware that your feet are going to continue to &#x27;shed&#x27; for at least two to three weeks after you use it. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, I saw baby foot on a video, so I wanted to try it and boy does it work wonders, at first mine wasn&#x27;t working as fast as I saw on the videos but it did say it would work after 5 days and on the 5th day it was peeling a lot, and they say it can peel for up to 10 days but mine was finished by the 8th day and my feet were soft and callus free. Your feet look pretty gross while it&#x27;s peeling and it gets all in your socks but the results are great. I would definitely  purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This worked so much better than I thought it would. I have severely dry cracked heels and I didn&#x27;t realize I had so many layers of dead skin to remove. It got rid of dang near all of it. Amazing. I&#x27;d post pictures but I don&#x27;t want to disgust anybody, it was quite gruesome once the skin began shedding. Will be needing another pack of this soon as my feet are missing being able to breathe free and clear of excess dry skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;I bought for my husband who very much needed it. His feet, for lack of a better word, were gross. Dry, cracked,...&lt;br /&gt;So I bought for myself. Wow, Amazing!</li>
    <li> EWWWW...all the nasty skin that comes off of one&#x27;s feet.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It took forever to arrive and I was not satisfied with the end result. My feet are no better now then they were before.</li>
    <li> This b product is great! I went about 7 days without peeling so I thought y hat this was a bust. Then one unfortunate dau, my work shoes broke, but I didn&#x27;t notice until I walked in a few puddles. My socks were soaked. When I got home and took off my broken shoe and soaking sock and OH MY GOODNESS!! The skin was falling off of my feet!!! This lasted a week because I couldn&#x27;t help but peel some off. In the end it left my feet really soft</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! I wished they sold it in stores. At first I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on an hour or more. I left it on for an hour. Some reviews I read said to leave it on 2. My feet started peeling 4 days after I application &amp; they are still peeling but my feet are very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is marvelous!  I used it every 4-5 months and more often in summer wearing flip flops.</li>
    <li> Delivery took twice the time advertised and the product worked just so-so.</li>
    <li> This product works better if you soak your feet for a few minutes each day after the treatment.  Soaking your feet makes the dry skin expand and shear off from the underlying normal skin.  You&#x27;ll noticed after a few days large patches of dry skin ready to peel off.</li>
    <li> a lot of work .. but the results are great</li>
    <li> Crazy how well it works!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and makes your feet look and feel like a million bucks.  It pealed like an eight of an inch of dead callouses off my skin in certain places painlessly. I get pedicures from time to time and they don&#x27;t compare to how well this transforms overworked feet.</li>
    <li> Its hit or miss on whether or not the product i receive will work on my feet.  I have bought several packages and only about 50% of the time my dead skin peels.</li>
    <li> My results were somewhat disappointing.  I got minimal peeling even after soaking daily afterwards.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations in exfoliating my feet even though I followed the directions with pre-soaking and additional soaking after application.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My feet have never been more soft or felt more silky. I cant afford regular pedicures. But this!! Soak your feet 15-30 mins just before you use it. Then everyday for the same amount of time for at least a week. You Will Be Amazed!! I highly recommend it and you cant beat it for the price!! It came quickly in the mail and did everything it promised to do. I will use this product forever!!</li>
    <li> It absolutely works. It&#x27;s disgusting and exciting how much skin comes off! I wish there was one that worked quickly for hands because your feet won&#x27;t peel for a few days and by then you probably have forgotten you did it and will have a mild heart attack!</li>
    <li> I read lots of mixed reviews on this so I was a bit leery about buying it, but I did and I have to say that it totally worked!  I soaked my feet beforehand and left the treatment on for an hour as per the instructions.  Nothing much happened for about 5 days other than my feet started looking really dry.  After a long bubble bath though my feet were shedding skin like a snake!  I ended up soaking my feet a lot that weekend and within a couple of days it slowed down, but I don&#x27;t think it totally stopped for several days.  It&#x27;s been several weeks since I used it and my feet are still 1000X better than before I did it.  I did have some problems at first with (re)developing blisters from wearing socks and shoes though because the newer skin had never been exposed to friction before.  It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I thought I&#x27;d put that out there...</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is just the greatest for your feet. I would recommend to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> good product and fast delivery also.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. It worked as it said it would. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> Applied as directed and it worked well on the majority of my foot , However my callused heels did not peel as well as I had hoped. This may be due to not soaking my feet 30 minutes as most reviews suggest, will give it another try.</li>
    <li> Kinda creepy watching your feet disintegrate but weirdly absorbing as well. Here&#x27;s to having baby feet and five days of gross skin falling off. Well, we pay for beauty, right? Note: Wear socks at night to avoid weird stuff all over your sheets.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to use this, but didn&#x27;t work, soaked my feet prior the application, I followed the instructions and waited the right amount of time...nothing happened and then I tried again (about two weeks later) because some people say it takes a second application and what happened? NOTHING!!</li>
    <li> I works well.  Works best if your feet are soft from your shower.  I keep the Babyfeet &#x27;socks&#x27; on for about 45 min to an hour.  I just put them on at the beginnig of my favorite show and let them soak!  Peeling looks icky, but it sure works.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped, but then again it didn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, because I have a few stubborn hard spots that never get completely removed in spite of regular pumicing. Yes, soaking my feet in a mild acid until they start to molt sounded extreme, but I wanted extreme. I was ready to take the next step in foot care, and get rid of those hard spots. I followed the instructions exactly, including pre-soaking my feet. I then waited several days, while my feet looked exactly the same, and fought the urge to pumice away the dead spots. Just as promised, the feet started to shed like crazy approximately five days after I first used the product. But a closer observation revealed that they were mostly shedding healthy skin, such as the skin along the arches of my feet. The hardened parts on the balls and toes lost only a thin layer of surface skin--the same thin layer that I lost from the arches of my feet, which do not regularly have any dead skin. The result is that it looks like my feet received a good lotion and pumicing. They don&#x27;t have visible dead skin, but they still have several hard spots to the touch--nothing like a &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s foot.&amp;#34; That would be alright, if I hadn&#x27;t undergone two weeks of extremely, ugly feet (waiting for the peeling to start, and having feet that looked like a lizard in full molt) to get this result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you know how to effectively pumice your feet, stick to it. This product is a lot of hassle for results that aren&#x27;t better.</li>
    <li> I have used this product three times over the past two years. It kind of works, in that it does peel a layer of skin off your feet. I have found; however that it does not get rid of the deep cracks and fissures of the heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong; the process is so cool. Over the period of about ten days the skin on your feet will peel off in sheets...and that is awesome! It&#x27;s like a science experiment on your body. It does not hurt at all unless you try to peel the skin yourself. I am a picker and the first time I did this I pulled on the peeling skin, but I ended up with sore spots; almost like when you peel a sunburn. Don&#x27;t do it. Just fight the urge tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best peels come after you have bathed or showered. The skin just sloughs off your feet. You will leave dead skin on the carpet, couch, chairs...everywhere. It&#x27;s kind of gross, but kind of neat too in an &amp;#34;eeew&amp;#34; sort of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for freshening up the look of your feet, but again; it won&#x27;t heal them. Oh I just remembered! One thing that was really neat was that it faded some scars I had on my feet from old blisters. It really lessened the appearance of those old scars. It smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman owes it to herself to try this at least once.</li>
    <li> Really works! I would buy all the time if I could afford it. Try it. My husband has the worst most embarrassing calloused feet and it worked for him. If your feet are in really bad shape you will need to use at least twice maybe three times.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 5 days ago. No problems during use. Do be careful as it&#x27;s slippery inside the bag with the gel, as one would expect. I put a tight-ish sock on top to hold this in place. No pain in using. Immediately upon removal, my feet looked like a roadmap, but no peeling for a few days. (see pic).&lt;br /&gt;Three full days in my feet began peeling, including on spots with areas that I thought were fine pre-peel, like arches and tops of my feet. I give my feet a good rub (with just hands or a coarse towel) after showering as they shed a lot and wear socks all the time.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are awful looking right now, but having read reviews, I expected this. It TBD if they&#x27;re better after. I posted a couple of pics. The first is immediately after, and the second three days in. I&#x27;ll update later.</li>
    <li> Baby Foot is the real deal there&#x27;s nothing like it.</li>
    <li> It works as described by everyone.</li>
    <li> I used the product for the recommended time and dealt with itchy/burning feet for 2 days. Then my feet never did peel. After about 4 days I couldn&#x27;t take it and decided to try and see if some of the skin would peel off. It was very minimal. Overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with hard and dry feet for almost 10 years.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds, probably thousands on pedicures, so I decided to try this product.  I misread the instructions and wore the gel booties for 2 hours.  :-|  I am on day 4 and my feet are shedding drastically!  The skin beneath is so soft.  For the cost of one pedicure, i&#x27;ve eradicated the issues with my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - I thought I was purchasing the product from babyfootusa.com but what I received was a similar product with Japanese and English language on the box.  Not sure if they are the same company but I was a bit skeptical when I opened the box.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works exactly the way they say.  I have used it twice. Will continue to purchase a few times a year.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, easy to use and quick responce!! Definently recomend this! i love it. Would definitely use it again if needed.</li>
    <li> I used it &amp; at first I was skeptical but 5 days later after a good cardio session I took my socks off &amp; my feet were peeling! After about two weeks total my feet were baby soft</li>
    <li> I read several reviews and had hopes that I would get decent results, unfortunately it did nothing. My feet are pretty dry, I live in AZ and as much as I need to wear flip flops around here, I thought it would be nice to have great looking feet. Anyway, I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> It really works, but the trick is to SOAK YOUR FEET every day after application (doesn&#x27;t take up that much time while you watch tv or read) to see great results.  I am going to purchase again either today or tomorrow.  Great product and customer service response.</li>
    <li> 2x means there are 1 for each foot not 2 treatments.  Works as described.  I used it 2 months in a row.  It has been about 5 months now and I am still good.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve purchased it from other sites in the past. It&#x27;s gross, but so worth the final product. You&#x27;ll have super soft feet!</li>
    <li> This works great if you follow the directions.  Don&#x27;t leave them on 2 hours.  More s not better.  But I did find if I soak my feet before, and the next day/ days after, it worked faster and better.  No time to soak your feet?  When you take your regular shower, put the stopper in the tub.  Same as a foot soak :)</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, have not used as of yet. Will post update upon actual usage.</li>
    <li> This product sounded too good to be true, but after reading so many positive reviews I thought it was worth a try. I should have saved my money. After following the directions to the letter, my results were poor to dismal. The only part of my foot that peeled - was the top part - and that was minimal. I hoped this product would result in the hard dry skin on the bottoms of my feet to slough off - but there was not one bit of difference from before to after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it works after multiple treatments, but with no guarantees that could get pretty expensive. Save your money-&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had.</li>
    <li> Read through a lot of reviews before order the product. Soaked my feet before wearing the boots for 2 hours. The peeling didn&#x27;t happen at all.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product, I was very excited to try it. I did my homework prior to buying the product. Most people said they had great results. I ordered my Baby Foot and followed the instructions. I even soak my feet everyday for about 15 mins. Nothing happens except for my feet to be really dry. Be warn, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product!!!</li>
    <li> I followed all the instructions.  I soaked my feet before.  I soaked after.  I soaked every single night for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 days my feet peeled.  But not that much.  It wasn&#x27;t coming off in sheets like some other reviewers experienced.  My feet were just flakey in some areas and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think my results were lackluster because I don&#x27;t have a ton of thin,dry areas on my feet.  I get regular pedicures.  The dry skin I have on my feet is mainly that thick skin on the heels and big toe that it is impossible to get rid of with regular pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if that&#x27;s the case for you, this product won&#x27;t give you such breathtaking results.  You will get results -- but just lower your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note:  If you are planning to wear sandals or show your feet publicly, do this treatment at least a few weeks prior.  My feet looked diseased with all the flakey skin and dryness.  I kept thinking &amp;#34;thank goodness it&#x27;s too cold for flip flops.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Okay, well... I didn&#x27;t think it would work... but it does!  The peeling skin is gross but effective!</li>
    <li> I love this, the peeling started a day after applying the product.  I highly recommend this for individuals that take care of there feet and need an additional pick me up before the summer.</li>
    <li> Try it...it takes about a week but you won&#x27;t believe how soft you&#x27;re feet will be!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Does not work as described.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use but I did not get the desired or advertised results.&lt;br /&gt;there was no pealing no improvement in skin texture.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a whim because I was desperate for some assistance with my feet. I moved from Florida to Texas a few years ago and my feet became so dry. It was perturbing and embarrassing. The reviews for this product were mixed but I thought, what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1... This product does work. I followed the instructions of the reviewer here that suggested to keep soaking your feet every day or every other day after using this product. That part is very effective and I feel should be included in their instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 (and most importantly).. since doing the treatment, my feet have been so incredibly itchy that it keeps me awake at night. This has been going on for days and I feel like I&#x27;m going to lose my mind.. not to mention, shred my feet to pieces from scratching. I&#x27;ve had to wear socks (and I hate wearing socks) just to prevent myself from scratching my feet to the point of bleeding. That is insanity. I have no idea why I am having this reaction to the product. I have pretty sensitive skin otherwise but never have found my feet to be overly sensitive. My feet immediately became irritated and were covered in red bumps..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the itchiness may be from the dry skin releasing. I have no idea. The product does work. However, I&#x27;ve paid a steep price for it...</li>
    <li> Amazing!  It actually does take off layers of skin.  My feet feel so much better.</li>
    <li> I am very happy.  How often should I do this or should what is the maximum?</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work as expected.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really makes the skin peel off. No itching or burning at all, just renewing. I want to repurchase for a part of my regular regimen (once or twice a year depending on how long it lasts. It was easy to use and fun to see it working (4 days later it started peeling, then 6 days later it was peeling a lot more).</li>
    <li> Works great, soak feet first</li>
    <li> Be prepared as this certainly does cause your feet to peel excessively 5-7 days post soaking.  At first I was worried that it was not working on my heels (the primary reason for using), but eventually I found my heels to be in so much better shape.  I will probably use this every month to 6 weeks during the summer months to keep them in good condition.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It was a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
    <li> My first reaction a few days after the procedure was..what have I done!!  You literally do shed dead tissue on all portions of the feet and you cannot help the process along with scrubbing, etc.  They are now baby soft, but I also am having to be careful not to get blisters when wearing certain shoes.  Sandles and flip flops will be great.  I would do it again some time later.</li>
    <li> Baby Feet made my feet look and feel 30 years younger !</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Will definitely buy more.  It took about 3-5 days before I saw the skin peeling away. Feet are smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Initially it removes all your dry dead skin. Your feet will truly feel smooth like a babies foot. But after a week or so the dry skin returns.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said, peeled skin off feet. Feet look and feel great. No side effects</li>
