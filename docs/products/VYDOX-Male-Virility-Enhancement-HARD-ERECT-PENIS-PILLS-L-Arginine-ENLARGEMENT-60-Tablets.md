      <li>Worked best early on then results were not as good.</li>
      <li>Would like to hear more than one ...</li>
      <li>but there are some with better feedback.  </li>
      <li>This whoel company is about getting your card info and then, without telling you, charging your card $90 a month for more of the supplement.</li>
      <li>Everything was okay 👌</li>

      <li>Thanks guys!</li>
      <li>but I am curious if there&#x27;s better?  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any real difference.</li>
      <li>Their trial offer is also very deceiving.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really solve any problems.</li>
      <li>My first pill I could tell it was potent, Little rush in blood flow and some eye focus change.  </li>

      <li>Yes I was on the edge of high blood pressure.</li>
      <li>You do whatever it takes to please her, but, you dont feel like youre quite there in the dick region, and want a little bit more.</li>
      <li>&quot; I purchased this direct from the Vydox website on a trial offer.</li>
      <li>Odds are, youre young like me (21), have a spouse or girlfriend, and she loves your dick.</li>
      <li>I use to be right about the same length as my Nokia 928, but now the head of my penis extends just a bit further than the edge of the case.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-10-14: I have noticed i am only slightly longer than i was before i was taking these pills, but its a push in the right direction.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lousy product, horrible company. They do not honor their return policy. We are disputing them with our credit card company. Stay away. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> Read the ingredients (many are not listed), this stuff can be dangerous!!!!....But at least you won&#x27;t be scamed as people are when they order it from the mfg...some people say when you order from the mfg you are billed monthly and can not cancel as the web site says...</li>
    <li> Even though their claims of no side effects, side effects still occur. Vydox does not stand behind their 100% satisfaction guarantee. Their trial offer is also very deceiving. You automatically become enrolled in a monthly shipping and you credit card will be charged full price 2 weeks after the initial order.</li>
    <li> I have hypertension and it is not safe for me....Could not find out until purchased.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really solve any problems. Noticed only a slight improvement over a few weeks after taking. Blood pressure readings are lower however there are cheaper alternatives to lower blood pressure</li>
    <li> This whoel company is about getting your card info and then, without telling you, charging your card $90 a month for more of the supplement. You can&#x27;t get your money back and it does not do what it advertises</li>
    <li> Everything was okay 👌</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to  guarantee to have erections ,my weenie is still limp, but it does give you a extra boost of energy.</li>
    <li> Odds are, youre young like me (21), have a spouse or girlfriend, and she loves your dick. You do whatever it takes to please her, but, you dont feel like youre quite there in the dick region, and want a little bit more. Let me tell you, ive noticed a significant increase in thickness only after 3 days of use. I get harder faster and stay that way. Now youre wondering \\&quot;why isnt he an Amazon certified buyer?\\&quot; I purchased this direct from the Vydox website on a trial offer. If youre looking for something to start with, start with this but dont buy here. Go to the website and get the 5 dollar trial. Its best if you use PayPal to pay for it since they cant keep drawing money out of the account. Just put 5 USD on the account and buy it. Its all a game of chance, this happened to work for me. Ill update this as time goes on. 4 stars only because i just started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-10-14: I have noticed i am only slightly longer than i was before i was taking these pills, but its a push in the right direction. I use my phone as reference, while in its case. I use to be right about the same length as my Nokia 928, but now the head of my penis extends just a bit further than the edge of the case. The screen is about 4.5 inches long. So id say that puts me at a solid 4.8~</li>
    <li> Would like to hear more than one ...</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Will not honor money back  offer. Scam!!!!!!! Stay away please. Does  not work and is toxic to some people. Shut this scamming piece of crap company down.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;Free is not free.  Look for fine print s</li>
    <li> I tried it twice and all it did was make me sick. I tried to get a refund but they would not refund my money. Save your money and get anything else that works.</li>
    <li> Excellent received on time . Excellent product</li>
    <li> This company is running a scam.  They don&#x27;t honor their money back guarantee.  I just reported them to the FTC for cyber scams.  I encourage you to contact the Federal Trade Commission if they refused to honor their money back guarantee.  Perhaps we can get them shut down and keep them from scamming others. (They don&#x27;t even deserve the one star, but I couldn&#x27;t post without giving a star.)</li>
    <li> Glad I read the reviews before purchasing this bogus product! Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> I Was looking for instructions on the box for usage. Couldn&#x27;t find anything. Haven&#x27;t seen any real difference.</li>
    <li> I got this on the free sample plan.  Paid shipping of 4.99 something like that.  I did cancel the automatic monthly plan, I hate how all sample programs on the web are doing this sneaky lil thing.  I read some people got sick taking this the first time. So I decided to only take half the dose they recommend (1 pill).  My first pill I could tell it was potent, Little rush in blood flow and some eye focus change.  The second day (2nd pill) I did not get this rush.  I&#x27;ve now been taking it for 2 months (1 pill a day)  30 day trial package.  I has increased my firmness. I  wake up with Wood like my younger days. My blood pressure has dropped I no longer fill that heavy heart pump feeling, where I needed to take a deep breath to settle down.  Yes I was on the edge of high blood pressure. I want to reorder this but I am curious if there&#x27;s better?  I know this one works but there are some with better feedback.  when do you quit searching? Or should I just take 2 pills?  That sounds expensive.  Oh fyi my pills where blue.  but in this box.</li>
    <li> SAME INGREDIENTS AS ALL THESE OTHER RIPOFF PRODUCTS!!!. Yes, it&#x27;s got Arginine, Yohimbe etc. Save your money if you want these ingredients and buy them individually. Tired of these companies ripping off consumers.</li>
    <li> vydox does every thing it clames it will do. I will surly order this product  again. but only from amazon. there prices are affordable.</li>
    <li> Great for weight loss and increased stamina haven&#x27;t noticed much help with sex drive</li>
    <li> Worked best early on then results were not as good.</li>
    <li> all I can say is nothing happened....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Big smiles for all involved</li>
