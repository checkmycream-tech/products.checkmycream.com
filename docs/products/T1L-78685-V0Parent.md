<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This night lotion has a great feel.  I am using retinol every other night....so on the nights that I do not use retinol I use this.  It helps with the peeling.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin that is prone to inflammation and redness.  From the moment I put this on it was soothing and and helped my problem spots while providing moisture without being too heavy.  I just ordered the rest of the line!</li>
    <li> Excellent night cream.</li>
    <li> feels really great.  I am a big Manuka honey believer so to use it on your skin without being sticky is great.</li>
    <li> I use it as a nightly cream.  Skin is very soft and it looks much healthier after long and stressful day at work. So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this cream. Its def a thickier creamier product, best used for Winters&amp; drier climates. Great scent not too strong or overpowering. I would recommend this product &amp; the original seller.</li>
    <li> Nice cream but very strong, thought nice, fragrance. I first tried this in New Zealand. I would give it 5 stars except for the too intense fragrance.</li>
    <li> Manuka Honey Night Revival Cream 100ml Wild Ferns---- This is so gentle and caress the skin.  I am enjoying it every night before bed I use a little.  Looking for the wonderful result.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of Manuka Honey. I love it. It goes on smooth, has a very pleasant scent and makes my 50+ year old skin look 10-15 years younger. This stuff is the bomb!</li>
    <li> I recently decided to try this night cream, as my usual cream became prohibitively expensive.  It seems to work very well for a natural cream, except for a mild stinging sometimes when I first put it on.  The one thing I can&#x27;t get past is the smell.  Think faux-flower-scented old lady perfume - and it&#x27;s STRONG.  I suppose everyone has different taste in scents, as many reviewers seem to love the smell, but I honestly can&#x27;t stand it and don&#x27;t know if I can use this any longer because of it.  I&#x27;m sad, and I hope that they consider changing the scent - or adding an alternate one as well.</li>
    <li> This gave me pimples on my face, however as a hand cream for dry, chapped skin, this is INCREDIBLE! I swear one healthy application and my husband poor, bleeding, and chapped hands were healed!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cream - it is one of the better ones I have tried.  It is creamy and nice on the skin.  We live in a very dry area and this really works better than higher priced creams I have used.  Thanks for the reminder, I need to order again!</li>
    <li> I found it too thick and heavy for my face--bit of breakout resulting from using it there. But it&#x27;s great as a moisturizing cream for hands and body. The quality is excellent, the price is good for a fairly generously sized tub, and the smell is lovely. An orange-blossom scent usually doesn&#x27;t work on my skin, but in this product it&#x27;s nice!</li>
    <li> Have always loved Wild Fern products and swear by the Manuka Honey hand cream, but this is heavy and greasy and made my skin feel awful. Since I can&#x27;t return it, it will end up in the trash!</li>
    <li> As expected...good product Thank you</li>
    <li> I like the way the cream hydrates, but the smell has forced me to use it on my feet, it has a strange chemical smell.</li>
    <li> This has become my favourite night cream. It&#x27;s relatively thick and creamy, which will suit normal to dry skin. The smell is very pleasant, and the feeling on skin is amazing. Soft and velvety all the way till the morning!</li>
    <li> I tried this cream because it was recommended with the lanolin cream it is also a winner and I will use it for a long time my skin feel great and youthful</li>
    <li> I am a beekeeper so anytime I see anything with honey in it I try it...well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great Scent&lt;br /&gt;Creamy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;To thick&lt;br /&gt;Clogged my pores&lt;br /&gt;Cap didn&#x27;t thread properly which led to the top just being set on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: Try it if you are someone who does well with thick creamy make-up and lotions, if you have large pores and tend to break out I&#x27;d stay away from it.</li>
    <li> using it daily, nice night cream, leaves skin soft, only wish it could help puffy eyes. other than that , I like it</li>
    <li> Nice smell and after you use it you have the sensation of an hydrated face but also it feel heavy, it is not easily to spread.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great product...!</li>
    <li> i found this product in the internet and i love it. my skim look younger and healthier since i been using this product.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for the night cream.  It does go on smooth but the smell is way too perfumey for me.  I could smell it for hours after i put it on.</li>
    <li> This product has dyes and chemicals.  Anything but natural if you need to include yellow 5 &amp; yellow 6 in it.  Smells nice at first, but after a few minutes the odor is overwhelming.  We bought with high hopes, but we were severely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can cause headaches for people sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient list includes in order is:&lt;br /&gt;Water, sweet almond oil, ceterayl alcohol, capric caprylic triglyceride glycerol monostearate, honey stearic acid, glycerol, phenoxyethanol, treithanolamine, perfume, tocopherol, acetate, iodopropynyl butycarbamate, butylene, glycol, neroli oil, yellow 5, yellow 6.</li>
    <li> I love this cream - it&#x27;s rich and creamy and feels so nourishing to my skin. It lasts a long time as well - you just need a little every night.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did not use it long enough but I thought it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this cream and can tell the difference from other creams for my face.  This product is of high quality and can do much for your skin as I have seen improvement.  Keep this product on your shelf.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many night creams through the years and I must say this Ultra Rich Cr&amp;egrave;me is so far the best. I was leery about the price, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I&#x27;ve read the reviews on the scent of this cream, but I really like it, so I guess some people can&#x27;t tolerate certain scents, but again, this isn&#x27;t bad, in fact, I look forward to putting on this cream because of the scent, I just wish the scent would last through the night, but it seems the smell goes away after about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 2 weeks before I actually noticed the improvements to my skin, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and I can&#x27;t see me changing to any other cr&amp;egrave;me. Oh, so yes, I&#x27;m a male and us males worry about our looks also :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer for night and at the worst of the winter, I use it during the day.  It works beautifully to soften and moisturize.  I like it so much, I blogged about it!&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combo skin/dry skin. Very Oily on my forehead, dry on nose and cheeks and chin.  Also can be dry under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as my under eye cream for night as well as an all over cream.  A friend who is a cosmetician once told me that a lot of eye creams are just a gimmick, and her advice was to find a thick cream that I like and use that under my eyes.  So I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is there, but it fades rather quickly.  On my this absorbs well, unless I use too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second tub of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and can really see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My face looks all dewy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a freezing, dry climate so it&#x27;s really hard to find a face cream that works.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought one for my mom, can&#x27;t wait to see what she thinks.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cream as I&#x27;ve been searching for a perfect night cream.  This cream just felt a little too thick and heavy for my taste.  I wasn&#x27;t in love with the smell and the almost sticky feeling of it on my face in the morning.  I was just so ready to wash it off every morning.  Maybe it would do better in the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> I really love the manuka products. I notice a difference in my face and I really like how natural they are</li>
    <li> I liked the creaminess, a little goes a long way, and it smells good. Gave a jar to a girlfriend who immediately bought the soap and other products to go with this. Yes, I will continue to use and like the way it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more, it really makes a difference in my ancient skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and years, but this is far superior. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture for my normal to dry, 42 year old, skin. I bought this with the day cream and eye cream. (I don&#x27;t like to mix moisturizing products.) The night cream is truly ultra rich, just like the label says, and smells so good. Seriously, it smells amazing. Most importantly, it feels like it moisturizes my skin all night. My skin is noticeably smoother every morning. I appreciate that the ingredients list is short and understandable. If this stands up to all four New England seasons, I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PRODUCT! I USE IT ON EVERYTHING AND IT IS DEFINITELY A REVIVAL CREAM! EVERYTHING FEELS AND LOOKS INCREDIBLY YOUTHFUL AFTER USING!! MY FACE &amp; BODY GOES THRU WITHDRAWLS WHEN I RUN OUT! DELIVERY TIME SUPER QUICK ! THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face before I go to bed.  It makes your skin feel very soft.  This product is a great value...it lasts a long time and is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Love it, use it every night leaves my skin so soft and then in the morning I use the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal overnight cream, has a very heavy texture and wonderful smell and you can almost feel it rejuvenating your skin. Great product to have for both everyday and occasional use.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product. Seems to be very gentle to face skin. So far, so good! will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Smell is not strong like other reviews. Its a light floral scent. Only gave 4 stars because I was really disappointed with how small the jar was. For 18$, you&#x27;d expect something rather larger. Will purchase again because it is a very wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This product has a strongly sickly sweet fragrance.  The texture is sticky and not soothing.  I threw it away after the first few nights of trying to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Best that I have found. I use it in addition to the vitamin c and e oil I buy on amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this, makes my skin smooth and hydrated.  Great product.</li>
    <li> i like it. it feels good. but used at night and the smell is overpowering- it does disturb my rest.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t regret buying this cream. It&#x27;s wonderful! I use on face, hands and feet. Soft skin happens when you use this cream.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how effective this product is. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I&#x27;ve been using daily on my elbows, heels and face. The smell is a bit too strong for me but I&#x27;m getting used to it. As far as helping with wrinkles and aging spots, not doing well with that.</li>
    <li> I love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Living in the mountains, I was looking for a cream that would really hydrate my face at night.  This is perfect.  A little goes a long way, and I wake up with soft, moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisurizer I have ever used! It smells and feels amazing...</li>
    <li> This night cream feels good on and hydrates well also the smell is like sweet honey which I like. The price could be a little lower, I like wild fern products but they are kinda high priced.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  This has really helped me a lot.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use this at nite and it really helps moisterize my face and in the morning it is very soft.It is very cold here and it really works well with the wild ferns eye cream. I really like this product and will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Awful cream. Purchased this cream based on other reviews. This cream is very heavy on the skin. Quite greasy and leaves the skin oily and enlarges skin pores. Smell is horrible, quite unpleasant(cheap smell). Buyers beware. Only thing I like as about this cream is the packaging. I&#x27;m afraid I just have to leave it one star based on my experience using the cream.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is super thick. During the cold dry winter it has been nice to have a face cream that holds up without causing breakouts. It will be too heavy for day cream this summer but i&#x27;ll use it at night.</li>
    <li> I use this product in pair with the eye gel and they both leave my skin very moisturized. The cream goes on somewhat thick, but it is quickly absorbed - it is a night cream after all.</li>
    <li> I am 49, and use a variety of products for my face - sometimes feeling like one over another just because.  I find I reach for this one A LOT.  I love the feel, the texture, the smell - it is a perfect, night cream.  I am looking forward to ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is a great night time moisturizer. It moisturizes without making me oily. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the smell is very strong. Its a nice smell and it goes away quickly but while applying it its just a little too strong for me. Other than that I would definitely recommend! I liked it so much that I went and ordered the eye cream as well!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister as part of her Christmas present.  She loved it &amp; wanted to know where I got it.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin smooth but I you leave it on overnight but it has so much chemicals in It if you read the ingredient label.</li>
    <li> I have seen no difference.  I would not buy it again.  It contains a bunch of other things (other than honey) that are not so good for the skin.  Alcohol dries the skin, for instance.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product when I first visited New Zealand. I have extremely dry skin and live in the desert! But I use this &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; cream to keep my face, hands and legs in great condition.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite night cream so far even though the smell is a bit weird!&lt;br /&gt;i think i would purchase this product again in the near future</li>
    <li> Ugh.. the consistency of this cream reminds me of ponds night cream that my grandma had 20 years ago... thick and heavy... glides on easily, but doesn&#x27;t feel smooth, actually feels like I have something on my skin and I don&#x27;t feel especially hydrated or nourished in the morning... I have normal healthy skin....</li>
    <li> Wonderful night cream .... I am only using this from now on.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful moisturizer!! LOVE This stuff!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, it is rich and creamy and really adds moisture to any skin. If I put it on broken or cracked skin it can sting a little but otherwise doesn&#x27;t. This cream is wonderful</li>
    <li> I use this on my cheeks and neck, but avoid my chin which is prone to breakouts.  It gives me a nice glow and does not cause breakouts on the rest of my face as do other products.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s prob a great product, but I tried two different trials just to be sure...and yep, unfortunately it caused me to break out with acne.  Very nice smooth lotion though, and the scent was light and lasted less than a minute.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. My face is extremely sensitive to specific lotions and breaks out with acne or a rash and it did none of the above with this product. It allowed my skin to stay well hydrated in the North country weather.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin with eczema and break outs. NOTHING ever works for me. This cleared my skin OVER NIGHT!!! I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Its OK, I like it, don&#x27;t love love love it, but its thick and moisturizing the outcome though it hasn&#x27;t changed my face or wrinkles much.  A lot of nightcremes will tighten and moisturize........this only moisturizes.</li>
    <li> It is working!!! Very good item.&lt;br /&gt;I have been bought it three times.&lt;br /&gt;I personally recommend that.&lt;br /&gt;Applying also increases your skin&#x27;s shine and health because it moisturizes your skin.</li>
    <li> I am tired of paying high prices for skin care.  This product is soothing on my sensitive 50 plus skin.  Some have commented on the scent, but I find it nice and it does wear off.  I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Way too thick and greasy, absolutely ill-suited for my sensitive combination skin. At the end of the day, I could only use it as a neck cream.</li>
    <li> I am reordering this product. I am very picky about face creams. Can&#x27;t be greasy, but creamy enough to really moisturize. This is the perfect face cream for me!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling on my skin after using the night cream, my face feels refreshed and moistured. It has a nice mild aroma too.</li>
    <li> Use it every night and love how it feels and &amp;#34;settles in&amp;#34; as well as the silky feeling left on my face.  I have forty-something normal to oily skin with once a month pimples.  This keeps the wrinkles at bay while not making my skin feel like it can&#x27;t breathe.  I try lots of products!  From La Mer to Olay. This is both luxurious and economical.  Cruelty free, paraben free, no mineral oil.  I was happily asked for my photo ID when visiting my college kids at a sports bar!  Yay.</li>
    <li> This face cream leaves my skin looking and feeling like silk. It has a clean scent that fades away over time</li>
    <li> I bought this product because its 4 and a half stars. I got it today and use it just now. It smells good of aroma. But when I look at the ingredient and see it contains alcohol and some color added which I didn&#x27;t expect from the natural product like this. Still I don&#x27;t know much how important to add those ingredients, so I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s good or bad. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a while and see the result again.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product, but looking at the ingredients and how people are happy with their purchase, I decided to give it a shot after my night cream ran out. It does have quite a heavy smell in my opinion, but the cream absorbs fast and easy, and the smell hence also fades away in a couple minutes. I have used this for maybe 1.5 months, and have noticed a difference in my skin tone. I have some red acne scars that have been there forever, and they have faded quite well with this cream compared with other night creams that I tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy and will definitely repurchase again.</li>
    <li> After being told about Manuka Honey, I decided to research it a bit.  I have only been using this product for 3 nights but am sold on it.  It makes my skin feel hydrated and healthy.</li>
    <li> smells very good and leaves skin smooth and soft. Will buy it again soon. Love all products which contain Manuka</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so good and I have very sensitive skin. I also use the soap! Most amazing skin cream ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month. It&#x27;s great! I have this chronic rash above my lips &amp; it has stumped my dermatologist. Well manuka honey has been the best thing for it. My rash is still there but the severity has diminished about 80%.  So this is a keeper for me. It also makes my skin feel well cared for &amp; nourished. Get some! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit heavy going on, but absorbs into the skin.  Leaves my skin feeling really smooth, and really takes on the winter dryness.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this night cream. It has a fairly strong honey odor, but I don&#x27;t mind that. It is also pretty thick with a slightly greasy feel, but I have VERY dry skin and it has definitely helped with that. Once it is spread on the face, the greasiness goes away. I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> The perfume is too strong when I applied it to my skin. The texture is light and good. Initially when I  read the comments I thought the cream was as thick as honey. I would keep it if the perfume wasn&#x27;t that strong. I gave it a four star b/c  the return was easy.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Serum and loving it, I purchased this night cream, hoping I would love it just as much. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed - in my book, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum seems to moisturize deeply, while simultaneously feeling light, non-greasy, and absorbing quickly into the skin. This night cream, on the other hand, feels heavier but doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize as deeply. Additionally, the serum smelled primarily of honey, while the night cream has the addition of another distinct smell...I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it&#x27;s the neroli oil mentioned on the package? Regardless, I&#x27;m not overly fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side (and why I gave the product 4 stars instead of 3), this night cream appears to be a decent moisturizer in its own right. I have dry skin, and it moisturizes without clogging my pores or causing breakouts. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d recommend it to someone who has oily or combination skin, as it might be too heavy. Overall, the product seems okay - maybe I would have liked it better if I wouldn&#x27;t have fallen in love with the serum first.</li>
    <li> I think it is great value for what you pay.  It isn&#x27;t odorless, but the smell isn&#x27;t awful.  A hint of manuka honey scent.  The cream hydrates my skin and has soothed redness as well.</li>
    <li> Not into cosmetics, but this one is really good. It makes your skin feel so smooth, soft and natural. Smell is good, package is cute</li>
    <li> I have noticed a definite difference in my skin on my cheeks and under my eyes. I am delighted with the results. Not greasy and has a very pleasant scent. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very, very, good and it works.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, honey, almond oil...all good ingredients for the skin in general, but upon first use, I was very disappointed that this is heavily perfumed. Not a good thing for the face, nor necessary for night time moisturizer I don&#x27;t think. I use it on my legs now and even still, I smell the overly perfumed fragrance... why didn&#x27;t they use essential oils instead???</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really use it so don&#x27;t know too much about it.</li>
    <li> Not Sure just how much Manuka is in this product but it seems to be a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> It is a very greasy cream.  I was hoping it would compliment my manuka honey facials.  It didn&#x27;t.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It moisturizes and makes my skin look less wrinkled while giving it a more plump and slightly rosy appearance. When I first tried it I noticed a stinging effect and was afraid I might be allergic to it as I cannot use many lotions and skin products. But that only  happened on the first application. I suspect it might be the neroli oil which is orange oil. I have used fruit acids on my face which also cause a stinging effect. I like to smooth this cream on after washing my face and hands and they are still slightly wet at night before I go to bed. The cream glides on more smoothly and evenly and I believe it helps seal in the moisture. In the morning my skin looks fresh and vibrant, and it is very very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream every night for about two years now, and this is the first winter where my face isn&#x27;t a complete disaster from the cold, dry weather. It smells fantastic, and is not too heavy or greasy. It is super moisturizing, and you don&#x27;t need much of it to cover your face, so it lasts a pretty long time. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I had heard about the healing properties of manuka honey and thought it might help with my rosacea. While it didn&#x27;t help the rosacea, it does help with the dryness I experience from it as long as I use it regularly. It&#x27;s delicate enough I can use it twice a day and even with my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve had no problems using it. It also has a nice, light scent. My second jar should be arriving in a few days! :)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel fresh and tingly -- i have had a slightly healthier glow since taking it. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it in the morning and at night. Has a slightly sweet smell. I have sensitive skin and it has never given me a problem. Been looking for a nice facial cream without any harmful chemicals and no mineral oils in it. Little seems to go a long way. Will buy again once I run out!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly!...If you like honey. And is all natural... very good for the skin. My skin is mixed dry/oily.</li>
    <li> I live in the high desert so my combination skin is now dry skin and I have a little redness - this stuff is amazing - so soothing and I think it feels luxurious to wear.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of more expensive brands and have finally settled on this one.  Incidentally when I travel out of the desert I still use it and don&#x27;t find it too greasy in other climates.  No idea what other reviewers are saying about the smell - I love it!</li>
    <li> It makes my face soft. My face is not dry now after using this. But it&#x27;s just small and its worth it.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and moisturizes without being greasy. There&#x27;s a distinct scent which I am okay with but some may not like it.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, I use it for my hands, it&#x27;s a little dense and heavy,</li>
    <li> Great cream.I am in my early 50,s,and based on my age I cant expect miracles,but this cream does very good job,smells incredible and is so smooth on skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat my order soon.</li>
    <li> i love this product. first used it after a trip to new zealand. it parches my dry skin in the winter and really does revive the skin. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my skin beautiful, replenishing it with needed nutrients over night.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a way to get beautiful, healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I like this cream and think it is a decent moisturizer.  But as far as results are concerned, I think it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an affordable Night Revival skin cream for some time.  I have sensitive skin and some of the high end creams have irritated my skin.  After reading about the benefits of Manuka Honey I decided to order this cream along with the eye cream, facial scrub and hand/cuticle cream.  I ave been using this as part of my night regimen for just over a week now and I am in love.  My skin has not looked this great in years.  My face is moisturized and my tone is more even.  The scent does not bother me, and I do not think it smells like an old lady, as described by other reviewers.  The scent to me is clean-smells like a jar of local honey I have in the cabinet.  This is definitely now my go to!  Thank you Wild Ferns for such a great product</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ve only had this for one day, but I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get this as a night time face cream, but rather to test out on my eczema. I&#x27;m testing it by rubbing this only on certain spots, and my regular lotion on other spots. So far, it is performing better than my regular, go-to lotion - so 5 thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;I will update the stars and comments if it doesn&#x27;t continue to perform, but for now I&#x27;m sooo pleased that I had to leave a comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/27:&lt;br /&gt;So after ten days, I&#x27;m still loving this cream! All eczema spots calm, no itching, no bumps! Aaahhhh. Wonderful!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT - why isn&#x27;t the product Prime Eligible any more?!</li>
    <li> I feel in love with this product the first time I used it. However, if you have oily/combination skin like me that is prone to acne and scars than you have to be careful with how much of this you use at night. I found out with just light application this cream does wonders to soften my skin the next day. It does not break me out (which often happens with other products), but it can clogs your pores if you drench your face in it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only give it five stars because I hoped to use it both day and night but it is too heavy for a daily moisturizer.....which should be obvious to me and anyone else as it is a &amp;#34;night cream&amp;#34; and because of how much is in the container...I am a new graduate, so I expected to get more product that I received, which I guess is okay now that I am only using this in the night instead of expecting to use it for day and night coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might I add, the packaging is absolutely adorable, I have never received wrapped facial products like this before. I will definitely try their daily moisturizer now; I am obsessed with Manuka Honey products.</li>
