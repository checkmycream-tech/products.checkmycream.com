<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love my box!!! This company is amazing! On time shipping and perfect condition/packaging. Love in love will recommend them to all...</li>
    <li> When I received my Beauty Cube, the bottom 2 drawers are over lapped. Can&#x27;t open the bottom drawer, without opening the drawer above it. Everything else is in great condition, but for this price I expect it to be in perfect condition and it was not.</li>
    <li> A lot of acrylic makeup organizers are incredibly expensive. I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it still looks amazing, organizes all my cosmetics perfectly, and looks gorgeous while doing it.</li>
    <li> This is even better looking than the picture shows!  All the drawers slide easily.  It has a good, heavy weight to it.  The only thing I was disappointed with were the dividers.  They weren&#x27;t beautiful and clear like the rest of the case.  They are all scratched up and cloudy, so I am not using them.</li>
    <li> This is nice, but not practical.  The drawers will fly out if you aren&#x27;t careful!  Not worth the money, good try though.</li>
    <li> Am so in love, it&#x27;s perfect!! So happy I purchased it, can&#x27;t beat the price xoxo Araceli</li>
    <li> Great construction, doors slide smoothly in and out, fit all my makeup inside, finally organized! And all my perfume and skin creme bottles on top. Love this!</li>
    <li> Let it be known that I am *not* a makeup junkie, nor am I a particularly girl-ie girl.&lt;br /&gt;This organizer is fantastic!  I bought the one with the crystal knobs and it looks beautiful on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I have fits nicely in this organizer.  I was very skeptical about spending so much $$$, but considering I see the thing in my bathroom every day, and my poor fiance has to deal with my mess, it was well worth the cost.  This thing is going to last me the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that the top lit flips all the way back to lay almost flush with the back of the case, so I have it pushed all the way against my mirror.  The drawers slide very easily.  The acrylic is thick and strong and clear, no yellowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller got it shipped in great protective packaging and it was at my door quicker than I expected.</li>
    <li> Purchased this makeup organizer as a gift for my daughter-law. I could not have made a better choice. She loves it very much and her friends have been asking her where did she get it from. This organizer proves to be what I though is was when I purchased it. I would recommend this item to friends.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, however the separators that can be placed in the drawers do not stay and move around.</li>
    <li> Yes it met my expectations and more. Would definitely recommend to others. Very spacious and the right size for my bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> I Recently received my beauty cube &amp; I&#x27;m very satisfied!!! The packaging was perfect &amp; came in great condition! It&#x27;s a perfect size &amp; has lots of space. Highly recommend this acrylic beauty cube!!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful organizer. You will love it and wonder how you ever got along without it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller is absoutlely wonderful to work with. All I can say is buy it and you will be happy&lt;br /&gt;With this cube.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what i was hoping for. Plenty of room for all m makeup. Nice and clear and i love the handles. Easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who comes into my bathroom comments on it.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Loved it, but it&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> it looks better in person</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. When the first one shipped there was a large crack, I called and it was replaced with no fuss! It&#x27;s nice and heavy so when I pull out a drawer it doesn&#x27;t tip over. Nice large size and the crystal knobs pick up the light in the afternoon sun and fill my bathroom with rainbows, so pretty!</li>
    <li> I love my Cosmetic Organizer! Its worth it ladies, especially if you have lots of makeup. I threw away so many old dusty make up bags that I&#x27;ve had for years and years, yuck. Upgrade with this organizer, I have to add.. its very Fancy ;) Thank you PRIMO for having this beauty cube at a reasonable price and making my transaction a happy one!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!! My makeup has always been so unorganized on my counter.  I use to just throw everything together in a big makeup bag or leave it laying around on the counter top. The Beauty Cube fits perfectly on my counter and looks absolutely gorgeous.  You can tell it is made out of very strong and durable material.  It is very sturdy and heavy.  I would consider my makeup collection quite a bit larger than the average girls, and I am able to fit all my makeup in it.  The flip top section is such a good idea.  I keep the lid open and place some of my most reached for products in it so I can easily access them.  The Cube measures exactly as they describe it, and in my opinion it looks even better in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very fast. It was delivered to me 3 days after I had placed my order. I have purchased many products online and this is exceptional service. I will be recommending this to all my beauty loving friends.</li>
    <li> Great organizer!!!  i dont know how i lived without it all those years! now all my makeup in perfect order!</li>
    <li> The makeup organizer is exactly what I needed. The drawers fit all of my makeup and slide in and out smoothly. It also looks great on my vanity. I&#x27;m very happy with this organizer.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I have been searching for. It looks stunning and is very practical. The crystal knobs are beautiful and are screwed in place.  Anyone who has seen mine has commented on it and asked where I got it.  The packaging of the product was superb. Plastic sheeting surrounded the acrylic to ensure no scratching, it was then wrapped in bubble wrap and surrounded by styrofoam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a clear acrylic makeup organizer. It is the perfect size and is very well made. My expectations were far exceeded!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in stores to be able to compare it to other things on the market. What I can say is that It&#x27;s heavy duty and crystal clear, which it should be for the price of course... The knobs are beautiful, but sadly I just opened the item today and one of them came off. It&#x27;s totally stripped so it will have to be superglued which is a real bummer for obvious reasons. Nevertheless it fits perfectly on my vanity, It was packaged well for shipping and it is the perfect size for my collection. The drawers are nice and deep and you can pull them out far and leave them open without the drawer falling out or the entire thing dipping forward. The bottom drawer fit my foundation without any problem and I love that the top opens- I&#x27;m using it for moisturizer, primers and the like. I seriously believe the organization will shave time off of getting ready compared to the old makeup bag with more little bags inside of it. Even though I&#x27;m totally annoyed that a knob is busted I give it a 4 out of 5 as far as meeting my needs and expectations. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have forever and worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with it. I have very little drawer space in my bathroom, so this was a great solution. It has a lot of space and appears to be well made. The drawers slide nicely. The crystal knobs are a nice touch, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the dividers that it came with don&#x27;t fit. They are too long. It&#x27;s not really an issue for me, because I don&#x27;t really need them, but if you do, I would beware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got it and would still purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect storage box and this was it . I got the one with the crystal knobs . It is sooooo well made . Its so elegant and just plain beautiful . It comes with dividers , so it&#x27;s easy to organize . I have a small collection of makeup so this was perfect for me . I would say it can hold a lot in it . I have much space to go :) . Extremely satisfied with it :)</li>
    <li> I love this!! Fits all my makeup perfectly and it&#x27;s pretty! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it came with the dividers but they don&#x27;t fit. Or I just have no clue how to put them in.</li>
    <li> i have been searching for a good makeup organizer for a long time, and i want something similar as what i saw on keep up with the kardashians!! This organizer is shipped from canada, beautiful made, really quality , brand new. The crystal knob is so sparkle and pretty!!! I clean all my makeup stuff today, now my vanity is beautiful and clean!! I strongly suggest if u r looking for a makeup organizer, this is your best choice with a good price!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my very particular daughter-  she loves it and it holds more than she needed. She likes being able to see exactly what she is looking for in each drawer</li>
    <li> Like most women, I have a lot of makeup- eye shadows, lipstick, foundation, powders, creams, sprays, etc, etc. This makes it so easy to organize your makeup by sections. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> bought one for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item!!!!</li>
    <li> After a lot of searching for a way to store my makeup, I came across this little beauty.  Everything about it fit my needs perfectly, plenty of vertical storage with a small footprint, attractive design and from what I could tell by the photos, durability.  It finally arrived ( I only say &amp;#34;finally&amp;#34; because I was so anxious for it to get here, like a kid at Christmas ) last evening, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Not only is it beautiful, but so well made.  The drawers slide easily and smoothly, every corner and seem fit together perfectly.  It has clear rubber pads on the bottom at the corners to keep it from sliding, and has a nice weight to it, nothing flimsy about this beauty cube.  There are an assortment of dividers included, which you can use or not.  While I&#x27;m using mine for makeup storage, it would also be perfect for storing jewelry.  It&#x27;s just a beautiful way to store and display whatever you want it for.  I&#x27;m definitely glad I purchased this cube, and will definitely recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, worth the money !</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical that this organizer would be worth the money and store a lot of makeup my client collected.  However, the acrylic was sturdy, the crystal knobs a bonus, and the organizer deceiving with the amount that it can hold.  Great solution for accessing makeup.  The drawers are a good size with the bottome one being deeper and the inserts help to keep a variety of items in their place.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. It&#x27;s just the perfect size for her</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item! It is not worth the money. I purchased it after researching other brands and found this companies prices more reasonable.  I bought the 5 drawer with lid on top.  Who ever measured this while make it was off! The doors only close after spending about 10 min trying to shut it in addition to getting stuck and not opening or closing at all!  This has happened regardless of weight of the items in the drawers or the amount of items I have put in it.  For instance one drawer I have used for eye shadows only and in another drawer I placed nail polish in which is a bit heavier than the eye shadow drawer, but both drawers give me problems closing and opening them! If you place yourself at eye level of the drawers you&#x27;ll notice that they do not stay on the rails they were designed to glide on while opening and closing them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have had the item for less than a week and it already has two cracks in two different places which looks awful.  The cracks are not on the outside or the inside of the acrylic, but rather in the middle so there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.  I have been very gentle with these drawers and if they&#x27;ve already cracked in a matter of a week, I cant imagine what its going to look like in 6 months or a year. I wish I had bitten the bullet and spent more getting a better quality item, than getting something that is not well made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if you still intend on  buying this product be sure and measure all your items that you intend to put in it.  Have a plan of what you would like to place in each drawer.  I stress this because there are certain items that do not fit in here that are common items you would plan to store in an product such as this.  For instance nail polish (most brand including OPI) do not fit in the drawers.  I do not hold the company at fault for this however I did research other brands that have more space in height for the items you would store  in each drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return the product asap but coincidently the policy states no refunds...</li>
    <li> Wish I had one of these years ago. Looks clean, easy to get makeup, drawers are smooth. Can&#x27;t ask for more. Best ever!</li>
    <li> Just received this beauty today and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! First off it came way earlier than expected which I was VERY happy about.  The quality is very nice and the crystal knobs defiantly add the elegant touch.  the drawers are deep enough and the perfect size to fit all of stuff.  I also like how the bottom drawer is a little bit bigger so I can fit my makeup palates in there which fit perfectly.  Overall I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The dividers don&#x27;t fit too securely. They wobble no matter how you try to place them. Other than that. It&#x27;s nice size &amp; pretty knobs</li>
    <li> My item came sooner than expected and free of any defects (*that I know of): no cracks or scratches; drawers slide easily; crystal knobs work fine.  Doesn&#x27;t take up too much space, it fits ALL my makeup, and looks really pretty.  The organizer came with dividers that I chose not to use--that&#x27;s why I cannot say for certain if it&#x27;s truly defect free.  But all things considered I&#x27;m sure it is!  Having moved around a lot, I was frustrated having to adapt/modify/change my makeup storage according to the bathroom I was in.  I&#x27;m so happy to finally have something that I can fit everything in, and looks like a permanent organizer that is beautiful to display. I love it!</li>
