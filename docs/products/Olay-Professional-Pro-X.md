<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved regenersit. I love this kit because it had all the products in it that I was running low on.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially the moisturizer. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The starter pack was great!  It came quickly and as advertised</li>
    <li> Am using this product now and so far so good.  I love the cleanser and the way I feel when I wash my face.  Will probably order my Olay products in the future.</li>
    <li> After a couple of years reviewing items I selected exclusively for myself (decidedly \\&quot;male\\&quot; items), I finally surprised my wife with something she could use - the Olay skincare Trio available through the Amazon Vine Program.  This was quite a humorous gesture, since I&#x27;ve long regailed her (she is a very tolerant person) with tales of how archeologists had uncovered jars of glycerine in the ruins of Pompeii.  In other words, women have been trying for millenia, very literally, to delay the onset of aging appearance in their skin (particularly in the face).  Olay rhymes with Pompeii, delay, and no way.  Glycerine (a moisturizer?) is still available, 2,000 years later, in every corner drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my wife has been an Olay user for several years.  Not long after P&amp;G purchased the brand and improved distribution, she began to use the products.  We are both in our early 50s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did she discover anything new?  The &#x27;cleanse, moisturize, and treat&#x27; sequence/combination seemed to make sense to her.  She has no idea what an \\&quot;amino peptide B3+\\&quot; is, and she allows for the possibility that its just more marketing BS from the beauty care industry.  But she wants very much to believe that it will actually help her face look, feel, and age better.  The feel better part seems to impress immediately out of the box.  She says all the products go on smoothly and cleanly.  To her, it feels silky and smooth, not greasy or cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though she is a long time olay user, she had not previously seen the push top dispenser on the \\&quot;deep hydration regenerating cream,\\&quot; which she liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make a difference long term?  Does she look younger than she would otherwise?  She believes a daily program with olay products (particularly when she goes to bed, and again, to a lesser extent, when she prepares for her day in the morning) will pay off by making her look younger.  And it has a big impact on her confidence.  She feels comfortable using a brand that she associates with quality.  Its expensive but not out of range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last Sunday morning over crumpets and tea, before she put her makeup on for the day, I told her she was looking particularly nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it the \\&quot;Trio?\\&quot;  My failing eyesight?  My affection for the mother of my children?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She isn&#x27;t taking any chances.expensive but not out of range.    So last Sunday morning over crumpets and tea, before she put her makeup on for the day, I told her she was looking particularly nice.      Was it the \\&quot;Trio?\\&quot;  My failing eyesight?  My affection for the mother of my children?      She isn&#x27;t taking any chances.</li>
    <li> After only two weeks, my face is softer, clearer, and the circles under my eyes are lighter. Good stuff, even for men!</li>
    <li> I am a 46 year old woman who was looking for an easy skin routine.  My eyes are starting to get some wrinkles and my neck as well. The trio pack is very simple and I have been using it for about 4 weeks. I have noticed my face looks more refreshed and most definitely more moisturized. I will buy this product again whenI run out. also I would like to mention each bottle allows you to dispense only what you need, so you don,t waste any.</li>
    <li> Tried other products for months with no result.  My face was dry and red.  Tried this product and saw a difference in less than 2 days, yes days.  After 6 days my face is back to normal.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars...</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 weeks now and have seen an improvement with my dry peely skin. Makes my skin super soft and have had no break outs with using it. It even feels good on your skin,feels very light. I have sensitive skin, and very dry skin. I am very glad that I tried it. Will keep on using. I have never used anything on my skin before, as I broke out with everything I used. That includes make-up. Am between 45-55 yrs. old. Have found the skin care with Olay. Now I am hunting for a foundation that I can use. One happy customer.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday.  I like the way they make my face feel and look, clean and moisturized. The eyelid creme feels good but I haven&#x27;t really noticed much improvement.</li>
    <li> i am very minimalist when it comes to my skin care regimen, and have preferred pure natural products like creams made from a blend of emu oil, shea butter, coco butter, almond oils etc... i was willing to give this product a try. guess vanity got the best of me and i wanted to see if i could do something about my crows feet.... unfortunately this product is full of weird chemicals that i cannot pronounce. the cleanser feels nice, as does the moisturizer, but it really stings and makes my eyes water if i get too close to them. i am afraid of even trying the eye serum around my eyes because of the stinging. i should have known better.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very helpful for my dry skin. I use it daily and it has improved my skin texture greatly. Good product.[[ASIN:B002UUT3YM Olay Regenerist Skin Care Starter Trio Pack, 1 Kit]]</li>
    <li> Honestly not as good as the regimem that I use. Less expensive but definately not as good. I was curious and am glad that I tried it.</li>
    <li> Ideal for adults wanting to improve the look and feel of their skin, Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Skin Care Kit is the real deal. It advertises results after three weeks or so, but I saw a difference in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried a half-dozen or so of these skin care kits, I was skeptical that Olay had anything different. For one thing, the larger tube had much more of an exfoliant than I was used to, but it felt exhilarating. The creams in the smaller containers felt good when I applied them, leaving my face moist and supple, especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real difference became apparent in the morning after I slept with the product applied. I could actually tell a difference: My skin looked more glowing and younger. Especially after a week, this Olay skin care kit made a believer of me!</li>
    <li> I was really interested in trying this Olay Regenerist set for the Eye Lifting Serum. My eyes aren&#x27;t baggy and saggy, but to be honest, like everything else with age, they&#x27;ve seen better days.    So after using all three products for a month - with particular attention on the Serum - yes, my eye area is definitely lighter, tighter, and brighter. I look wide awake (probably more so than I feel sometimes!), and it&#x27;s noticeable.     A noticeable improvement in 30 days from an over-the-counter product is just amazing...!    An Olay cleanser and deep hydration cream are also included with the kit. The cleanser is merely okay, but the cream, like all Olay products, does an excellent job of moisturizing and not feeling greasy. Wonderful accompaniment to the Eye Lifting Serum, which, really, you should try if the \\&quot;sags\\&quot; of aging are starting to bother you.     Regenerist is just an excellent OTC product line!</li>
    <li> Well, I can say I am looking \\&quot;younger\\&quot;...if you count the return of teenage \\&quot;zit angst\\&quot; to my life!  The feel and scent is fine...but I have had a few \\&quot;zits\\&quot; on my nose and elsewhere on the face for the first time in a decade... since using this kit. Will use up the scrub...but the other creams will be used on the feet, hands and elbows. Perhaps they can work on the \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot; properties of these creams. Back to simple vitamin A and C creams for me. Peace to you and yours.</li>
    <li> The Eye Lifting Serum feels good -- as promised, velvety smooth -- and it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I don&#x27;t see any change, but I  have reached the wonderful stage in life in which I no longer see my fine wrinkles. Maturity has its compensations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Hydration Rgenerating Cream is supposed to improve my skin&#x27;s texture. I will love that. Actually people tell me the skin on my face looks pretty good for someone my age. Maybe it will help my fine lines, but how will I know? If it breaks my face out in zits, I&#x27;ll put it on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Regenerating Cleanser has an exfoliating process not as harsh as some I&#x27;ve tried. I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust Olay products, and I hope these will help me look younger, smoother, and lovelier. It would be difficult for me to recommend them to you though. You may not be able to tolerate the amount of hydraton provided. Tell me your age so we can discuss this situation further.</li>
    <li> My wife tried the kit and found the following:  The cleanser is very nice and refreshing without being rough on your skin.  The moisturizer smells good and is easily absorbed by the skin.  The eye cream I find impossible to judge - while it smells nice I am not sure of the effectiveness.  All together a nice kit.</li>
    <li> I have slightly oily skin. So, I am always curious as to how a face care kit will work for me.  Some leave my face too oily.  But, I thought the Olay Regenerist Skin Care Kit had just the right balance of cleaning my face without stripping it.  I can&#x27;t say that it worked miracles for me and made me look younger.  But, you could certainly pay a lot more for products that don&#x27;t work as well.  The products feel good on my face.  The packaging is practical and convenient.</li>
    <li> The Olay Regenerist kit is a great starter kit.  I have reviewed the individual products in the kit below.  I am giving this product 4 stars because it seems though the eye serum ran out long before the the cleanser and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye lifting serum ran out very quickly so I was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t have all three to use together.  However, I can definitely SEE the difference around my eyes.  The skin looks so much smoother and younger than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the exfoliation properties in the daily cleanser because most exfoliaters are too drying, but this cleanser I can use each day without my skin getting overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My absolute favorite product is the moisturizer!  It feels very heavy but goes on extremely light and does not leave a greasy or oily feeling.  It absorbs quickly and provides long lasting moisture even under make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken 45 days to write this review, simply because i don&#x27;t believe you can form an opinion about skincare products quickly. The kit works exactly as advertised -but only on some skin types. My wife used it with perfect results, better than many $100 kits, but on my (male) skin, it made me greasy and break out. Bottom line - you really need to try it out as instructed, give it time, and decide whether the results are worth it.     If your skin responds well, you have yourself one hell of a bargain in skincare. If it doesn&#x27;t, move on and find something else.</li>
    <li> My aging skin was not responding well to any of the anti-aging products I tried until this one.  My skin is back to having that dewy tone and my wrinkles are starting to fade.  I highly recommend using this product.  I love it in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s microdermabrasion kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m spoiled when it comes to mens face care products... I enjoy brands like Kiehls, and Truefitt and Hill, and even Fresh. But most of these Olay products compared favorably considering the amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is above average. Gentle, but effective. Leaves your skin feeling clean but not overly dried out like some of the scrubs and more abrasive cleaners out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer too works well considering how much you get for 1/3 of the price of this package. I found it to be simultaneously a little too thin and greasy for my tastes, but it seemed to work and absorb well so I guess Olay really does know what they&#x27;re doing. By the end of a dry LA day it seemed to have lost some of the moisturizing that Kiehls manages to keep. Definitely worked better at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream was really the disappointment for me. I often pull long days and even longer nights. This eye serum did nothing noticeable for the circles of puffiness for the 15 or so days I tried it (there was quite a bit left in there, but I have no idea how you&#x27;re supposed to get it out, it didn&#x27;t pump.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this product rates 3.5 stars for me, and if the eye cream works for you, considering its price, its easily 5 out of 5. Even 6 out of 5, considering how much most eye creams alone cost.</li>
    <li> The daily regenerating cleanser contains vitamins B5, C, and E. It has a slightly gritty feel, like a mild exfoliant. It did not feel as harsh on my face as some of the natural products I&#x27;ve bought. Frankly, if it weren&#x27;t for the fragrance I would still be using it. I think this cleanser is nice for what it does, but it has one of those powdery scents that clings to everything and never fades. If Olay made a fragrance-free version, I would repurchase this product. Disclaimer: I do buy fragrance-free detergents and other products, so I am more sensitive to smells than some people. You may like the perfume this has, but be aware that it does linger on the skin even after the cleanser is washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep hydration regenerating cream smells much stronger than the cleaner. This also contains vitamins B5, C, and E. It has a light, slippery feel out of the container, which is somewhat like a small deodorant container. There is a small hole on the top, so you won&#x27;t get a lot of the cream out at once. I don&#x27;t think you need more than a few drops on your finger to spread on your face, so this keeps the cream from being wasted. Not a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye lifting serum has the same fragrance. I tried it on my eyes and had to wash it off within 10 minutes. The smell is strong, and it lingers. The eye serum has vitamins B3 and B5. My eyelids did look a little brighter, but that is because the serum contains mica and titanium dioxide. These ingredients are used in eye shadows. Mica is a reflective natural mineral and titanium dioxide is used in everything from paint to cosmetics as a white pigment. So -- yes -- your eyes will look brighter. I wouldn&#x27;t mind this so much, but you&#x27;re supposed to put the serum on and let it absorb into your skin. It says nothing about washing it off later. I don&#x27;t want layers of pigments and minerals stuck to my skin; it seems counterproductive and would clog my pores. Besides, I expect serum to mean that this somehow works at a cellular level and not as a cosmetic cover-up. Also, if you are concerned, the serum is made in China. I&#x27;m not sure that bothers me, and Olay does indicate that on the outer package, so I&#x27;ll give them credit for full disclosure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only two stars? Well, I found the eye serum to be somewhat misleading. It isn&#x27;t a nutrient as much as it is just a cover-up. I felt a little bit tricked by that, which made me wonder about the other two products. Second, the fragrance was so strong it was unpleasant. I was initially hesitant about using these products because heavily scented products can give me a headache. Unfortunately, they did just that. If you have sensitive skin or do not like perfumed lotions and skin care products, be forewarned that the Olay does have a rather strong perfume smell that does not quickly dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging was very difficult to open and needed the use of scissors. The three products are shrink-wrapped to a cardboard insert. The plastic is tough and hard to cut. I think the items could have been packaged in a smaller box.and not as a cosmetic cover-up.

    <li> sample pack I have tried for first time, each product is for helping dry skin in different areas, would definitely order again, came in nice gift box</li>
    <li> was sceptical but have seen results. minor but noticable. Have addded this to my subriscriptions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite cheap and good quality. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> The product was fine even though the box was pretty damaged.  In all I can&#x27;t complain because the product is nice and the price was good.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this product. It&#x27;s not bad but I can&#x27;t exactly say I see a major difference.</li>
    <li> Love this cream,  when applied to the face the skin feels like silk, I love it.  I read on line that this rated 4th in the best skin creams...  The other cream advertised on TV  by a famous model rates as number 9 and cost heck a lot more than $29  You will not be sorry to buy this cream.</li>
    <li> The cleanser leaves you feeling fresh (not overscrubbed or dry).  The moisturizer is not greasy and soaks in nicely.  I do not have the string of days necessary to comment on the eye serum&#x27;s effectiveness.  In a nutshell, these products do leave you feeling clean and moisturized.  I don&#x27;t have another \\&quot;Regeneration\\&quot; type product to compare this to, but it seems to deliver on its intended goal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trio pack everyday for a month now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference around my eyes.  I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7-Ounces]] and [[ASIN:B0007W1R58 Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, 1.7-Ounce Jar]] which I absolutely love, but I took a hiatus from these products so I could try out this skin care starter pack.  This trio pack was just ok.    The facial cleanser contains microbeads, so it is grainy, but I generally like that.  Do not expect this to turn into a sudsy lather.  All you will see/feel are the microbeads which are there to cleanse/smooth your face.  The face lotion was surprisingly light.  It has a scent that didn&#x27;t appeal to me, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now.  The face lotion is light enough to be used under makeup, and I&#x27;ve tried this out a few times without noticing any \\&quot;grease factor\\&quot; during the day.  I have an oily T zone.  The eye serum doesn&#x27;t seem to be making any difference.  Maybe it needs more than a month to kick in, but I&#x27;ll update this review *if* there is a noticeable change.  Once I finish up this trio pack, I&#x27;m probably going to switch back to my Olay night cream which instantly gives me noticeably softer skin - several coworkers even complimented me after I had been using the night cream for a few days!</li>
    <li> My wife agreed to try this product to assist me with this review.  After using it for several weeks, she has noticed a definite softening of the skin.  Furthermore, we&#x27;ve both recognized a noticeable reduction of the \\&quot;crow&#x27;s feet\\&quot; around her eyes.    My wife found that the cleanser compared favorably to other \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; products that she has used and that the moisturizer did soften her skin.  She was most impressed with the eye-lifter.    Is this product \\&quot;better\\&quot; than comparable products manufactured by other brands?  My wife was not willing to say so.  But did it fulfill the claim of the manufacturer?  Yes, at least in our experience, it did.  My wife would certainly be willing to use this product again.    Four stars.</li>
    <li> Though I am only 26 and not struggling with wrinkles yet, I DO have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m happy to say that this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I replaced half of my daily regime (the Daniel Kern Regime at [...]) with these products. Despite not needing for wrinkles yet, I am tempted to buy it just to use, because I really like it. Especially the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face wash/scrub: I use this in the shower in the morning. The scrubby bits are very small, so it&#x27;s not at all harsh but will still exfoliate some. It&#x27;s moisturizing, leaves you feeling clean, and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: I use this at night. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being heavy. It soaks in nicely and leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I really like this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Cream: I use this at night as well. Feels nice and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the whole trio!</li>
    <li> I love this product.I have been using this product for over 5 years.  I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s the only skin care product that I can use and the price is reasonable for a high quality product.</li>
    <li> Great products and feel great on your skin. 30 to 40% improvement in the first week of using this kit. Am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;kit\\&quot; comes with three components:    Daily Regenerating Cleanser -- This is an exfoliating cleanser.   Usually I hate exfoliating cleansers, as the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; feels like I am washing with sandpaper.  But this one is quite mild.   It does feel gritty, but its not uncomfortable at all -- perhaps the grit is rounder, or somehow easier on the skin?   My face felt cleaner and fresher after using this cleanser for a couple of weeks.   This item: 4 stars    Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream -- I LOVE this moisturizer!   I am a long time fan of the plain old Olay Complete lotion, but this is even better.   It is very very light and absorbs quickly into the skin, and moisturizes well.   It is not oily at all -- it almost has a smooth powdery feel once absored .   You can apply make-up over it immediately.   I wish this product would incorporate a light sunscreen, too, but even without it is definately my favorite moisturizer.   This item: 5 stars    Eye Lifting Serum -- Perhaps I&#x27;m not clear on what this is supposed to do.  But I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything.   I tried using it on just one eye for a week to see if there was a visible difference.  Nope, both eyes looked the same to me.   It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes,  so I&#x27;ll give it a couple of stars for that.  This item: 2 stars    Overall:  This kit is worth it, if just for the Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream.   When my current supply runs out, I hope to purchase just that product separately.    This kit: 4 stars</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with this product.  It performed as stated and I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy too, and after using this product over the course of a month, co-workers have taken notice to the fact that I do not have dark circles under my eyes anymore. My boss thought I wasn&#x27;t getting enough work or was slacking off. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not often you hear about a guy being commented on about looks like that, but it was a pleasant surprise and I am much happier now that my under eyes do not look so horrible. If it is any testament to the product, I plan on purchasing it again and using it every day. I am a full time employee, a full time youth minister, a full time dad, and a full time MA student, so sleep is fairly low on the priority list and this stuff is a godsend.</li>
    <li> I gave these creams to a lady in my life as a present and she really loved the cleanser.  I can&#x27;t say much for efficacy on the anti-aging as her face still looks the same two months later. (If she ever reads this review- it&#x27;s because her skin was flawless to begin with!)  As a mid-range moisturizer and cleanser, I&#x27;d recommend it.  But don&#x27;t expect miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product, seller, and transaction. Very pleased thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and people keep telling me I am looking younger.  It is the first skin care system I have stayed with and is within my price range with high quality.</li>
    <li> I have neglected my skin for years and was looking for a collection for maturing skin. Olay Regenerist has been highly praised. The three products provide a system which is fairly comprehensive and easy to maintain. Having used it for several weeks, I was surprised to be told that my skin looked wonderful by people who were unaware that I was doing anything differently than I had in the past, e.g., nothing.  I am very pleased and intend to extend my collection of Regenerist products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist Daily Serum on my face for years, so it was a no-brainer to try this trio.  I really like the cleanser.  My skin tends to be dry, so I was worried that it might make me feel dry after use, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I just feel clean and smooth.  The eye serum really does seem to help with little lines and I think the bags are less with regular use.  The regenerating cream is a little heavier than the daily serum I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I&#x27;ve stuck with the regenerating serum during the day and the regenerating cream for use at night.  GREAT combo!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for Christmas I have bought in the past - Olay is always a hit in my Family .</li>
    <li> I bought this package on a whim using part of a gift card I received on my birthday, and I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge! I saw a recent picture of myself and was stunned by the number of fine lines I&#x27;ve gained around my eyes. I finally decided it was time to move up from the teenage products I&#x27;ve been using for years and try to be proactive about keeping my skin from aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The starter package comes with three products: an exfoliating cleanser, a moisturizer, and an eye \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; cream. Unfortunately what it doesn&#x27;t come with are instructions (which might seem unnecessary but I&#x27;m used to a VERY basic skin care regimen so some instruction on proper use would have been nice). The exfoliating cleanser is a bit harsh and I hesitate to use it around my eyes but it does leave my skin feeling fresh and clean. The moisturizer is very light and my skin feels soft and not at all oily after. My favorite product, however, is the eye lifting cream. Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination but I really feel like the fine lines around my eyes have diminished after only 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I want to comment on is the scent of the product. I think it is wonderful and my husband actually asked me if I was wearing perfume the first night I climbed into bed after using it. This might work for some but for those who don&#x27;t like scented products or perfumes might thing it&#x27;s too strong. Also, the first week of using this package I broke out quite a bit but I guess my skin has become accustomed to it because I&#x27;m break-out free now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using a more \\&quot;grown-up\\&quot; skin care package and I love that I can actually notice it working. It really doesn&#x27;t take long to use and so I&#x27;ve added it to my subscribe and save list because I definitely plan to keep it up!</li>
    <li> Great Products. I love Oil of Olay and this kit is perfect. The price is also great. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works my face feels soft and smooth after washing,it is a new and wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting up there in age. It was bound to happen, I mean Sarah Michelle Gellar has a baby so I know I&#x27;m getting old. But I have great skin and not a wrinkle *knock on wood* so I didn&#x27;t want to change what I use on my face which is just Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps. The stuff works great without over drying the skin and leaves it SUPPLE! So when I had to use Olay, I wanted to jump out of a window or at least throw myself down on the ground or at the very least give myself a paper cut ... drama queen. I walked away after much use of this stuff, hating it. It dried my skin every morning and night. It was horrific how rough this stuff was to my skin. My biggest gripe was with the Regenerating Cream, just way too thick and left my skin feeling greasy.     I will stick to my old tried and true formula of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, a bit of retinol and baby lotion ... learned a valuable lesson.</li>
    <li> I remember trying Olay Regenerist Day Cream many years ago and mostly what I recall was that it was too thin and watery and felt like it didn&#x27;t really hydrate my skin. This new formula is totally different. The face cream is very thick and leaves skin feeling soft and moist, which becomes important as the skin ages. Not to mention, my skin does look a bit younger and refreshed. I&#x27;m mid-thirties and have a few fine lines that are noticeably less visible since I&#x27;ve been using this product. It&#x27;s certainly not a miracle worker, but as far as skin creams go, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used (and I do not say that lightly.) I&#x27;ve used many alpha-hydroxy creams that did not produce results as good as this Regenerist Trio pack has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I steer clear of scented formulas, since my skin is so sensitive to perfumes in creams, but thankfully, I have not had any type of breakout from the fragrance in this. It does smell nice and I&#x27;m glad to be able to wear a scented face cream that doesn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is very similar to the face cream; thick and hydrating, leaving my skin feeling moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash has micro beads that act like scrubbers to help slough off the dead skin cells. It does a very good job and I&#x27;ve also been using it on my chest and shoulders to get ready for summer. Also, nice to use BEFORE applying sunless tanner to get an even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and will purchase a new set when I run out.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t really rate at this time...haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  So far I like it and will order again if it works.</li>
    <li> While results take a few weeks to achieve, there defiantly was an improvement overall to skin elasticity and a decrease in noticeable lines. The creamy wash doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all tight and stretched and has little to no &#x27;foaming&#x27; to it. A wonderful kit that has everything you need to get started. Much like [[ASIN:B003YBE2CE Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins Be Weil Collection]].</li>
    <li> TRIED THIS PRODUCT DUE TO A DEMONSTRATION  ON A TV SHOW.  IT IS ALL THEY SAID IT WOULD BE AND MORE.   I HAD SOME SCARS AND IT SOFTEN THEM.  MY SKIN LOOKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Good deal You save about 15$ compared to in the store for the same product.    Also if you buy in this pack you basically get the face wash for free.</li>
    <li> I gave this package to my wife to use while were on a trip.  She uses many OLAY products and is generally quite pleased with them. She used all the products in this package and commented as follows:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It probably doesn&#x27;t do any harm and for a little while after first applying things, I feel (and believe that I look) better and younger. A couple of hours later, I can look in the mirror and see that I was kidding myself, yet again. Youth simply cannot be purchased and had from a bottle. Even from OLAY.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I believe my wife!</li>
    <li> Olay is my Wonderful. I recently bought this kit and I&#x27;ve been using it every day. I activly tan and garden so my face is always dry. This kit helps A Lot as it makes my skin supple and soft. I am not able to tell if it has reduced any wrinkles or fine lines but it hydrates very well and my face looks smoother with it. It lasts until all day under makeup and all night before bed. It really helps with my busy lifestyle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the eyelift cream even though it had some negative reviews. The reviews for the set seemed better and it was a good deal so figured why not do it all together. I have useing all daily (and the eye cream religously twice a day) for almost three weeks. I am just starting to show my age and I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, just a few fine lines. I do however wake with puffy, tierd looking eyes that last most of the day and they make me feel like I look old and wrung out. I have to say I like the whole set so far. The mositurizer is very luxurious but it is a little heavy compaired to what I usually use. I found I don&#x27;t like it under full makeup, which I only do 2 or 3 times a week for work when I have to go in. Most days I do simmple 5 minute makeup and then I use it twice a day. When I did wear it with make up I felt like it made my make up not last. I think it smells great but sent sensitive people may think it&#x27;s too much. The scrub I like as well but I also decided to pass on it on full makeup days in the morning as if I was in a hurry I seemed to leave some scub behind. I think it is a good exfoliater and my skin looks a bit fresher. Now the best part, my sad eyes do seem to respond to the eye lift serum &amp;/or the mositurizer. I didn&#x27;t expect much so I am thrilled to see any change. I took before pics and in a few more weeks if I feel brave I will post the afters. My husband and I see a change. My upper lids have a little more lift and are not as puffy/tierd lookig. It&#x27;s subtle and not a miracle or anything but I have gotten compliments that I look good, or healthy several times this week. I&#x27;ll take it! The only thing is it has helped my right eye a little more than my left and the left needs the help more. This makes me think if it isn&#x27;t totally consistant on two eyes on the same person then it obviously can&#x27;t give everyone the same results. Still I would recommend trying it because it might, it&#x27;s afforadable, and I am happy with it!</li>
    <li> My quest to find the fountain of youth has not stopped.  This Oil of Olay set was nice, but it was not anything special.  My skin did not get worse, but it didn&#x27;t have the vibrant youthful glow that I was hoping for.  I do have fairly sensitive skin, and I found that this product, unlike others, did not cause my skin to have blemishes.  This product was comprable with what I normally use, so was I happy? Yes.  Thrilled? No.</li>
    <li> I like the facial wash with the little scrub beads. I don&#x27;t know if they actually help or not, but they feel good as I&#x27;m washing. I really like the facial cream. It goes on and is absorbed well with no greasy feeling. The scent is only a faint, pleasant smell. I haven&#x27;t noticed any pros with the eye cream even though I still use it, since it has a soft feel.</li>
    <li> Of the three that come in this trio, the eye cream is the best. Olay Regenerist ADVANCED ANTI-AGING cream cleansing is like gently washing your face with a bottle of cheap perfume. Completely disgusting. The other smelly little moisturizer (in a stupdly messy bottle) is pointless, as well. Again, the only one of the trio worth considering is the wonderful eye serum. It&#x27;s label reads &amp;#34;regenerating eye lifting serum&amp;#34;, by the way.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and feels great on my skin.  Love the fragrance as well.  Easy to follow directions that give you step by step use.</li>
    <li> This starter kit has all the products that I need.  I have been very please with them and will continue to purchase this kit..</li>
    <li> The facial scrub is not as effective as Philosophy&#x27;s Purity therefore I would not purchase this again.Otherwise the creams are fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only about two weeks.  I see no improvement yet, but it&#x27;s early.  I&#x27;ll revisit this review in a month.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love Olay stuff.</li>
    <li> This did not seem to smooth or moisturize my skin at all.  Waste of money!  Going with natural products after this.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. The wash and eye cream lasts longer than the moisturizer. It was comparable to most stores. It is no miracle product though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Olay junkie. I&#x27;ve only ever had great experiences with their products.</li>
    <li> Over all a good value, I only wish they had another option to have the night cream included in a Value pack!&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this does NOT provide ANY sunscreen, which I understand many people are sensitive to. So I guess that&#x27;s why they omitted it. Most people have their favorite brand anyways. You need to use it for a good month to begin to appreciate it&#x27;s effectiveness. It is lightly scented which I personally find pleasant, but in the case that you don&#x27;t, it does not linger long.&lt;br /&gt;Now here is the breakdown per bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream - 1.7 OZ Lovely moisturizer that you can actually apply to your entire face, eyelids included! It has Amino-Peptide +B3 complex, that are purported to renew your skin&#x27;s outer layer.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great alone or as a primer to your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;  How much difference you will see in actual noticeable improvement depends on your age, the condition of your skin &amp; what your past daily regimen has been! IF you are just starting to take notice that you need to do something, you might see a more dramatic difference sooner. IF you have been using retin A, copper peptide products, getting peels done at intervals this may not be as effective for you to notece much improvement as you&#x27;ve already been aggresively seeking to correct damaged/aged  skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Cleanser - 5OZ: Nice size bottle. Don&#x27;t expect this cleanser to lather up like soap.  It is excellent for older (I&#x27;m 52), drier skin types (like me) it does wonderful job of GENTLY cleaning without stripping your face of all natural oils &amp; making it feel dry &amp; tight.  The derma-beads  were more stimulating than \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; this will NOT leave your face pink &amp; tingly like most exfoliating scrubs. I would say it&#x27;s gentleness makes it perfect foe DAILY use, accomplishing the same exfoliation in a more gradual way. As I have older dry skin, it is WONDERFUL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum - .5OZ feels nice, tends to plump area around the eyes so that fine lines are not so noticeable. Be sure to give yourself 10 minutes or so for it to absorb before applying eye make up.area around the eyes so that fine lines are not so noticeable. Be sure to give yourself 10 minutes or so for it to absorb before applying eye make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged man who long ago worked as a region sales manager for one of the world&#x27;s largest and most prestigious personal products companies, an Olay competitor.  I mention that fact because my work experience undoubtedly influences how I use and evaluate skin care products ... and because I feel it important to fully disclose any possible bias (either positive or negative) when reviewing any type of product or service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that caveat, I am pleased to be able to recommend the Olay Regenerist Skin Care Trio.  I&#x27;ve used the regimen faithfully over the past 60 days, and am very happy with the results.  Although I don&#x27;t look any \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, my skin feels healthier, and I&#x27;ve received a couple of sincere compliments about how nice my complexion looks.  I have combination skin, a little oily around my nose and forehead, with some dry areas around my eyes and brow.  The Olay products seemed to balance my skin, and more importantly, they did not clog my pores or irritate my skin.  The Cleanser didn&#x27;t leave any residue and was gentle yet effective.  The Moisturizer was non-greasy, as advertised, and absorbed invisibly.  And the Eye Lifting Serum didn&#x27;t creep across my skin into my eyes which is a real problem with some products (the eye is the most active area of the face, which is why substances in that area often move around and eventually move across your rims, causing stinging and burning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, especially from my male point of view, is that after treating my face with the Olay trio, it always looks fresh and natural ... not as if I&#x27;ve been using a cosmetic on it.  I really like these products.  Use them not because you think they&#x27;ll make you look \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, but because you want to feel and look your best, whatever your age.</li>
    <li> I think this product worked somewhat to minimize the wrinkling around my eyes; however don&#x27;t expect miracles or plastic surgery-like results. I did not take before and after photos, but to me my eyes look less old and tired while using this product. I really like anything made by Olay as their products are gentle to the skin. Whether it made a big difference or not, I still felt perkier and that&#x27;s all that matters. I would use again.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products. This item is a great starter set. Works as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent. Not to strong. Would definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> I started breaking out from using this product. I have discontinued use. My skin is very sensitive. I usually use Cerave lotion on my face because I have such sensitive skin and it helps with dryness without clogging my pores. Cerave does a better job at moisturizing than this product. The olay is thicker feeling, but it still leaves skin a little dry feeling. I was hoping to start adding anti-aging products into my routine, but I guess I will keep searching for a product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oil of Olay for many years. I am 36 but others think Im in my 20&#x27;s bc my skin is so clear, hydrated and moisturized. I &amp;#34;cheated&amp;#34; on Olay and tried Mary Kay Timewise line for there Anti-Aging products, only bc my coworker sells it and her skin is beautiful. I used it for about 2 months and didnt see any difference at all. There were alot of steps to follow with little to none results. So I switched back to Olay and the very first application I could feel the difference on my skin! I will NEVER switch again!! I also tried the BeautyFusion line Kim Kardashian sponsers and its pure crap!!! Stick to something that works and stay with it. Oil of Olay has my skin and WEN has my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist for a few years now &amp; it does do what it says...I do notice a difference in my skin using Regenerist products!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from amazon for $29.00, mainly to use a gift certificate.  The added bonus was that I could apply it towards a $15 dollar rebate.  The product works well but I really didn&#x27;t notice much until week 5.  The cleanser does have beta hydroxy acids with peptides and serves as a gentle scrub.  the eye serum is great but I layer it under an eye cream.  The deep hydration cream does not contain a sunscreen but my skin is so dry in the winter I use this as an added layer over my sunscreen.  The hydration cream didn&#x27;t seem to do much at first but I ran out of a night cream and used the hydration cream in place of.  I really like the fact that it isn&#x27;t that heavy greasy feel.  Your skin will feel smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> I really like this kit a lot! The price point is a good value for the amount of product that is included, unlike some of the competitor kits, this one has more than a months worth of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scrub&lt;br /&gt;The beads in the scrub are smooth enough for everyday use. The cream leaves your face feeling hydrated and not stripped. My skin felt and looked fresher after only a few days use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is different, but I got used to it right away, and now I really like the design! The cream is SO silky! It feels amazing on your skin, and leaves your skin with a more matte finish, instead of a dewy look that other moisturizers leave. I really love this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a dot of this around each eye so it lasts a long time. There is a bit of sparkle to it which brightens your eyes. I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in the way my eyes look after using the product, but I do think it is a good moisturizer for the sensitive area around the eyes.</li>
    <li> SO FAR I REALLY CAN ONLY JUDGE THE FACIAL CLEASING CREAM BECAUSE IT GIVES INSTANT RESULT.  BUT USE ONLY AT NIGHT FOR MORNING USE OIL OF OLAY FACIAL CLEANSING SOAP.  WHICH IS NICE AND CREAMIE AND I DON&#x27;T FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT USING THE FACIAL CLEASING BOTH DAY AND NIGHT. CAN&#x27;T JUDGE THE OTHER 2 PRODUCTS ALWAYS GIVE IT A CHANCE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS.  USUALLY ABOUT 6 WEEKS WILL GIVE MY OPINION THEN. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN OIL OF OLAY FAN BUT DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO PAY THEIR PRICE FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT WORK. THEN ALONG CAME AMAZON I LOVE THIS WEBSITE.</li>
    <li> I really see a big difference in my skin since using this line! It&#x27;s smoother and I have no redness</li>
    <li> These are wonderful products.  I especially like&lt;br /&gt;the cleanser.  It makes my skin very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The other products are nice as well.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m an OofO girl from way back, starting with my Mom.  These products are really good.</li>
    <li> The kit arrived in great condition and the price was really reasonable.&lt;br /&gt; I was not pleased with two out of the three products  I felt like the moisturizer wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is actually a scrub and does not work well to remove makeup and other impurities and is too harsh to use&lt;br /&gt;every day.  The eye treatment cream is good, but comes in a small size and doesn&#x27;t last long enough.&lt;br /&gt; On the whole, I feel the products are great products, just not what I actually needed.  It would have been nice to have&lt;br /&gt; a more descriptive explanation of the benefits of each product.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Its great value for money. Makes a great gift. Im not sure how much the products are helping to regarding anti aging but its light enough that I dont feel greasy but still good enough that ive bought it again.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
    <li> The products that come in this starter pack are the same size as the solo versions.  If you like the product, they&#x27;ve been great for me, then you absolutely cannot beat the price of this pack!</li>
    <li> Love it! And so nice to have it delievered to my front door!</li>
    <li> The Olay Regenerist Skin Care Starter Trio Pack, is a nice way to get chance to try all 3 products.  I was happy with all the products, except the eye hydro serum.  For some season, the serum was having difficuly coming out of the pump.  I thought this might just be a faulty bottle, but it also happened on another package I had also purchased. I purchased the other bottle of serum seperately.  I realize this is not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but I will be getting a hold of Olay, as to either get a refund for both products, or some kind of gift coupon, as the product would not come out of the pump on either bottle.  I had to cut the bottle open with a pair of industral sicossors!!!  When I did use the serum, when I was able to get a few drops from the pumps, and the rest when I was able to cut the bottles open, the products did work well.  The other products work well too!  Yet, to be honest, I like Olay ProX Products better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert on cosmetics. But I have noticed a growing number of fine lines and wrinkles on my face in the past few years. I decided to try this product and see if it would do any good, I used all three components as directed and didn&#x27;t skip an application for the duration. The Olay Regenerist Skin Care Starter Trio Pack didn&#x27;t really produce any noticeable difference in the line and wrinkles on my face. I did notice that the skin in this area did feel softer and less dry. Perhaps someone with softer skin to start with might see better results.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I love it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me made my skin more oily and also broke out. I wouldn&#x27;t  recommend it. Save your money</li>
    <li> I love this trio. I was worried about the eye cream, the bottle is so small. You use so little of it, it will last longer than you think. I have been using it for over a month. I have noticed a more even color of my skin. Red blotches are disappearing. Best friend asks what are you using on your skin. I did not want to tell her since she is a Mary Kay Lady. Love the price and love the products.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Starting back using Olay Regenerist should had never stopped using their  products. Love how my face feels smooth and clean,</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE OIL OF OLAY PRODUCTS. THEY ARE EXPENSIVE BUT AMAZON&#x27;S PRICE IS LESS THAN I PAY IN THE STORES. I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT THRU AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my neck area in particular. I have been getting \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; in the T zone though. Overall a great product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Ruined my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist actually told me to purchase this.  i bought two sets; one on line and the other in a store that was closing so it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neither worked at all.  i think i can get equal quality out of any other over the counter by reading the product content.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, at her request, for Christmas. She loves it and was happy withe refill of the products. It&#x27;s a great deal too!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, that tends to be oilier in the summer and this product line is just way too heavy and greasy for me. The moisturizer didn&#x27;t even sink in and just lingered on my face, so I had to wash it off. Maybe it works better for dry skin types.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that annoyed me was the strong perfume scent. Plus it contains parabens (which I knew before, but I still wanted to give it a try.) I Won&#x27;t purchase any Olay products in that line again, but for somebody else it might be different.</li>
    <li> I love all of the items in this package.  The scrub is not too harsh, the moisturizer makes my facial skin very, very soft and the eye serum does what it promises.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this kit for me from a big box store because I had complained about dry skin this winter.  I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and have combo skin. The cleanser left my skin feeling like something waxy was left on my skin even though it was rinsed off thoroughly in the shower.  The moisturizer felt very waxy and  it did not sink into my skin and I noticed no improvement in skin dryness even though I used it twice daily.  The eye serum was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but nothing special.  This product did however cause me to have acne breakouts near my eyes and other areas which I&#x27;ve never had before. This product may work for some but I will not use this product again...I got better results for the dryness and no breakouts by using some Gold Bond lotion I found under my sink. Much cheaper too.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will buy again</li>
    <li> These items are not good for sensitive skin.  I am unable to use them.  The eye cream makes my eyes itch and burn, no matter how far I get it away from my eyes.  The cleanser &amp;#34;takes my hide off&amp;#34;.  I use it occasionally to exfoliate.  Can&#x27;t use daily.  The moisturizer burns and causes my skin to itch.  I am 69 and have sensitive skin.  I really need &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;  items.</li>
    <li> This combination of products has helped me feel better about my aging face. I see fewer wrinkles and the deeper ones look less severe. I love the softer look around my neck and chest. I still look 63yrs but I feel more like putting my bare face out for folks to see. Thanks Olay, for products that work.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this product for a few weeks, but every time I put it on my face I got TONS of zits the next day. I *never* get zits. It must be too heavy for my skin or something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t say whether or not it works, but I can say that if you have clog-prone skin it may cause some pimples.</li>
    <li> I am really loving the Olay regenerist starter kit. I am also using the regenerist serum (in between cleansing and moisturizing). I do not know how this compares to other anti-aging products because this is the first I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s also worth noting that until now I&#x27;ve done very little for my skin care-- cetaphil lotions only and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have problematic skin. I have several expensive prescriptions to treat my atopic skin (eczema) and I have acne scars and frequent breakouts. After my second pregnancy, my atopic skin began to flare up constantly on my face. Especially around my eyes, horrible red, itchy eczema all over. I also started to notice WRINKLES at 29! Not cool. :) Mainly on my forehead and around my eyes, probably from all that dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Regenerist to combat wrinkles, but I was skeptic because I thought my skin would be too sensitive. Amazingly it doesn&#x27;t irritate my atopic skin or my allergies, more amazing it improved my skin. My skin feels smoother and soothed. I&#x27;ve been using about 6 weeks and I can tell a difference in over all skin tone and texture. My pores have not disappeared, but they are minimized, less redness, etc. It has not made me break out at all, in fact, if I get a blemish it comes out and goes away MUCH quicker than they used to. And blemishes are much more rare. The eye cream is amazing- I still have the occasional flare up of eczema from allergies, but for the most part it is GONE. Also, my wrinkles (on eyes and forehead) are fading. Eye circles are gone (although I didn&#x27;t have a major problem with that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still have acne scars that I am hoping will continue to fade. I do feel that the product is \\&quot;sluffing\\&quot; away dead skin, I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s why I am not having as many breakouts and maybe why the eczema is better. Sometimes my skin will feel great and moisturized, but it will look like it&#x27;s almost lightly peeling in areas-- in a good way. Like you are revealing new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a reasonably priced, non-doctors office way to take care of your skin. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it does what it says, and it&#x27;s not too harsh for my sensitive skin. Softer, more even looking skin with minimized wrinkles. And it&#x27;s not so expensive that I can&#x27;t use it all the time. (I&#x27;ve actually found that my sensitive skin does best if I only use the cleanser once a day. The rest I can use 2x a day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I would not purchase this again would be because I want to try the micro-sculpting cream instead of this moisturizer. There are so many options in this regenerist line it can be a little overwhelming. :) But, I may stick with this exact blend of products because it&#x27;s working, and you cannot beat that price for all three. Thanks, Olay and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love oil of Olay...nothing better out there for facial products...you couldn&#x27;t get it at this price anywhere else. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Ive seen a big improvement on my face since I&#x27;ve used this. My pores are smaller and feels so fresh and smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good price but I saw the exact thing at Walmart for the same price around Christmas time. Probably&#x27;ll just buy some at the store next time.</li>
    <li> I got these products in two days.  They were well packaged.  I love this product which leaves my face clean, fresh and no greasy feeling.  I am 64 and am relatively wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> I think it should be cheaper though. I was never one to really take care of my face, but with these products, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;The price is lower compared to walmart.</li>
    <li> This size is perfect for me including the cost compared to the store prices. Most store prices increased by $10</li>
    <li> The eye cream came in a tube (not like the bottle pictured).  The face wash does a good job and the face cream feels velvety.</li>
    <li> This  stuff is Amazing. I&#x27;m looking younger already. 😂 All my friends want it, so does my Mum. Lol 😁, I highly recommend this seller to all, Cheers 🍻 Bex</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good quality. Good bargain. Would recommend and do business with again.</li>
    <li> I love Olay. This pack was all I needed.</li>
    <li> I and 36 and looked about 55 before i started using these products. After 2 months of using i look 21!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously, i like the feeling this gives my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the medium bottle is for daily use, especially if after shaving your face is a little dry. slight sent but it actually smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Big tube is after i get home from work and the smallest is for eyes before bed</li>
    <li> TO EARLY TO TELL BUT IT SEEM TO BE HELPING</li>
    <li> Very good quality and will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> The scrub makes my face break out. The face cream has a really strong smell that gives me a headache.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands instead and it&#x27;s been really nice for that. The eye cream is the best part of this kit. I usually love Olay products, and highly recommend the other Regenerist products, but these are not for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great combination of items, I&#x27;m not too sure about the eye cream yet but the cleanser and the moisturizer are great.  I have only used this twice but I can tell it&#x27;s going to be a keeper.</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin and so far the cheapest set and the most effective that i have found is this. its great!</li>
    <li> I can tell that this product does make a difference! It keeps my skin hydrated and I think it has helped my fine lines... At first I found it a little too heavy and oily, but I am now used to it and I think my skin craves it when I forget to use it. I think for the price this is a great product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s three Olay products here.  Olay makes good stuff.  The wife has to like at least one of them.  She did.  I win.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Mary Kay facial products, but my sister has used Oil of Olay for many years. I live in Colorado, which is very dry. Chapped hands, feet and lips happen frequently. Oil of Olay, Regenerist was up to the task. My skin is softer, less wrinkles and glowing. I used all these products and added the gentle exfoliate, perfect combo!</li>
    <li> The cleanser is working for me to remove makeup and exfoliate enough to keep my skin smooth from red bumps.  but the eye cream and the night cream aren&#x27;t enough to keep my skin moist in Colorado.  I have other products from Paula&#x27;s Choice and Arbonne that I like better.  And cosmeticcop.com says ladies don&#x27;t need a special eye cream.  We just need a moisturizer that works for the face and eyes and both Arbonne and Paula&#x27;s choice have those moisturizers.  I recommend the cleanser but I would choose another face  cream that works on the eyes as well.</li>
    <li> Oh my Oil of Olay package was wonderful. I haven&#x27;t used these products before but am trying them now. The moisturizer Is fantastic. Thanks for this threesome and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of these kinds of products and I can&#x27;t say I found any \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; properties in this one.  The moisturizer is nice but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be rushing back to the store for more.</li>
    <li> It was great to find all the articles in one package</li>
    <li> Saw visible difference in just under a week. Great for travel. Does not leak. Women who would love to age gracefully should use this product regularly.</li>
    <li> This was a great way to get the group of products that I would otherwise have purchased it in one of the local stores.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, highly recommend.  My face feels wonderful, noticed difference in a couple days</li>
    <li> This product had many great reviews....but for me it made my skin burn seems to be a little harsh but the eye cream I enjoy and the face wash smells so good.</li>
    <li> My skin is delicate and I can see a difference towards looking good again!  I would reccomend this product to anyone looking for a real &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great price good stuff. I thought i&#x27;d try it and I&#x27;ll buy it here again. I look 10 years younger.</li>
</ol>
