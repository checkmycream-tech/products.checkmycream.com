      <li>This one is great for doing it&#x27;s job and was easy to install.</li>
      <li>The handy wall mount keeps it close at hand</li>
      <li>It is so nice to have them up and out of the way</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the ANDIS 1200 Wat dryer.  </li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to store it and dig through a cabinet every time we need to use it.</li>
      <li>This 1200 watt hair dryer is perfect for anyone with short to medium length hair.</li>
      <li>The dryer is held in place at the top by a lever, which you release to remove the dryer from the wall unit (and which also turns the dryer on), and by a plastic \\&quot;lip\\&quot; at the bottom of the wall unit that the handle fits into.  </li>
      <li>We like being able to hang the dryer up and save on counter space in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>Size is perfect, not big and bulky on the wall.  </li>
      <li>so guests have easy access.  </li>
      <li>We have this installed last month and it&#x27;s working beautifully.</li>
      <li>It was a 1600 turbo with a night light.</li>
      <li>so it is adequate for his needs.</li>
      <li>Great little dryer.</li>
      <li>But other than that, it is a good product.</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>I have always had a larger more efficient hair dryer from Andis for years.</li>
      <li>I bought this same unit many, many years ago and it finally bit the dust.  </li>
      <li>They get WAY too hot and mine melted the plastic casing.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Also, the 1200W is hot but not too hot and won&#x27;t singe your hair.</li>
      <li>We managed to find the exact product at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This dryer is just right for my short hair and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The Andis is attached to the wall, keeping it out of the way and ready to go when needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right temp and the right amount of wind force for my short hair.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to see the same model # still available and jumped on it.  </li>
      <li>I hung this blow dryer in our main bathroom where it gets used every day.  </li>
      <li>I really wish they&#x27;d kept the old design.</li>
      <li>We live in a condo.  </li>
      <li>If you are using this in a B&amp;B or small hotel, then sure, meatheads will break it.  </li>
      <li>(although they are LOUD), but the plastic wall unit just does not hold up.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my 12 year old son&#x27;s bath room and he loves it.</li>
      <li>Bought this to replace one that was so old</li>
      <li>/&gt;Footprint is small and easy to install on wall.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It used exactly the same footprint as my prior one.</li>
      <li>I already had an older dryer same brand and style.  </li>
      <li>In Normal use I expect it to last for years.  </li>
      <li>The hair dryer has a high and low setting, with the high setting being decent enough to dry my hair in a pinch.</li>
      <li>My old Andis wall mount finally died after over 20 yrs!</li>
      <li>Got this for my husband to replace his old one that finally died.  </li>
      <li>The old hair dryer left by the former owner was no longer working properly.  </li>
      <li>The dryer is small, but powerful.</li>

    <li> This dryer is just right for my short hair and easy to use.  I like that it is on the wall.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to find a hair dryer in the stores with less than 1875 watts.  They get WAY too hot and mine melted the plastic casing.  I am thrilled with the ANDIS 1200 Wat dryer.  It&#x27;s the right temp and the right amount of wind force for my short hair.  I give it an A+.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to replace his old one that finally died.  He likes it, but it is a little hard to turn off.  You have to hook it up to the wall mount and it keeps running until you get it just right.  But other than that, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I hung this blow dryer in our main bathroom where it gets used every day.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to store it and dig through a cabinet every time we need to use it.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer - has 2 speeds.  I like the wall mounted feature.  The dryer is small, but powerful.</li>
    <li> My old Andis wall mount finally died after over 20 yrs! It came with the house when we moved in and was always used several times a week.  This one is every bit as good except for one item.  It does not have an on-off switch. This requires that you must hang it up to turn it off.  A  bit of an inconvenience.  I really wish they&#x27;d kept the old design. This one is great for doing it&#x27;s job and was easy to install. It used exactly the same footprint as my prior one. Still a keeper</li>
    <li> Compact yet powerful,&lt;br /&gt;Chord could be a bit longer but still a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Footprint is small and easy to install on wall.&lt;br /&gt;No on-off switch- automatically starts or stops when removed or reinserted into mounting slot</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer! It is the second I&#x27;ve bought for our home. It is so nice to have them up and out of the way and this Andis dryer is the best!!</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these units for the bathrooms in my bed and breakfast.  The dryer is held in place at the top by a lever, which you release to remove the dryer from the wall unit (and which also turns the dryer on), and by a plastic \\&quot;lip\\&quot; at the bottom of the wall unit that the handle fits into.  The plastic \\&quot;lip\\&quot; on two of the wall units broke within days so and the dryers can no longer hang from the wall unit.  I called Andis and was told that there was nothing they could do.  It&#x27;s a good concept, and the dryers work well (although they are LOUD), but the plastic wall unit just does not hold up.</li>
    <li> This 1200 watt hair dryer is perfect for anyone with short to medium length hair. The handy wall mount keeps it close at hand but out of the way. The smaller wattage, as opposed to a 1600 or 1800 watt lets you style your hair without blowing it off your head. I love it!</li>
    <li> Seen some people complain about durability, but it seems well made.  If you are using this in a B&amp;B or small hotel, then sure, meatheads will break it.  In Normal use I expect it to last for years.  Also, the 1200W is hot but not too hot and won&#x27;t singe your hair.</li>
    <li> I already had an older dryer same brand and style.  This dryer replaced it.  Great dryer. Convenient to use. Thanks</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works exactly as described. I bought it for my 12 year old son&#x27;s bath room and he loves it. So far we have not experienced any issues from you.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a previous one of the same model.  We like being able to hang the dryer up and save on counter space in the bathroom.  It is a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this same model hair dryer about14 years ago.  It finally died so I ordered the same one again.  It is an excellent product and I hope this one lasts that long as well!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one that was so old I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it.  Great little dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this same unit many, many years ago and it finally bit the dust.  I was surprised to see the same model # still available and jumped on it.  You should too.</li>
    <li> On occasion when I travel, I&#x27;ll sometimes have to chance to use the Andis Hangup. The Andis is attached to the wall, keeping it out of the way and ready to go when needed. The hair dryer will turn on when the dryer is removed from the mount and turn off when the dryer is remounted. This setup is convenient and ensures that the dryer is always placed in the mount when not in use. The hair dryer has a high and low setting, with the high setting being decent enough to dry my hair in a pinch. I would not want to use this hair dryer every day, because the power is on the weak side. For travel, it will do.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit in our bathroom.  We are very happy with this purchase and the price.  1/2 the price of other retailers</li>
    <li> The drying power is very good. Size is perfect, not big and bulky on the wall.  The draw backs are you cannot turn off the power without putting the dryer back in the cradle.  Also, the clip tha hold the dryer in place is plastic, and is also the power switch.  I don&#x27;t think the plastic would hold up well unless it is handled with care.</li>
    <li> I have always had a larger more efficient hair dryer from Andis for years. However, they don&#x27;t make the models I use to buy because they were expensive. The last one I had on my wall worked for 7 years. It was a 1600 turbo with a night light. This is a 1200 with an on off switch. However, my husband has less hair than he had 7 years ago so it is adequate for his needs.</li>
    <li> We live in a condo.  The old hair dryer left by the former owner was no longer working properly.  We managed to find the exact product at Amazon.  We have this installed last month and it&#x27;s working beautifully.</li>
    <li> Great for after the swim.  Located in the bath next to the pool so guests have easy access.  Great dryer.</li>
