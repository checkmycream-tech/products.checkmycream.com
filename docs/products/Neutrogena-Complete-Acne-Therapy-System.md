<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ever since i started college, my face has been a complete mess. I started using this along with taking birth control. And I&#x27;m not sure if it was the birth control or this that helped my skin. I&#x27;d say this because birth control usually only starts working after 6 months, i heard. I use to have about 3 new peoples everyday. Now i have 3 new pimples a week, if even. No more pimples and i couldn&#x27;t be happier. All i have now is dark spots from the pimples. Also, if i apply the acne lotion on a pimple, it will be gone in about two days. So, this is pretty legit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i first started using it, it dried my skin a lot. I was doing the face wash and putting the acne treatment every day. So i started doing it every other night and only putting the acne treatment on new pimples. AND MOISTURIZER!! Make sure to moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now i use the face wash every day, and i put the acne treatment on new pimples and before bed I use another neutrogena moisturizer. In the morning i wash my face with water only, and I put the  the Spf lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this! It will save your life, lol but make sure to moisturize and dont over use it.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected. This product has made a dramatic improvement in my son&#x27;s face in just 2-3 days!! Works just as well or better as Proactive at a fraction of the cost!!</li>
    <li> This product claims to be as good as Proactiv but it&#x27;s a waste of money. It dried my skin out and left a rash. Don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne so maybe thats why this didn&#x27;t make a difference. I only get acne once a month and its usually only one or two little dots that I screw with until they are huge red scars. I used it and still got acne about once a month. Maybe you need to have a substantial amount of acne in order for this to work.</li>
    <li> I used ProActiv for many years and recently switched to Neutrogena.  Without a doubt it was a great switch, and I only regret not doing it sooner.  Its only a fraction of the cost of a similar ProActiv system, and it is doing as good of job or maybe slightly better.  The cleanser it not as harsh on my skin as ProActiv, and it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of an odor.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast. I got a week earlier than expected. So thank you for that.&lt;br /&gt;The product: gosh finally I found something that really helps me. I am using it for more than a month.And I really can say my skin got muuuuuuuuuuuuuuch better. In the first 2 weeks my skin got really dry. It was visible on the skin around the mouth and chin. I tried to use some other creams on top of it when puting the make up on. But in general i left the way it is. Now its just a bit dry, also in the same areas. My forehead is great. I didnt get rid of acne 100% but i can see clearly the pores dont get blocked with dirt and sebum. Before when i used other treatements i didnt get acne but the pores where getting blocked, and finnaly i got lots lots of blackheads/whiteheads all around my face, and when touching my face you could feel like i have small volcanoes with craters open, it annoyed me always. plus my skin still looked sick, redish, spots everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt experience that with Neutrogena. I have an uniform colour on my forehead and cheeks. Not perfect yet, but hey its just a month. So im going to order another set. Hope ill get rid of it once and for good. Thank you amazon.com and Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This works great! I have always had problem skin and this keeps me clear.  I have been usin this for a year or so now.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter is turning 13 this year and is starting to get acne, we have been using Olay face pads for a couple years and I thought she should try something a little stronger. This system work just about the same but is a little more costly</li>
    <li> I have a hard time sticking with any routines, including putting products such as this everyday on my face. However - I DO use this system from time to time, and really like it! I use the facial wash when I&#x27;m in the shower, and whenever I feel a breakout coming on, I&#x27;ll put on the lotion. These both do a great job for me, and I&#x27;m sure if I used it more religiously I&#x27;d get even better results!</li>
    <li> My website, w[...] is currently testing this product in our \\&quot;Cynical Trials\\&quot; blog. So far, so good, I guess, although the benzoyl peroxide lotion looks a big like egg white even after it&#x27;s dry. Blackheads are diminished by day 2, but major pimples don&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere fast. But I love the microfine beads in the cleanser, which smells great and has a nice lather to it.</li>
    <li> No results at all. Aggravated pimples. Skin is even more worse now</li>
    <li> I just began using this less than a week ago and I have already seen improvement! I understand that everyone is different and your skin may not react to this treatment as well as others but so far I am seeing great results!  I have combination skin, it gets oily throughout the day and I have to use oil blotters at time, but at the same time it can also get very dry! It&#x27;s not terribly sensitive, but it leans more to that side.   I was afraid that this product would dry out my face and although it does dry it out a little bit initially, the lotion has really helps to balance out the Ph in the skin!  This product has already been clearing up my acne and I am so far very happy! Hopefully it will keep on working!  2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have relatively clear skin, but I started breaking out in college. I&#x27;ve never had huge breakouts that covered my entire face in bumps, just spots around my nose, forehead, and chin. I also have hormonal breakouts and the occasional cystic pimple. So I&#x27;d recommend this to people with mild to moderate acne and flareups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried this when it first came out because the reviews were so positive, and it worked great for me. Definitely worked better than ProActiv, at a lower price and without the hassle of a monthly bill and getting stuck in an auto-shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad- not great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;re putting a ton of acne stuff on your face. And I love the two different lotions you get. The day lotion is great, light, and has SPF. The night lotion is heavier and great at zapping zits. The cleanser is gentle but exfoliating. All together, the system works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the individual lotions/cleanser were sold separately. It&#x27;s convenient having them all in a kit, but I ran out of everything at different times. I used up the cleanser first, then the day lotion, then the night lotion. But I had to buy a whole new kit and replace everything, so it seemed a little wasteful. Also, like any acne kit, this can be drying, so you may need another moisturizer, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has calmed down since I first used this, but I&#x27;d still recommend this. Try this product first before you call an informercial- of all the acne systems I&#x27;ve used, this one gave me the best results.</li>
    <li> I started using this kit last year after ProActiv failed to work. I noticed the little saying on the box \\&quot;Works better than ProActiv\\&quot; and thought since I spent $40 on a kit that didnt work, what was $20 more on a kit that might work. Much to my surprise, it worked!! Within a couple of days my face started to clear up! Every time I used it, my face felt clean and soft! I love it! Now Im in panic mode because I cant seem to find it anywhere but online!! Salicyclic acid alone doesnt do the trick, I actually think it makes it worse, but with this system, my face clears up! I think its the combination of Salicyclic acid and benzoyl peroxide and nowhere else have I found the combination of these two crucial items together in ONE kit!! I love the price and I love the whole kit! It gave me amazing results!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other products before and they tend to dry my skin out very bad but this didn&#x27;t. I noticed just over the first 24hrs it was working. Don&#x27;t expect it to clear everything over night but little spots that I did have were going away and a few were gone. Over a week later much more was gone to not much left.     I do have more sensitive skin, so every couple days I only wash my face once. If you are a person who needs to do this it is best to wash your face in the morning than at night. I would always make sure to rinse my face to get my make up and I also go the spot gel so when I didn&#x27;t wash my face at night I could use that on the spots needed.    I also love that it can be a 2 step unlike others that are a 3 step. Also, love that one has 15SPF. I never got that it any other products I used.     If you have not tried this product check it out. Like said by others, not every product is for every one but this one is worth trying.</li>
    <li> Being a college student who is on a \\&quot;budget\\&quot; for a skin care can be challenge for everyone. I have tried many products from different companies and they usually work in a short term rather than a long term. The benefit of using this products is to complete system that Neutrogena offers. The cleanser does not have an overpower feminine smell. For any males who are curious trying out Neutrogena, this product is for us. It is a gel type cleanser that easily turns into foam when use moderately. This is beneficial for me because I dont want excess cream dripping into the sink while I wash my face. The cleanser absorbs most of the oil that my skin produces after I finish washing my face. The acne gel does have a slightest smell of benzoyl peroxide. When use moderately, the acne gel does not leave any white residue on my skin. Too much of the gel will leave ugly white mark on anyone skins. One of the reasons I love about this acne gel is how quickly it dries when I apply on my skin. I do not have to sit around and wait for minutes for the gel to sink into my pores and to demolish tough acne pimples. In the package, it also include a suncream protection with SPF 15. I live in a desert where my skin gets to expose toxic radiations from the sunlight. I use the suncream to protect my overall face from any radiation of the sunlight. I love about the suncream because it is oil free. Do not quote me on this statement but I think all of the products from Neutrogena are oil free. Having oily skin, this suncream allows my pores to breath. What is more special about this acne system is every box comes with a five dollars off to use at any retail stores in America. I get mine for 15 dollars and it usually last for two months. I am not going to lie but I also use other facial cleansers from Neutrogena as well as other companies because I want to make the kit last a bit longer. The overall experience was a ten on a product that works for me. If you are about to complete reading this review, I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers oily skin with MILD acne.

    <li> Gave this to a teenager with acne and she&#x27;s getting results after only three days of use!  She switched from Pro-Activ to Neurtrogena Complete Acne Therapy System and she&#x27;s sticking with it!  She is absolutely thrilled.</li>
    <li> The kit as a whole works great, they&#x27;re meant to work with each other so you don&#x27;t have to second guess that they&#x27;re mixing Salicylic Acid in the cleanser and Benzoyl Peroxide in the Acne Lotion. The acne lotion is really nice because you can use it all over the face for complete breakout control. But my favorite part is the SPF LOTION. My gosh, this lotion is the best thing ever. It not only has SPF 15 but has their patented blend of nutrients and botanical extracts known as DermaNaturals which reduce redness and leave my skin feeling really healthy. I know because some nights that I&#x27;ve gone to bed without the lotion on, the next day my acne looks the same and my skin feels really dry. But every night I put the lotion on, I see massive improvement. It&#x27;s been about a week and my face is totally cleared up and it&#x27;s even starting to work on some of my acne scars. Way to go Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early thirties and thanks to genetics I&#x27;ve had acne breakouts for as long as I can remember. I tried Proactiv, but didn&#x27;t like the harshness to my skin and had mixed results. When I first started using Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System, I saw improvements within the first 2 weeks.  In fact, my friends and family noticed the difference in my skin and commented on my clear skin. Over 4+ years later, my skin continues to be clear and I will continue using this system.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I do think it&#x27;s worth giving a try!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 21 yr old black guy and i gotta say great product this is, worked better than I expected. I&#x27;ve gotten better results with this than I did with proactiv, true story! Now I know everyone skin is different &amp; results may vary, but I haven&#x27;t had one breakout since I started using it about a month ago. No complaints &amp; only 20 bucks, I&#x27;ll definitely keep purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I am one of those rare adults that keep having blemishes well in her twenties. I have more break out problems now that when I was a teen. I been using this product for several years and I am really happy with it. I haven&#x27;t try proactive, so I cannot compare. This system works remarkably well because it cleans the oily skin without drying the rest of my face or making me look all red. I started buying it for my teenager nephew and he likes it too. Specially, because the presentation isn&#x27;t \\&quot;girly\\&quot; (his words). The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that you need to buy the whole kid and I usually finish the creams much faster than the washer. The previous package&#x27;s washer is almost new and I had to buy a new one to get the creams. Since is not particular expensive I&#x27;ve started using it as a body wash and it has been working really well, too.</li>
    <li> Clearing my daughter&#x27;s skin slowly.</li>
    <li> I started breaking out about 2 months ago.  There was acne all over the sides of my face.  It wouldn&#x27;t clear up on its own so I knew I had to do something about it.  I&#x27;ve broken out in the past before and tried Proactive and Retin A before (topical treatment) and both did not work for me!  In fact, both those products made me break out more.  I don&#x27;t know why that is because it seems to work wonders for other people.  I decided to try this product because I had seen it in a drugstore before.  My face was even more swollen and painful after many extractions I got from a facial.  One day after the facial, I started using the face wash and acne lotion as directed.  In as little as two days, my acne started clearing up!  I could see a significant difference.  I dried up the acne and I could feel how tight my skin felt after washing my face with this product.  I didn&#x27;t start peeling from the dry skin until about a week and a half into using the product.  In a week my skin was almost back to normal, I just have some scarring now from some of the acne.  I would definitely recommend this product.  When my mom saw that I had purchased this acne system she told me don&#x27;t use drugstore products!  You don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll affect your face, they probably use cheap ingredients in the product.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen because it&#x27;s not true!  It worked for me.  I may switch to a normal face wash and lotion again now that my skin is cleared up (2 weeks into using the product), it does dry up your skin but that is much BETTER than having acne all over.  But if I ever break out again I will definitely go back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Complete Acne Therapy System!</li>
    <li> You know how they say things that are too good to be true probably are? Not in this case! I thought that this might clear up some of my acne (male mid 20s). It did a great job of that.    But what I didn&#x27;t expect is that it would reduce the size of my pores as much as it did!    The downsides are that a) the bottles on the left and right are super small, even though you use those more than once a day whereas you use the polishing bottle (the big one just once). And b) there are no clear directions on how to use. Do I let sit on my face and then wash off? Do I just leave it there all day?    Also not a big fan of the lotion. It&#x27;s slimy and doesn&#x27;t rub in very well. Ended up using another type of face location instead.</li>
    <li> You will not regret I Promise!  It works fast and without any pain!    I&#x27;ve tryed proa**ve it does not work.   I&#x27;m a teeager and it worked great on me! try it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable system that is both easy to use, not too many steps, and leaves your face feeling smooth and clean.  I have been using this for two weeks now and besides a very brief period of \\&quot;getting worse before getting better\\&quot; my face is virtually blemish free.  Be patient this system works but for me at least it took these two weeks and not the four days it claims on the package.  The reason I gave this four stars is that it can cause some annoying dryness.  My neck became very dry and a little chapped after the first week.  I simply reduced my application to once a day and put some petroleum jelly on my neck.  It feels fine now.  Please try this product.  It is so affordable and readily available.  I used proactive before and was put off by the contractual obligation to reorder.  Besides that, it never worked as well as this Neutrogena kit.</li>
    <li> So for the price it&#x27;s a waste of money. The salycilic acid just doesn&#x27;t cut it i guess. it&#x27;s too soft but , then again benzoyl peroxide is too strong. I could get2 or 3 other products here for this price</li>
    <li> This product cleans my pores well and works great within the first week, but after that my skin started peeling really badly. I even used the lotion only once a day and my skin was still completely flaky. Then my acne started coming back because of all the dry skin on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for those with sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use another acne product, but after moving to CA I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Since I was busy packing and couldn&#x27;t use the internet to order it online I stopped by my local Target and got the Neutrogena Acne System. There&#x27;s a cleanser, day lotion, night lotion.   The cleanser in the beginning seem pretty good, but after about a month&#x27;s use it&#x27;s okay. I probably will go back to my other acne system. I only have mild acne that doesn&#x27;t break out a lot.   The day lotion is useful since it also has 15 SPF. Perfect, since I don&#x27;t have to apply two types of lotion in the morning rush hour.  The night lotion is awkward...it makes your skin all tight and such. Probably the main reason why I won&#x27;t purchase this system. Neutrogena products are great, but I this acne treatment doesn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
    <li> I think this is more effective than the Neutrogena Skin I.D. system, which is about twice the cost!  I have had very good results w this product and would recommmend it to anyone battling acne!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of this product and rushed out to purchase it to give it a try.  I&#x27;m in my thirties and just recently was having problems with acne.  I was washing my face daily and in spite of all of my efforts, I repeatedly was dealing with break out after break out.  It was driving me nuts.  Out of desperation I checked Amazon and found this product.  I rushed out and bought it from Target, and two weeks into using this product I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My skin looks better and better with each day of using it.  It&#x27;s simple to use, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> At 29 years old, I&#x27;ve suffered from moderate to severe acne since I was 16.  I have tried everything from Proactiv to prescription creams and pills (a total of 6 failed prescriptions).  After using Neutrogena for 3 months, I have perfectly clear skin.  I do get an occasional zit here and there, but my face is no longer covered with acne.    The cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all.  The spf lotion is amazingly light and I don&#x27;t even feel it on my skin.  I highly recomment this to anyone!</li>
    <li> The only thing worth using in this kit is the benzoyl peroxide. Didn&#x27;t like the salycic acid solution or the lotion (very white like sunblock).</li>
    <li> Really works as long as you stick with it. Face feels better than ever</li>
    <li> Love having this available on Subscribe and Save!  I&#x27;ll never go to Costco again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have major acne, just on my cheeks and sometimes on my forehead and jaw. It did help my pimples go away faster but I still kept getting acne. It was okay but I am not getting it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System for close to 2 years.  I had tried everything under the sun from prescription to over the counter products.  This is the only product that has worked for me over the last 25 years...it even beat Proactive hands down.  I highly recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> This really works!  Only downside is that you use up the cleanser before the other two products, so it needs to be bigger.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I would describe my skin as oily, everywhere, not just the T-zone. Very acne prone with mainly whiteheads or the very deep infections that take a couple weeks to disappear but not without leaving a nice little scar. I cannot touch my face, ever. I&#x27;m pretty much guaranteed to get a zit wherever I place a finger.  I am African American so the scars seem to be more prominent (to me anyway).  Anyway, The Acne Therapy System has been very successful with not only making my acne disappear but also improving my skin tone and color uniformity. Many of the scars have faded and my skin just looks fresh! It has also been very effective at removing my Dermablend makeup which, if you have no experience with this foundation, is very difficult to remove. I&#x27;ve been recommending this product to everyone I know. $20 is a steal!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading some of the other reviews of this system that it might be less expensive, more effective than Proactiv. This was not the case for my skin. Maybe I was sensitive to some of the ingredients in the Neutrogena system or maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me, but either way ruptions began occurring when I used it. I noticed the pores on my nose seemed to be enlarging with continued use. I found that my skin did not feel clean after using the cleanser; as if a residue were left behind. The night cream seemed to get absorbed completely but the day cream remained slightly tacky feeling like it was sitting on top of my skin. I used the system a couple of weeks assuming that maybe my skin just needed to adjust - the eruptions didn&#x27;t stop. I wish this had worked as it is a fraction of the cost of Proactiv.</li>
    <li> Reacted to my wife&#x27;s skin</li>
    <li> I got this for my gf... And it is showin improvement..! Though not completely, there&#x27;s some betterment..! But the acne tube gets over very soon.. So gotta order that separately..!     But certainly.. No fairness is gained by applyin this...</li>
    <li> After using numerous acne products, this system has always worked for me. As a man, its easy to incorporate into your shower routine which I like. Works wonders on acne and have never had any sort of irritation.</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv for a little over two years and then decided to try something cheaper and hoped to get the same results. So, I saw Neutrogena Advanced Solutions on T.V and decided to try it. For the first week I didn&#x27;t have any breakout; the second I had a pimple; the third week there were pimples here and there on my face and it made me upset. I understand that Neutrogena Advanced Solutions works for some people (probably those with mild acne) but it&#x27;s by no means better than Proactiv Solution. I also tried other products beside Neutrogena Advanced Solutions that didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m back to Proactiv now and i have clear beautiful skin again. Proactiv Solution is a little pricy but it&#x27;s the BEST acne product that I have used by far. For those who have tried several acne products that did not work, try Proactiv Solution because it works!</li>
    <li> This product was really unimpressive. It helped my skin, but not nearly the effect that I had gotten when I tried Proactiv. I wish I wasn&#x27;t banking on it making me pristine before my wedding. Mostly my problem is oily skin, so it might be different for someone with different skin. The bottle sizes are very different, so it was easy to run out of one bottle before the other.</li>
    <li> I am someone who has had moderate acne since about the 6th grade.  I have tried many, many products that claim to be miracle workers when it comes to clearing up acne, even some very expensive ones, but none of them did much for my moderate acne.  I decided to try the 3 piece Neutrogena Advanced Soultions Acne Therapy Treatment Kit and I can tell you that it does great things for my skin.  I can also tell you that now I only get a few pimples here and there, but none that are too large (or painful) or that last very long.    This product has 3 steps (and 3 products in it)    The first product (step) is the face wash, which is my favorite part.  It is effective in cleaning and killing off the bacteria that form and cause the pimples.  It is also a great exfoliator and leaves my skin feeling smooth.    The 2nd product is the acne cream that you apply morning and night.  This works to fight and prevent the acne.    The 3rd product (which I personally do not use) is just an spf-15 face cream. Personally I find it to be useless and does not smell that great.  I use my own face cream.  I wish they would get rid of this lotion and lower the price!    Overall this product is great and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was sick of getting a major pimple or two every month with a little acne on my chin- this pack is amazing. My pimples are gone. My skin looks good. Not harsh for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I like this product...It does a great job of clearing up my face when I use it properly. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Proactiv and has worked just as well as that product did (although I haven&#x27;t used Proactiv in ~6yrs, it never impressed me much for the price). The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the active ingredient in one of the 3 tubes, benzoyl peroxide, has ended up bleaching the collars of many of my shirts. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, maybe I accidentally rub my face all over my collar without realizing it. But a lot of my shirt collars paid the price before I even realized what was happening. In the end I&#x27;ve had to resort to using the benzoyl peroxide product only at night before bed, and just using the face wash and moisturizer in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well but my shirts thank me.</li>
    <li> 15 year old daughter has used about 18 months. Very few zits to report!  Wish we could buy items separate my, as lotion not used as often.</li>
    <li> I had moderate acne on my chin forehead and nose area. With Neutrogena&#x27;s background, I though my acne days were over but the whole thing backfired! Day 1 and 2 were nice, my skin seemed to be clearing but the next morning, my entire face was covered in pimples. Hoping this was just the middle phase and that after this terrible ordeal was over, I&#x27;d finally have clear skin. But no. It only continued to get worse and worse. This was a terrible product. Now, I&#x27;m dreaming of the way my skin was before I started. Complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Ive been using for two weeks and no results. Causes my skin to become very dry.</li>
    <li> my daughter liked anything that neutrogena makes so no complian about the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now.  I&#x27;m 30 yrs old with oily skin.  I really dont get breakouts, unless I run out of this product or forget to bring it travelling with me.  I tried ProActive once and still think the Neutrogena worked better (and Amazon doesn&#x27;t scam you!)    I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Subscribe &amp; Save!  Its cheaper, free shipping (no minimum), and I don&#x27;t run out.  Win, win, win!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews and opted for this product versus Proactiv, mostly due to price. I have fair skin, freckles, sensitive skin, and since January have been breaking out all over my face, so badly, that I even went to the dermatologist (who wanted me to take an oral medication or go back on the pill). I have been using this for approximately 2 weeks now. I only use it at night time. You only need a dime size of the face wash, which feels thick and has tiny scrubbers, but works very well. My boyfriend hates the face washes with any type of \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; for scrubbing and yet he didn&#x27;t even notice these. It cleans my skin well and tightens it. I use the acne lotion, a nickle size amount, which is very thick, goes on heavy and can feel greasy, but dries up in 1-2 minutes and that heavy greasy feeling is gone. Your skin will feel ight. I have used Neutrogena acne sore pimple spot treatment on cystic pimples and then go to bed. I have noticed a substantial difference in just 10 days. I am thrilled and will efinetly be being it again. Only complaint is that the acne lotion (not the SPF one, is such a small tube and they don&#x27;t sell it seperately).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne all of the time.  There are times where my skin is clear.  But when I do breakout, usually before my menstrual cycle, I break out pretty badly.  I get these big, under the skin type of pimples, especially on my chin.  I had broken out pretty badly a week and a half before my brother&#x27;s wedding and I bought this product hoping it would work as fast as it said it would.  I used this product for one week.  That is all I could handle.  It literally hurt to wash my face with this product.  For days I could not even touch the skin on my face, it hurt that bad.  It made my skin raw.  Here I was with a bad breakout right before a wedding I was to be a bride&#x27;s maid in and be photographed, and for days before the wedding I could not stand to wash my face at all.  This product is a little on the pricey side and I had to throw it out.  I flushed about $25 down the toilet.    I&#x27;m really surprised that this product received as many good reviews as it did.  This product may very well work on some skin types.  But if you have sensitive skin, do not use this product.</li>
    <li> The face wash is really good my skin feels really refreshed and clean, the Acne lotion is good it&#x27;s clearing my acne up but it can leave my skin feeling a little dry so I would use a good hydrating moisturizer to help with the dryness.</li>
    <li> Even though the packaging has changed. The products still work as well as they previously did. However, I find that the face wash is not as effective as it use to be so I usually have to go out and buy one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who is 21. She has developed adult acne. After 4 days of using this, as described, her face is broke out even worse than before using. It just isn&#x27;t the product for her, i guess. Shipping was fast and packaging was great. I wish it had worked. I wish i could get a refund for the item.</li>
    <li> I bought this products on Neutrogena website when they have some discounts. Had tried many acne products and just decided to try this one out. It was quite impressive! After 3 weeks of using it, my acne breakouts reduce significantly and heal more quickly. Although my skin is not totally clean as I hope it will eventually be, I&#x27;m pretty happy about the results.   My skin is combination-type and quite sensitive to lots of things--spring season, sun burns, etc. Many anti-acne products that claim to be moderate often cause serious allergic issues like redness or even more severe acnes on my skin. For this one, I have not experienced these problems. However, it does cause my skin to be overdry a little bit--so what I do now is I combine the kit with some sensitive-skin lotion and moisturizer. For people who have relatively dry skin, I guess using the kit as a supplement rather than relying on it for moisturizing would be a better option.   --------------------------------------------  Updates: I stop using this line after 2 months. It works better at the beginning and now its effect is fading. I guess this is the problem for all acne treatment products based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. It is also not appropriate for long-term use on sensitive skin. I had to apply lots of Avene Spring Water to calm my skin everyday in the past few weeks.  I&#x27;m switching to more natural products now, such as tea tree oil and lavender oil.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been shelling out hundreds of dollars for ProActiv for our teenaged daughter for the past couple of years, and all of sudden, it stopped working for her.  I did a quick \\&quot;google\\&quot; and Neutrogena products came up.  We gave it try.  It took about 5 days to see results - then her face was clear!  For the price - you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/27/2011:  Actually, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as Proactiv.  My daughters face broke out big time.  Never happened before.  Might have to see a dermatologist now.</li>
    <li> after 2 months of using this product the acne on my daughters face is the same, and it dries out the skin to the point of peeling...waist of money... will try proactive this time...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of acne kits, even those expensive ones, &amp; none of them worked. Then I saw this while looking around Amazon &amp; read the reviews. It works wonders! I have sensitive skin &amp; it made my skin dry &amp; flaky at first. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now, once a day, &amp; my skin is totally clear! Two thumbs up! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  You have to be persistent to see results and keep it.</li>
    <li> I am a 24 year old female with combination skin. I had little to no breakouts during my teenage years, but at 21 I got pregnant and had my son and a whole new set of skin problems! He is now 3 and I still have breakouts. I just began using this product yesterday along with Burts Bees blemish stick. I have tried ProActive in the past but it was too harsh on my skin from the first application. So far I used this system once last night and then again this morning and evening, and I have a feeling I am going to be very satisfied. I will update here as the weeks go one, but so far, I think im going to love this!</li>
    <li> One of the hardest decisions regarding acne is what type and brand to choose. There are many out there saying they are \\&quot;the best.\\&quot; I have had acne for years now, but nothing too severe. I was tired of the irritated redness and zits that would just appear overnight.    I heard good things about Neutrogena. I have owned this kit for two days and already see drastic improvements. This products really works. The one thing that people don&#x27;t understand is that it&#x27;s not just the product that makes the difference, it&#x27;s the constant application. You HAVE to stick with it. You cannot use only when you get that one breakout. If you use this kit as directed everyday, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product as it has done a great job at preventing more breakouts and has cast out any current pimples. The only fault I find with this product is that it does NOT reduce redness. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and see now reduction in my pimples with red spots. When using the Acne Control Lotion, only use it on the spots you need to treat. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll have some peeling on your face. The skin cleansing is great and feels good against my skin, although be careful when placing it on your Clarisonic or hands as a couple times it has slid right off my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- Good product but wish the redness reduction was much better.</li>
    <li> so far, no pimples.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> I started using the products a week ago and I think this is the most wonderfull thing that I have never tried. My skin gets better most of the irritation and acne were removed. Of course I read all the instructions and yesterday I bought a lotion with solar protection factor 100, because one of the indications mention that you need to be really carefully with sunburned. I hope when I finished the treatment my skin will be better than that, also for people that this did not work I recommend to visit a doctor and ask for recommendations, in my case I was lucky I just see the product and I bought it, also as part of the indications they said that you need to ask an especialist before start using that. This should be one of the reason of most of the people obtain bad results because the treatment should not be for all skin types</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all. Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, Phisoderm, Clinique, other over-the-counter treatments, as well as prescription washes, creams, and pills. I can honestly say this is the WORST one I&#x27;ve ever tried. Seriously disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this religiously for three weeks and my acne has actually gotten worse... not one sign of improvement. And if that isn&#x27;t enough, the creams are not even comfortable to put on - the night cream being the worst. It&#x27;s thick and sticky and leaves your face feeling like a dried up raisin. It dries out your face and makes it tight and itchy. Seriously unpleasant. The day cream has an SPF in it, and although that sounds appealing, I feel like all that&#x27;s in it is sunscreen. It smells like sunscreen and makes my face extremely oily. The general face was is okay but leaves a bit of buildup unless you spend five minutes rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please... read all of the reviews here and make the decision for yourself. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but at least take this review under consideration. It&#x27;s a serious waste of mulah!</li>
    <li> My acne did not start until my 20&#x27;s.  It was concentrated on my forehead and chinline and although it was not severe, I always had at least 1 or two large, painful pimples.  No one should have to deal with zits into their late 20s!  I tried all the high end products and even other Neutrogena products without positive results.  Then I found the Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System which I bought on a whim because it was on sale. I have used this system everyday for four years and a breakout is now an anomaly and most likely the result of my not using the system for a few days.  The face wash always runs out first but as long as I have my day and night creams, I remain breakout free.  To address those who complain of dry skin, I only use the day and night creams on my trouble areas (I have combination skin) and I always layer on another moisturizer on top of the system.  I will panic if they ever discontinue the system or change it in anyway!</li>
    <li> I used Neutrogena products since high school to maintain clear skin. I actually have combination skin and never suffered much from sever acne. However, I would have break outs and Neutrogena would clear these up within 2 days. I recently was pregnant and got some fine acne along y forehead and chin. Naturally I panicked. A trip to the cosmetics store was in order and I bought this kit. My OBGYN said it was safe to use and that I did. 2 days later my skin was clear and has been clear since. I even gave some to my husband who is a sceptic (bless his heart) and he came to me last week and apologised for doubting. My kit from pregnancy has not been exhausted yet and we both use it. Neutrogena has my vote for life!</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve spent so much money on acne cleansers that didn&#x27;t work that I just got fed up and starting using inexpensive cleansers.  I&#x27;m 27 and have struggled with moderate acne over the years off and on.  Sometimes my face will clear up but then, boom, I have cystic pimples all over my chin...I&#x27;m very diligent about washing my face and moisturizinig with oil-free moisturizers but just recently my chin area exploded with zits.  I went to Rite Aid and came across this acne system and thought, \\&quot;why not...I&#x27;m desperate.\\&quot;  I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work like all of the other somewhat expensive cleansers I&#x27;ve bought, but I was wrong.  THIS WORKS!!!!!  I wash my face with the main cleanser in the morning and then dab on the lotion on all of my zits and problem areas.  I don&#x27;t put it on my whole face, as it dries my skin out.  After dabbing on the lotion and letting it dry (I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels tight), I rub on a hypoallergenic oil-free moisturizer of my own and let it dry before doing my make-up for the day.  At night, I do the same routine, except that after adding the lotion, letting it dry, putting on my own moisturizer and letting it dry, I dab on the system&#x27;s lotion (again) on any existing zits and they usually get dried out and zapped in my sleep.  My face is finally clear, so now I&#x27;m just using the lotion on my acne scars and they are fading as well.  For the first time in my adult life I&#x27;ve found something that finally helps clear up my face and stay that way.  I&#x27;ve still gotten a pimple or two, but I immediately dab on the lotion and keep them under control.  I can actually not wear foundation and not feel self-conscious.  Hope it works for you all! I&#x27;m a lifelong custmer now, this stuff is GOLD!!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for people who do not benefit from Proactive, AcneFree and other acne kits. I have oily but sensitive skin and am prone to drying-out from products/severe redness. Because this product is effective at removing oil, it caused some dryness but most importantly it dries out and reduces my acne very rapidly. It is pretty effective at reducing recurring breakouts too, with the exception of the time just before my period. I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun, prescription topical meds and OTCs, even Accutane (caused permanent organ damage and didn&#x27;t keep my skin clear either). This worked best for me.</li>
    <li> In my mid-30s, I have been experiencing more aggressive acne over the past few years.  I seem to find a product that helps, then it goes off the market :(  Lately, nothing has been helping.  5 days ago, I did some research online and found, like other reviewers have said, that a combination of Salicylic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide seems to provide the best relief.  So I went to my local big box store and decided to take a chance on this product... I am SO glad I did!!!  Within 2-3 days my active breakouts were significantly healed, including a large cystic breakout that had become quite infected. And I have not noticed any new breakouts since starting to use this product.     Per the packaging, this system \\&quot;starts clearing breakouts in just 2 days\\&quot;.  It claims to work faster than Proactiv, and shows it&#x27;s effectiveness in clinical trials on the back of the package.  It uses a three part system: step 1 - skin polishing acne cleanser with 0.5% salicylic acid and microfine exfoliating beads; step 2 - acne control lotion with prescription-grade benzoyl peroxide; step 3 - oil-free SPF 15 lotion with calming botanical complex. Although it doesn&#x27;t mention it anywhere else on the package, under the cleanser directions, it does mention that the product contains AHA (an alpha hydroxy acid) in case you are sensitive to that.    I LOVE how simple this kit is.  I am not one to wash, tone, etc. etc. etc.  I simply wash my face at night with the Skin Polishing Acne Cleanser, followed by the Overnight Acne Control Lotion.  Whenever I try to wash my face twice a day, it increases breakouts, so I didn&#x27;t even try with this.  In the morning, I put Neutrogena&#x27;s [[ASIN:B000052YJX Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment, Vanishing Formula, 0.75 oz (21 g)]] on any remaining breakout spots, and follow with the Sun Shield Day Lotion from the kit, then apply my typically minimal makeup. I was even tempted to leave the house this morning without having applied my makeup, my skin is so clear! I am so happy to have gotten this kit, and I hope it remains on the market! My kit even contained a $4 coupon off my next kit purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of products and systems. Crazy to think how much money I&#x27;ve spent over the years. However, NOTHING was as drying and irritating as this. It felt OK after the first use. After repeated uses however, my face and neck were so dry and irritated it hurt to make facial expressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it just every other day and moisturizing frequently and it helped a little, but the combination of all three products still made my face really uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I abandoned it and went back to one of my favorite products which is the Neutrogena 2 in 1 blackhead removing pads. They aren&#x27;t very strong, only 0.5% SA and they&#x27;re very good at removing dead skin. It helped my skin recover a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to think that it was either the acne lotion or moisturizer that made my skin so dry because i&#x27;ve used 2.5% BP before and it was fine. And well, if a moisturizer is drying, that makes little sense. So I began using the pads instead of the polishing wash and then put the acne control lotion and the moisturizer on after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work better. Not nearly as drying. I don&#x27;t exactly know what&#x27;s in the wash. I&#x27;ve never had such a bad reaction to an SA wash before.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product and so far have liked the results. It&#x27;s simpler and has less steps than many more expensive acne systems, such as Proactive. I had been using plan Dove soap to cleanse my face and a moisturizer, but I was looking to reduce break outs and black heads (I&#x27;m an adult and yes I still get these). I did have a transition period where I broke out a little bit more than normal when switching, but once my face calmed down about the switch I&#x27;ve noticed great results. The cleanser feels good on my face and is not drying. I typically only use it once a day. I have oily skin but it gets worse if I over wash. I use the moisturizer in the morning, usually after cleansing. There is an acne fighting cream I put on at night. It&#x27;s not a chore or a process to use this system, pretty quick an easy, and it wasn&#x27;t really a deviation from my usual routine. I have noticed that my skin feels and looks pretty good, and I&#x27;d say I have less break outs. I still have black heads on my nose (I have no idea how to get rid of them and have tried everything). I would say they seem a little smaller and my pores are looking slightly better. No miracle transformation here, but I&#x27;d like to find a product that does. Overall I like this system, and I feel the price is right. I have seen positive results and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 26 with mild to moderate acne. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year. I recommend it to all of my friends. It works if you are consistant with the regimine. Wash your face with the cleanser in the morning, use the moisturizer during the day (a little goes a long way with everything)Wash again at night &amp; use a thin layer of the the benzoyle peroxide on areas that are broken out, follow with a moisturizing night cream of your choice. The benzoyl peroxide gel is harsh at first &amp; will dry out your skin... but it WORKS and your skin will get used to it. Give it 2 weeks. Another thing to be mindful about is that the benzoyle peroxide will bleach your pillow case, but for me it&#x27;s worth having clear skin. I just buy light colored pillow cases, no big deal. This stuff works for me. I use it everyday and have clear skin. I will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> Gud product..but I am not satisfied with moisturizer...</li>
    <li> Around this is a great product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and this stuff irritated it. My cheeks became exremely dry and chapped. The lotion is the one weak point, it was no help because it doesn&#x27;t moisturize. After the irritation went away it made my skin clear up and my blackheads shrink. My skin is just too sensitive for it.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line, chin and cheeks for the past couple of years.  I have tried Murad, Proactiv, AcneFree and many other systems without success.   &lt;br /&gt;A month ago I picked up the Neutrogena system when I saw it on sale. Within five days days my skin started to clear.  Now, I have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system. I have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before.  Finally, a product that works and comes at a decent price!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and have combination type skin with occasional, mild to moderate acne.  I used nearly two whole ProActiv systems before switching to a Neutrogena kit and have found that this clears up my skin much better and faster.  I find it very convenient that the Day Lotion includes SPF 15, whereas the ProActiv Repairing Lotion doesn&#x27;t, even though ProActiv advises you to use sunscreen with their system when going outside.  That would probably prompt you to buy their oil-free moisturizer with SPF 15 as well ($$ smart business move $$), thus adding another step to your skin-care regimen.  I would recommend anyone with my acne/skin type who is thinking about subscribing to ProActiv to try Neutrogena first.    Anyway, the Neutrogena kit lasts around 5 months for me.  I still get an occasional zit or two, but with less frequency than I did in the past.  I use a Neutrogena Rapid Clear spot gel for that with success.    Word of advice: It might be best if you shake the tube of acne cleanser before you start using it.  When I was finishing up what was left of the last tube I used, I discovered that all the \\&quot;micro-fine beads\\&quot; were gathered there, afloat at the very top somehow.  I&#x27;ve been wondering where those were all along...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old female and have had pretty good skin - up until about a year ago. Then my skin started to break out, not just in the normal spot like my chin but now on my cheeks. I tried everything, and even broke out $159 on a Zeno (which does NOT work). I was getting desperate and bought this system at Wal-Mart about 3 weeks ago. And what do you know - my skin is almost 100% clear. It did take 2 weeks for it to fully work and be effective but now my skin looks pretty darn good. And I have not experienced the extreme dryness like others. There has been some dryness but if you use a washcloth it takes it away with no issue. I highly recommend this product - especially because its much more cost effective when compared to Proactiv or other types of acne products. I gave it 4 out of 5 because it did take 2 weeks to start working. Other than that I am a very happy customer and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this is the only product that keeps me clear.</li>
    <li> I started using this product two days ago, and woke up this morning with an itchy, bumpy rash!  I had problems with benzyol peroxide 9 years ago, but thought it might be time to try it again, especially with the good reviewds on this product.  I truly did notice the acne clearing up in just these two days, so I hate that I have to stop using it!  Maybe, like other users, I&#x27;ll have to use it every other day.  If you don&#x27;t have a problem with benzyol peroxide, this may be your dream product!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews. Ever. But I am in LOVE with the way this makes my face look. Not only did it help clear up minor bumps, but blemishes and it helped to clear out my pores and reduce them significantly. I used to be afraid to walk out of the house without make-up on, now I have a skin tone that isnt ruined by huge red splotches and is even and beautiful! I saw results in about two days, around day 4-5 my face started to dry out, but I just decided to use the lotion at that point (which I wasn&#x27;t originally using) and its been GREAT ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I dont have terrible skin (I have moderately oily skin and minor bumps and blemishes) I only use this once a day after my shower in the AM. I then use the Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub every night and sometimes the Clear Pore Mask/Moisturizer as a Mask (every 3-4 days) just for that super fresh feel! Oh, and some lotion! :D</li>
    <li> This product is working great for me, it has been about 3 weeks and everything is really clearing up.    I am a bit worried about the part where it says to limit exposure to the sun while using this product, it may increase the possibility of sunburn.  With spring and summer around the corner we&#x27;ll see what effect it has for me, I work outdoors, hopefully it won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a month it did not clear up acne, seemed to for the first week then skin just got worse and worse. It was also really harsh on my skin, dried out areas especially around nose. I love Neutrogena products, but this one just did not work for me...</li>
    <li> My teenage kids absolutely LOVE this product!      After we saw the commercial, my kids wanted to give it a try.  ProActiv didn&#x27;t work well for them and I found it to be too expensive.      They&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena product for about a week now.  They&#x27;ve had NO NEW BREAKOUTS.  My son especially likes the moisturizer because he used to really get dry skin.      If the commercial is an indication of what my kids have to look forward to, we&#x27;ll be die-hard Neutrogena users for life!  :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, I have been using for a week and my face is almost cleared up!!  Try this before you try anything else.  Only thing is it will dry your face out a little but that is great for me because I have such oily skin.  Check it out.</li>
    <li> I used Proactiv for a long time. I have also tried everything else possible. The first 2 days of using Neutrogena felt good and my face felt clean. The third day, I woke up with a huge painful pimple and throughout the next week of using the product, I had 4-5 HUGE pimples all over my face. I had previously only had a few small ones here and there, so this product made it way worse. I switched back to Proactiv and my face has pretty much cleared up in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Ehh didn&#x27;t last as long as it was suppose too and barely cleared anything and the stuff it cleared just came back the next week</li>
    <li> i use it like 1 week but after my face become red and burn, i stop it now , i bought it because of acne but now i have 2 problems acne plus this red stains</li>
    <li> after the first application my skin started to dry out and I also had a lot of of burning after the second treatment. I only used this product for 3 nights and threw it out because it dried my skin out and burned my skin so bad.</li>
    <li> Good product as long as you make sure to use it gently (don&#x27;t rub the cleanser too hard). The acne control lotion isn&#x27;t really a lotion; it&#x27;s more like a gel. Aside from that, this is a good product, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is the oil-free sunblock lotion. It comes really useful in Florida.</li>
    <li> So I just got this product and after skimming the reviews for it, i thought i would take my chances. I can&#x27;t afford proactiv so this was the next best thing and a competitor of proactiv. this is awesome for oily skin! my skin changes day to day and even hour to hour. i can get dry flaky skin to really obnoxiously oily skin. i wear make up and it breaks me out pretty bad. i use it this morning and my god my skin feels great under the makeup! i can tell the difference between what i normally use and this product. i usually use Loreal 360 clear sets. the pink bottle burns my face and the orange one drys me out band the blue bottle makes me break out bad and the green bottle makes me flaky. i seriously could not win with those products. from what i can tell, this product is repairing my skin from the inside out! its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: About a week after this review, my face started getting really dried out. Thought it might have been the acne control cream, i was right. it started to burn my face and i had to stop using it as frequently. so, do what the box says and if you cant do every day 2 times a day, go every other day or cut it to 1 time a day. dont burn your skin, it takes forever to repair correctly.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is not authentic. I tested it out in the store and the product here is not the same as in stores. I will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> For the price, I think this works very well.  My skin does look much better, though it does dry.  Definitely worth a try to see if it will work with your skin.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Advanced Solutions product has worked well for me- from day 1. After using Proactiv for YEARS, this product is a welcome change that performs as advertised. At first, using it twice a day was too irritating, switching to once a day was fine for the &#x27;break in&#x27; period, I can now use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first if this product line would really do the job the same or better than Proactive. The amounts of medication used are less than what&#x27;s contained in the \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; Proactive I&#x27;d been using, but which left me with skin so dry I would only apply once a day.     I&#x27;m really happy I decided to purchase this line when I saw it in the store (convenient and half the price). The cleanser is where you get the salicylic acid and very small gentle beads, the night lotion is where you get the benzoyl peroxide, and the day lotion is included for a nice oil-free spf 15 moisturizer.     The overall results are much better than my old regimen. I have clearer skin with much less drying, and I don&#x27;t have to go through the extra steps of applying an added moisturizer and sunscreen like I used to. I recommend this gentle and effective product, great all-around.</li>
    <li> The cleanser is great. The lotions are meh. The acne lotion in particular is really really sticky. It doesn&#x27;t rub in very well and it leaves a white film on my face.</li>
    <li> Umm..best product for acne clearing!    I seriously tried EVERYTHING..probably 50..ask my mom..LOL..including proactive..which is possibly the worst acne medication..due to the OVERDOSE on benzyol peroxide!  Benzoyl peroxide makes yoru face EXTREMELY DRY and by puttin it on DAY AND NIGHT..your skin will barely be able to move!    Nuetrogena gives a perfect balance of both sacylic(sp??) acid and benzoyl peroxide.  In the morning you treat your face with the sacylic acid which helps prepare your skin for the benzyol peroxide you put on at night!  My skin cleared up completely in about a month!      Umm...the one thing a suggest is that you use a ACNE mask like \\&quot;Queen helen mint julep mask\\&quot; (sold at your nearest beauty supply store for 5 bucks) because the neutrogena system (like every other acne product) is not PERECT..it needs a little help.  The mint julep mask should replace the benzoyl peroxide gel and be put on once a week OVERNIGHT on the face..and washed off once awake.  If little pimples do come up..you can use spot treatment with the mask OVERNIGHT and wash it off in the morning!  But ALWAYS use the mask on the ENTIRE face overnight ONCE a week..and spot treatment if necessary during the week...     Great product tho..wouldn&#x27;t trade it! The sunscreen moisturizer is awesome..smells great. THe skin polisher smels great and feeels and looks like it does polish your skin.  GREAT SYSTEM all together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old and have been dealing with acne since I was 13, and have tried just about every product. This one was really terrible, I have only used it for 3 days so I&#x27;m not sure if it is actually going to clear my acne or not but it has dried out my skin and made it REALLY flaky and the moisturizer is so thin and light weight that it doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I constantly have a really flaky face all the time now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 and NEVER even had so much as a tiny pimple anywhere...until I got pregnant.  My daughter is now 3 and I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne ever since.  I get large, deep, cystic acne on my chin and sometimes on my forehead, and tiny, puss filled pimples on my neck, chest and back.  I have tried Proactive for months on end with far less results than were worth the time and effort of all the steps involved (and the price).  I have tried a variety of precriptions for washes and ointments/foams/creams from my dermatologist including Benzaclyin, Evoclin, Tazarac Cream, Clenia, and Zyiana.  Some dried my skin out so badly that it actually cracked and was very painful, some didn&#x27;t dry the pimples out enough, and some would clear up breakouts, but not prevent future outbreaks. None of them came with a moisturizer, so I never knew how to fight off the dryness.  I was always afraid that using a drugstore moisturizer would defeat the effects of the meds by clogging my pores and causing more breakouts, so I&#x27;d just suffer with uncomfortable and ugly flaking skin in hopes that the acne would atleast stop.  No such luck.    I have been using the Neutrogena system for about 2 weeks, and I can confidently say that this is going to be the LAST acne regimin I will ever follow again.  When I bought the set at Target, it came with a free bottle of the spot treatment, which I think is vital to the success of this system.  Within a few days, I noticed that the tiny pimples on my chest were drying out and no new pimples were forming anywhere.  Now, almost all of the pimples - even the deep ones on my chin - are either gone, or DRAMITICALLY reduced.  I will also add that I started this system about 12 days before I expected my period knowing that the worst pimples of the month were on their way. I did experience a bit of drying, but nothing that was at all painful or really red and irritated.  The best thing about this system is that it comes with a daytime moisturizer, so your skin willnever be cracking and flaking the way it would with other treatements.  The slight drying was actually beneficial for me because I have olive skin, and I get hyperpigmentation (dark marks) where pimples were.  They normally take several weeks to fade, but the drying effect of the nightime acne lotion helped to really exfoliate those spots and the result has been a dramatic lightening of those marks.      I would definately recommend giving this system a try.  Get the spot treatment as well.  I started out using the wash and night time acne lotion as well as the spot treatment at night, and then the wash and moisturizer during the day.  Now that most of the pimples have cleared up, I&#x27;m not using the spot treatment.  There are so few steps to this system - it&#x27;s not time consuming or tedius to keep up with.  It&#x27;s affordable (the bottles are large enough to last over a month even if you&#x27;re using them on your back, chest and face as I am), it&#x27;s quick, easy, and most of all, effective.</li>
    <li> This comes with a face wash, a face lotion, &amp; sunscreen. I just started useing this cuz my face broke out. I&#x27;ve always had clear skin not sure what&#x27;s up.. but it makes my face feel nice and clean!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews. It didnt completely clear up my skin... and didnt make some existing pimples go away. The moisturizer made my skin feel greasy and look shiny.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> very good product they are the only one product that i use now and i feel very satisfy.</li>
    <li> Noticed a clearer face within days of using it. Love the gentle feel and doesnt leave my skin dry or overly oil.</li>
    <li> The once Acne fighting system I used actually works well. Once I stopped using these, acne came back and I started using it again. After having using it for several month, I do not even remember I had acne before. I like the bland smell as well.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with acne since my early 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m now 28) and I have tried EVERY product out there. Nothing ever seemed to work, even the highly toted Pro-Activ. I started using this stuff on a whim and was surprised by the results. When I got back from my Iraq deployment my face was HORRIBLE! Nothing I would do could make it any better. I tried chemical peels and all sorts of cleansers, masks, toners, etc. I had seen a review on here a woman made about this product being good for adult acne. So, I went down to Target and decided to give it a try. I vowed to make a review after I waited at least three months to see if the product really worked. Good new...IT DOES! (I started using this back in November 2010, it&#x27;s now February 2011). I had the initial breakout where the product was purging all the nasties from my pores...I also had the DRY, DRY skin. Try to get past it. It won&#x27;t last forever once your skin gets used to the products, I promise. I did find that the oil-free lotion wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me at night, so I mix pure aloe and pure vitamin E oil (70k I.U.) and slather that on my face about an hour after the BP lotion (to give my skin time to absorb the lotion). I find that the aloe/vitamin E mix also helps with the hyperpigmentation left after the pimple/zit goes away. If you find the oil-free moisturizer isn&#x27;t moisture enough for the day, try mixing it with another Neutrogena day lotion. I like the moisture for combination skin OR the &#x27;wrinkle free&#x27; moisturizer with Retin-A. The second lotion isn&#x27;t oil free, so I use it on the days my skin feels extra dry.    Anyway, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on here for this product, with a lot of them referring to the dry skin it gives you or saying that after a week or two their faces looked worse...that&#x27;s to be expected!! It takes your skin about 3 months to adjust to a product. Only then can you determine whether or not it&#x27;s working. Please give this a chance...if you decide not to, well...that&#x27;s cool too...more for me!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought his for my teenage daughter, who is allergic to just about anything, and it has worked wonders. Not only does she no longer have breakouts, but her face is smooth and has an even tone and healthy glow. I have even used it on my skin. I always recommend it to anyone with acne issues. Now I am jealous of her beautiful skin. i have to get my own.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve had this product for about 8 weeks now. It was working great the 1st 3 weeks and I was so excited! However, after those 3 weeks it just seemed to stop working despite the fact that I wasn&#x27;t doing anything different. Also, this product has made my pores HUGE! My pores have never been this big or so spread out or so dark. They use to be on my nose and apple of my cheeks but now theyre down and along my cheek bones. I&#x27;m so embarrassed by them.     I would not recommend this just because my bad experience which could happen to someone else (which I would hate), however, everyone is different and from the reviews on here, hey, you might get lucky with this.     Also: Neutrogena was very smart in making the most helpful protect of the 3 the smallest. When I was done with it I still had half my sun protection lotion and half the face wash. Good way for them to make $$$ but bad way to keep customers happy to use their products; I wouldn&#x27;t continue to buy the product at nearly $20 just for one of the items, a 2oz bottle; and then be continue to collect bottles and bottles of the other two. Not cheep and very wasteful.</li>
    <li> This systems works great. I&#x27;ve been struggling for about a year to find something that works. The first week and a half didn&#x27;t show to much progress and I was breaking out still. I told myself I&#x27;d give it a solid 30days after about two weeks of regular use (plus benzoyl peroxide topical cream in problem areas) I&#x27;m acne free for the first time in ages. I still have a few small cystic problems about once a month but they are small enough that they aren&#x27;t a problem.   Not sure about the bleaching comments, I haven&#x27;t noticed that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System for a year now. I had to switch over when I developed a sensitivity to my other acne control system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great and even more effective than the other system. I love that they give a moisturizer, but I regret that there is no toner included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s more affordable than the other products.</li>
    <li> This is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right! Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night. The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> For me personally this product was terrible. I have moderate acne and I was just getting it under control and cleared up so I decieded to quicken the process of clearing my face so I decieded to buy this product. It&#x27;s usually takes me a week or so start seeing improvements or if my acne gets worse. After a week or so I would think my acne should be improving but instead I broke out even more, my face stung, and my face got all red dry and itchy. I do not recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I understand that each person needs to find a product that works with their skin issue. This is my personal experience. This product dried out my skin but did not stop my hormonal acne breakouts. I used it for a full 2 months as directed. My before and after pictures look pretty much the same. I never had acne until about a year ago when I stopped BC. Since then Ive been suffering with ongoing outbreaks. At the year mark of desperation I purchased proactiv. At day 5 my outbreak is already calming down. I think its good to try a couple different reasonably priced items before moving to more expensive ones. Aveeno or Neutrogena did not work for my hormonal acne issues.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this actually works but nothing else does, this product usually dries up my face and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different products within the Neutrogena line for acne and skin care. I will be the first to tell you they didn&#x27;t all work very well for me. A couple actually did more damage than they did good. Drying out my face, giving me painful cracked skin, and in some cases making my acne worse.     This system really did not do much for me other than stopping new acne from forming. And to be honest I stopped using it and really didn&#x27;t even notice much of a difference.  I still use this brand, I just prefer the pads (which I use at night) as they are more gentle on my skin.    I also started using an over the counter acne medication which I am still surprised how well it works to keep my skin clear:  [[ASIN:B00QU3EFXO Acne Treatment Supplement: Top Rated Acne Pills for Women, Men, and Teens - 29 Powerful Acne Fighting Ingredients]].    If you are trying to rid your face of acne I would recommend Neutrogena as a brand still and a good acne supplement that will help clear up and even up the color of the skin.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my teenagers face. Cleared his face about 85 percent. I would buy again...</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this for 3 weeks.  She has had moderate to severe acne starting about 4 months ago.  This product has cleared her skin some, but  she still has a significant amount of acne.  We are going to try it a few more weeks but will probably switch to trying pro active.</li>
    <li> My face got really dry by using this product. And it works just fine.</li>
    <li> If anything my acne was worse. I tried to stick with it, with hope, but....&lt;br /&gt;I was once told by a Dr to use Neutrogena clear bar or Basis for best results and I was excited to see this product by Neutrogena. I will save my money and go back to the bar. I had as good if not better results and no drying, AND its only $3-$4! I do love Amazon and Amazon subscribe and save, this product not so much.</li>
    <li> I am not normally a person to write reviews but when I come across products that really work I have to share the news.  I am 26 years old and have struggled with mild acne for the past 14 years.  I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist and I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Murad and pretty much anything I could get my hands on.  This product really worked.  I use the system faithfully and for the first time in my adult life I have really clear skin.  All three products did dry me out at first so I didn&#x27;t use the night cream every time.  Now I have no problems at all with my skin.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I started seeing results in two days. Love the cleanser, feels like it really gets deep down the pores and exfoliates. The day moisterizer is really light, has 2% salicylic acid, SPF 15 and best of all it smells great. The night moisterizer has benzoyl peroxide so it really works all night to kill the bacteria and deduces the inflamation. But what i love most about this product is that its affordable, it works and when i run out i can just get in my car and get it at target or walmart.             I am glad i tried this product:)</li>
    <li> Yikes, after only two days of using this product my skin was starting to peel! I stopped right away and started to use creams to help soothe the dryness.  I think I will continue to use it maybe like once a week, cause it almost seemed like it was going to help but it did not at all : (  I&#x27;m very disappointed, i&#x27;m glad I still have a TON of proactiv left.</li>
    <li> This system is a great alternative to ProActive, and much more gentle on your skin. I just wish they sold each item separately!!!! If you read this, please sell the bottles separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a returning customer.&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for something cheaper than Proactive and i found it. Does what its supposed to in a very short amount of time!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the results and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> JUST ORDERED SOME MORE .. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> As an avid Proactiv user, I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying another brand. However, Proactiv is very pricey and didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it should. Therefore, I decided to try this Neutrogena system. I love it! I just have to use about a dime-sized portion of each product for coverage, including the soap, so it seems like it&#x27;s going to last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both lotions at first, but it did really dry out my skin, so I cut back to using one at night and the other in the morning. The past few days I&#x27;ve actually just used one lotion at night and nothing in the morning and my skin still looks good! The only thing I miss is using a toner - I felt with Proactiv that the toner really removed any last traces of makeup. However, I&#x27;m getting used to going without that step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a third of the price of Proactiv and came with a coupon for $5 off the next purchase. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> The P brand was fine for a little while but about 6 months in to using it, it stopped, working. According to my doctor that can happen. Very disappointed and desperate I tried this and thought what do have to lose. IT was amazing and now its been 2 years and still going strong. I wont say I never get pimples, its bound to happen, but it really manages my skin so its at least bearable.</li>
    <li> I have acne blemishes and small pimples on my face and after using it for 3 days so far, I noticed the redness is almost gone. My skin is almost a single complexion now. I gave it a 4 star because the SPF lotion was very sensitive on my skin and made me ITCH badly. ONLY the SPF lotion so I dont use it. Otherwise just rinse with the cleanser and apply the acne lotion to affected (and also previously affected) area to prevent recurrence. Works great so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m approaching 50, never in my life have I had such severe acne problems till few months ago. The acne keep on breaking out, rarely did it give me a break for one or two days, that left me with a scarred face, especially on the forehead and the chin. I&#x27;ve tried CVS brand acne cleanser, it did nothing but causing my skin to be flaky so I returned it; days later, after some diligent research, I decided to try out this system, it contains two different medications, so I thought I would be saved. But it&#x27;s been almost a week, no old acne ever wanted to go away while new ones still kept on growing just like before, now my face is all red, irritating and flaky with totally zero results. I guess my acne must be hormone related, if so, cleanser that&#x27;s supposed to kill bacteria probably would not do a thing, I&#x27;d say this Neutragena&#x27;s acne system may not work on adult acne that is caused by hormone changes around menopause. Must stop using tomorrow before I turn into a monster.</li>
    <li> This system works for me and I used to use Proactiv, but I really don&#x27;t like to have to purchase online; with this I can purchase in the store if I run out.  I am black with combination skin and this works well.  I don&#x27;t use the acne lotion twice a day because it can dry out the dry areas of my skin and sometimes I even skip a day if my face feels too dry. I use the face wash and the lotion twice a day, but I only use a small amount of the lotion.  I use a gentle facial wash pad to apply the face wash and I notice that I get better results than if I were to just wash my face without the wash pad.  My daughter found that the product caused her to break out more so I think it is too harsh for her skin type (a little drier than mine)</li>
    <li> I have never had acne during my teenage years. I moved to California about a year ago and boom! I have a breakout almost every week. This acne therapy system works. However, I was not ok with the way it was drying up my face. My face was almost flaky. After my roomie constantly pestered me I have switched to the Clinique Acne Solutions[[ASIN:B001BKLPK2 Clinique Acne Solutions Clear Skin System All Skin Types Travel Size Starter Kit]] and I am glad I did. Again, it costs twice as much but its really gentle on your skin and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I am a former pro active consumer. Note that I say former, because I have found the perfect replacement! I have medium tan skin with occasional Nodular Acne breakouts. Those are the hard extremely painful large bumps under the skins surface. The fact that this treatment system is helping heal such a stubborn type of acne for less than 20 bucks is amazing. As others mentioned it does get your skin a little dry, but what acne medication doesn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it successfully cure stubborn acne within a week but also makes my skin glow and look radiant like it never has before, thanks to the cleanser that does a thorough job at removing dead skin cells. But you have to make sure you massage it in gently for a good 3-4 minutes on all of your face to get impressive results. Oh and NEVER leave your home without applying sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I am 37 years old and I have had acne since the age of 12.  During those 25 years I was unable to find a product that worked this well.  At one time I did consult with a Dermatologist but when I left my job to go to Law School that option was simply too expensive.  I searched for 2 years to find a product that would come close to what I experienced with the prescription products and this one, without a doubt, meets or even exceeds the results I had with the prescription lotions.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and I&#x27;ve had acne of varying severity since I was about 12.  I&#x27;ve tried many different treatments over the years, and while I&#x27;ve never suffered from extremely severe acne, I just can&#x27;t remember a time when I went more than one day without at least one or two zits... and usually I had more. I was affected mostly in my T-zone, but I also have really sensitive skin, so often it felt as though the acne medications I&#x27;d try would only make things worse!&lt;br /&gt;I came across this system and figured it was worth a shot... it&#x27;s only $20 and you don&#x27;t have to sign up for any monthly plan like you do with Proactiv.  And... it really works!!  My boyfriend and I are both shocked by how great it&#x27;s been working.  Every morning, I wake up expecting a new breakout, just like I used to get. But every morning I wake up and it&#x27;s just clear skin!&lt;br /&gt;I began using the system about 3 weeks ago, and I&#x27;d say for about the first week I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going.  My skin seemed to get a bit more sensitive, and my cheeks (where I don&#x27;t have acne, but where I was still using the cleanser) became really dry and a bit red.  I started applying the benzoyl peroxide cream every other night, and only using the cleanser in the morning, using a gentle cleanser (cetaphil) in the evening instead.  I figured that at night the benzoyl peroxide could work while the cleanser in the morning could help during the day?  After a few days of changing my routine like this, my skin calmed down again, only with fewer pimples!  I continued that way for another week, and now I&#x27;m still using the cleanser only once a day (morning) but I&#x27;m using the benzoyl peroxide night cream every night.  It&#x27;s now been about two weeks since I&#x27;ve had a major zit (I have gotten about 2 very small ones, but they went away within a day.. I&#x27;ll take it!!).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... who knows what will work for someone else, but this product was like a miracle for me.  I will say you have to keep using it in order for it to keep working... whenever I have forgotten to put the cream on for a few days in a row the zits definitely do come back.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as an alternative to Proactiv, which I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 years. I thought it would be more convenient since I can buy this system from the grocery store, instead of ordering online. I used it for about two months, and from the beginning, the acne that had been well-controlled on Proactiv came back. I never saw any relief while using the Neutrogena system. Clears acne in 4 days? I think not! I soon went back to Proactiv, which works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Stupidly sensitive skin. And I also have stress-related acne and a very stressful job. I am 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been searching for a solution on-and-off for years and have tried many things including Proactive and Acne Free, both of which worked wonderfully at the cost of having itchy, dry, irritated skin for weeks. I wanted to find something at least a little less irritating. And something that didn&#x27;t have a toner because I find them irritating and drying and I always run out of it too fast. Plus, Witch Hazel (the main ingredient in toners!!!) is only $2 at the drug store for a HUGE bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s system is no exception on the irritation front, but it is much *less* irritating. I had tried it before (maybe 5 years ago) and I was pleasantly surprised to find the face wash bottle has gotten MUCH bigger since I last used the product (in their defense, since I see a lot of complaints about size of the product bottles) but it still smells the same and has the same snotty texture. The acne lotion has a lower percentage of benzoyl peroxide (hence the lower irritation I&#x27;m assuming) than other brands, but the stinging/itch is off-set by the heavier moisturizing of the SPF moisturizer. I, however, try to use a lighter moisturizer (like Simple&#x27;s light moisturizer) during the day because I seem to get a lot of whiteheads when I use it any time other than at night with the acne lotion. It may just be too heavy for my combination, picky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be helping my skin clear, and at a fairly decent pace. I liked having my skin clear up in a few days as it did with other brands that use more benzoyl peroxide, but my poor face can&#x27;t take any more. I&#x27;m really actually pretty happy, and the price was right at about $20. My only major annoyance is that the coupon for a few dollars off that was inside the box was already expired for nearly a year when I got it.</li>
    <li> excellent product, maibe is not perfect, maibe dont kill any acne but is powerfull for control acne. I use for a month and is very nice</li>
    <li> I received this on March 28th and have been using it since, mornings and nights along with the 2-in-1 toner. There has been a HUGE change in my skin. Yes it does take a while but nothing works overnight so patience is a must. My forehead was covered in bumps, pimples, whiteheads, blackheads and even the post acne marks. Although the marks are still visible, they have faded tremendously. If used correctly, it will definitely last. It has been 2 months and I still have enough left for at least another month. Worth the money. I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s better than Proactiv because I&#x27;ve never used it but I highly recommend this product. The only thing is it dries out the face A LOT!  I use another moisturizer along with the one this comes with with an SPF of 40, so make sure you get another moisturizer with a higher SPF.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks. I saw medium results the first week which made me feel super excited; however the next 2 weeks I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.  Because of this, I tried \\&quot;Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash\\&quot; and combine it with \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure Two Part Acne Treatment System\\&quot; and I found that these two products are incredible when used together! I saw big results the first week! Now I have been using them for almost 1 month and my face is almost clear! I only have like 4 small small pimples and before I had my forehead covered with pimples! I highly recommend you to try this combination, but of course keep in mind that what works for me might not work for you!    Good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a week ago.The first couple of days shown real improvement but on the 3rd day when i put on step one it burns my skin.I was afraid to put it on again,it hurt that bad.now i have a rash in two different spots.I might not use it again.i rated it a 3* because it does work but its really hurts.Its well worth it if you have bad acne breakouts.I dont have that many.I only reccomend it if you really need it.</li>
    <li> Summary: Defiantly helped clear up my face. Although I feel it could of done a better job cleaning up my blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The morning acne lotion contains SPF15 which is fantastic since I&#x27;m a pale person who burns easily. I know SPF 15 is not much, but I&#x27;m sure it helps prevent some skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I would of liked if the face cleanser included some type of &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; to help clean out my pores. I feel as though massaging the cleanser(without beads) into the skin, per the instructions, does not do much for pulling dirt/sweat out of the pores.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactive for the past two years, and I liked it, but I wanted to see if I could find a cheaper substitute.  This neutrogena set was a really good combo and kept my face looking good, but after two weeks it started drying my skin out.  I had to incorporate stronger moisturizers to help compensate, and my face broke out in the process.  I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily.  I don&#x27;t think I would suggest this set to people who have a problem with benzoyl perozide because my face had the same reaction to that.</li>
    <li> Where proactive has failed, neutrogena has worked. however, there is a lot of skin peeling and your skin does feel a little more sensitive but over all the product does work for me.</li>
    <li> I GAVE TO MY NIECE I&#x27;M WAITING RESULTS</li>
    <li> It is too dry, but overall it is good. Because it is too dry, I do not use it sometimes. My acne still comes out. So it is hard to say if it works. Honestly, it is better than other products which has nothing to do with my acne.</li>
    <li> I have always used an off brand product similar to Proactive but I thought I would try this since it&#x27;s made by Neutrogena. I would occasionally have bad break outs but most the time I would only have a few small white or black heads, after three days of using this I noticed it was actually making my skin worse not better. I now have a huge pimple about the size of a dime right on my jawbone and it hurts like a motherlover, and what&#x27;s worse is it won&#x27;t go away! I am not ever going to use this or trust their products again. Do not buy this if you unless you like having zits.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than Proactiv and so much cheaper. I am a woman in her 40&#x27;s whose skin decided to turn on me at this stage of the game. Sometimes my acne (around the chin line and nose ) would be horrible I bought this stuff and now my face is clear as a bell a little drying(around the nose area) but nothing moisterizer can&#x27;t help!</li>
    <li> I am still using this product now, and my blackheads are diminishing. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I understand that not every product will work for every individual.  But, this one is far exceeding my expectations.  I did some research online before I bought this.  What I found was that what seemed to work the best for people was a combination of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.  I looked at the wide array of acne treatments I had at home and they were ALL salicylic acid, but no benzoyl peroxide.  I thought it was worth a shot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 35 and acne runs in my family.  My mom still has it.  I was starting to develop very deep, painful acne that would heal in one place and then show up in another place.  Nothing I was doing was getting rid of it.  I found this Neutrogena system and I noticed some improvement the very next day.  I&#x27;m a little over a week into it now and I can&#x27;t believe the improvement!  I&#x27;m going to recommend this product to anyone I know who battles with acne, like I did.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Realistically, I know I&#x27;ll probably still have the occasional breakout.  But this worked wonders on the constant problems I was experiencing before.  One of the things I REALLY like about this, is it&#x27;s only 2 steps.  Wash and moisturize/protect.  I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience for a whole routine with various products.  I love that I just have to wash and apply cream.  Overall I think this is a wonderful product and half the price of Proactiv (which I understand is a 3 step process anyway).</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling clean. I like it.</li>
    <li> In college I used Neutrogena&#x27;s acne stress cream and that worked for my occasional mild acne/breakout, but after college I just broke out like crazy. I was so embarrassed to go out. All I did was stay inside &amp; research acne products &amp; remedies for a whole year. I tried almost everything out there and bought expensive kits to almost every drug store kit available. Some made my acne worse and some worked a little bit, but never cleared my complexion enough. Then finally this kit came out, I tried it &amp; within weeks it cleared my acne! (Although this worked for me, it might not work for everyone else--like any product, you really have to find what will work for you &amp; give you the results you seek.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is you have to consistently use this product otherwise breakouts creep back in if you stop/get lazy. I tried switching to other 1 step cleansers and going with more natural cleansers etc, but they just don&#x27;t work as well, so I always found myself coming back to this kit. Wish they sold individual bottles because I always ran out of the acne control lotion (love it the most/this is the miracle cream, but also the smallest tube out of the kit). On my wedding day, this was my skin&#x27;s life saver-- so thankful I found it a few months before my wedding because it cleared my complexion for the big day. Been using it for 4 yrs now. My husband hates that I always buy this every 2 months, but I can&#x27;t help it--it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me. Good luck!</li>
    <li> the first day i was really scare becouse i was red all my face :S but the next day allready was super clean and earresing acne problems&lt;br /&gt;like 50% , one day !!! and i have 4 day continually and it s the BEST i have and really cheap&lt;br /&gt;im super happy !!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to help with adult hormonal acne, and the reviews made me think the Neutrogena (a great brand) Complete Acne Therapy System would be the best. Unfortunately, for me, it didn&#x27;t do significantly better or worse than any other acne wash, spot treatment, or moisturizer out there. If I used the wash regularly, I did notice my acne was a little better during that time of the month, and the spot treatment, while very drying, wasn&#x27;t as irritating as some other brands. I think my favorite product was the moisturizer, especially for the sun protection it offered, but for the small tube you get, I just don&#x27;t know it it really stands out in a crowd. Also, the tubes for the spot treatment and the moisturizer are exactly the same--even the names are similar. More than once, I went for a big dollop of moisturizer, only waste a ton of the spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have problem skin, I do think you should give this product a try. It&#x27;s a good deal and it&#x27;s nice to get all components of acne treatment in one kit. Same rules for any acne treatment apply: it&#x27;s drying, can be a little irritating, etc. However, for me, it just didn&#x27;t stand out enough for me to buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne all through high school and into college; I&#x27;ve tried numerous acne products (even acutane) and nothing seemed to work... Until I started using this product. The Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System has been the only acne medication that has worked for my skin (my skin is a combination of oily and dry and I tended to break out in the T zone).  Since using this product I have seen significant improvement. I still have minor breakouts from time to time but nothing like before. I did experience a little drying of the skin when I first started using the product so for the first couple weeks I only used it once a day and gradually increased to twice a day; I would suggest anyone with sensitive skin to do this as well. It took about a week after starting the treatment for my skin to clear up, though the pimples were less red after the first couple uses. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and am very pleased with it. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different treatments but I would definetly recommend any one struggling with acne to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Cleared my skin.  Only problem is the dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was extremely worried when Neutrogena decided to end their Skin ID line because it was the ONLY acne skin care system that, &amp;#34;cured,&amp;#34; my acne.  Feeling saddened that I could no longer purchase this personalized acne system, I was desperate to try anything by Neutrogena to keep my skin clear.  After purchasing this system online, I was hesitant about the results that would follow.  My worries and concerns were put to rest however.  This system, when used daily, WORKS!  KUDOS to Neutrogena for delivering another skin clearing system.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.....I tried other kits and Neutragena works on me</li>
    <li> I have tried Proactive before, but that never worked especially well. This Neutrogena system works much better for me.</li>
    <li> Got the item right on time :) I could already seen less pimple appearances after the first night. Amazing compare to crappy doctor prescription stuffs. It does make your face less oily with that special sun lotion. I am Very happy.</li>
    <li> I just bought this about 1 week ago at Target on a whim.  I am impressed with this product.  I have combination skin with severe dryness in the T-zone and around the nose and mouth.  This does not make me peel, as a matter of fact it exfoliates the skin nicely and gently each day revealing more and more beautiful skin every day.  I have noticed a significant change in the appearance of blackheads as well, they are almost completely gone.  This is an excellent product and very easy to keep up with since it is so few steps.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic cleanser.  I also love the day cream.  The night cream caused me to break out in hives.  So I no longer use the night cream and gave it to my teenage son, who swears by the whole system.  I used to spend a lot of money on facials to help me cope with my blackheads.  No more.  I hope this product continues being manufactured, but have my doubts as I could not find it in several drugstores and grocery stores in the Atlanta area.  In the meantime, I am buying a lot of the product, in the unlikely event that it is taken off the market for any reason.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactiv for a while.But it wasn&#x27;t doing the job as good as I hoped.So I bought neutrogena advanced solutions complete acne therapy system where I worked.I said if this don&#x27;t work I was going to the doctor.I tried it and in two days it controlled my very oily skin.Proactiv never done that.My face doesn&#x27;t look like I smeared grease all over it.I couldn&#x27;t believe it.And at a great price.I don&#x27;t have to order it and wait.I can go and get it at any retail store.Way cheaper than proactiv.It cleared my skin in just two days.I understand that it may not work for everyone but it worked for me.I was very pleaseed.Try it.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne (the normal white/black heads) and cystic acne since I was a teenager and am now 25 with not much change.  After trying prescription medications (I refuse to try Accutane) I decided on this product.  I didn&#x27;t like the fact that Proactive was like a monthly subscription since I try to make my products last a long time. I use the day lotion daily and the night one every other night for at least 6 months and am just now running out (great deal for about $20!).  I found it has made my skin much clearer and more even toned.  I still have the occasional breakout and cyst but I am also on antibiotics (minocin) that help tame that as well.  This is by far the best overall \\&quot;system\\&quot; that I have used. It does annoy me that it is prepackaged with all three products together, but I have dealt with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that even though the cleaner has \\&quot;micro-beads\\&quot; my skin wasn&#x27;t getting the exfoliation it needed and I definitely needed something to get rid of the top layer of dead skin cells. I have been using Clique&#x27;s exfoliant (Apricot Scrub would be good too) which is fine as long as I don&#x27;t use it more than once a week. I also noticed that the cleanser seemed to not work after a while and I rotate it with Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapidly Clear cleanser and use the spot treatment for the rare breakout. I tend to have combination skin but do not have the dying out problem that other people have had.  If I do have a dry spot, Clinque&#x27;s Dramatically Different Oil-free lotion is a great quick fix and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Sounds like a lot, but no system by itself is perfect and unfortunately, you do have to experiment.  I would say it took a good month for this to make a positive impact on my skin.  When I slacked off on the regime, my skin did get worse.  You do have to keep it up.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and will dry out with most systems, including Proactiv.  With the exception of AcneFree (which eventually quit working for me) this is the only product that does not irritate my skin and works well.  I use Clinque for all my makeup, but even their systems don&#x27;t do well on my skin.  It&#x27;s also the only product that has even started to help with cleaning the pores on my nose etc.  I love this product. I&#x27;m living overseas and had one location that carried it, they stopped so now I&#x27;m ordering it online...which I won&#x27;t do unless I really love the product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She&#x27;s tried all kinds of products and this one works the best for her, in just a matter of a few days, and it leaves her face looking smooth and fresh - not dry.  I would highly recommend this product before trying anything else.</li>
    <li> The combination of 3 products in package is perfect. My son is getting better with his face and he&#x27;s 14, so very important having a clean face.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product more stars I would. I suffer from adult acne and normally have several breakouts on my jaw line, chin, forehead and cheeks with many of them being the large, sore, cysts...yikes! I have tried AcneFree, ProActiv (on it for 2 years b/c it worked the best of anything but still not fantastic results), recently I picked up Advanced Solutions and 1 week later I had perfectly clear skin. I thought I was going to have to go to a dermatologist but low and behold there is a less invasive answer. You have to give it a good week to two weeks and you HAVE to use all three steps . AWESOME</li>
    <li> My 18 y.o. daughter is pleased that this works better for her than Proactiv.  There was a short time of drying/flaking/mild peeling, but that was followed by clearer skin than she&#x27;s had in a couple of years.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product, works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate acne completely, at least for me, but clears it up significantly. My skin looks better than it has in probably 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry skin out a lot but I just moisturize between treatments (I use Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free moisturizer for combination skin) and it works fine. The overnight lotion is a miracle worker. The day lotion/sunscreen that comes with this works well but tends to leave little white chunks as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products smell mild, not pleasant or unpleasant, just mild, sort of soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great system. I&#x27;d recommend following the directions at first and then afterwards you can adjust it to suit your own skin.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 5th or 6th pack of this stuff, and it works perfectly for my skin, dealing with the mild adult acne that I have been having from time to time. Not a good idea to use if you have sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s great for my combination skin. I have been buying this for myself, for my family members, as well as for my friends. They all love it! Highly recommend this to anyone suffering from skin problems! Might not work if you have anything major, though. so read the ingredients!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different products, and spent a lot of money! I switched from Murad to this product after I continued to break out and was breaking my bank at the same time. I was really skeptical at first, but this works. I rarely have a blemish now and definitely don&#x27;t break out anymore. It&#x27;s worth the 20 dollars and more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and a half and it is working absolutely wonderfully! I started developing mild adult acne (I&#x27;m 25 and I have never had it before! Not fun!) so instead of making an appointment with the dermatologist, I decided to try to find something store bought that would work. This has been perfect! My skin was clear by about the 3rd day or so..I even got my brows waxed, which tends to make me breakout, and nothing! The biggest bonus is that the usual blackheads I get are considerably (visibly) diminished and hopefully will be gone soon. I will say that it tends to tighten and dry my skin after washing it with the cleanser at night, so after using the night lotion, I apply a face cream once the night lotion stuff has dried. This seems to keep my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 40 and my skin leans toward the oily side. My acne seemed to continuously get worse. I have tried almost everything, inclucing seeking the help of a dermatologist. I was very skeptical of this product thought it was for teens, but I am so glad I tried it. The cleanser takes a little getting use to, and so does the consistency of the acne control lotion. Here is a tip especially if you are having a lot of drying. I always add a little water to the acne control lotion it is very thick and this makes it easy to spread a smaller amount over my face without pulling (have to worry about those wrinkles). Don&#x27;t skip the oil free spf lotion. I use all products morning and night; however there are some nights I use my wrinkle creme instead of the oil free lotion, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that. I never bother reviewing products but this one is definitely one I am promoting, because it really made a huge difference for me. I will use this product forever. It works!!</li>
    <li> As it says on the tine excelente</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Tried a month. Nothing happened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since middle school, I am now 22 and still struggle with controlling and treating my acne. I have to say, this is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It works, but only if you&#x27;re constantly using it. My one problem with this system is the two moisturizer. The oil free one makes my face a bit sticky, and the acne control one leaves little areas of dry product on my face. Like other users I also recommend using the acne control lotion at night instead of during the day, just in case what happened to me happens to you. Also, a little cleanser goes a long way. I used maybe a 1/4 teaspoon twice a day and it lasted me 4+ months. I do recommend trying the oil-free moisturizer before throwing it out. It could just be how my face &#x27;s oils react to it, making it sticky.</li>
    <li> Love it definitely see results</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month with very little results. Made my more noticeable pimples go away but left all the smaller ones. I would reccomend paying more money for something that actually works.</li>
    <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t have bad acne, but I decided that I should try it out anyways. The first day I have tried this product I was amazed! It cleared up most of my acne (maybe even all of it) the first day I applied it. I recommend this to anyone who wants something that actually works, even if you have dry skin, sensitive, oily, etc. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin flakey or irrated, NOTHING! Actually, smooth.(: Try this out!</li>
    <li> got for my grandson in lieu of the brand name Proactiv.  He likes the Neutrogena better because it does not dry out his skin so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the girl that&#x27;s tried everything. Another loss.</li>
    <li> Does not work for me and my skin. Dry my skin really bad. I do not like this product at all.</li>
    <li> I recently used this system and experienced immense irritation and drying of my skin. After 2 days of use, even foundation was painful to wear. Then, my skin flaked off in big chunks. I use Neutrogena products such as the On-The-Spot Acne treatment and several moisturizers with no problems. I think that using the 3 products in this system at once can be harmful for sensitive skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure for people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it must work. If you do, try it on just a patch of skin first and not your whole face. The packaging is nice and attractive, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been faithfully using this product for the past month, and I can honestly say that my moderate/mild acne has gotten under control.  I still break out with a zit or two every other week; which is a lot better than when I was using ProActiv, which was about a couple of blemishes and dry, flaky skin every week! But with most acne products, this system can dry out your skin, so use moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about a week ago and I started noticing a difference in my skin after only a day. I am 27 and have been breaking out worse now than when I was a teenager. My entire face was covered and irritated. A week later I can finally say that I don&#x27;t even have one pimple! My skin is usually very sensitive to products, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product. My skin feels smoother than it has in years! I have tried proactiv and several other cleansers, but none ever worked. My search is finally over as well as my acne!! I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy with the results. The difference shows within a few days. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Neutrogena products, so I thought this one would be no different. Boy, was I wrong! After only 2 uses my face, especially my chin and jawline, is completely dried out and itches like crazy. I didn&#x27;t even realize my skin was sensitive until I used this product.</li>
    <li> I do love it! My skin is so clear, that I still am amazed. I bought it in store on sale, I thought it was wirth a shot. Few months earlier i purchased Aveeno Clear Complexion (no fragnance, natural...) I thought I made a good choice, but I was so mad- my face started to get worse and worse- meaning more pimples. I did not wanted to throw away the product, so I used the whole bottle, but all the time I was using it- I can say that product did not help at all, made it just worse every week... I also used Proactive in past and it did not really help...    First day I started using Neutrogena my pimples were reducing... I have been using it for two weeks now, and even if I get a pimple- I put acne lotion on it and it get better next day. There is only one little complain- my skin is very dry after washing it with cleaning solution, and after applying lotion, it still is a little dry, so I additionally purchased Neutrogena Oil Free moisturising lotion, and my skin feels really nice after that.     Overally I am very satisfied. I&#x27;m 25 years old and I don&#x27;t remember when my face was so clear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with constant but moderate adult acne since age 23 (I&#x27;m now 28).  Proactive did not work, it made my skin worse, and an expensive prescription cream made my skin red and peely, and contributed to visable wrinkles due to the drying. Clinique&#x27;s 3-step made my skin not as bad, but I&#x27;d still have zits all over. I&#x27;ve used this system for 1 month, my skin has NEVER been better (even during &#x27;that&#x27; time of the month)!  This product cleared whiteheads, blackheads, and those awful, deep zits all over my face and neck in 3 days flat without drying my face out. Now, for the first time since I was 19, I&#x27;m going without foundation or concealor and spending a lot less time getting ready in the morning.  You should shake the face wash every time before using, the beads of exfoliant float to the top of the tube if you store it upright.  I only use the wash at night, so as not to over-exfoliate, and Cetaphil in the mornings.  The kit should last me 2 months, and all 3 products look like they&#x27;ll run out at the same time.  This system is worth more than $10 a month! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> It works like a charm for those people with minor acne problems.  Otherwise, you should seek doctors&#x27; advice.  For the price you paid, it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> it works really well on my skin . You have to be patient because it take time to get your skin clean&lt;br /&gt;and healthy. It works on me and I probably buy another therapy system .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months now and I&#x27;ve tried different skin care products in between and always revert back to this one. I would recommend to put the first lotion on immediately after washing your face with the cleanser, then waiting about 1-2 minutes before putting the second lotion on. I didn&#x27;t do this for the first month I had this kit and I kept getting fakes. So waiting 1-2 minutes between applying the lotions prevents flakiness! Also, the one bad thing about this product is that it makes your skin kind of oily as the day goes on, so I would recommend using a Neutrogena toner halfway through the day.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, this product beats ProActiv big time.  I didn&#x27;t think it would since ProActiv is so popular nowadays.  I bought ProActiv a while back and it was not a pleasant experience.  My skin burned, itched, turned red.  And on top of all that, it was abnormally dry [shocking because I&#x27;ve never had dry skin in my life]. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I desperately needed something to get rid of my acne [which was located mostly on my forhead area] ... ProActiv was terrible, as I mentioned before.  So I decided to buy Neutrogena Advanced Solutions, and this was the best decision ever.  I noticed results as soon as 2-3 days.  My acne is all gone now.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  Since I don&#x27;t have enough time in my schedule, this product was great.  It&#x27;s only 2 steps, whereas ProActiv was 3.  My skin is great right now, I love it!! I totally recommend this product.  You may be wondering why I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars, the reason is because it DID cause a bit of dry skin, but it is not severe, it went away by itself.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after 2 years of paying so much for proactiv. I read that it was better. But after four weeks of using it, my face looks terrible. I have acne all around my mouth and forehead. It dried my face out a little but only in certain spots. I was really hoping this would work. I looks like I will keep paying high dollar for proactiv.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter and it worked well to clear an unusual outbreak due I think to stress of college.</li>
    <li> Acne is multi-factorial based problem especially for teenagers. There can be multitudes of reasons why one gets it. One of the main cause is obviously ignoring one&#x27;s health and beauty routines. The secondary cause from what I learnt over the years is the fact that your pillow can accumulate various contaminants especially from your hair &amp; oil or simply because of build-up of barely noticeable to the naked eye&#x27;s growth of harmful bacteria on your pillow cover from the build-up. What I have understood is that If you put a clean towel every-night where you face skin comes in contact with your pillow cover it can minimize the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter has frequent breakouts and she has tried various products to combat her breakouts fiasco. She is extremely conscious about the issue and is seen to attempt to keep her face clean, washes her face twice daily with [[ASIN:B001U0OQN6 Clearasil Daily Face Wash]] the key ingredient being &#x27;Salicylic Acid&#x27; but now and then the breakouts happen and she feels upset about the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each individual skin is different, Acne treatment product might work like miracle for one while might completely fail for another with same symptoms. Having said, This product&#x27;s complete package for Acne treatment did give her a &#x27;confidence&#x27; boost and I do see positive effect on her skin. The reason could be the fact that it has Oil-Free Day Lotion with SPF 15 and anything that keeps oil off your face is a good thing! - I am not saying that the pimples are gone! but sure looks minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product from a reputable company. Worth trying.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has severe red inflamed acne with break outs covering her entire face.  It was no help.  Perhaps it would work if you only have a mild case of acne.</li>
    <li> I waited a while before I wanted to review this item.  I purchased this three months ago and have been using this product.  I knew I should give this product enough time to start working, but after 3 months and I am still having lots of breakouts I am done.  What is worse is that this product made my skin so dry that it was flaking, which is more embarrassing than the acne!  I bought oil of olay moisturizer just to help give added moisture as the kit&#x27;s lotion was not enough.  Even with the added moisturizer my skin was still so dry and flaking and I was putting tons on.  I have tried lots of treatments, but am going to go back to proactiv because at least it worked even if it is more money.  Every day I have new acne appearing so Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy&#x27;s System did NOT work for me.  I am disappointed I wasted so much time and even decided to buy this kit.</li>
    <li> Dried my face out horribly</li>
    <li> This did not clear my skin. I used it religiously for a month and a half. Also, it is uncomfortable once you&#x27;ve put on both creams. Proactive works much better and feels very nice on your skin. Ultimately, none of these products work, they are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth</li>
    <li> Worth the money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase this acne care system trying to prevent breakouts and clear up my skin. Ive tried proactiv and it works but it take a very LONG time to see results. Ive started using this product and (just as it says) YOU GET RESULTS WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK. And one box is a 2month supply and I believe it! why? because after using this product continuously, your skin will dry out and peel so you can lay off it for a few days and then use it every other day or every 2-3 days. I got great results with this product and I will be a regular customer for now on. The only thing that would make this EVEN BETTER than proativ is if this set came with a darkspot/blackhead removal cream. Everything on the box is TRUE! (no im not paid to say this, I rarely even take the time out to write reviews.) What I love MOST about this product, is that even if you have an unexpected bump/pimple appearing on your face, you can just use this product and it will calm down overnight or the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is that it really dries out your face if you use it too much. But, this product works for people who have naturally oily skin like me.</li>
    <li> I started using Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy from Jan 2015 and since then only once I see breakout on my face. Now my face is very clean and truly I recommend this product use at least once, I am sure you will never stop using this product. Do not miss to apply night cream, I feel this is the one which is controlling breakouts during night time.</li>
    <li> Great product I am so happy because I can show my clear face thanks neutrogena.i think this product better than proactive</li>
    <li> This product was way too drying. I have tried other acne products as well with the same results. Dry, red, irritated skin. My skin is normal, not oily, and I live in the southwest, very dry climate. Maybe that&#x27;s why none of these products work for me.  :-(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a terrible allergic reaction to the new formulation of Acne Free&#x27;s face wash (red and white scaly, painful, cracked \\&quot;skin goatee and mustache). First off, I dislike this product very much. AcneFree was very effective in removing the acne, but it just about removed the entire top layer of my facial skin along with it! This Neutrogena line is highly inneffective. The face wash is SO thick, that when you squeeze it into your hands it comes out in a solid ball of product. Rubbing the hands together to liquify it is futile. Secondly, there is a day face lotion. What is the purpose of this? This product contains so little salicylic acid that I could not imagine it drying the skin out. Replace that with a toner, please. Lastly, there is a nighttime treatment. It works a little, and is more convenient than the other products... but I just will not be buying this again. Maybe other products from Neutrogena are great; but this one was a mistake for me to purchase.</li>
    <li> First impression: lots of perfume in the products.  Dried the face, gave rough patches on the sides of my cheeks.  Got rid of blackheads, but that was all.  Did not prevent cystic acne.  Got rid of average pimples by drying harshly, and many more returned in its place.  I used for 1.5 months before giving up.  I&#x27;m going back to a less harsh routine, which is probably better for my face anyway.  I feel this product made acne worse.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a little over two weeks and so far the results have been terrible. I did the entire system and followed the directions exactly yet after every wash my skin was dried out and stripped of it natural oils. I now have dry patches on my cheeks and chin and I still have acne on my forhead. I tought maybe it was the acne control lotiona that was the problem so I reduced my usage but the cleanser is just as bad, after washing my face and putting on moisturizer the dry patches did not subside. Do NOT waste your money, I am a young African American female with combination skin so I suggest for people in the same boat as I am to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after I saw a TV commercial about it. The selling point for me was that a young man on there said that it did not dry out his skin or make his skin red or irritated. I have tried several different products for my mild acne but almost all of them dried out my already dry skin. This product comes with great lotion that makes my skin feel great. I am 26 and still experience at least 3 pimples on my face at a time. I have tried proactive in the past but besides the fact that I could not stand the smell of proactive, it also dried out my skin. After the first week or so of using this product I still had some visible acne, but I have been using it for about 3-4 weeks now and my skin looks the best it has in a couple of years. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It worked okay, it dried out my face a lot and made my forehead look weird. I used it for about a month and then when my acne cleared I switched to something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was sick of paying for Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;The face wash does not have the exfoliating beads or whatever in it, so its not like a scrub like Proactiv is.&lt;br /&gt;There is no Toner with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;There are two lotions with this instead of one. The first is an acne lotion and it feels sorta sticky when it starts to dry. I usually wash my hands after applying. The second is like a normal oil-free lotion and the face doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after applying just a little of this.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since the switch (2 weeks ago), so it seems to be working just as well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only products that actually works and keeps my skin from breaking out in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, some facts about this user:&lt;br /&gt;Female, late 30s, combination skin, gets nasty breakouts on chin right before period. Good times. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a bit of a drying effect. That&#x27;s normal with these types of products. But that will be lessened if you DON&#x27;T use a HUGE amount of the cleanser or the benzoyl peroxide lotion at a time! That stuff should be used sparingly. It&#x27;s like any other medication: Don&#x27;t overdose on it! More is not better! I only use it once a day, in the morning, so that it doesn&#x27;t become too irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I notice when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Overall skin clearing and better evenness of color.&lt;br /&gt;--Lightening of skin spots and old blemishes (benzoyl peroxide is responsible for that).&lt;br /&gt;--One particularly nasty zit has begun to heal, shrink, and the dead skin around it has lifted up and peeled away. Good riddance!&lt;br /&gt;--Finer skin texture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and have normal skin, not sensitive, not oily.  I was using Skin ID for the last 6 years or so, and it worked GREAT.  Since they recently discontinued it, I had to find a different product that worked on my skin. Proactive didn&#x27;t work.  The products Neutrogena recommended (that had the same active ingredients as my SkinID regimine) didn&#x27;t work.  This, however, has held its own against my skin with no problems.  I haven&#x27;t had a single new pimple since I started this regimine.  I was getting those gross, deep below the skin pimples that never seemed to come to head or heal.  They just sat there being big, sore, and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash once in the morning and once at night.  In the morning only I apply a tiny bit of the Acne Control lotion to my trouble spots (T-zone, cheeks, and chin), and use the Oil Free lotion everywhere else.  I let it dry for a couple minutes and then apply makeup normally.  I don&#x27;t have any of the problems other users have mentioned (dryness, flakeyness) and the Acne Control lotion doesn&#x27;t seem mask-like to me at all, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
    <li> So far no more breakouts, I am finally confident of a product that truly works. It&#x27;s a great system for sure. I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I was wanting an acne system that was cheaper than ProActive, but got the job done eventually...it took about 2 1/2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it took a lot longer than two weeks, but maybe it is because of the reaction that I had to the face wash &amp; lotion. I noticed on the bottle that it said use the system once daily, but I had to start using it every other day because the system would really dry my face out. By &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, I mean itchy and dried out, but not peeling or anything like that. The itchiness of my face is what annoyed me the most, so I had to cut back on the treatment to every other day like I previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearing up, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel healthy/smooth/soft, it just feels dry. I wouldn&#x27;t use this treatment for daily use, but eventually it got rid of my pimply/zitty breakouts. I would like to find something more gentle on my skin that works faster.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena is just perfect for acne. It dries the pimples very fast.</li>
    <li> I think this system works for me. I use it twice every day and I feel my acne is in better condition than I previously recall.</li>
    <li> My skin: Combination. I get mild to low-moderate (depending on my diet / hormonal cycle) breakouts in random spots all over. Face only. No cystic or heavy acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Salicylic Acid face wash: Even when used as seldom as only once every 3 days, this still dries out my face and causes it to be flaky. It also causes new acne eruptions the day after I use it, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Benzoyl Peroxide acne cream: The texture bothers me - it&#x27;s slimy and sticky feeling. I feel like there&#x27;s a film on my face after I put it on. This feeling does not fade after time. The face feels a bit stiff for as long as the cream is on, even once it&#x27;s &amp;#34;soaked in.&amp;#34; It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective. After a month of consistent use, my face is broken out in the same spots, the same amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The SPF-15 oil-free lotion: It smells like sunscreen and leaves my face looking a bit oily and shiny. I have other oil-free noncomedogenic (and similarly priced) facial sunscreens and moisturizers that I prefer.</li>
    <li> It did not help me at all, i felt like it broke me out even more.. but everyones skin is different.</li>
    <li> These products have worked wonders on my daughters facial break-outs.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes it!</li>
    <li> You can see the results immediately, use solar protection if you apply it at day. the kit is durable and I recommended.</li>
    <li> Cleared off most of my acne, made my skin softer, smells good, very easy to use, incredibly fast to see the results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month. Besides for a general drying out of my skin, this product has not given me any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any, my face has more pimples and whiteheads than before. I&#x27;m so surprised- I always thought Neutrogena is a good company. The 2-step system here is faster to apply than Proactiv- and cheaper too- but what&#x27;s the point, if you can&#x27;t get rid of the acne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this combo, but I feel like you really have to add in a toner in order to exfoliate the dead cells off; otherwise, the regimen does not work.</li>
    <li> Just by using it for 2 days and my skin becomes smooth &amp; removing the acne in fast action better than ProActive</li>
    <li> It dried my skin so bad and it my my acne worse.</li>
    <li> I still believe what I wrote previously, below.  I just want to comment that a lot of the negative reviews are the result of misuse and misunderstanding.  Please keep in mind, any new product will affect your skin differently and may seem harsh.  It takes a while to adjust; a few days aren&#x27;t enough.  And increased blemishes at first can be the result of this product bringing the proto-blemishes to the surface, after which you will likely have much better skin.  It&#x27;s not going to work for all skin types, but I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s been great for me.    *****************************  I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe 8 years.  A number of months ago I guess I thought I needed a change and so switched to another high-end skin product.  After a few weeks my skin was getting worse and worse, and surprisingly it took me a while to realize that the cause was not using this product.  So I started again and my skin improved right away.  My only complaint is that I run out of the three tubes at different times, so wish I could by them separately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this acne system for a long time now, and my acne has not gotten better. I finally realized that the moisturizer makes my face break out terribly. I&#x27;ve decided to finally call it quits and move onto a skin care regimen that produces results.</li>
    <li> I used it for several weeks on my facial acne and was disappointed.  I saw no improvement and found this product to be just another box of broken hopes and promises.  I am still looking for something to help.</li>
    <li> This is the only set that helps my adult acne!!!!! dont forget to add the toner.</li>
    <li> I am 27 and have oily skin prone to a a little bit of acne.  I always was looking for something that would prevent my acne, but still provide me spf protection without giving me oily skin (I don&#x27;t like going out without sun protection, but HATE that my face gets so shiny).  Well, i found it!  i liked that 1.  It&#x27;s cheap for all three things.  2.  it works very well.  My face has dramatically cleared.  Not just that, i dont have anything new popping up too.  Only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the excessive dryness/flaking.  Actually, I added on [[ASIN:B001P97TI6 Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting Concentrated Night Serum - 1.0 oz.]](a retinol cream with vitamin C and Soy) at nighttime to help with the flaking and take away discoloring i have a little bit of from my old acne.  i found that my regimen that works for me is  using benzoyl peroxide cream twice daily after washing (i do skip the benzoyl peroxide on the days that i feel is too dry).  I use the spf lotion every morning.  and i use the night cream i bought also at night.  i really liked the combo.    Also for your background, i have tried Origins (found it didn&#x27;t work as well, and my skin was still oily, Plus it&#x27;s expensive, aveeno spf lotion (too oily), eucerin daily lotion with spf 30 (it was okay, but i was missing the acne treatment component), Murad (too expensive and didn&#x27;t help with oilyness, just helped with acne).</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that it has only been about 3 weeks, but the product seems to be working. From the first week I saw a difference. The lotion keeps breakouts at bay and coupled w/ moisturizer my face feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it continues, as the results so far have been better and more consistent than Proactiv.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about using any other products but Proactive&#x27;s system. Proactive really helped clear away a lot of my blemishes and scars and really made my skin perfect. After 2 years of not using it, I started breaking out like when I was in high school again and so I bought this product over the counter. It was cheap enough to risk and try it out. So far my face is clearing up nicely, unlike other products I have used (no thanks clean and clear). Any who, I only have one negative about this product and it&#x27;s that it dries your face up pretty quickly if you use to much of the acne killing bottle, but I just balance it out with a bit of moisturizer. Specifically L&#x27;Oreals \\&quot;Active Daily Moisture Lotion\\&quot;. SO if you cant get your hands on Proactive&#x27;s system or looking for a cheap alternative, this is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have bad acne, but it&#x27;s certainly persistent, and this treatment has certainly helped a lot. I seem to build up medical immunities pretty fast, so I have to use multiple systems at a time, alternating by day or morning/evening or whatever works. Last week I switched to Clean and Clear in the morning and this system at night and it&#x27;s been very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment is a good, cheap solution for others who are cursed with teenager-ism and is wayyyyy cheaper than prescription acne medications.</li>
    <li> Best treatment I&#x27;ve used yet! This is a holy grail for me. It has immensely contributed in making my complexion better! I bought this with the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-1 Acne Treatment and they have both been amazing! Definitely repurchasing !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  work for me after use during 3 days it starts to burn my face.</li>
    <li> The cleanser its very good, since it leaves your skin very soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The acne treatment actually works!!! It reduces the redness and It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen protector is perfect for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper for sure!</li>
    <li> For me, I never really used skincare products actively. I have one of the oil-free acne washes from Neutrogena but I never used it everyday. The other day I saw my acne was EXTREMELY angry and red on my forehead and chin, so I went out and bought this. The product is well priced if you&#x27;re shopping in the right place; here it is cheap but on the website it sells for $25. I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week and my forehead isn&#x27;t red anymore! Most of my acne has gone away. The acne lotion leaves my skin feelings super smooth and clean. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is my skin has been a little bit oily since I started using the wash. Other than that, I highly suggest getting this!</li>
    <li> it is not for oily skin should not be used in frying days after sun may see spots on the face I have very oily skin sometimes appear acne product I may not come due to the fact that we now have a summer in the street is very hot after peroxide of benzene in the morning as if you tan made</li>
    <li> Things were going very well with a different cleanser, [[ASIN:B001E96MLW Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, Power-Clear Scrub, 4.2-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]], but I was running low on moisture lotion so I decided to buy this kit.  I figured it&#x27;s Neutrogena so it must be good.  It turned out to be a big mistake.  Over the last several days I&#x27;ve used the face wash in this kit, and the pores on my forehead are so irritated they look like craters, and there&#x27;s a red tone.  I think this formula is too powerful for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne control lotion (step #2 in the kit) looks sort of like moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not.  It is only something you would use as needed to control breakouts.  This part is fine, and the moisture lotion with SPF is fine too.  The only problem I have is with the cleanser.  It has a gritty texture like fine sand particles.  If I had some big blemishes on my skin, that is probably the last thing I would want to put on my face.  If your skin is already broken out, why would you want to cleanse it with something that feels like an exfoliant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For evening I like a one-step makeup removal/cleansing process, and this does not meet that need.  I prefer the [[ASIN:B001E96MLW Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, Power-Clear Scrub, 4.2-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]].  It is smooth, does the job well, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean...not irritated.  (And by the way, I don&#x27;t consider my skin to be sensitive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an aside, if you&#x27;re looking for an entire cleansing system, I would recommend [[ASIN:B000FBNV1Y Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Acne Treatment System with Oligopeptide-10, (1 acne treatment system]].  I used this system and can honestly say it&#x27;s the best thing I have found to date.  The only problem I had with Nature&#x27;s Gate was when I ran out of the cleanser I still had a lot of the moisturizer remaining, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay to buy all three products yet.  I could not find a listing for just the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this Neutrogena system two stars, rather than one, because I realize that not all of our needs will be the same, and this product may work for other people.her than one, because I realize that not all of our needs will be the same, and this product may work for other people.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with acne until I was about 18.  Now I&#x27;m 22, and have had embarrassing acne since.  It made me feel self-conscious all the time, whether it was at work, at college, or at parties.  I hated it whenever my boyfriend got close to my face.      I tried every product I could afford and visited a dermatologist several times.  I&#x27;ve tried creams, overnight gels, face washes, antibiotic pills, you name it.  The treatments I tried either did nothing significant or made my skin very irritated and worsened the condition.  I have very sensitive skin so I couldn&#x27;t use most of the treatments prescribed to me from the dermatologist.    I had finally given up and told myself I would just have to settle with having bad skin. I felt totally helpless.    My mom ended up sending me this product, which I was embarrassed about at first.  But let me tell you, I can&#x27;t thank her enough because I&#x27;ve used this system for about a month now and I am basically a new person.  My skin is completely clear like it hasn&#x27;t been for years. I&#x27;ve experiences NO irritation whatsoever.  I can&#x27;t say what it does in the long run,  but so far it has worked wonders.    I get comments all the time from friends and family on how good my skin looks.  In just 2 days my skin felt and looked better, and now I don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup.  I&#x27;m so much more confident.      I highly recommend this system!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m am a 14 year old girl who started getting acne at the age of 10, during the (short and not so great) 4 years I have tried a great variety of acne products, including Proactive and things the Dermatologists (two different Doctors) have proscribed. When I started using Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System two things happened. 1) I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts. 2) My skin never dried out. Even with the products the Doctors gave me I dried out like crazy!! But with this my acne hasn&#x27;t flared up.   It&#x27;s also great because now if I forget my lotion and go to a friends house and then come home and use it the next night I don&#x27;t break out like I did with other things.  I think Neutrogena rocks!!!! But like all products it might not work for all people, but it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin (oily in the T-zone) suffered from acne throughout high school, and enlarged pores since college. I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, and I&#x27;m on my fifth set of this system. LOVE IT! For the first time, I no longer have to wear concealer or foundation - my skin is almost completely clear, and my pores are visibly smaller. And I no longer have to powder my nose in the middle of the day.     The cleanser can be a little drying with twice a day use, but I find that extra moisturizer really helps to balance that out, and the results are worth it.     Also, Amazon&#x27;s price is significantly cheaper than any store I&#x27;ve come across, so will purchase from here in the future.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother who is 65 and has been having trouble with acne and other sores on her face for a few years. She loves the stuff its cleared her face up remarkably. In fact my niece who just turned 14 uses it too and it keeps her face clear as well. So now i buy it monthly for both of them. Very good product much better and less expensive than a certain pro active product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I use it twice for morning and evening, it&#x27;s very useful products. the breakout disappear during two days which is a very good time.</li>
    <li> It works better than the antibiotic given by the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing acne from excersizing more frequently. I ordered this skincare set to remedy the situation. It has been working great, my skin has cleared up, and I no longer feel like a puebescent teenager. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not effective with mild acne</li>
    <li> Based on past good experience with Neutrogena products, I bought this for my wife. After several days&#x27; use she had what appeared to be an allergic reaction to it. Unfortunately, I allowed more than 30 days to pass before attempting to return it and so we&#x27;re stuck with it. I hope others have better success with the system.</li>
    <li> I have used some Neutrogena face wash products, but after a recent breakout, they no longer proved effective. I bought this system and within two applications I noticed a big difference in how clear my skin was. The key to the system is the middle step, the acne control lotion. This stuff leaves a dry, tingly &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; on your face. Keep away from fish tanks and oceans! Yes, it is that dry. But it&#x27;s been very effective, clearing up my face and controlling new breakouts. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so quickly, either. The minuses are few- I didn&#x27;t find the system effective at all on blackheads, although nothing I&#x27;ve tried has helped those. Also, the product caused discoloration/bleaching of my pillowcase while I was sleeping, so use an old one or stick with a white one. I can definitely live with all of that for something that works this well.</li>
    <li> Large enough bottles to last me at least three months, especially the cleanser. Dried my skin out when I used it twice day, but I was fine when I switched to once a day. Normally I have oily skin but it&#x27;s very balanced now. No breakouts since I started using it! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have serious acne but I had a pretty bad breakout mainly on my cheeks when I ordered this. I LOVE the cleanser! It really refreshes and soothes the skin and it feels completely clean after you use it. But the salicidic acid on the little bottle did not cleared it, it just kind of made it look presentable. But I continued to get pimples. The oil-free moisturizer it&#x27;s really good but it just has SPF 15 and for me it&#x27;s not enough, I use them with SPF 30 or higher. This products helped me get on track but it really didn&#x60;t do much for me. I recommend you to look if your skin responds to salicilic acyd or benzoyl peroxide best because that will be really important when you decide to buy or not this product. My skin is tamed with benzoyl peroxide! That said this Neutrogena system is kind of light for me.</li>
    <li> This product helps me to reduce my breakout very quickly. It dry out all my pimple withing 2 days.</li>
    <li> My son uses this product and he seems to like it better than the other similar products on the market.</li>
    <li> I have a moderate acne problem, nothing too serious, but still embarrassing enough on a man of my age that I feel a need to do whatever I can to get rid of it. My sister recommended using this acne therapy system on my face to get rid of my pimples, so I figured I would give it a shot and try it. I actually used it for a full two weeks before making an informed decision about its success and I&#x27;ll have to say, not the most successful.    It&#x27;s a good product, definitely, but I was still missing the deep cleaning and acne prevention I was looking for. I went online and found [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]], which had great reviews for exactly the sort of cleaning I was looking for. I started using this as an exfoliator two times a week, concurrently with the Neutrogena system, and I saw much better results! My acne stopped forming as much and the existing acne minimized and there was a lot less redness on my face. I think the mask helped because the sulfur and tea tree oil work as a deep clean and as a preventative measure for future acne.    Satisfied with the results I even ordered the same company&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)]], which I read was good for spot treatments and BONUS--I also found info online that I could use it to help with razor bumps for shaving, which is like, a life saver for me. I think the Neutrogena is a really good product, it just needs to be used with other things, which is why I give it four stars rather than five. I recommend all of these products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually have bad acne but for the past 3 months after going off of birth control my face just got worse and worse.  This stuff worked fast and cleared up my skin.  It was great because I tried other things that cleared some areas but left the worst areas (side of my for forehead above my eye brows and my chin) seemingly untouched :(!  Apparently it can be harsh for people with really sensitive skin though.</li>
    <li> I was leary at first because my face was in rough shape. I have a high stress noon and got Shingles this year. But, for the price I bought it. And wow! The first few days my skin dried out a bit and was sore from the scrub but by day 3, it made a difference. My skin is smother and is glowing. Last night at my work Christmas Party I was so comfortable for the first time in months because my skin and makeup went on flawless! This IS worth the buy! I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and other acne treatments and this is better! I would suggest tho, buy Neutrogena&#x27;s make up wipes to pair with. They rock!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted a kit of acne treatment so I thought neutrogena would be a good choice because I love their other products. The acne wash which is a cream feels strange and I used it for two weeks straight and it made no diffrence. Ive had the same results with the control lotion, next to none. The last of the three is just a lotion for acne prone skin, it does nothing to control it. Clean and Clean and Clinuque control lotions and gels are much more powerful.</li>
    <li> This works so well.  My daughter uses this and it is the only product that keep her acne at bay.  Although she still has flair ups.</li>
    <li> Ive used neutrogenas skin id for years, since its no longer available I started searching for a new product. I was worried since ive been battling acne since I was nine, and skin id has been the only thing to work for me since I stopped going to the dermatologist. But this product is even better! With one use I saw a major difference! And its cheaper then skin id!! Ill definitely be stocking up on this product!</li>
    <li> At half the price and better results than ProActiv, this is a no-brainer.  We&#x27;ll be buying it and using it again.</li>
    <li> My teenage sons use this and it works very good!  Helps keep acne away!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find any other acne treatment that works as well as this system.  My only complaint is that you cannot buy the three bottles separately (it always seems like one bottle runs out before the others).  I highly recommend despite this as it keeps my skin clear.</li>
    <li> I like it better than Proactive. Smells better too.  It&#x27;s a really good anti-acne OTC product.  My dawgs, use this, its a lot less expensive than that stuff those two millionaire dermatologists are hawking.  Thanks my dawg.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and my face has been breaking out more frequently. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but when I break out I get pretty bad blemish spots for a period of time. I have tried everything like washing pillow cases multiple times a week, washing my hair brush, switching make-up. Nothing has helped. I&#x27;ve even paid a dermatologist hundreds of dollars for prescription medications that really don&#x27;t work.     Today is Monday. I bought this product on Friday and started using it that night. My face is already notably brighter and clearer. 90% of my blemishes have already disappeared. I even noticed these last 3 days that my face isn&#x27;t near as oily during the day as it used to be.    ONLY WARNING: Be very careful when using the cleanser and acne control lotion around your eyes. I was very careful not to get it near my eyes, yet I still had some irritation on the outside corner of my eye. I used a little Curel original formula lotion (any non-scented lotion) on it, though, and it cleared up. If you have sensitive skin or skin that dries out easily I would also use some type of night moisturizer (I use Neutrogena&#x27;s light night cream).</li>
    <li> I love this product! There is a little bit of dryness but not nearly as much as other products. I am very happy with the price and how well it works!</li>
    <li> ...you can&#x27;t buy the products separately.  I particularly like the acne control lotion.  It keeps my skin from becoming oily.  I was surprised to see that there was no astringent in this system</li>
    <li> I am a teenager with very frustrating combination skin and I have gone to a dermatologist multiple times with no success. I picked this up at target and tried it. I&#x27;ve gone through two and am still waiting for results. The acne control lotion dries out my skin more than the repair lotion can, well reapair. I love nitrogen but this disappointed me greatly</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this system after the rave reviews I&#x27;ve read on Amazon.  But it has done nothing for me except alternately dry my skin and make it greasy.  The salicylic acid cleanser is terrible - it makes my face feel tight and dry, and woe to anyone who gets in on her lips!  And the SPF day lotion might be oil free, but it caused my skin to overproduce oil like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  The worst part is that instead of clearing up my breakout, it just seems to have made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product.  I&#x27;ll know to stick with PanOxyl from now on.</li>
    <li> This works! My son has severe, long term acne and this has GREATLY improved his skin, without totally drying it out. He has tried many products and this is the best so far. Priced right too. He uses the On The Spot treatment with it. (Recommend this spot treatment) We saw improvement within 2 weeks. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Although did not show any effects within the first two days as advertised, it has cleared my skin significantly especially on the face. not as effective on pimples on the back or chest area as suggested by another reviewer. Good buy though.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s tough to review a product like this because whether something works seems very dependent on what type of skin you have - it&#x27;s specific to the person.  To help out, I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m in my 20s and I have oily/combination skin.  I&#x27;d developed acne as an adult (didn&#x27;t really have pimples as a teen) and had used prescription creams last year (Epiduo and an oral antibiotic).  The prescription medication worked really really well, cleaned up the worst of it, but was expensive and fairly harsh (I couldn&#x27;t wax my eyebrows for example).  I was looking for something milder and over-the-counter.  I&#x27;ve been using the acne system for 3 weeks now.  It did not work within 2 days for me.  In fact, at first, all it seemed to do was make parts of my face turn red and peely.  I followed advice and began using the acne cleanser about 2-3 per week (rather than the daily, as directed) and used the acne lotion every other day.  The redness has gone away and my skin has cleared up and really looks great.  Hopefully it will continue to work.  So that&#x27;s my advice - give it time, and don&#x27;t be afraid to use it a little less to spare your skin.  And remember to be careful with the lotion as it will bleach your clothes and hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed I was really hoping this would work for me.  I dont mind the dryness but the acne control lotion caused an itchy rash on my face and left new dark marks on my neck.  I must be allergic to the benzoyl peroxide or it&#x27;s just too strong because my face is puffy and itchy and I only used a tiny amount.  So sad I wasted my money and irritated my pores at the same time!</li>
    <li> Good product, not oily!&lt;br /&gt;Is the best you can get for that price!&lt;br /&gt;The sunblock lotion is not so good but the other 2 lotions are great!</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t work miracles, but for the money this is a quality product that compares favorably to more costly options.</li>
    <li> Okay, listen. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, even though I base most of my shopping life decisions on them. Selfish, I know. But this calls for some reform. For whatever reason, my ever perfect skin decided to take a turn for the worst sometime around my 30th birthday. Go figure. I&#x27;m going to blame hormones, since I&#x27;ve ruled out every other possibility. I started having major breakouts in the last few weeks, enough that I didn&#x27;t even want to put on makeup simply because it just made it look worse, and I am a makeup JUNKIE. Enter Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System. I recall using this once before, probably preemptively (since my skin hasn&#x27;t even been THIS bad), and discontinued use shortly thereafter. I did notice some mild improvement over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get to the point here. THIS STUFF WORKS. I received my shipment in the mail on Wednesday and it&#x27;s now Friday. The breakout is 75% gone, hands down! I mean, within 48 hours I managed to get rid of nearly all blemishes on my face. Of course there will be some long-term care to get rid of acne spots and hyperpigmentation, but when it comes to clearing acne, I&#x27;ll never look any further than this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not without a few side effects, in my experience. The product is rather harsh, and while I don&#x27;t typically classify my skin as sensitive (more combination/oily), this did give me a slight rash around the eyes. Not necessarily bumps, but a bit of extra puffiness and redness. Needless to say, I will most likely only use the system 2-3 days a week lieu of daily use, once my skin has fully cleared. I&#x27;m almost positive the Acne Control Lotion is the real MVP here, but it needs to be used sparingly, almost as a spot treatment. I&#x27;ve resorted to uber-moisturizing my normally oily skin, just to combat the over-drying caused by this product. While this may be off-putting to some, it was so worth it to have clear skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my 15 year old cousin. she as oily skin. since skin has greatly improved.  she loves this product</li>
    <li> I bought this and it has completely dried my skin out. My face feels tight all the time and I need something else to help with my adult acne. I wasted my money on this product! Saying is true..you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I am a swimmer and so my skin is dry when I swim, but then gets oily from all the stuff I put in my hair to keep it looking nice. This causes me to break out around my hair line and all over my forehead. I picked this up at Walmart and found that it worked within a day. However when i went swimming that afternoon i forgot to put on sunscreen( I am really tan so I usually don&#x27;t wear sunscreen), this caused me to get sun burned only on my face. So if you are going out in the sun even for a little bit wear sunscreen( the lotion with a spf of 15 that comes with this isn&#x27;t enough!) Other than that I found this product to be excellent it does dry your skin a little but nothing some face moisturizer won&#x27;t fix i suggest Neutrogena Naturals it wasn&#x27;t to harsh.</li>
    <li> I use Neutrogena Products a lot in my lifetime. I recently purchased this kit because I didnt like having to keep on purchasing and purchasing new bottles from Proactive.(Proactive AMAZING though) But I wanted something cheaper in mind, (Doesn&#x27;t Everyone?) Anyways the 3 step system is NOT GREAT AT ALL NO 4 STAR REVIEW NO!! NO!! First the cleanser nasty, sticky, not good smelling at all ether! OVER DRIES SKIN COMPLETLY (Dont Use If You Have Sensitive Skin! After you use the 2nd step, your skin feels nice and clean, BUUUUTTT you HAVE to use the sunscreen on top of the other step (The Acene Control Lotion) well you have to use the sun screen because if you dont your skin will burn dramatically and start to itch if you go outside for long periods of time, like swimming, hiking, or a picnic (You Get The Idea). But when you do all three together it ends up a oily mess full of STANK!!!!!!! Bottom line dont buy this i would buy the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Acne Scrub Or Proactive Both Work Great For Sensitive Skin :) - The Pickle</li>
    <li> Not as good as they were trying to make it sound like didn&#x27;t work that much in the beginning for me but soon after it does kinda work I just recommend you to take proactive instead</li>
    <li> I gave the product a low rating because it did nothing for me but add acne to my face....</li>
    <li> it works for my skin. the cleanser could be more gentle. It can be harsh on my skin at times especially while using other products. don&#x27;t tan after using this product, i had a bad skin reaction for almost a week from that :/&lt;br /&gt;bottles are small.</li>
    <li> Finally cleared my adult acne! The sun block lotion is great not oily at all. The night Lotion can get a bit drying but my skin eventually got used to this. Overall amazing results in a shirt time</li>
    <li> We have tried everything for my 13 years old daughters acne. This is the first and only product that finally works!! Her face began clearing up right away. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 and I was having breakouts.  I have sensitive skin and I just wanted something that worked when I followed directions.  After I started I had no new breakouts and my old pimples cleared up.  After 3 weeks I got lazy for 2 days and it came back.  I wash with the cleanser in the morning and apply a thin layer of the supplied lotion afterwards.  At night I use the cleanser again along with a small amount of the acne lotion to any breakout spots or the areas where my breakouts occur most even if there is not anything there.  I&#x27;m so happy.  You can buy this at Wmart for the same price.</li>
    <li> Works great on adult acne.</li>
    <li> Works fast, daughter loves it, it has cleared her skin very well and the cleanser polishes the dead skin off of her face as well.</li>
    <li> I have had moderate to severe acne since I was 13.  I started using this about 3 weeks ago, and my face is clearing up sooo nicely!  I&#x27;ve read complaints about it being too drying, but this is the first product that I have used (on my extremely dry skin!) that leaves it feeling fresh and moisturized.  I only use the night cream to spot treat, and that seems to be working really well for me.    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it&#x27;s taking a while for my acne to disappear.  I had two pimples on my check before I started using it, and they are both still there (though much smaller--they&#x27;re more of a discoloration now).  The best part is I&#x27;ve only had two pimples start to come up, but after putting the night cream on them, they&#x27;ve both disappeared.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to treat my adult acne for about a year.  It works better than Proactiv and better than the Philosophy salicylic acid regimen and it&#x27;s much less expensive.  The SPF 15 in the moisturizer is nice, too.      Though I haven&#x27;t had perfect, miraculous results with the Neutrogena kit, I&#x27;ve been better able to control my acne with this than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve found my skin to be smoother, I have less redness and fewer pimples.  The blemishes I do get seem to be smaller and fade faster and my skin seems less oily.    I also like that it&#x27;s only two steps, twice a day.  As a busy mom I really appreciate being able to do my entire skincare regimen in less than four minutes.    The only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is because it didn&#x27;t completely clear up my acne.  But I&#x27;m starting to think that&#x27;s not going to happen without the help of a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I got this product after I had my first child in January and proceeded to break out like I never had before!  Proactiv was more expensive, and three steps seemed like alot, and I have trusted neutrogena in the past.  The night cream is very strong, and does dry out your skin a lot at first, but this improves with time.  My skin improved within a week, but it took about a month for the acne to clear up completely, but now I just get an occasional pimple along my jawline (the problem area to begin with).  I like the day lotion with SPF very much, since I never remember to apply sun protection.  It&#x27;s also a very easy regimen to follow.  I purchase masks from other sources to use once in a while, when I remember.  My skin has gotten somewhat softer with the use of this product as well.  I would definitely recommend it.  I have very sensitive skin (I get scars from everything!), and while the night cream is drying, I worked my way up to every day application gradually, and now I don&#x27;t have any problems.  Nice product</li>
    <li> My acne is not bad.  If I stay away from dairy and get enough sleep I usually don&#x27;t have a problem.  Please tell me who gets enough sleep...... Thank you!  Even though Proactiv is expensive it does work for me.... thought I would try cheaper Neutrogena to see if it works, and I have to say it does but not consistently - which is of course the whole point.  If I were to go off to a Monastery where red face spots wouldn&#x27;t matter then I could take this, but Proactiv has a better success rate for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The micro-beads in the Neutrogena skin washer are too micro to really do anything for me.  Also, with the Proactiv 2nd step - the reactivating toner (really meaningless name) - when used with a cotton swab, actually takes more dirt away from my face even after I&#x27;ve used Proactivs Face cleanser (first step) and it has better microbeads than Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say bottom line Neutrogena better than plain soap, but not a consistent winner for me.  Gonna stick w/Proactiv</li>
    <li> For me, this was a horrible purchase. I never had a problem with my skin until I was about 19. I  purchased this product when my acne started to get aggressive. THIS MADE MY FACE 100% WORSE! The kit was actually painful (during the first week), it burned! The second step made my face dry and peel. After using the product for almost 2 months I noticed that it GAVE me acne. This product gave me HUGE painful zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit (I occasionally buy the mark kit as well). Clean and Clear works so much better. It saved my face!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I haven&#x27;t had breakouts since I was 13. So when I turned 20 and all of a sudden pimples popped up on my face I freaked. My skin type is: very sensitive, moderate oily.  I started using this product and I could tell a difference in my face in about 3-4 days. Pimples were still there but they were shrinking in size. As you should know I&#x27;m impatient. So I went to the store and bought NEUTROGENA MICRODERMABRASION  and when I tell you all of my acne was GONE within 2 days it was amazing. And to remind you my forehead and cheeks had big blotchy pimples. I put the cleanser on the microdermabrasion so I  could get a better wash and then I put the ance lotion on my problem areas then I added the spf on the non problem areas. VOILA acne gone! And I started taking maca root to balance my hormones as well. Hope I helped !</li>
    <li> Did well at clearing my vitamin (biotin) and hormone induced acne. The only complaint I have is that on my skin is was very drying, In order to avoid that I reduced my use of the acne lotion to once a day. Its the most effective acne system I have used so far.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly for me. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING and most products and systems are too drying to make the benefits worth it. What good is less acne when your skin is so dry it is scaly and peeling?  This system has the perfect balance of effectiveness and being gentle enough to not kill your skin.  This kit lasts a surprisingly long time and I will continue to reorder it until the end of time!</li>
    <li> It RUINED 2 of my favorite shirts before I realized it will bleach your clothes.  What happened was I was sweating and the sweat carried the product to my shirts and bleached them. I looked all over each tube and could&#x27;t find any warning about bleaching.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the acne control lotion because the active ingredient sounds like it would bleach. Also my eye brows are almost white now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was saving money until it ruined my 2 favorite shirts which I will never be able to replace and those cost me over 50 dollars.  From now on I&#x27;ll stick to lab series products.</li>
    <li> Of all the acne treatments I have used I&#x27;ve gotten the best results with this product. I am in my mid-twenties and had little acne as a teenager. Several years ago I started to occasionally break-out in large, persistent blemishes on my chin and forehead. I saw some improvement with over the counter and prescription regimens. But I would still get monthly breakouts on my chin. When I first started using this product I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic change; I still had some good skin days and some bad ones. Over several months I definitely notice a big improvement. My skin no longer feels oil at the end of the day and the number of \\&quot;bad skin days\\&quot; a month has shrunken to 1 or 2. I do find that I have to be persistent. If I don&#x27;t use the product for a day or two I start to slide back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others who have moderate acne, but haven&#x27;t been able to kick it with other drug store products. I am definitely glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 14-year-old daughter who experienced pretty bad breakouts two weeks before school started.  She started using it one day, and there was a noticeable improvement the next.  Two days later, her face was almost clear and her skin tone was smooth and nearly flawless.  She has finished most of the kit and we&#x27;re about to order another.  The only minimal \\&quot;problem\\&quot; was that during the first week of use, the skin around her eyes got extremely dry (she didn&#x27;t realize there was no need to use the treatment lotion near her eyes) but she just used extra moisturizing lotion in those dry areas and was fine.  So yes, it might dry your skin out initially (that&#x27;s kind of the point), but her skin has looked great for a month, she&#x27;s gotten multiple compliments from fellow students and friends, and we like these products so much we might actually do the \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; option and have it delivered regularly so she never runs out.</li>
    <li> This product worked well to clear up my acne (not severe, just an occasional 2 or 3 pimples). Neutrogena has a dark spot fading toner I&#x27;ve been using that has helped fade the residual marks</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System for over a year now.  I tend to live with a migrating breakout that travels around my face perpetually.  I won&#x27;t say that this system has cured it but a drastic impact has been made.  My breakouts are gone MUCH faster and they don&#x27;t seem to spread as much anymore.  I have even enjoyed a month or two of completely clear skin. Something that, if you are afflicted with adult acne, is a game changer. Subscribing on Amazon is by far the best way to purchase this product as it is often 7 to 10 dollars cheaper than can be found in my local stores.  Be careful with the use of the acne control lotion that goes fast and first.  With a little practice I am able to make it last a month to six weeks using it twice a day. Do not, however, under any circumstances run out of this stuff once you start to use it regularly.  All hell will break out on your face.  This stuff requires a commitment of 16 or so dollars a month for, presumably, the rest of your life.  Not a bad trade off for skin that doesn&#x27;t make you want to die when you look in the mirror.  Side note: Examine your peanut intake.  I gave up peanuts and the result was immediate. I&#x27;m not a doctor, just a dude telling you what has worked for me.</li>
    <li> It might also depend on skin type. But for me, it didn&#x27;t work at all after using it for more than a month.</li>
    <li> This is the only acne stuff that keeps my skin clear. I had tried so many other products and this finally worked. The only thing is that the benzol peroxide (i think thats what it&#x27;s called) in step 1 really dries my skin out, especially in the winter months. So, I just switched to using it every other day and it was fine. I definitely recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for my teenage daughter who suddenly developed a bit of acne at the age of 15. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a  hormone surge. Anyway, this product worked pretty much overnight. It is very drying but very effective. We are pleased with the results. Four stars as opposed to five is for the drying factor but I&#x27;m thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a little over two weeks now and I can&#x27;t say I am impressed. I guess I was hoping this could get me by until I could find a new dermatologist that gives hormone therapy instead of just traditional acne therapy. I have had pretty severe acne off and on for 9 years and have seen 3 different doctors for it only to find temporary relief from the antibiotics and topical gels they prescribed along. They mentioned Acutane too but I refused to try. About 3 years ago I began to realize that I had a hormone imbalance which made me moody and made it hard to sleep at times. I knew the birth control pill could help with acne so I went on it and it really helped with all of my hormonal issues, but it only went so far. I still have breakouts and sleep problems and decided so seek out a doctor that could address my hormonal frustrations, esp my acne. I am looking forward to getting a hormone blocker and stopping the excess oil production in my skin that contributes to my cystic acne.  Hormone therapy gets to the root of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms of acne itself. When you get your hormones under control it&#x27;s more of a permanent solution unlike traditional therapy (only to have the acne return in a few weeks/months.)  I don&#x27;t think I will be trying the severe acne kit Neutrogena offers either. I am tired of wasting time and money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell actually if it does combat the acne - my face was red and burning after a week of diligent application. I had to stop using it because I really felt I had a serious sunburn. It also dried out my skin severely. If you have sensitive skin this is not for you! And as I said, I&#x27;m not sure if it actually did anything for the acne because I had to stop using it after one week and up until then I could not see any significant changes. Aside from redness and burning!</li>
    <li> You need this if you are serious of getting your acne treated. I&#x27;m 37 and had never taken care of my facial skin and after this my blackheads have disappeared, by skin is smoother and acne has been reduced by 95% (only been use it for 1 month) and combined with Neutrogena Men Invigorating Face Wash I&#x27;ve been able to look 5 years younger and my face is clean!!</li>
    <li> I have hormonal acne, so every once a month I get those painful, just-under-the-skin breakouts that I can&#x27;t even get with a comedone extractor. And I noticed that it had gotten worse -- usually it clears out after that time of the month, but I guess my sebacious glands are on hyperdrive (I may be lucky to have oily skin way past puberty, but it still has drawbacks). I was skeptical with Proactiv (too costly), and I really didn&#x27;t want to spend too much to start with in a 3-stage acne treatment system, so I decided to give this Neutrogena system a shot. I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a month ago, and I decided to wait for a little over a month to see if it&#x27;s effective against my monthly breakouts. I have oily skin (on the T-zone), and it minimized the pimples and whiteheads on my cheeks and forehead in a couple weeks. I really was happy with the difference it made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this twice a day, just a pea-sized amount of the cleanser, and a little less of it for the acne lotion. I wait for a minute or so for it to dry, then apply the SPF15 lotion. Then you can apply whatever makeup you use afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s 100% effective (nothing is in the real world), I still do get the usual tiny pimples on my pimple-prone areas, but my face cleared out and the mild breakouts I&#x27;ve had was not as angry and usually cleared up after a couple days as long as I stuck to my regular application schedule.</li>
    <li> To me, nothing is more embarrassing than skin breakouts. They always seem to come at the worst time for me. I would have an interview or a start a new job or have a date the next day and it would never fail, I&#x27;d wake up with the breakouts. I went to a few skin doctors who said I was probably experiencing some type of hormonal imbalances. Like pretty much everyone else writing these reviews for the various acne products they&#x27;ve tried, nothing I was doing was making any headway even though I had read all the books and used every pill, cream, and scrub. I have tried a little bit of mixing and matching and I&#x27;m having much better results. I used the Neutrogena to get rid of the greasy skin and facial acne and used an acne supplement [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] to stop the breakouts from happening. I used the Neutrogena system once in the morning when I woke up and once at night before I went to bed and took 3 capsules of the Clearzine twice each day .Within two weeks I was able to get rid of my acne, stop my breakouts and stop the greasy feeling of my skin. So far it&#x27;s been a month and no breakouts at all and my skin looks amazing. Not sure if this combo will work for everyone, you may need to be doing a little experimenting of your own but it works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> This truly is the only Acne System that works for me NOTE: I have moderate acne. I use to use proactive at night before bed, but I noticed that I would break out bad the following day but for some reason the day after that it would clear everything up. WTF. It was this inconsistent for weeks and I could never get the process down. I shortly gave up on proactive and started searching around for a solution and found nothing. Most of the time each product would cause breakouts instead of clearing them. Finally my mom brought me home this acne system and I tried it for the first time one night. When I woke up the next morning my acne was GONE! I was shocked. Ever since then I have been using this system for months and I absolutely love it. I will sometimes forget to wash my face at night and wake up in the morning wash my face and only use the SPF 15 Lotion and it would clear me up for that day, and the day after. The only con with this product is that my local CVS or Rightaid doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore so I have to buy it from here.</li>
    <li> This product burned my skin.  I used it at night and the next morning I felt and looked as if I gas a sunburn.  My face felt hot, was puffy, and itchy.  I imediately stopped using it.  But my scts kin was still irretated for days afterwards and turned into a got a dry rash.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with neutragena products before.  If you buy this product for the first time, I would recomend testing it on a small portion of skin before applying it to your face.</li>
    <li> My oldest son was placed on prednisone for a medical condition he was dealing with. He had a terrible time controlling face breakouts due to the meds. This was the only product I found that helped him. I bought every wash, scrub, lotion, cream, etc that I could find and none of them helped until I found this set. This is the only acne product I&#x27;ll buy now. Now my younger son is turning 15 and starting to get some small breakouts and he uses this too.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says and I have to say it does it well, it is fast and very affective and works for a long time. Highly recommend if you have ache problems.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
    <li> Seems to keep acne in check though I still always have a few here and there. Overall pleased with it.  Be careful with the acne control lotion, I discolored a lot of towels and pajama shirts before i remember, &amp;#34;duh, peroxide bleaches things&amp;#34;....sad day</li>
    <li> This is working!!! My face is so smooth and even! and it&#x27;s only a few days left.&lt;br /&gt;My tip for you!&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you use &amp;#34;Acne control locion&amp;#34; only to the acne active area otherwise your face will be too dry.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I used these products for a few days when the skin under my eyes started to burn, turned very red and started to swell.  Apparently I got the product too close to my eyes, but I always considered Neutrogena  products to be mild.  It took about two weeks for the area under my eyes to get back to normal using petroleum jelly to sooth the burning and Benadryl to ease the reaction symptoms.  Unfortunately, all three products went in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This product made my acne far worse than it used to be while i used it, i seized the usage of this product and my acne was back to normal, a simple cleaning of the face every other day gets the job done better than this</li>
    <li> This is a good product bc it uses both acne meds and a non drying and non oily spf lotion. It works well and is gentle. I have seen major improvement with my acne.</li>
    <li> I did notice a change in my skin. It cleared up a little but didn&#x27;t make as big of a difference as I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks and I&#x27;m very impressed. skin is clear and soft. Pores are smaller. This is a three step system. Make sure to use wash, acne lotion, then moisturizing lotion. Some think the acne lotion is a night cream and the other a day cream, no use all three every time or your skin will dry out. This is better than proactive hands down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne. This system works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial cleanser gets a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night lotion makes your face tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day lotion fights acne and provides SPF protection.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 3 years ago and it works great. I keep trying different washes because I run out of that first (I wish they sold these separately) but each time I use a different wash the acne comes back...with a vengeance!  I always kick myself and ask myself why I always do this :) I guess I look at the cheaper cleansers and get pulled in but I think I spend more on them because I end up throwing away half the bottle just to buy this one again. Meanwhile I always end up with acne but this stuff will get rid of it within days not weeks. I have come to terms that this product is the ONLY thing I will use for my face now. I have zero acne and my face is not oily or dry while using it.  I am now buying this for my daughters to use.  I am DONE with this acne battle!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the benzoyl peroxide lotion very often; when I do it is very effective in drying out pimples. I also use a clarasonic mia, and my skin feels like heaven.</li>
    <li> Within one week&#x27;s time, my acne has significantly decreased. I use the salicylic acid scrub in the morning, and the benzoyl peroxide lotion in the early evening, leaving a thin layer on rather than rinsing it off. This combo has really done the job, and the cost of this product is very reasonable compared to other brands (*cough* proactiv).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product a couple times and I can feel it working!</li>
    <li> Saw an significant reduction in outbreaks by day 2. The wash is perfect and the lotion is great too. Be careful not to have contact with clothes while the lotion is still wet or the active ingredient will bleach colors. Still an amazing product that worked for treating and preventing acne on my face and body.</li>
    <li> I will update my review over time . As of now it&#x27;s been 7 days I have been using this and the results are favourably  noticeable . My scars of acne of last 5 years are dimming away which is a good sign that this product is working . I have oily skin and I have tried lot of products but no one gave results so fast .</li>
    <li> It contained 3 tubes- a face wash, a sunscreen and an acne control gel. I found results after using them for 2-3 weeks everyday as per instructions. It is slow in treating, but effective. I used sunscreen in the morning and acne control at night, both of them after washing face with the face wash cream provided. I would certainly recommend people to buy if they have acne problems. It peels skin and reduces pimples.</li>
    <li> Great product but it dries your skin  If you have a sensitive skin I would try a different product.  But this works great</li>
    <li> Was on Amazon looking for ProActive and came across this Neutrogena product by chance. Read the reviews, seemed legit, so I went to my local Wal-Mart to pick it up and used it that night. The next day it looked like it was working great, the redness had gone away, swelling gone down, etc... But the NEXT day, I used the cleanser, and then the lotion without the SPF since I wasn&#x27;t going out that day and five to ten minutes later my face was on FIRE! It started out with persistent itching, and then burning. But I thought it was just a sign that the product was working. Wrong! That is most definitely not the case. I found a forum online about people who&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products and had skin irritation like mine and worse, even been hospitalized. I plan on using the face wash as long as I can, so long as it doesn&#x27;t start reacting badly as well, but the lotions, I plan to trash. Buyer beware! It will chemically burn you. I&#x27;m not sure if my skin type is the reason, but I&#x27;ve never been known to have overly sensitive skin, but whatever the reason, it is harming it far worse than the acne was doing. And to clarify, the burning seems to have been caused by the lotions they provide, not the cleanser itself.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT. PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER, PER ONCOLOGISTS. DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS. SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS!</li>
    <li> This acne system was blah! to be honest, it really didn&#x27;t work for me. My face would get worse and worse as i used it, i guess it was just being stubborn on my skin</li>
    <li> At first I thought this product was helping my skin clear up but after a few weeks I started breaking out worse and now I have four huge pimples that refuse to go away. Also the cream dries out my skin so bad it peels so I use it once a day or  once every other day</li>
    <li> Well there isn&#x27;t much that I can say about this product except that it worked for me. One thing I noticed though is that my skin, around the mouth, feels irritated when I use this before I brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> Ive never suffered from acne in my teens and early 20&#x27;s. I was blessed with great skin. I did not get acne til about 9 months ago after I turned 29. It came out of the blue and was terrible. I swear I woke up one day with a face full of acne. I had it mostly on my forehead. I usually do not wear makeup and I was so self conscious that I went out and bought some. It just made it worse. I tried multiple products with very little results including proactiv. I was getting very frustrated untill I came across the neutrogena system online. It had really good reviews so I figured it was worth a try. It was sold out online so I hit my local drug store. To my surprise it was sold out everywhere I went. I tried about 4 stores in my area and no one had it in stock. I thought this stuff has to be great to be sold out everywhere. I hit the internet and found it in stock at the walgreens about 15-20 minutes away. I picked it after work on a Tuesday night and began to use it immediately. I was shocked at the results come Friday. The acne on my forehead was about 75% better. What I had left was bearly noticable. The redness was gone and my skin was surprising soft. I was so thankful for the results that I went that weekend and bought another kit because I was scared I wouldnt be able to find it again. It worked wonders for me and did not dry out my skin like most of the other products. I found my new beauty product and I am so thankfulto neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Ever since I discovered this and started using it, my skin has cleared up significantly. I actually get complements on my skin, something that hasn&#x27;t happened in over 20 years!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products, including Proactiv, Mary Kay, and other systems, and found none to compare to this. Within two weeks me and my teenage daughter were clear of these crazy pimples without harsh drying of the face. Its so easy to use and leaves your face feeling so clean and smooth. I have to admit, I was very skeptical at trying this thinking it would never work but it has been a blessing. I&#x27;m 5 weeks into using this just once daily, and now the scarring is even diminishing, and my complexion is starting to clear and be vibrant. It only takes a small amount to go a long ways, and with 2 of us using it, we got 5 weeks out of the kit, so it will definitely last one person 2 months. Walgreens runs great specials every couple of months on Neutrogena products, buy one get one 50% off and free shipping. That&#x27;s the best deal I have found on it so far! I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with this product. It has been a small miracle for me, but more than that it has gave me my confidence back of not hiding behind a face that is broken out all the time. Not having one new pimple in 5 weeks is completely amazing!</li>
    <li> I have this in stock at all times because it works and works fact.  I also use Neutrogena Exterminator with this, which actually works overnight.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I never had acne as a teenager, but entering my 20s, I noticed terrible breakouts of cystic acne with dark marks left on my cheeks. I tried everything but an actual system, from masks, to scrubs, to three or four different products, but nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the Neutrogena system working 2 weeks after I started using it. My smaller whiteheads disappeared within a week, and my larger zits started shrinking within 2. However, when I first started using it, it dried out my skin terribly, and in conjunction with a mild exfoliant, my skin was red and raw, peeling in some places. I stopped using the system for a week afterwards until my skin returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the system for two months now, and it does work to an extent. I still have mild acne, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad, and the whiteheads clear up within a few days and my dark spots have been slowly fading. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to use this product with another moisturizer (I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination skin) and a spot treatment for more severe breakouts. The only problem is that the control lotion runs out really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great system, but you have to be careful not to use too much to dry out your skin and to not overdry or overexfoliate.</li>
    <li> The product works, but I think my skin is very soft for this treatment I hope to see recommendations on this.</li>
    <li> excellent product, works great!!! I´m really happy</li>
    <li> I used Proactive for several years which did WONDERS for my crazy teenage skin and unfortunately could not afford it any longer... For awhile my skin stayed good. But now I&#x27;m back to the bad acne again ): I read reviews on this before buying it and a lot of them said it worked just as great as pro, some even said it worked better!! I must say .. It actually made my skin worse. The acne cream is horrible, sticky, thick and disgusting. The wash sometimes burns my face &amp; I do like the moisturizer. I love neutragina don&#x27;t get me wrong but this set just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used proactive or any other acne therapy systems, but I have to say that this product works miracles. I was having some acne problem on my neck, and it was constantly flaring within about 2-5 five days, the acne is almost gone completely. The flaring&#x27;s gone done and my neck has cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some spot treatment and some treatment pads but they did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this product and trust me you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I used a few times and it has worked so far. I haven&#x27;t had but for a week or so. It shipped promptly!</li>
    <li> I like this better than proactive. It works better for me. It have a 3 step system also, but instead if toner it&#x27;s just the acne lotion, and sunscreen. It protects my skin better and makes it feel soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Made my face very dry.</li>
    <li> Burns your face so much, I kept feeling like I was scratching my skin off!!! Clearly too strong of chemicals in this product!</li>
    <li> It works for my acne. But it is very harsh to my skin. It makes my face feel extremely dry. And I got terrible pimples and took one week to recover.</li>
    <li> Best product for the price....love proactive but can get exspensive at times...sine ive been using this for a month i havent had a breakout......now i have to find simething for my blemishes</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t live without this kit. When I have a couple of breakouts on my face, I use all 3 products and it really does the trick. When my skin is clearer I continue to use the spf lotion because it&#x27;s so lightweight and perfect for my acne-prone skin! Love it love it!</li>
    <li> This acne therapy system either made my skin flaky and dry or it seem to ave any effect. Probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I had small acne-like bumps on my upper arm.  The cleanser (with fine granules for exfoliation) coupled with the night treatment were great in clearing up all the bumps on my arm.  It tends to be a little drying.  It also comes with a good day-time moisturizer.  Also, a plus is the great price. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for the people with acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;red swollen pimple &#x3D;&#x3D;&amp;#62; to smaller with darker skin ( like the pimple is died)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; pimple is almost gone with dark skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3&lt;br /&gt;dark skin where the pimples were and my face it really clear</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for about 2 months now. It starts working fast, and it keeps working. After years of battling with acne, I finally have clear skin and added confidence.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 days, I know it is pretty early to draw conclusions its efficacy, but I have to admit I have been quite impressed with the results. The product reduced the appearance of black heads and my skin is less oily and clearer than before. I have noticed, however, that the night cream leaves my skin dry and red. The cleanser and the day time cream are great. I will probably only use the night cream every other night from now on. The product is well priced and very much worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing breakouts in problem areas like my chin and the areas on the side of my mouth and this cleared it up in just a few days.  After two weeks my skin is totally clear.  It can be a bit drying, but I just use the sheer tint Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer and then another product they sell--the anti-wrinkle anti blemish cream.  I no longer need to use foundation and have found that with the tinted lotion all I need is the mineral powder makeup I use.  After all the department store products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, this Neutrogena system crushes them all!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for one week and I can see the results. I think this product works and will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 and have been using this product for about 4 days now, I can see significant change in the breakouts that I&#x27;m having, my left cheek always have a spot which breaks out more than any other place on my face and It seems that it has reduced this breakout spot by 60-70% which is pretty good.    I have no idea how this works over a longer period of time but if the results keep coming as they are at the moment I will be a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything to keep my skin clear.  I am older (in my thirties) with acne and it has been so awful to find a product. I have done natural, cheap and crazy expensive.  This is the first product that actually keeps my skin from feeling greasy half way through the day.  It took about THREE WEEKS for it to clear up the initial breakouts.  If you read the box it tells you it could be up to a month before they are gone.  Stick with the product, it will not be fast results. After those were gone I have not seen anything.  The only acne product I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> This product works and will definitely clear up your skin, but at a price. Within two days of using this product I had large patches of dry skin on my face. These patches looked like burn marks and were significantly darker than the remainder of the skin on my face. I have normal/combination skin, so only the dryer areas had these dry patches. I did not use the sunscreen because of its hormone and endocrine disruptors and ability to lead to developmental and reproductive toxicity when absorbed by the skin. As a result of the drying effect this product has on your skin, it creates wrinkles in the skin and causes you to show signs of aging. If you choose to use this product, it is a good idea to take a fish oil as well as a collagen supplement to counter the drying and aging effect it has on your skin. Lastly, this product will bleach any fabric it comes into contact with, so so not use expensive bedding when applying the night cream.</li>
    <li> This is the only acne treatment I have tried that works. I am in my 30s and have been suffering from horrible acne breakouts for the past few years. Within days skin became clearer and now remains primarily clear with only minor breakouts. I use this system daily and is not over drying. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i have had adult acne for some time now and this product improved my acne tremendously, cleared and even toned my t zone spots from old acne and i would recommend this to all my family and friends. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> First off, for almost a year now, I&#x27;ve been getting little flesh colored bumps all about my face.  As a 45 year old male who hasn&#x27;t had an acne breakout since I was 17, I was very curious why this was happening.  I thought maybe my intense weightlifting and cardio sessions were stimulating too much testosterone or something but i wasn&#x27;t going to stop working out.&lt;br /&gt;I created my own concoction of baking soda, apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil that didn&#x27;t do anything much.  Plus, for a month, I started creating fresh kale, strawberries, banana, green apple and almond milk shakes to get leaner and stronger as well as hopefully help my skin.  Some of the bumps had even gotten  bigger and was really starting to disgust me.&lt;br /&gt;Second, about a week and a half ago, I came into contact with some poison ivy and had a very bad reaction.  The rash was around my jaw, neck, and chest.  Now I looked like i had really broken out bad.  I decided that this was it and time to do some research.  All the reviews helped me here to find something that will dry out these zitx and rash bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for a week by washing with the microbead solution and leaving it on for 5 minutes before washing it off and then I applied the acne control solution.  I didn&#x27;t  use the moisturer enough so my skin got extremely dry but all the bumps are gone and a big one on the cheek is only a 1/4 of its original size and will probably be gone in  another week.  My skin is now smoother than it has been in years like when I was 20.  I will continue to use this fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  Very effective without being harsh. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Works great, just wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has proven itself more effective and more affordable for acne control than brands like Proactiv. This system is suitable for adults and teens, and will leave your skin both clean and clear. Use a moisturizer as well, though, because if you use acne-clearing products and then let your skin dry out, you might just end up with more acne.</li>
    <li> Great products, works wonders, would recommend. I was so impressed I now have a subscription to this product and Amazon delivers it to me every other month. Amazon has it for a cheaper price then any other store does plus with a subscription you get an additional discount can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Great product, Worked better than expected. My breakouts cleared within 2 days.  I had used  differin and Dalacin T for several months with little effect. Definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it, this is the only product that has cleared my cystic acne. I am surprised with the results. Love! Wish I could purchase the product separately. I am almost running out of the BP.</li>
    <li> Well to start with it didn&#x27;t arrive for two weeks... When it did come the shipping box was all banged up and product packaging was completely opened. I used product as directed and when I woke up in the morning my face was so swollen and burnt looking it was bright red and bubbly looking.  I have had a very large boil like pimple on my cheek ever since I used this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this system for a day. Already it is unique. The  face wash has very very fine beads, like sand, that literally polish your face and get rid of flakes. after washing, m face wasn&#x27;t tight and dry. The benzoyl cream is great because it&#x27;s only 2% benzoyl which means it doesn&#x27;t dry your face  out while still being effective. So far I&#x27;m in love,they use two different types of medicine. I woke up and there were no new blemishes and the ones I have seem smaller already. I recommend this product especially if you have combination skin. Buy this!! Great price and it really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old who occasionally suffers severe acne, and any acne outbreak is a BAD outbreak. This is the only product that I have used with near-flawless results. However, it doesn&#x27;t work overnight. It takes a few days for signs of improvement, and weeks for amazingly clear skin. You must use it consistently in order to get the results that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that it stains/bleaches certain shirts, so be cautious of that!</li>
    <li> April 5, 2013:  Not sure what happened but now I am allergic to BP and can no longer use this. Doc says it may be the carrying agent in the product? This set used to clear up my face and keep it clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use the 20% glycolic acid wipes (60 count) and salicylic acid with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> it helped a little but not as much as i hoped. it helped to the point where my acne wasnt huge red sore pimples but didnt get rid of them completely.</li>
    <li> This product is great I started breaking out never had acne before and it cleared it right up!</li>
    <li> Eek. I did not like this at all. I was hoping it was somewhat similar to proactiv, but it was a let down. The wash was sticky feeling and made my face SO dry. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> So far this product has been giving my skin a break from all of the break outs I can use just anything even tho I have trying to see what works best. Then I decided to try Neutrogena and boy oh boy I am so glad I did. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products I have been using these as trials. Just started 2-3 days ago and I am starting to see a difference. Not to strong but just enough ingredients to help me to feel better about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your product I will pass it on.</li>
    <li> This system worked well for me (mid twenties female with mild-moderate acne). Love the lotion, this is the second time I&#x27;ve bough this system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin, but around age 40 I started developing adult acne.. I tried everything to contain it; some things worked, including a few other store bought Neutrogena products, but nothing ever made it disappear; it was always on the verge of a moderate breakout.. It was so bad to the point that I didn&#x27;t want to go anywhere, but had to face a fact that the acne was probably going to be part of my life until the day I die. I would get it really bad on my forehead and cheeks, especially when I sweat.... ugh..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So a  few weeks ago, I saw this complete acne therapy system, got it with my Prime and got it two days later. Used it the first day, starting with the skin polishing acne cleanser, then applying the acne control lotion.. I did this for 3 days - the break outs persisted and even got worse..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So on the fourth day, I used the acne control lotion ONLY, and the next day I saw an improvement. It&#x27;s about two weeks later and my acne is not only gone, my skin looks like it did when I was 30.. The product&#x27;s directions say to wash your face and apply 1-3 times daily (leave it on), that didn&#x27;t work for me..made it even worse..  and it did dry out my skin.. So the secret for me is wetting my face with warm water, applying the acne control lotion, waiting 2 or 3 minutes and washing it off and ending with cold water..That&#x27;s it ..twice a day.. No dry or oily skin.. Using it as a facial wash..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I still have the oil free lotion and acne cleanser, but will probably never use either of them, but I will continue to buy this kit, because it&#x27;s the only way to get the acne control lotion; and it&#x27;s definitely worth it! The way I&#x27;m using this product may not work for everyone, because everyone&#x27;s skin is different; which is why some cheap drug store scrubs work miracles for some and are a nightmare for others. However, if you try this kit and don&#x27;t get the results you hoped for, based on the directions, try how I started using it,and it may work for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  One other thing, as a side comment: I thought \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was an ingredient which adversely affected sensitive skin  yet all of these companies, including Neutrogena, put out multiple products containing \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; and say they&#x27;re going to work on sensitive skin..and then they don&#x27;t.. Maybe there&#x27;s no link, but according to the box and bottle, the acne control lotion doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance.. but the other two bottles do.. I only use the one that does and break outs are history.. hmmm .. Just a thought..</li>
    <li> This kit is working very well for our teenage daughter.  It is gentle, yet effective, and costs less than Proactiv.</li>
    <li> I never had a problem with acne until about two years ago (right before I turned 27) and it also caused my pores to get larger, as well. I went crazy trying to find something that would actually clear up my skin and this is the only product that has done so! It clears up my acne and even the smallest blackheads, while actually making my pores smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, i couldn&#x27;t find this product in the store for about a month and my pores got larger, the acne came back, and I had tons of blackheads. But I&#x27;ve started using this again and within a couple days I have seen the fantastic results again.&lt;br /&gt;This is also the only product from Neutrogena that has worked for me, I have tried all of their other product lines without success.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and stopped. I have recently moved from south Florida to Minnesota and my skin started to break out. I tried other brands and even considered Proactive but came back to the Neutrogena System. I will say to start small and work up to twice a day as this can be very drying for your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with pimples and acne all my life. Recently it started getting really bad, big painful ones along my jawline, neck and some random ones on my face. I&#x27;m 37 and I thought I would have outgrown pimples by now. The worst part was when the pimples were gone they would leave big red spots, so I had blotchy skin as well. I finally decided to do something about it, and bought this package since it is cheaper than proactive. After one day my pimples seemed better, then day two they were worse, I kept using it and that first week it felt like a battle. I was putting the acne control cream on twice a day, and it really started to dry out my skin. After about a week the pimples started to lessen up, so I switched to applying the acne control cream only at night, the dryness went away after about another week. It has been a month now and my skin is now completely clear. I get the occasional pimple, but I no longer get the deep, painful acne. I&#x27;m not even wearing foundation anymore, I feel so much more confident about my face, the red spots have cleared up as well. I will continue using this stuff, I wish I would have started sooner.</li>
    <li> When I got this I was going through a particularly hard time with my complexion. My hope was that &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; care would take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not very good at following directions closely. I washed my face with the face wash fine which has a great sandy feel, so you can get a nice exfoliation going in your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I did something stupid. For some reason, I was under the impression that step 2 went all over your face and not in your trouble areas. Even then, though, it dries out my skin too much but I digress. Point is, I put the stuff on all over my face, twice a day, for 3 days straight come to find that my face was painfully raw and peeling. So beware and read instructions carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took about a week and a half before my face was back to normal. By then I&#x27;d moved on to the All-in-One system Neutrogena has, which I highly recommend. It&#x27;s gentler than this and seems to be more effective in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak very much about the moisturizer since I used it when I was destroying my face with step 2 and haven&#x27;t since.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work the best of all of the acne products that I have tried. I used to use the Oil-Free Anti-Acne Moisturizer, but it was discontinued. This seems to work a bit better, but has one drawback that anything with benzoyl peroxide will have: I have started to leave blotching marks on a towel and my pillows before I realized what happening. So just keep that in mind, use a white towel to dab excess lotion off of the face, and do not put it on right before going to bed if your pillows are not white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this seems works for me, so I am going to stick with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenagers and have seen significant improvement in their skin. Less breakouts &#x3D; happier kids. Sounds like a deal to me. UPDATE: was $4-5 cheaper at Walmart last time I checked. Product still works great.</li>
    <li> Although I do like this, and can&#x27;t complain about it, I can&#x27;t say that my face has gotten any better, and I feel like I might as well be using something 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin issues for years but in the week and a half that I&#x27;ve been using this system, I love it. This is the best my skin has looked in a long time. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i will use it for a long time</li>
    <li> Received this today. 1st impression was that it was drying to my skin. The wash has a slimy consistency and the lotion was sticky while applying. This just may be my last application. We shall see</li>
    <li> I like this product.. I saw my face getting clearer within 3 days.. But my skin looks so dry.. Anyways I will write one more review after 2 weeks as it is mentioned that we see best results after one month..</li>
    <li> I had a terrible reaction to the benzoyl peroxide. My entire face was swollen, red and puffy. I could barely open my eyes. I do have fair skin, but I&#x27;ve used various strong acne treatments on it for years.</li>
    <li> To start with I&#x27;ve always had break outs and what not on my face. Keep in mind though, I do not suffer my mild or severe facial acne. I have acne prone skin and will get bad flare ups and used to suffer from those annoying face bumps that werent quite acne but never go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product about last year or so. Ive been using it since. I exfoliate with the step one in the shower then after my shower I use the step two and apply it in my T-Zone. Once that dries up I take a cotton ball and use the Glytone Spray and spread it around my face (If you suffer from back acne like I USED to, PLEASE look up Glytone Spray on amazon!!!!!!!) And then I follow with Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E lotion cream (you can get this at the dollar store) then followed by my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This basically keeps my skin under control and I like the fact the step 2 is a lotion cream base rather than the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;I use the step 1 every morning in the shower than use my step 2 after. At the end of the day I take my foundation off and wet my skin with a wash cloth to open my pores and apply the glytone spray on my face for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used to have those annoying bumps on my forehead but since Ive been doing this routine, I have none on my forehead anymore. If you do have those bumps though I would suggest seeing a dermatologist though.&lt;br /&gt;I still get my occasional break outs but I really do like this product. However I do not use the step 3 just because i see it more as sunscreen rather than a lotion.</li>
    <li> I just want to say this kit is AWESOME.  I&#x27;ve had acne practically my whole life.  I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, and for the price, this kit can&#x27;t be beat and is MUCH better than the more expensive Proactiv Solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin like me, you will adore this.  It leaves me totally grease-free and my makeup foundation goes on very smoothly.  If you have drier skin, no problem, just use your favorite moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended.  My skin is clear and healthy looking.  You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Works great on smoothing out skin tone in 40 year old woman. I pretty much just use the cleanser on my face and shoulders, in the shower. Louis, no more PMS acne.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work as fast as they advertise it &amp; is not as good as proactive. Also did not clear up all the acne</li>
    <li> For months I have randomly and suddenly developed cystic acne around my mouth and painful tiny lesions with the occasional cyst on my chest and back. I tried Naturals, I tried expensive organic sets, they soothed some of the inflammation but not much. Realized that what I had was adult onset acne and looked this up on Amazon and got it immediately. Used it last night and woke up this morning, just as promised, the pain is gone. The swelling has disappeared and only the largest of the cystic ones are visible or can be felt by fingers. I would never normally review after only one use but this is just incredible. If you&#x27;re like me and review everything before you make a purchase because you hate to throw away money, you won&#x27;t be throwing money away on this purchase. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried even more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have a moderate acne problem and made the mistake of purchasing Proactive in 2012. It promptly gave me a chemical burn. I went back to my Neutrogena products, and then I found this skin care system on the drug store shelf. It has been a life saver for my skin for the past three years. I&#x27;m so happy I found it on Amazon for half the price!</li>
    <li> I have used for a month. Skin was so dried. When I used lotion, it was solidified like skin pack. I have even gotten pimple now. I hate this.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works for me better than proactiv.  Nothing is perfect, but this seems to be the best acne product ive used yet.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing and using.  Very pleased and it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
    <li> The price is great, only took a few weeks to totally clear up! It does dry out your skin if you use it everyday more than once a day, but it&#x27;s worth it in the end. I just kept on using there oil free lotion on the dry spots, this lotion feels really nice too, it has SPF 15 and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I did use this inconjunction with proactive solution advanced blemish  treatment. I used it as a spot treatment during the day. This also dry out your skin. All in all I would buy it again, the price is great and recommend it to anyone and have to my friends!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s fine. I like cleaner face and suncream. But control ance not work for me. I don&#x27;t see my pimples better</li>
    <li> My face started clearing up noticeably with in two days after I started using this. With in a week and a half people were telling me that my skin looked great. No irritation whatsoever. I shower in the morning and wash my face with this before I go to bed (so only once a day) and that&#x27;s all it takes for me. I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would help my teenage daughter with early on set acne - and it did! She has sensitive skin and after trying proactiv when I was younger and experiencing tons of dryness, I was weary of letting my daughter try it. I read about Neutrogena Acne System and thought I would give it a try! So glad I did - completely cleared up her skin within 1 week - noticeable difference in 2/3 days. Only complaint is that 1oz lotion sizes run out way too fast, wished it was same size as cleanser. Also, bought Neutrogena toner on the side (proactiv comes with a toner) for her to use. 5 Star product that I will purchase again and again!!!</li>
    <li> After years of struggling w cystic acne and trying everything including Pro Active I found this gem and at a very budget friendly price at that!! It has worked better for me than pro active ever did and without the drying effects on the skin!!! 10 out of 10 stars for this product!</li>
    <li> I have never had acne. EVER!  After my third baby I couldn&#x27;t stop the breakouts.  I decided to try this because of other reviews.  It was great!!  I misunderstood the directions and applied the acne cream all over my face.  Don&#x27;t do that! LOL.  It is quite uncomfortable once it dries.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this set, due to some negative reviews. However, I am so glad I did. I have mild adult acne, and it is very embarassing. Previously, I tried Proactiv, Clerasil, and pretty much every possible OTC acne product, and have never been impressed. I purchased this product, and in the past 2 month of using it, I have not had a single bump! I feel much more confident and happy. This product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product!  Initially, my skin became mildly dry when I used the system.  However after two weeks, my skin improved dramatically.  Before using these products, I had severe acne; I couldn&#x27;t touch my face without getting a pimple as a result.  I literally had pimples all over my face.  It was a horrible experience for me.  And to make matters worse, I couldn&#x27;t find a solution to the problem.  I finally gave Neutrogena a try, and I love it!  I use all three products twice a day, and this regimen has kept my skin clear for over four months!</li>
    <li> First time reviewer here. I felt compelled to write this review after the excellent results I have acheived from using this product. You´ll start seeing a difference after 3 days. You just need to be very consistent to avoid breakouts. I really dont like the moisturizer as much but it does work as a decent sunblock. I´ve been using this product for a month now and I have only had a breakout at the time of the month. I really recommend using the Neutrogena intervention kit when you have NASTY breakouts because it has a high concentration of salycilic acid and it clears red spots quickly. (Doesn´t do much for the inflammed pimples but it´s excellent at renewing skin.) Try this at least once before moving on to other acne clearing systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I did find that the acne lotion was a bit small but so far Ive been using it for weeks and it hasnt finished as quickly as I expected.</li>
    <li> UPDATE to my review below: I have now been using this for around 4 weeks and I am so pleased!  The acne I was battling is entirely gone!   I use the Neutrogena cleanser twice a day on my entire face.  I use the Neutrogena acne control lotion following that on the areas that I tend to get acne (I don&#x27;t put it on my entire face), then I follow with Ponds Clarant B3 as my moisturizer on the areas that are not as acne prone and tend to get dry.  I do not use the Neutrogena oil control/spf lotion that comes with this system.  It was not effective for me.  I have found the Ponds Clarant B3 to work much better in its place.  Despite that the kit is VERY worthwhile and I am so happy to have found an affordable product that has made such a drastic difference!  ************************  Very pleased with this product overall!  I am in my late 30&#x27;s.  During the past year - 2 years I have had frustrating acne on my forehead and along my hairline. I had tried products (Rodan Fields) that cost 3 x the price of this without much long term improvement. At first I saw no improvement using this Neutrogena kit but now after using the products for 7-10 days there has been a very significant improvement. I started noticing the improvement probably around 7 days.  This is definitely clearing the acne and I am pleased. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is it does dry out the other areas of my face too much. However, now that I am focusing the cleanser &amp; acne lotion on the problem areas and applying additional moisturizer on the dry areas it&#x27;s working out well.  Definitely worth a try in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Seem to work abit berlly noticed but not worth it deosnt work as it says and have to add like three different creams wich takes time and deosnt even work as good as they say it pretty much sucks for its price idk what people are saying on here that works for me i did but not in 2 days it only takes out like small blach heads tbh thats all i seen it do</li>
    <li> I have really fair, sensitive skin (natural red head) and have never really had more than a pimple here and there. For the better part of the last year, I&#x27;ve had constant flare ups around my mouth, chin, and nose... three show up and fade and another four appear. They&#x27;re painful and take forever to disappear. I was hesitant to try an acne system because dry skin is a big issue for me but I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I looked into a few different options and decided to go with Neutrogena&#x27;s system because it has a lower benzoyl peroxide percentage than a lot of the other ones. This turned out to be a great choice. Within 2 days, I noticed a reduced redness. Within 1 week, my skin was a bit dry but my problem spots were definitely starting to clear up so I switched to using the acne control lotion once a day. I&#x27;m now 2 weeks in and, while my skin is pretty dry in some areas, it looks so much better overall I wish I had done this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;If you dry out really easily (like I do), you may want to find an alternative moisturizer but otherwise, this system worked great for me. It&#x27;s hard to put a price tag on getting your self-confidence back but I&#x27;ll take the low price on the Neutrogena system. :)</li>
    <li> Did not work and was too drying and burned tween daughter&#x27;s face</li>
    <li> Works. Already seeing big difference after a week.</li>
    <li> The moment I bought this system was life changing for me. I had suffered with acne throughout my teen years. My self esteem took such a beating. I had small pimple clusters all over my face. And large spots here and there. There was barely a spot on my face that was not covered. I have combination skin, so my face is partly oily and partly sensitive/dry. I tried Proactiv to no avail. The acne came back worse than ever and left my skin embarrassingly and very noticeably flaky. I tried Clean and Clear&#x27;s system as well and it was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with hope but with no expectations. It blew me away. Now I am confident, happy and I feel so GOOD. I look back years ago and feel so grateful that Neutrogena came out with this product. If you&#x27;re reading this you&#x27;ve probably tried other methods that haven&#x27;t worked. Please just give this a try. Give it time to work, like a month. With any new system you need to give it enough time to work. For me it was definitely apparent after the 1st month that this was the system for me. It got more effective with time. Of course I get pimples every now and then but they are normal like everyone else. I don&#x27;t feel like an undesirable freak any more. I have been using this system for over 3 years. I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> This can be harsh on your face if you are using it for the first time. I recommend taking the week off if your skin is particularly sensitive. For me, my face will get worse days 1 through 4 then rapidly get better. By day 7-10 it is pretty much clear.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and after a few days stopped because i get forgetful. This time I am going by the directions. I started off twice a day but went down to once at night because my face was getting too try. It is really working well.  I am very happy</li>
    <li> I am 35 and now have skin like i was 17 again.. OK&lt;br /&gt;Been to dermatologist and gave me rx for all kinds of stuff.. They didn&#x27;t work ok.&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome I received it 2 days ago and had a ingrown pimple.. I used this for 2 days and now its almost GONE! Its a fast working awesome product. My face is so smooth and break out free im a life user of this product and am very pleased with the real results. I have used proactive and this surpasses it by a  billion !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I give this three stars because I  bought this for me and it was no use to me. I was angry at how dry my face was with proactiv and so I decided to give this a try and it definitely was worth it because this was lighter on my skin so I have seen both sides of extremes, but this wasn&#x27;t for me. But for my cousin who only got occasional acne, it worked perfectly for her. Like a blemish here and there. Mine was worse.</li>
    <li> for the first time it may burn your face but keep on using and you get the results.you will love it but it really depens on skin.</li>
    <li> Lasted a long time. Did the job, didnt feel irritated or anything.</li>
    <li> This worked very well, cleared up problem in a few days and they have not returned. Try it I think you will like it.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Clears acne, but not acne scars.</li>
    <li> Overall very good face wash. For some reason my acne came back really bad over the last few months after bringing it down to nothing on accutane 80 mg a day for 5 months when i was 19. After just a few days with this my skin was much less irritated and significantly less breakouts then i added just 20 mg of accutane a day and my skin at this rate is going back to almost perfect in just a few weeks from now. I HIGHLY recommend low dose accutane treatments for extended periods of time. Other than slightly dry lips there is no side effects at all for me. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I love the neutrogena acne system it really works. I have moderate acne and it cleared it up within a matter of days.</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old, have oily skin, and have always suffered with acne. I used to use Proactive and it worked well until my face became too used to using it (after like 2-3 years). Then it seemed to do nothing for me. I then switched to SkinID by Neutrogena in February 2012. SkinID worked AMAZING! I was so impressed with the product itself. The online SkinID company was very frustrating and in about January 2013 their website shut down and said they are not sending this product out anymore (i still have no idea why). So, i had to hunt for a new acne solution. I never had success with single acne face washes, so when I found this 3 step system I was so excited. It made me even MORE excited to learn that it&#x27;s made by the same company who made skinID (Neutrogena) - So I knew I&#x27;d probably have luck with the ingredients being similar. I would definitely recommend this acne system. The first step face wash does smell a little bit, but as long as it&#x27;s working, i don&#x27;t care at all. I wash my face with this system once in the morning and once at night every single day. It does dry my face out a lot, but after the third lotion step in this system, I use a Neutrogena soothing moisturizing lotion I found at RiteAid and it completely nourishes my skin. This soothing lotion does not effect the works of the acne therapy system. It all works together very very nicely &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have suffered with acne my entire life. I have been going to a dermatologist since I was 13. This has cleared my skin up and improved skin tone all within a month of using it. I will never use anything else. I also use Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear toner when I use the face wash and benzoyl peroxide lotion from this kit.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my niece about a month ago, and when I saw her yesterday her face was better than I seeing her before. She told me that sometimes she forget to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product according to the instructions and after 6 weeks of continuous use my forehead looks worse than ever. &amp;#60;sarcasm&amp;#62; Thanks Neutrogena for completely destroying my face!!! &amp;#60;/sarcasm&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with Acne on my chin, upper lip area and hairline since I hit puberty. For me I&#x27;d get one or two spots on my face and as soon as they started clearing up I&#x27;d get a new spot and boy they can be painful. I&#x27;m now in my mid twenties and I still have to deal with these painful spots that pop up on almost a weekly basis. Needles to say I&#x27;ve used every over the counter cleanser and acne treatment available and was at my wits end. I had finally broken down And was going to try the famous acne treatment that starts With a &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; but decided to try this instead because I&#x27;ve always liked Neurogena products. I have to say after using this for a month I am extremely pleased with the result. As I type, I currently have no acne on my face whatsoever and if one pimple starts to pop up its gone in a day or two.  I have not been acne free since I was a little kid. Where has this been all my life? The only downside is the active ingredient  in this is benzoyl peroxide and I neglected to read the warning that it could bleach things. I woke up the next morning after my first use to find my lovely gray pillowcase had been bleached in spots to a light tan color. But that was my fault. I suggest if you are going to use this before bed, do as I did and buy some white pillow cases. I</li>
    <li> This is the best topical acne system I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used an array of products by neutrogena, proactiv, clean and clear, acnefree, and numerous Rx washes and creams from the dermatologist too. Despite using acutane several times when a teenager, I am still acne-prone as an adult. This system has made a visible in just a week. I use it with the Olay Pro-X cleaning device and my skin has never looked better. I love the sunscreen moisturizer that comes with this, as the cleanser and acne cream can make your skin more sensitive than normal to sunlight.</li>
    <li> LOVE NEUTROGENA, THANKS</li>
    <li> Received my order but two tubes were busted. I am not happy about this. Could not even return because all the liquid leaked out.</li>
    <li> Before I had used this product I was a loyal Acnefree customer and mainly for their foam products. Since Acne free foam products were discontinued (I am very angry about this as it was the only product that worked) I looked for alternatives and this came up as one of the highest rated and most popular so I decided to order this kit. It worked great the first month. Minimal outbreaks although it didn&#x27;t work as well as the Acnfree foam. It was until about a week ago that I started getting very red skin, itchy, inflamed skin. I also got a mild outbreak. It doesn&#x27;t look to serious in the mirror but it feels very discomforting. I think it&#x27;s the benzoyl peroxide. It&#x27;s the lowest concentration (2.5%) which isn&#x27;t much. My skin could handle the acnefree foam which had about 5%. So I&#x27;m suspecting it&#x27;s another checmical my skin is refusing to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint is the sizes. Make all containers the same sizes. I have found this to be a problem with most acne kits. I always seem to run out of the acne treatment lotion first which is inconveniently always the smallest container and also the most expensive! I will be switching to a more basic products. Possibly the one&#x27;s from acne.org since they are cheaper and have the same active ingredient.</li>
    <li> A great face soap! I like the exfoliating texture and seems to help keep the oil level in my face down.</li>
    <li> After having two children in my 30&#x27;s, I developed this thing called \\&quot;hormonal acne\\&quot;. Horrible deep cystic pimples around my chin area. I tried products from the dermatologist. I tried numerous spot treatments and different cleansers. Nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is that I have very sensitive skin and is quick to peel when harshly treated. I was afraid to try a system because it might be hard on my skin. After giving up on everything else, I finally decided to try the Neutrogena system. The price is right and it&#x27;s available locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised! 4 days in and acne is calming down, skin texture is looking better and it does not seem to be irritating my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m not calling it a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; yet because it&#x27;s been less than a week but I&#x27;m impressed so far. I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: 1 month use - After one month of use, 2x daily, the results are pretty amazing. My skin is not 100% clear but it&#x27;s at least 90% cleared up. Wearing makeup completely covers any problem areas now. Now, I only get a few small pimples and they are shallow. I have not had any of the horrible deep cystic ones since I started the treatment. My sensitive skin does peel a tiny bit but it&#x27;s easily cleaned up with a little exfoliation in the morning shower. I&#x27;m kicking myself for not having tried this stuff sooner. It&#x27;s a miracle worker as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: 2 months use - Now been using the Neutrogena system for over 2 months with a Clarisonic Mia and the deep pore brush heads. It&#x27;s an amazing combo. My skin is completely clear right now and has been for a couple weeks. Crossing my fingers it stays this way! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product and cheeper than at the stores</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really help me a lot !!!!glad I choice this one :). So many people said that \\&quot;where is your acne !?\\&quot; :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to attach a picture of my face after using this kit, but I did not find this option, because I think it would speak louder than any words can describe my painful experience. It burned several layers of my skin after only using it once. I had to go to emergency room twice. I have used other Neutrogena products before and loved it. But please be aware of this particular product.</li>
    <li> Not good. I taught it will be as Proactive but didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Inboughtbthis for my teen daughter. It has really helped her skin clear up. It&#x27;s a simple process and trusted brand for our family.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product because some how when I applied the benzoyl peroxide acne control lotion! Right after I washed my face with the acne wash! In the morning when I woke up , my face was covered with redness and blisters that were severe and worsened my acne !! Please help me ! What should I do ?</li>
    <li> This product worked very well on my skin, it&#x27;s a perfect routine and i&#x27;m glad to have discovered it.</li>
    <li> I was using Proactive Acne system which I didn&#x27;t see the improvement as advertised. So after 30 days of using it I threw it out and now started Neutrogena Complete and it&#x27;s only been 2 days but my blemishes are almost gone, my pores are smaller in just 2 days! Very happy with this system!</li>
    <li> I was a little iffy about purchasing this at first considering not much else works for my acne breakouts besides proactiv, but I gotta say...THIS stuff works BETTER than proactiv!! I&#x27;m only on my 2nd week of using Neutrogena complete acne therapy system and I already see amazing results. My redness and blemishes have faded and I haven&#x27;t had any recent breakouts. I feel a lot more confident and I feel like I don&#x27;t have to cake the makeup on my face just to hide pimples now. I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and I am so relieved all&#x27;s I have to do is go to my closest retail store and get this for only 19.99 for 2 month supply, when you pay the same thing for proactive for only a 1 month supply. When I first started applying this for the first few days, my skin became a little dry, but I gave it a couple more days and the dryness subsided.. everybody is different though and some people are more sensitive to certain products than others... but hey, reading these reviews and seeing the ratings from so many different customers, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try! I definitely love it and it works for me. :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Started to work the very next day.</li>
    <li> when i first got this it worked a little but i started using acnefree serve acne treatment and it is working amazingly for me i have used proactiv in the past and worked wonders but for the price and having to have a membership i quiet using it and started searching for the next best thing and acnefree was the best hands done u can get a sulfar refining mask and a deep cleaning scrub with the acnefree and it works as good or almost better then proactiv u have to try it what is there to lose except the break outs</li>
    <li> Let me first say I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts since the age of 15. I&#x27;m now 29, and I still break out. I have ups and downs, and after going through my first pregnancy, then breastfeeding for a year, starting a new birth control, my hormones have been all over the place the past 2+ years and my skin was suffering. Now, I tried Proactiv (again) because I had had great luck with it in my early 20&#x27;s. However, I seemed to have built up a tolerance to it so quit using it at about age 24-25. This time it SERIOUSLY irritated my skin. It was red, it hurt, it was tight and dry. I used it every other day, as recommended, and after 3 weeks my skin was worse than ever. Mind you, this was all happening at the same time I had started taking Loestrin Fe for the first time. So, that could have been a factor as well. It was hard to know what was causing the flare-up, but Proactiv made it SO much worse. But, all I know is that I ordered this stuff and within 5 days my skin felt and looked WAY better. I have been using it for about 6 months now and love it. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, I don&#x27;t have 100% perfect skin, but I know I never will. But it is considerably better, and when I do get breakouts (still hormone-related, as it&#x27;s always during \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot;) it&#x27;s not bad at all. Bottom line: it is effective w/out being so harsh on your skin like Proactiv. I am buying more of it, I love it. I would highly recommend you try this if you&#x27;ve tried other methods, have stubborn breakouts, and have found Proactiv either too harsh or that it loses its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena acne treatment for almost a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product! It&#x27;s gentle, yet keeps my skin clean. I just wish the lotion was in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for over a month and it has been wonderful. I have had zero breakouts, not even a single pimple. I am using the system per the instructions, twice a day every day. You use the acne control lotion at night and the SPF lotion during the day. The face wash and the lotions are mild, not harsh on sensitive skin (which I have). For the lotions, a little bit goes a long way. I am running out of the face wash much sooner than I am the lotions. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with acne concerns.</li>
    <li> I would 100% give this 4 stars if I could just buy the cleanser, but I don&#x27;t need the 2 other products - they don&#x27;t work well with my skin. I agree about the comments that one of the other steps burns my sensative skin. I would buy this cleanser more often if it came by itself, but I really try to ration it b/c it&#x27;s so expensive to buy the 3 in one. My sister-in-law told me about this system, so I had to try it. I use the cleanser pretty much every day twice a day and noticed way less break-outs or big red bumps that hurt and turned into zits. I figured out that I can use this cleanser with a Neurogena sensative skin lotion with spf 15 and I can keep my face clean and fresh. I&#x27;ve been using it since the spring of 2012. I do still mix in some other neutrogena face scrubs in the summer when my face is really oily and I want to exfoliate more than this product does.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena - please, please, please offer the cleanser on it&#x27;s own for those of us with really sensative skin!!!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m very impressed.  I was a proactiv user for a long time but $40/month (and minimal results after a long period of time) made me start looking around.  I love neutragena products so I tried this.  So far my skin is GREAT!  I also use the new gel moisturizer at night and their wrinkle cream.  The best part is I&#x27;m not scared to use it because it is so much more affordable.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, so we will see how/if it continues to work.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I can only comment on the use of the face wash because I do not use the other two skin lotions as when I did use them I noticed my acne increase. So with the wash only it does the job perfectly. Downfall is having to pay the price for only one product and not the full product line. I have compared there other products and I have yet to find one of there soaps that is excatly the same... so untill then I will be paying the price for nice skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I&#x27;ve been using the complete Neutrogena line of acne products to treat my sudden breakouts.  This stuff works!  I believe it is just as good as Proactiv and much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Cleared up my persistent adult acne- you just need to use it consistently each morning and evening.</li>
    <li> I found that this product never left my face feeling clean.  I would use it before going to bed and then wake up with my face feeling waxy/greasy.  After using it for two weeks I had twice the pimples I had started out with.  Even after switching to a new product that worked better for me, it still took over two weeks to get rid of the pimples this product caused.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend and compared to the regular  price of 3 tubes of facial products, it&#x27;s a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;AND MAY HELP your complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding this harder to find in stores. But I find it to be the ideal product for me.</li>
    <li> The product received expires within a month!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week.  I noticed that my pimples are fading after the first few days of use. I haven&#x27;t gotten  any new ones as well. In that aspect the product does its job. But after few days of use my face started to look dull and dry. So I am taking a break from the product now...still no new pimples though!</li>
</ol>
