      <li>Not greasy or shiny, just healthy.</li>
      <li>It smells divine and feels so lovely on the skin.  </li>
      <li>so i gave it to my sister and she&#x27;s ok with it...  </li>
      <li>While many are good, I have really found none better than this one</li>
      <li>The smell is awesome, where other moisturizers smell of chemicals or perfume, this has a nice light citrus scent.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer, absorbs very quickly, moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make skin shinny.</li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased with this product!</li>
      <li>My skin is more even,and the cream goes on smoothly with no heaviness to it.</li>

      <li>Overall, the cream is a great value for the money.</li>
      <li>This cream is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It has a light citrusy scent which is not overpowering and dissipates after application.  </li>
      <li>However, once you apply it, it soaks in well after a bit and leaves a perfect layer of moisture without a heavy, greasy feel.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I have used many many day creams over the years - drugstore brands and high end department store varieties.  </li>
      <li>A good day cream, not sure if I would buy again, I have to use it for a longer time to make a fair judgment</li>
      <li>I originally stumbled upon this moisturizer when I ran out of what I was using while away on work trip.</li>
      <li>Great product for mature skin --- very moisturizing and brightening.</li>
      <li>For daytime, she used this cream, stating it absorbed easily, did its job, and that it seemed to give her a glow</li>
      <li>Great for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This is great for a person who have dry skin.</li>
      <li>I think it is very nice, but the Lumene has just a little something more going for it.  .</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth and has a fresh citrus scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a bit pricey for what I would normally reach for, but compared to a lot of other companies, like Origins for example, this has given me some of the best results.</li>
      <li>Now, I am a  loyal fan.</li>
      <li>The uneven skin tone and texture from sun damage is greatly improved, as well as reduced pore size and fewer wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>It really makes skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>And it smells like fresh oranges too</li>
      <li>but it is absorbed well.</li>
      <li>love it, it is really good -- I don&#x27;t use much as I try to cut back, my skin is too sensitive.</li>
      <li>I gave this product review four stars as I am still using the product and have been satisfied thus far of the results.</li>
      <li>They found a young Asian-American woman with the most glorious skin they had ever seen; she glowed.  </li>
      <li>I picked up this tiny jar of sample of the Lumene bright now cream at CVS for $5; I wish it is odorless, but the scent is at least mild and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and actually smells quiet good!</li>
      <li>I use just a little since my skin gets oily, it has a nice consistency and smooths on easily.  </li>
      <li>My makeup goes on pretty nicely since that dry patches is gone!</li>
      <li>, it keeps my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
      <li>but my face is in so much pain right now.</li>
      <li>I have been told I look 20-25 years younger than I am, and been very satisfied with the few skin products I have been using for many years, except for my daytime moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It instantly made my skin feel soft and look kind of glowy.</li>
      <li>But I know that this Lumene Vitamin C cream is having a positive effect because I recognize the difference in my skin brightness just by looking in the mirror.</li>
      <li>The texture is just right, and I would highly recommend this product regardless of your age or skin type.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I am very picky about what I put on my face.</li>
      <li>After moving here to a Northern state, I found that the winter air really dries me out.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to look, as my face is very greasy with this on.</li>
      <li>and I now use it absolutely every day.  </li>
      <li>First off, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, live in the tropics and have combo skin so my T-zone gets a bit oily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am very picky about what I put on my face. Growing up my Grandmother told me to only use cold water. After moving here to a Northern state, I found that the winter air really dries me out.  I used Olay day cream with SPF15 for a number of years; the container is just way too big; it often expires long before all the lotion is gone. I switched to Shinseido urban renewal; which is scentless and has SPF 42 - these features I liked; it felt more like a sun lotion rather than a moisturizer. I picked up this tiny jar of sample of the Lumene bright now cream at CVS for $5; I wish it is odorless, but the scent is at least mild and pleasant.  It is a little thicker than the above two but it is absorbed well. It also does not contain Parabens. I recommend using this for the winter season.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic. I have just passed my Paul McCartney \\&quot;Will you still need me\\&quot; birthday. I have reasonably nice skin, not too dry, a few wrinkles around the eyes; like another reviewer in my age group, who wrote a review last spring, I am still 64 ( i.e., not 30)! At a party the other evening, someone I hadn&#x27;t seen for a year, and who, trust me, pays a lot of attention to the matter of Youthful Appearance, came up to me and stated with sincerity that I looked like I&#x27;d had a face lift. This was not a fawning, great-to-see-you-darling, kiss-kiss, mwa mwa, greeting. This woman truly thought I&#x27;d had Work Done. I hadn&#x27;t.    Now I will admit that I had been having trouble sleeping when she last saw me at the 2013 event, and that I probably looked a bit tired back then. But I know that this Lumene Vitamin C cream is having a positive effect because I recognize the difference in my skin brightness just by looking in the mirror. There is this glow that&#x27;s hard to describe. It&#x27;s, well, a glow!    As some have said, a little goes a long way. I recommend that you time your makeup regimen to allow two or three minutes for the cream to absorb. If I don&#x27;t do this, my makeup can slide off a bit. I use Dermalogica redness relief, and l&#x27;Oreal visible lift  Blur foundation; and a little Clinique pore refining solutions instant perfector on my nose and forehead. This combination is very effective for me.  Another day cream that I like a lot is DML, which comes in a tube and is easily transportable in your purse. The DML has SPF 25. I think it is very nice, but the Lumene has just a little something more going for it.  .</li>
    <li> A good day cream, not sure if I would buy again, I have to use it for a longer time to make a fair judgment</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read my favorite author, Diana Gabaldon uses it- (she always looks radiant,) I have to admit- the stuff works. I tried all sorts of lotions and potions but this cream actually is fading my brown spots on my face. My skin is more even,and the cream goes on smoothly with no heaviness to it.</li>
    <li> Glad to try the vitamin C face cream!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the night cream and day cream. The reviews were good, so I&#x27;m glad I tried it. I think it has lightened my face.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin so sometimes it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a cream that&#x27;s both light and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has been amazing on my skin and keeps it feeling soft without the greasy feel a lot of other&#x27;s leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Oil of Olay or an equivalent, which has worked pretty well for me, but the Lumene has really made a difference in the health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey for what I would normally reach for, but compared to a lot of other companies, like Origins for example, this has given me some of the best results. I&#x27;ll still use it simultaneously with other face creams and have had no allergic reactions with it - definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Very light yet moisturizing. A little goes a long way. I LOVE the smell, its so refreshing, its a must for me every morning.</li>
    <li> I originally stumbled upon this moisturizer when I ran out of what I was using while away on work trip. I ran to the nearest drug store and found this. I would concur with other reviews that it is a bit expensive for an over the counter product. However, the results are much better. I too have combination skin and felt like other products would leave some areas dry while other areas were continually oil streaks. I have never had this problem, not even during the humid summers of D.C. The smell is awesome, where other moisturizers smell of chemicals or perfume, this has a nice light citrus scent. It is those cloud berries they put in it. I used to suffer from adult onset cystic acne as well and have to be very careful of what I put on my skin, this product has never been an issue. All in all, I would recommend it to anyone and think the world of it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased it!</li>
    <li> Um, I used this product for two days and now I&#x27;m scaley, flaky, red, and itchy around the mouth area... Not sure if I&#x27;m allergic to an ingredient in this product or whatever, but my face is in so much pain right now.</li>
    <li> Like the product and like the price</li>
    <li> love it, it is really good -- I don&#x27;t use much as I try to cut back, my skin is too sensitive.</li>
    <li> great product.  if used on a routine basis with the night cream, your skin will appear slightly brighter.  note that it does have a fragrance and may irritate the eyes.  has a nice scent, goes on smooth, a little goes a long way, have been using for over 3 years, 75% of the time.</li>
    <li> I needed a quality moisturizer that has sunscreen in it so I don&#x27;t have to apply another layer of cream when I am in the sun. I have been using Lumene regularly for a couple of months and am very happy with it. Before trying this product I would occasionally get red splotches on my cheeks. With Lumene I have had almost no breakouts or red spots on my skin. The product is a bit thicker than your average cream but takes less to cover your face. It glides on smooth and has a fresh citrus scent. The only downside is if you&#x27;re swimming or doing any kind of heavy sweating outdoors, you&#x27;ll need to reapply or use something that doesn&#x27;t sweat off. Overall, the cream is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites... And it smells like fresh oranges too</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this day cream. It does not have an overwhelming smell like my Lumene night cream. My skin is smooth and silky. I&#x27;m also glad it has SPF - We do need the extra daily protection in our high elevation town.</li>
    <li> I am more than happy with the Lumene Vitamin C Day Cream.  It smells divine and feels so lovely on the skin.  This is a product I will order again in the future.  The scent of this facial cream is subtle citrus, which gives it an uplifting effect.  I also like the fact that this day cream has SPF 15, which is nice to use during the Spring and Summer months.  Overall, this is a fantastic day cream that I would highly recommend to anyone, young or older.  I&#x27;m impressed with Lumene products and will be checking out their other items.</li>
    <li> I like the Vitamin C line of Lumene. Smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, absorbs very quickly, moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make skin shinny. I have combination skin and it works for me well.</li>
    <li> I have used many many day creams over the years - drugstore brands and high end department store varieties.  While many are good, I have really found none better than this one and I now use it absolutely every day.  I have &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin -- not too dry, not too oily -- and I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;young looking&amp;#34; 63 years old -- but I&#x27;m still 63(!).  This cream is easily absorbed but gives my skin a wonderfully dewy finish, perfect under makeup or bare.  I like that it&#x27;s got SPF15, though in the summer I would still use a higher SPF sunscreen on top of it for greater protection.  Vitamin C is a great benefit, and the scent is glorious (oranges?).  The texture is just right, and I would highly recommend this product regardless of your age or skin type.  I will not be buying high end day creams now that I&#x27;ve discovered this gem!</li>
    <li> I just turned 51 a month ago and I think that I was in some kind of delusional state about my skin. Being olive skinned, my skin was always kind of oily, so short of the occasional acne product, I just stuck with very basic moisturizer. I started noticing that my skin looks so blah. Kind of dry and boring. I felt like I was really starting to look old. So, I know that I don&#x27;t drink enough water and God knows I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, and none of that is changing anytime soon. Honestly I bought a small size of this product in CVS because I had enough extra bucks but I&#x27;m hooked. It instantly made my skin feel soft and look kind of glowy. Not greasy or shiny, just healthy. It takes a tiny little smidgen to do your face. It needs to be rubbed in a little because its a little thick, but once I did that I kind of added little dots of it to problem places. The little creases in the corne of my mouth, the inner corner of my eye and a little more on my lids. With no makeup at all, I automatically looked more awake. I will definitely buy the larger size of this and I&#x27;ll try their other products too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the citrus smell and feel that it is a little greasy. Its not enough of an issue to make me not use it, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great consistency. Great price.</li>
    <li> A little heavier than I was looking for... consistency feels close to suntan lotion.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, and most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t moisturize my face enough; my skin ends up feeling stiff and dried out. This cream, though, actually keeps my face soft and supple, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying throughout the day. I also appreciate that it has an SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars, though, because this cream is a little too expensive for my taste.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years and just love it.  Ii have dry skin and this is very good at keeping it moist and soft.  Amazon has the best price too!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and she loved it. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It looked like it was opened, when I opened the top their was no seal to it. So I dont know if ill use it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smell like oranges. Great for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> After trying another product, which left my skin rough and dry, I went back to my Lumene Day Cream. I really like this product, it keeps my skin smooth and soft all day. It works for me.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream has a luxurious texture. I don&#x27;t like creams that leave a thick oily layer which is what I thought this was when I first opened the jar. However, once you apply it, it soaks in well after a bit and leaves a perfect layer of moisture without a heavy, greasy feel. It really makes skin feel smooth. It has a nice scent - not flowery, but rather citrusy. Made in Finland (and you know they&#x27;re not trying to kill us). SPF 15. Contains vitamin C. And...as I was typing this, I thought, &amp;#34;so what? Do we really know that applying vitamin C topically makes any difference?&amp;#34; Good ole, internet...What I discovered was a clinical study (the real kind, not the kind conducted by the company selling you a product) determined it does make a difference. This was the study&#x27;s conclusion statement: &amp;#34;(topical application of) vitamin C results in clinically visible and statistically significant improvement in wrinkling when used topically for 12 weeks. This clinical improvement correlates with biopsy evidence of new collagen formation. Here&#x27;s the link to the study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11896774&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, I just love it because it feels great on my skin and I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife along with the Radiance Nectar as she loves them and has not been able to find them. She was basically out of her current supply and she was so thankful to get a refill of both. She uses them both daily.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every possible face cream, and even if I had, there would be no comparison to how I looked without trying anything (is it my genes, or is it Lumene?).  However, I really like this; it seems to do as much as much more expensive creams, and doesn&#x27;t clog up pores like many others - both less expensive and more expensive.  I use it on my throat too.</li>
    <li> Delivers excellent results!  Light fragrance and nice delivery. Leaves skin brighter and moisturized. Beautiful packaging as well. Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> this lotion feels great and smells good. I have only been using for a few days but my skin is not dried out like my previous face lotion.</li>
    <li> I am sooooo surprised at how well this affordable product works! Not only does it provide a nice healthy sheen and SPF for every day wear that saves times and money with one product, it actually has drastically improved my overall skin quality after using half of 1 jar. The uneven skin tone and texture from sun damage is greatly improved, as well as reduced pore size and fewer wrinkles.  Now, I am a  loyal fan.</li>
    <li> Great product for mature skin --- very moisturizing and brightening.</li>
    <li> I gave this product review four stars as I am still using the product and have been satisfied thus far of the results. I would recommend this product to all customer wanting to remove the dark spots from skin.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not at all oily.</li>
    <li> I was searching for an spf cream that would not leave my face greasy looking, this is not it. I will continue to look, as my face is very greasy with this on.</li>
    <li> I love this Lumens face cream! It has brightened the appearance of my skin and has made my face so smooth!! The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering and actually smells quiet good! This is the only product that works on my eczema!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with my skin with spf creams,  i get crazy breakout on my chin only when i use them  .. so i gave it to my sister and she&#x27;s ok with it...  maybe it doesn&#x27;t suit dry skin</li>
    <li> This is great for a person who have dry skin. I use to have flaky spot on my face and this cream help reduce and prevent it from happening. My makeup goes on pretty nicely since that dry patches is gone!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cream.  I have been told I look 20-25 years younger than I am, and been very satisfied with the few skin products I have been using for many years, except for my daytime moisturizer.  It leaves a residue that gradually builds as the day goes on, so I  still read articles about skin care.  I recently read an article in a women&#x27;s magazine that explained why they were writing about certain beauty products, none of which I had heard of before.  The team went out on the streets of NYC looking for a regular woman with beautiful skin.  They found a young Asian-American woman with the most glorious skin they had ever seen; she glowed.  In their article, they listed  the few skin products she used.  For daytime, she used this cream, stating it absorbed easily, did its job, and that it seemed to give her a glow and she loved it.  I bought it here on Amazon. I agree.  It is very nice, absorbs quickly, does its job, my few tiny wrinkles are minimized and my skin has a new glow also -- and I am 83 years old.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, live in the tropics and have combo skin so my T-zone gets a bit oily.  I found out about this brand here on Amazon and since I couldn&#x27;t find any local store that carried it I decided to take a chance and get it here.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about one month.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that I like it very much!  It has a light citrusy scent which is not overpowering and dissipates after application.  I use just a little since my skin gets oily, it has a nice consistency and smooths on easily.  I also like that it&#x27;s not sticky/tacky on the face, just a nice smoothness.  I use a 15 SPF foundation which goes over the cream nicely.  Overall I really am happy with this moisturizer and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like this it feels really good and hydrates the face noticeably.</li>
