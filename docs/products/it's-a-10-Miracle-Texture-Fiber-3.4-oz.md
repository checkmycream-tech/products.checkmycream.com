      <li>Works exceptionally well on my short, extra fine hair.  </li>

      <li>Works really well...</li>
      <li>I really like this product and use it after I&#x27;ve styled my hair with mousse and blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>Really like It&#x27;s A 10 products, except this one.</li>
      <li>I like that its cheaper and also its much easier to dispense with this container (hold button and its comes</li>
      <li>Too much</li>
      <li>I have really short and thin hair and this product is awesome</li>
      <li>Smelled good when hairdresser used, but texture of the paste is too thick.</li>
      <li>I have very fine short hair--I discovered this thru a friend and now at least I have some texture for this very fine hair of mine.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have thick course hair and i like it to spike out in the back a little...this stuff is great for that! It is sticky in your hands when you are putting it in but your hair is not sticky at all and a little dab will do ya! Great stuff! I was getting it in a salon but my salon quit carrying it so I resorted to online! So HAPPY I could find it on here!</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with products leaving my hair oily looking and feeling or hard as a rock.  This product gives me just the look I&#x27;m going for!  I no longer look greasy or like I&#x27;m wearing a helmet.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Was a bit hard to get the gel to pump - almost returned because we thought it was defective.  Eventually, with a lot of work, it started to come out. Not very impressed with the pump mechanism, but the seller and gel itself are perfect.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed. I wondered why they were so inexpensive ($13 vs. $20)...it&#x27;s because none of the pumps works. The product won&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;. My husband says its like cement. All products from this brand smell great.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for short hair. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding something that would tame my curls and keep them from getting frizzy in the humidity, but that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, sticky or feel heavy. This does it all! ***Just a hint for those who think the product is too thick:  I pump a dab into my palm (a little goes a long way) rub my hands together, and then add just a bit of water, then rub hands together again to create a more &#x27;lotion-like&#x27; consistency. This consistency then works itself very easily into hair...whether wet or dry. Works fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product truly is a 10!! It&#x27;s is one product that does it all.  You&#x27;ll save money by eliminating the need to purchase multiple hair products.  My favorite feature is that It&#x27;s a 10 really does eliminates FRIZZ which is quite an accomplishment during the humid months!</li>
    <li> rinses off easily...  holds better than anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased...</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected. Smelled good when hairdresser used, but texture of the paste is too thick. Prefer to use Osis Hair Gum.   Product is probably best used by experts who know how to utilize the thickness of the hair product.  Does not even smell as good as Osis.   Bottle very hard to pump.</li>
    <li> I cannot praise it enough. It made my morning routine twice as productive and cut the time to 5 min to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I used to get this in my salon until they stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;m a male with short hair and like to spike it up a little.  This product doesn&#x27;t make my hair crusty or hard and still holds it in place while giving it a natural look.</li>
    <li> Really like It&#x27;s A 10 products, except this one. I found it hard to release from container and way too gunky, difficult to break down and disperse through hair. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> use this on my short hair and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff . My sons does also</li>
    <li> I have pumped it about 100 times and yet no product comes out. Have b&lt;br /&gt;No idea how it actually works on my hair. Have emailed conpany. Awaiting reply.</li>
    <li> The pump makes it easy to dispense just the right amount of product, which is also excellent for different hair types. It&#x27;s not available in many retailers near us, but I&#x27;ve found it online. Check the prices, tho, b/c Amazon isn&#x27;t always the cheapest place.</li>
    <li> One of the only products I can find that takes my thick, course hair and separates and texturizes it.  Leaving looking like a professional has finished it.  I wish it was less expensive</li>
    <li> The pump.on the product is broke and I&#x27;m a tad bit upset about that. I.Will figure out how to get the product out one way or another but it&#x27;s quite aggravating!</li>
    <li> Seriously, if all else fails, apply this and scrunch. It has saved me from the worst of all bad hair days. It holds a style without sticking, and if I brush it later I can get a completely dry look back again, not that it looks all that obvious before, but it won&#x27;t leave you looking greasy. One of the products I keep coming back to.</li>
    <li> Works really well...love it!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> I have short spiky hair and this is great. It is not oily like some of the others I have used. I took it with me the last time I went to get a hair cut and used it and the women that work there were really surprised at how I use it and the out come. I really rub it between my hands to dry it out a little and then really rub it in. Then I can spike it up with just a few pulls.</li>
    <li> Love the hair fiber, my beauty shop told me it was discontinued and they no longer could get it for me, but saw it on line so I order 6 tubes and I am loving it,  makes my hair look great!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff yields the perfect &amp;#34;piecy&amp;#34; texture using a small amount;  if you don&#x27;t over-apply,  it is non-greasy and will hold a style (with a fluff!) for a couple of days.  It is pricy but worth it,  I think.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried less than a pump on my medium length fine hair and find it weighs it down and feels sticky.</li>
    <li> This product keeps down the flyaways without making hair feel greasy. The bottle lasts a long time because you only need to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s A 10, works good for my hair. The price is right. It is not greasy. It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> love this product. doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down unless you use too much.  easy to retouch up hair with water.</li>
    <li> barely put a dot on my fingertip and my hair was ruined for the day...do not buy this product if you have fine hair!</li>
    <li> Easy to style without a comb. Hard to find where I am. I&#x27;m cheap but will spend the bucks for it.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried it on wet, dry, and damp hair thinking it will get better but no luck.  It is globby and sticky and no matter the amount I use weighs my hair down and leaves it looking nasty.  I should have returned it right away but gave it a few extra chances.  May save it for Halloween but other than that no use for it.</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product. It creates that elusive texturized &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care&amp;#34; (but secretly do) look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and order it. I believe you will like it.</li>
    <li> This Texture Paste is great, it makes for textured hair and all you have to use is a small amount rubbed into fingers and then separate pieces of the hair.</li>
    <li> love this been using it for years</li>
    <li> I have really short and thin hair and this product is awesome and I get height worth the money love it</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;monster hair,&amp;#34; or so says everyone whose ever cut it. THIS product is the one I reorder because it works!!</li>
    <li> New product for me.  I think I will like it.</li>
    <li> Disgusting texture like all muds and fiber products, but it REALLY works well. I have baby fine hair and this stuff can make it stand at attention for hours.</li>
    <li> Works exceptionally well on my short, extra fine hair.  Adds texture and body, just like it says it will.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I have fine hair and this product allows me to hold a set much longer.  It makes my hair feel thicker.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product works great for me....as I have thin hair and I keep it short.  It helps me get the spike look that I like.  It gives my hair a fuller look, but remember - only use a little bit....that&#x27;s all it takes.  My hairdresser used it on me and I loved it.</li>
    <li> This product hits every item on my hair fiber must-haves checklist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Good hold&lt;br /&gt;-Light, don&#x27;t need to use a ton&lt;br /&gt;-Not too greasy&lt;br /&gt;-Washes out relatively easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from gels to a stick wax -- I liked the wax for the way it was a malleable hold, but it was rather greasy.  Then I found this stuff and never looked back.  I will probably buy this product until it stops being made.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and use it after I&#x27;ve styled my hair with mousse and blow dryer.  A little of this goes a  long way in having certain areas have more height or be positioned just so.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this gives my hair the perfect look- I have used this for over a year and I&#x27;m always afraid they will discontinue it it- lol it doesnt dry my hair out- it still feels soft - I can run my fingers  through it but at the same time gives my curls seperation and control- it does take a little time to get the right amount! a little goes a very long way! I  take a very small bit not even the size of a dime - rub it between both palms and start to work it through my hair and then add little bit more as needed- very important if you get to much you wont like like it - I get complilments on my hair all the time! now this is for a soft flowing look - wont work if you are going for a spikey type look</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product for a soft non-sticky hold.  Too much and it will weigh down your hair.  No shine with this product would be the only negative comment.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these at once because I LOVE this product!  However, the pump does not work correctly on the first container I opened.  I hope the other 3 aren&#x27;t as messy/difficult to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is tacky, leaves hair feeling greasy and weird, not what I expected. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Only need a dab.... Very thick stuff but holds great!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I used Davines Wonder Wax for a long time, but it&#x27;s been discontinued.  This is not quite the same, but it works well with fine shorter hair and was the best thing I found as a replacement.  Only takes a tiny bit, adds some texture and keeps my hair under control without any obvious &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; feel or look.</li>
    <li> great product. can&#x27;t find in stores</li>
    <li> Been using on and off for past few years, especially when I have my hair short. A little bit goes a long way. Holds your hair without making it stiff.</li>
    <li> A very good product for difficult hair. This product holds like no other. Apply at once in the morning and you&#x27;re good for the entire day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use to style my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is now my go to hair product.  I was a die hard Bead Head Manipulator guy, but they changed their product and now its a rather messy soupy goop and not the thicker stuff that used to be so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a great hold, gives a matte look and isnt greasy.  The hold lasts all day and can be reworked a bit if need be.  I like that its cheaper and also its much easier to dispense with this container (hold button and its comes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Star!</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with a drop of oil for my very short hair for years.  I cannot get it any longer from my local hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair frizz free and looks great on silver hair.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product for styling your hair. If you have hard to handle hair..try this!! Thank You</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Great product! Can&#x27;t say enough! Changes hair texture!! Lasts all day! Don&#x27;t use too much, a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> the pump does not work and the product left my hair plastered to my head even though I used a tiny bit of it according to directions.</li>
    <li> this is a great styling product. it only takes a small amount for my short hair to give it definition!</li>
    <li> I use this maybe one too two times a day and I think it is quality and have used it for may years.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product I have found for my curly hair. It keeps my curls looking great, but not crunchy or gooey and it never clumps up or makes it look like you have white paint in your hair (yes, I&#x27;ve had this happen). If you use too much, your hair will feel sticky, but not necessarily bad...it just feels kind of gross. I have no idea what this product would do to straight hair, but for my curly hair, this is the only product for me.</li>
    <li> I have short hair that must be defined with texturing product and It&#x27;s A 10 is the ONLY product that really separates and stays.  Add some hair spray after you put in the product and style it the way you want it and you won&#x27;t have to touch your hair all day - it will stay perfectly.  If you want spiky, sassy, and a really texturized defined style you must use this product only.</li>
    <li> I live in a rural area of the country--I have very fine short hair--I discovered this thru a friend and now at least I have some texture for this very fine hair of mine.  I wear my hair rather spiked and this allows it to do so with softness.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, got my hair cut shorter than was planning and my hairdresser used this but she was out and was suppose to order me in some but didn&#x27;t. Found it on amazon and got two for her single price. The best stuff for short hair</li>
    <li> I have thick straight hair and nothing else works for me. This allows me to fluff up my hair so it is not flat on my head..I think this is the third bottle I have bought</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products but this one is the keeper for me. I have short hair and all I have to do is dry it, use a very small amount of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Texture Fiber&amp;#34; and I am good to go. I don&#x27;t even have to use hair spray any more. Highly recommend this product. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> You only have to use a little pea size drop on your fingers, will not weigh your hair down and combs right out! GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Great for those fly-aways and frizz!!</li>
    <li> If you have short hair and it is fine in texture this is the product you have been looking for! Hair will not get weighed down flat like other gels and waxes do with fine hair.</li>
    <li> How are there so many good reviews on this product? I love it&#x27;s a 10 products, they&#x27;re amazing. But this one did nothing for me. Very hard to disperse in hair. Sticky and weighs it down if you put too much. I&#x27;m all for products that game frizz but there are better products out there to do the job! Not impressed with this product at all.</li>
    <li> good for fine frizzy hair to keep fly aways at bay, a bit tacky to the touch but great for high humidity situations</li>
    <li> My wife uses it exclusively</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not the best I have ever tried.  I love the brand and have used the leave-in product for a long time.  Just thought I would try this texture fiber and it is ok the first day but unless you wash your hair every day, it doesn&#x27;t do much the second day.  More of just a mess on the second day.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I should be applying more on the second day or not.  Maybe i&#x27;ll try that before I give up on it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works with my thick, short hair. It easily lasts all day without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
