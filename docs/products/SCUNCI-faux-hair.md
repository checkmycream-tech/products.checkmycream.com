### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>Great clip!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>So I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I am going to Mexico and this will be great</li>
      <li>would be great.</li>
      <li>buy two of these, then take them off the plastic clips (save those clips for something else - they are awesome - really strong!).</li>
      <li>I ordered the Curly Jaw Clip extension and really loved it.  </li>
      <li>It is a great length and has a true brunette color.</li>
      <li>It perfectly looks like a new one.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all with this product, but it was very cheap for extensions</li>
      <li>You obviously won&#x27;t be able to wear it more than a about a dozen times, or wash it or curl it -</li>
      <li>i like it a lot :)</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>:) I really like it and have had it for about 6-7 months and its still in good shape, i tend to cram my hair stuff in baskets under the sink, and  youd  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product...turns any woman&#x27;s short hair into beautiful long curls.</li>
      <li>but it has stayed nice and pretty for a while..</li>
      <li>But hey - for the price, it&#x27;s a really nice look, and a fast \\&quot;do\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put my own hair in a ponytail, had a friend curl it, and then clipped the fake hair on top and blended it in as best I could.</li>
      <li>Great for Halloween or any special occasion hairdo, when your short locks just don&#x27;t do the trick!  </li>
      <li>but this thing seems like it would be fantastic for a night out or special event.</li>
      <li>A good way to make it last is to pull the hair forward around your neck anytime</li>
      <li>so thats cool.</li>
      <li>The only thing good about it was that it added length.</li>
      <li>Scunci,... not bad.</li>
      <li>because though the natural hair extensions out there would have probably more closely matched my fine hair, I think they wouldn&#x27;t have had as much volume as these hair clips had, and I would pay like 4 times more.</li>
      <li>This product is an extremely inexpensive way to give yourself a great hair day.</li>
      <li>I plan on wearing these maybe once again to get my money out of them, but after that they will be too tangled to use again, since they tangle quickly.</li>
      <li>You can also do more than just a pony tail with it.. and extremely low heat is fine if you want to curl it or straighten it.</li>
      <li>but it works as a fun addition on girls night out or date night.  </li>
      <li>Quite long , but very cute.</li>
      <li>The waves are just right as well - it looks fantastic if you have straightened and then curled your real hair into spirals.</li>
      <li>Also, they kinda of hurt your head because of the weight and the clip digs right in</li>
      <li>Had to return product-which was super easy since amazon makes it made simple and of no charge.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for an evening out when you need a fast, cheap solution.</li>
      <li>So be aware.</li>
      <li>First of all, it looked and felt fake--you could just tell without having to focus on it.</li>
      <li>This hair looks REALLY pretty on.</li>
      <li>and I feel like it was pulling my own hair out, since my own hair was fine and weak and fragile to begin with.</li>
      <li>I wore it to a gathering for the first time last week and it looked great all day long!</li>
      <li>Price is worth trying it if you want to try something new.</li>
      <li>And third, it shrivels and falls apart easily when you comb it or straighten it with even the lowest heat.</li>
      <li>This easy to use extension gave her the look she wanted for special outings and made the mistake with the straightener a little easier to take.</li>
      <li>I got lots of compliments about it, people saying it looked so real.  </li>
      <li>looks like my real hair.</li>
      <li>Either way, the hair looked real and luscious.</li>
      <li>Very crappy looking straight out of the box.</li>
      <li>No one knew it wasn&#x27;t my real hair.</li>
      <li>I wear lots of synthetic and real hair pieces and this one I DO NOT recommend.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally fine, silky, long hair that is a lighter brown color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent price for a &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>definitely a darker brown- worth the price.</li>
      <li>There are huge sections of coppery highlights that really over whelm the parts that actually are dark brunette.</li>
      <li>this is so cool, i wore it the other day and people didn&#x27;t even know it wasn&#x27;t my hair.  </li>
      <li>It looked natural.</li>
      <li>Really pretty and long-</li>
      <li>It blends nicely into average dark brown hair because it has a lot of colors/highlights in it.</li>
      <li>The hair is very pretty and the clip stays tight all day.</li>
      <li>I have only remy extensions and have never owned a synthetic product but as far as I can tell this</li>
      <li>There are obvious golden highlights in this product...not solid dark brunette</li>
      <li>As far as the quality goes, it&#x27;s what I expected, but the color is not Dark Brunette.</li>
      <li>I separated them and twist each of them and let them dry naturally.</li>
      <li>I am naturally curly long hair, and miss the length now that it&#x27;s short</li>

<li> I separated them and twist each of them and let them dry naturally.</li>
<li> I am naturally curly long hair, and miss the length now that it&#x27;s short</li>
<li> Nice hairpiece but difficult to wear due to the clip attached to it.</li>
<li> The only problem is that these don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> I have worn expensive weaves of all kinds and clipped real human hair on in every way possible, so I speak from experience when I say - not bad</li>
<li> They are big loose bouncy curls-</li>
<li> Some women have been able to tell that it&#x27;s fake (probably due to the shininess of the plastic)</li>
<li> When i bought this, i was a little hesitant because it just listed \\&quot;brown\\&quot; as the color, but when I used it, it matched my hair color exactly, the hair is blended with a few shades so it will match a variety of hair colors.</li>
<li> Not all the way curled, now I&#x27;ll have to boil it and curl it myself but to be honest, it&#x27;s not all that bad for the price</li>
<li> 20inches is a bit long for me</li>
<li> I lost a lot of my hair due to a medical problem and was looking for a solution for my graduation party.</li>
<li> This product is very heavy, looks fake and I have not been able to hide the big claw clip.</li>
<li> After it dried I keep it in the net and put it back in the box of the product.</li>
<li> Its LONG and the curls are tighter than I expected</li>
<li> So be careful of that.</li>
<li> We are talking a lot of hair on the salon floor, mixed with just a few tears.</li>
<li> I feel I made the right decision to buy the fake hair product,</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think it would stand up to daily extended use but for a few times a week for outings around town for a few hours, it does the trick.</li>
<li> even tho box says dark brunette.</li>
<li> Not worth the money and SLOWWWW shipping.</li>
<li> I put little bit of serum and combed it  with wood comb(gentlely).</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve asked several men and they had no idea it was fake.</li>
<li> After an unfortunate hair straightening incident my teenage daughter had to have her hair cut.</li>
<li> Just be careful of getting a curler near the fake hair, as it immediately burns and tangles and you have to end up cutting the burnt part out.</li>
<li> My clip was broken.  </li>
<li> Hard to put in and looks bad wearing it, will not buy from again.</li>
<li> After I used it, I washed it with shampoo and rin it with cold water.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s synthetic and when it gets dirty, it&#x27;s time to toss it.</li>
<li> I get about 10 uses out of it before the hairs start to clump together making it look ugly.</li>
<li> Then I pin the hair in at the base of my head, side by side.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this.</li>

    <li> 20inches is a bit long for me but it works as a fun addition on girls night out or date night.  saves me time is styling time</li>
    <li> There are obvious golden highlights in this product...not solid dark brunette even tho box says dark brunette. Either way, the hair looked real and luscious. Had to return product-which was super easy since amazon makes it made simple and of no charge.</li>
    <li> I wore it to a gathering for the first time last week and it looked great all day long! I got lots of compliments about it, people saying it looked so real.  Wonderful product...turns any woman&#x27;s short hair into beautiful long curls. I am naturally curly long hair, and miss the length now that it&#x27;s short but now I can have both!</li>

    <li> I have worn expensive weaves of all kinds and clipped real human hair on in every way possible, so I speak from experience when I say - not bad Scunci,... not bad. This product is an extremely inexpensive way to give yourself a great hair day. You obviously won&#x27;t be able to wear it more than a about a dozen times, or wash it or curl it - it&#x27;s synthetic and when it gets dirty, it&#x27;s time to toss it. But hey - for the price, it&#x27;s a really nice look, and a fast \\&quot;do\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is buy two of these, then take them off the plastic clips (save those clips for something else - they are awesome - really strong!). Then I pin the hair in at the base of my head, side by side. With two, it gives all the fullness and length you need. This hair looks REALLY pretty on. It blends nicely into average dark brown hair because it has a lot of colors/highlights in it. The waves are just right as well - it looks fantastic if you have straightened and then curled your real hair into spirals. Highly recommend for an evening out when you need a fast, cheap solution.</li>
    <li> Very crappy looking straight out of the box. I wear lots of synthetic and real hair pieces and this one I DO NOT recommend.  Hard to put in and looks bad wearing it, will not buy from again. I threw it away.  Not worth the money and SLOWWWW shipping.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t match my current hair color but this thing seems like it would be fantastic for a night out or special event. I have only remy extensions and have never owned a synthetic product but as far as I can tell this would be great. Price is worth trying it if you want to try something new. Its LONG and the curls are tighter than I expected so thats cool. They are big loose bouncy curls- the clip is sturdy too- I say try it!</li>
    <li> This product is very heavy, looks fake and I have not been able to hide the big claw clip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. My sister, my mom, my sister in law and I used it in my wedding day. It&#x27;s perfect. We love it. It looked natural. After I used it, I washed it with shampoo and rin it with cold water. I put little bit of serum and combed it  with wood comb(gentlely). After comb, I found out that the hair has 3 layers. I separated them and twist each of them and let them dry naturally. After it dried I keep it in the net and put it back in the box of the product. It perfectly looks like a new one. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally fine, silky, long hair that is a lighter brown color but I do a color gloss to get it to a darker brown. I lost a lot of my hair due to a medical problem and was looking for a solution for my graduation party. I feel I made the right decision to buy the fake hair product, because though the natural hair extensions out there would have probably more closely matched my fine hair, I think they wouldn&#x27;t have had as much volume as these hair clips had, and I would pay like 4 times more. So I am happy with it. I put my own hair in a ponytail, had a friend curl it, and then clipped the fake hair on top and blended it in as best I could. It matched my color well. Just be careful of getting a curler near the fake hair, as it immediately burns and tangles and you have to end up cutting the burnt part out. I plan on wearing these maybe once again to get my money out of them, but after that they will be too tangled to use again, since they tangle quickly. Also, they kinda of hurt your head because of the weight and the clip digs right in and I feel like it was pulling my own hair out, since my own hair was fine and weak and fragile to begin with. So be careful of that. Oh and I secured it with a ton of bobby pins, too.</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter needed. After an unfortunate hair straightening incident my teenage daughter had to have her hair cut. We are talking a lot of hair on the salon floor, mixed with just a few tears. She had enough hair left for a short ponytail. This easy to use extension gave her the look she wanted for special outings and made the mistake with the straightener a little easier to take. I don&#x27;t think it would stand up to daily extended use but for a few times a week for outings around town for a few hours, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> As far as the quality goes, it&#x27;s what I expected, but the color is not Dark Brunette. There are huge sections of coppery highlights that really over whelm the parts that actually are dark brunette. If you do not have highlights, it will not match your hair color.</li>
    <li> this is so cool, i wore it the other day and people didn&#x27;t even know it wasn&#x27;t my hair.  I am going to Mexico and this will be great, i don&#x27;t have to deal with my hair since it is so humid over there.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Curly Jaw Clip extension and really loved it.  It is a great length and has a true brunette color.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all with this product, but it was very cheap for extensions so I kinda figured from the start.  First of all, it looked and felt fake--you could just tell without having to focus on it. Second, you can only do a ponytail with it because there are no clips, just a big jaw clip one. And third, it shrivels and falls apart easily when you comb it or straighten it with even the lowest heat. Now I probably can&#x27;t return it anymore. The only thing good about it was that it added length. So my advice is to NOT buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great for Halloween or any special occasion hairdo, when your short locks just don&#x27;t do the trick!  It is as &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; as the Zohan would want!</li>
    <li> Nice hairpiece but difficult to wear due to the clip attached to it.</li>
    <li> Well, the hair in this thing is the same hair you find in barbie dolls. So be aware.</li>
    <li> Great clip! looks like my real hair.</li>
    <li> My clip was broken.  I had to take the hair off of it to wear it.  Very disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and I wear these every time I get dressed up. Some women have been able to tell that it&#x27;s fake (probably due to the shininess of the plastic) but I&#x27;ve asked several men and they had no idea it was fake. The only problem is that these don&#x27;t last very long. I get about 10 uses out of it before the hairs start to clump together making it look ugly. A good way to make it last is to pull the hair forward around your neck anytime you need to sit up against something, like in the car.  It&#x27;s a decent price for a &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; hair piece though.</li>
    <li> Not all the way curled, now I&#x27;ll have to boil it and curl it myself but to be honest, it&#x27;s not all that bad for the price</li>
    <li> Really pretty and long- definitely a darker brown- worth the price.</li>
    <li> Quite long , but very cute.</li>
