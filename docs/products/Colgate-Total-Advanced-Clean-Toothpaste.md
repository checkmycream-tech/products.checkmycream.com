      <li>I just rinse more after using it.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with the &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; pricing for so many items that I already purchase.</li>
      <li>I consider this specific Colgate version one of the best toothpastes on the market.</li>

      <li>I gave it four stars, just because the flavor is so strong.  </li>
      <li>Great regular toothpaste.</li>

      <li>Everything gives us cancer, so I&#x27;m going to brush my teeth with this stuff anyway because I have loved Colgate Total for years, I love toothpaste, not gel, and I like the whitening and the way it cleans my teeth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very useful to place to toothpaste vertically.</li>
      <li>clean and smooth everytime</li>
      <li>I originally picked up this toothpaste as an item that would get me a discount through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
      <li>I use this one in the daytime and whenever I feel like I need to clean my teeth again.</li>
      <li>Clean feeling all the time.  </li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean longer, and I tend to have fewer cavities pop up between checkups.</li>
      <li>Takes care of everything and makes my teeth feel clean all day.</li>
      <li>They do have a wide lid so it can be used as a stand which is nice, if you like that kind of thing.</li>
      <li>Makes teeth feel slickery clean.</li>
      <li>it leaves my mouth feeling so amazingly clean.</li>
      <li>Studies have shown that it has no long term detrimental effect on desirable oral flora (&#x27;good germs&#x27;).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cool minty toothpaste</li>
      <li>It makes my teeth feel super clean</li>
      <li>Then after I was amazed by how clean and fresh my mouth felt.</li>
      <li>I also love the larger size that I can&#x27;t find at Walgreens or CVSI&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite kind of toothpaste and for whatever reason, locally they do not sell it in this size!</li>
      <li>Taste good and 7.6 ounce is a quantity that takes long time.</li>
      <li>No crazy flavor / texture / feel.</li>
      <li>but they stay fresh</li>
      <li>Leaves my mouth feeling minty and fresh.</li>
      <li>Just nice solid toothpaste for all.</li>
      <li>Colgate Advanced Deep Clean contains more silica, and in a wider range of grit, from very fine and undetectable to larger and more noticeably coarse.</li>
      <li>ADVANCED CLEAN / DEEP CLEAN</li>
      <li>It truly cleans, keeps breath fresh, keeps your smile bright, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the place because it&#x27;s a paste.  </li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite toothpaste, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It does clean well and my mouth feels fresh afterwards, but if you are trying to avoid specks in your toothpaste you&#x27;ll want to steer clear of this one.</li>
      <li>Well made, packaged, and arrived on time exactly as ordered.</li>
      <li>have recently started buying more grocery items here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>; used to be this products varietal name, but Colgate is now applying the &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; labeling to most of the Colgate Total lineup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Colgate Total feels like a higher quality toothpaste than it&#x27;s competitors (notably Crest).</li>
      <li>My teeth are white, my gums are healthy and breath doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
      <li>Love this gritty tooth paste.  </li>
      <li>Last Thanksgiving, I tried Colgate Total Advanced Clean at my daughter&#x27;s and was very surprised by the great taste and the feel while I brushed.</li>
      <li>Colgate Total Advanced Deep Clean Toothpaste, 7.6oz is a super product.</li>
      <li>The new labeling reads &amp;#34;Colgate Total Advanced&amp;#34;, and features a prominent gold shield.</li>
      <li>I use it with an electric toothbrush and so doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
      <li>You like the feeling of glassy smooth, deeply cleaned teeth&lt;</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>You have especially sensitive teeth and gums -- you may want to explore gentler options.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>so there isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
      <li>There are however a few important differences that make the Colgate Total Advanced range, and the Deep Clean variety in particular unique amongst toothpastes here in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unique to the Deep Clean variety is a modified blend of silica (included in virtually all toothpastes as a cleaning and low-abrasion polishing agent).</li>
      <li>I trust Colgate deep clean toothpaste it keeps my teeth</li>
      <li>To my knowledge, my teeth haven&#x27;t gotten any more or less whiter since I started using the product.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>taste is unsurprisingly minty, enough to impart a clean sensation and some lasting freshness, but not so intense it burns or lingers beyond</li>
      <li>This is the ingredient that is not found in any other (to my knowledge) toothpaste available in the states, and is what allows them to make claims about 12 hours of efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the Total version, whether Deep Clean or Whitening varieties.</li>
      <li>I expect a large tube as this one will last me 2-3 months.</li>
      <li>I bought this toothpaste to replace a different kind of toothpaste that I didn&#x27;t like using because it contained little abrasive blue specks that would get stuck between my teeth and need to be flossed out.</li>
      <li>As it&#x27;s named, it&#x27;s complete.  </li>
      <li>Been a user of Colgate Total Advanced Total for as long as I can remember.</li>
      <li>If you have ever tried Pearl Drops or other home tooth polishes, this product is similar in concept but much much gentler and perfectly suitable for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use everyday and keep my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>If you consider your sensitivity level to be normal to only somewhat sensitive, I think this product would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Of course the day after I bought, the warning came out that an ingredient was cancer-causing. Everything gives us cancer, so I&#x27;m going to brush my teeth with this stuff anyway because I have loved Colgate Total for years, I love toothpaste, not gel, and I like the whitening and the way it cleans my teeth. The cost was high, even with Amazon Prime, but the size was a great value and it&#x27;s a product I know I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Well made, packaged, and arrived on time exactly as ordered. One of the best prices for the item I have seen online. Would highly recommend. Crest is too mainstream. This cleans well, a little goes a long way, and isn&#x27;t overly sweet or minty. Perfect toothpaste IMHO.</li>
    <li> Its my favorite toothpaste. This one has an easy open/close top which I like.  This size should last me the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase.  Reasonably priced.  Thank You !</li>
    <li> I trust Colgate deep clean toothpaste it keeps my teeth clean and smooth everytime I brush with it I recommend this toothpaste.  I also love the larger size that I can&#x27;t find at Walgreens or CVSI&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a toothpaste so there isn&#x27;t much to say. It&#x27;s good, and I love the STAND-UP CAP. It&#x27;s very useful to place to toothpaste vertically.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price - absolutely a daily routine must!  I routinely try different toothpaste brands, depending on whatever I have a coupon for (so I&#x27;m a couponer, don&#x27;t judge!).  My husband opened the 4 oz. tube of Colgate Deep Clean that we had stored in the linen closet, so I tried it for a few days myself.  And to my happy surprise, the prominent coffee and tea stains on my bottom canines that I&#x27;ve had since forever noticeably started diminishing (and that was with a toothbrush that needed replacing)!!  The stains aren&#x27;t completely gone, but there is DEFINITELY a difference that I usually don&#x27;t see unless I use 3D White (which due to tooth sensitivity I usually have to stay away from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a larger tube and am keeping my Amazon subscription, as I&#x27;ve looked at various stores and this particular formula isn&#x27;t being sold in my area anymore.  It truly cleans, keeps breath fresh, keeps your smile bright, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the place because it&#x27;s a paste.  A little goes a long way, so a 7 oz. tube will definitely last your entire family a while!</li>
    <li> ADVANCED CLEAN / DEEP CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;This product is currently undergoing a branding/labeling transition that may be confusing for some. &amp;#34;Advanced Clean&amp;#34; used to be this products varietal name, but Colgate is now applying the &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; labeling to most of the Colgate Total lineup. The new labeling reads &amp;#34;Colgate Total Advanced&amp;#34;, and features a prominent gold shield. The variety is now called &amp;#34;Deep Clean&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;Love the stand-up cap, which allows it to be stored on its end -- and take up less space in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TASTE &amp; TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;The taste is unsurprisingly minty, enough to impart a clean sensation and some lasting freshness, but not so intense it burns or lingers beyond it&#x27;s welcome. The texture is typical of &#x27;paste&#x27; type dentfrices, however it is subtly &#x27;grittier&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS &amp; HEALTH CLAIMS&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are mostly standard fare for mass-market toothpastes, including cleaning agents and fluoride for cavity prevention. There are however a few important differences that make the Colgate Total Advanced range, and the Deep Clean variety in particular unique amongst toothpastes here in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Colgate Total toothpastes contain triclosan, a skin and mucous membrane-safe germ killing ingredient that you likely already use daily in the form of anti-bacterial soaps, lotions, and sanitizers. When added to toothpaste it helps kill undesirable oral bacteria (the kind that cause plaque, tartar, gingivitis and cavities). Studies have shown that it has no long term detrimental effect on desirable oral flora (&#x27;good germs&#x27;).  This is the ingredient that is not found in any other (to my knowledge) toothpaste available in the states, and is what allows them to make claims about 12 hours of efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unique to the Deep Clean variety is a modified blend of silica (included in virtually all toothpastes as a cleaning and low-abrasion polishing agent). Colgate Advanced Deep Clean contains more silica, and in a wider range of grit, from very fine and undetectable to larger and more noticeably coarse. In my experience, this makes for more effective cleaning, and leaves my teeth feeling polished and glassy-smooth. It also helps prevent and even dislodge some existing tartar buildup between dental visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOFTSCRUB FOR YOUR TEETH&lt;br /&gt;I use this as my daily toothpaste, and while it is slightly grittier than other toothpastes, it is not coarse to the point of harshness or outright abrasiveness. If you have ever tried Pearl Drops or other home tooth polishes, this product is similar in concept but much much gentler and perfectly suitable for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S FOR YOU IF...&lt;br /&gt;- You want healthy mouth, teeth and gums with fewer &#x27;bad&#x27; germs&lt;br /&gt;- You want to keep tartar from reforming after a good dental cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- You like the feeling of glassy smooth, deeply cleaned teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINK TWICE IF...&lt;br /&gt;- You are triclosan-phobic (I am not, clearly). Some people believe this additive isn&#x27;t good for you (in toothpaste, handsoap, or anywhere else for that matter)&lt;br /&gt;- You have especially sensitive teeth and gums -- you may want to explore gentler options. If you consider your sensitivity level to be normal to only somewhat sensitive, I think this product would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED: Yes.</li>
    <li> I originally picked up this toothpaste as an item that would get me a discount through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program. I figured I&#x27;m going to need toothpaste anyway, so I might as well have it delivered to my door. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now with no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste works well enough. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my teeth or gums, nor has it caused any infections or any other issues in my mouth. It freshens my breath and kills enough of the bacteria that I don&#x27;t get nasty breath later in the day. To my knowledge, my teeth haven&#x27;t gotten any more or less whiter since I started using the product. You&#x27;ll want to look to other methods or toothpastes if that&#x27;s your objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Total feels like a higher quality toothpaste than it&#x27;s competitors (notably Crest). All-in-all, I don&#x27;t have any complaints. As with all health-related items, your mileage may vary. Regardless, I&#x27;d recommend it for general usage and as a way to get to that 15 percent discount on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Been a user of Colgate Total Advanced Total for as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s a good brand and I like it. I use it with an electric toothbrush and so doesn&#x27;t require much. I expect a large tube as this one will last me 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Prefer gel toothpaste to the paste versions but can&#x27;t seem to find gel versions for subscribe n save. So I&#x27;m ordering this on the subscribe n save for now. It works ok.</li>
    <li> It is what it says.  It came on the 8th day, which was the last day of the four-day ETA.  But it got here &amp;#34;on time.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Your mouth tingles when you brush your teeth but they stay fresh seems like forever. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars, just because the flavor is so strong.  Apparently I lean toward blandness, because others I&#x27;ve talked to like it as is.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t toss it out.  I just rinse more after using it.</li>
    <li> My fav toothpaste to date. Leaves my mouth feeling minty and fresh. When I use it it&#x27;s like I feel the mint throughout my entire body lol....It&#x27;s a cool minty toothpaste</li>
    <li> great product at a great price  thanks for the product would buy from you again thats the bottom line cause i said so  two thumbs up</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste.  As it&#x27;s named, it&#x27;s complete.  Takes care of everything and makes my teeth feel clean all day.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this toothpaste anymore.  Its the best.  Clean feeling all the time.  Bring it back Colgate!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Its toothpaste, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Colgate Total Advanced Deep Clean Toothpaste, 7.6oz is a super product. It makes my teeth feel super clean and I like the taste of the toothpaste. Twice daily brushing makes my teeth look great.</li>
    <li> I like it better then my using toothpaste. I want to buy another one. My husband also likes it. It&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite toothpaste, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it available on Amazon. Any time I attempt to switch toothpastes, I always end up coming back to this one. My teeth feel clean longer, and I tend to have fewer cavities pop up between checkups. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering this product to save trips to the store.</li>
    <li> Does not have whitening agents which are harmful to gums.  My periodontis  told me to only use a toothpaste without whitening agents.  And the only thing drug stores and supermarkets carry are &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes.  Plus it has an ingredient that is anti gingivitus</li>
    <li> THE CAP IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SNAP SHUT</li>
    <li> Subscriber savings item.  Saves a trip to store.</li>
    <li> Has a flip top lid, that&#x27;s all you need. I really hate twist off and on caps on my toothpaste and so I like these. They do have a wide lid so it can be used as a stand which is nice, if you like that kind of thing.</li>
    <li> Great regular toothpaste. I use this one in the daytime and whenever I feel like I need to clean my teeth again.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used that works. Recently switched to this toothpaste as per my hygienist&#x27;s suggestion to help fight my periodontal disease. My teeth are white, my gums are healthy and breath doesn&#x27;t stink. I say this is the most fantastic thing ever!</li>
    <li> I consider this specific Colgate version one of the best toothpastes on the market. Only Toms of Maine (a colgate brand) has organic versions to rival this one.</li>
    <li> Colgate Total Advanced Clean is my perfect toothpaste. I am a former &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste user. I began to dislike the chemical taste of commercial toothpaste. Last Thanksgiving, I tried Colgate Total Advanced Clean at my daughter&#x27;s and was very surprised by the great taste and the feel while I brushed. Then after I was amazed by how clean and fresh my mouth felt. Now I only purchase this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently started buying more grocery items here on Amazon. I am so pleased with the &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; pricing for so many items that I already purchase. This will go on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, and it rocks that perfectly! No crazy flavor / texture / feel. Just nice solid toothpaste for all.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothpastes....</li>
    <li> too small an item for my use would not order it again</li>
    <li> Just like Colgate that I use all of the time, good paste.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste to replace a different kind of toothpaste that I didn&#x27;t like using because it contained little abrasive blue specks that would get stuck between my teeth and need to be flossed out. Unfortunately, what I didn&#x27;t realize was this toothpaste also contains little abrasive specks, but in this case they are white. I still need to floss my teeth after using this toothpaste, which I was trying to avoid since I floss before I brush. It does clean well and my mouth feels fresh afterwards, but if you are trying to avoid specks in your toothpaste you&#x27;ll want to steer clear of this one.</li>
    <li> Love this gritty tooth paste.  Makes teeth feel slickery clean.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite kind of toothpaste and for whatever reason, locally they do not sell it in this size! What a nice surprise to see that it was available on Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save! Very happy with the purchase...it leaves my mouth feeling so amazingly clean.</li>
    <li> Most people have probably used more types of toothpastes than they can remember, myself included. The past few years I am been using the Colgate pastes as I am not a fan of the gels. I like the Total version, whether Deep Clean or Whitening varieties. It is so hard to compare the effectiveness between different toothpastes so I won&#x27;t try and guess but I always get good checkups at the dentist.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use everyday and keep my teeth clean. Taste good and 7.6 ounce is a quantity that takes long time.</li>
    <li> My fav brand but it&#x27;s paste and I love gel so I&#x27;ll be switching.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste. Dentist said I had hardly any plaque in a year and helps keep my teeth white</li>
