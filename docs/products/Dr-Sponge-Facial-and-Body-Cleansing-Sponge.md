      <li>I have been reading tons of articles about charcoal and how great it is for your skin.  </li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>Worked great up until then.  </li>
      <li>It was too squishy to feel like it was doing any good exfoliating.</li>
      <li>it did a good job.</li>
      <li>It is very unique, but works great.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product and love it!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
      <li>I think a good exfoliating cloth is better.</li>
      <li>I like how it cleans but didn&#x27;t notice any difference to be honest</li>
      <li>It fits nicely in one&#x27;s hand too.</li>
      <li>I love this sponge, it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of soap and suds up amazingly</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It seems more dense and exfoliating.</li>
      <li>Yields a healthy skin balance&lt;</li>
      <li>It could be slightly more abrasive</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this sponge.  </li>
      <li>and I think it holds my liquid soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) a lot better.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it</li>
      <li>Love these sponges. .</li>
      <li>A better and safer alternative to the plastic loofahs.</li>
      <li>Great sponge, but the very first thing I recommend doing is removing the string (unless you absolutely need it).</li>
      <li>: Rub the magic sponge and be richly rewarded.</li>
      <li>So soft and gentle, yet does a great job cleansing!</li>
      <li>Nice, large, easy on the face sponge.</li>
      <li>my skin is squeaky clean</li>
      <li>nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle and was PERFECT when I was going through a round of accutane.</li>
      <li>It sounds more like a cleverly worded marketing technique than anything else.</li>
      <li>I love that it is all natural</li>
      <li>This one is big enough even for my body and works great on my face.</li>
      <li>I used it to clean the fresh rose mask as it&#x27;s very hard to clean with hand.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this sponge because i have the smaller version for face</li>
      <li>I bought several of these Dr. Sponge sponges and I love them.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the soft exfoliation of this sponge.</li>
      <li>It is not scratchy and yet it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>but it is large and good for everyday use and is gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>Oh...it has a great hand feel, too...not too big and not too small.</li>
      <li>Dr Sponge Facial and Body Cleansing Sponge is soft and easy to use.</li>
      <li>(Skin was hyper sensitive and &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>Sponges certainly always benefit from hanging rather than just sitting on a shelf in the shower, but for me personally it wasn&#x27;t worth the discomfort.</li>
      <li>so I particularly like this charcoal one.</li>
      <li>It is soft and works really well.</li>
      <li>It was too soft to offer and real exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I also bought a few for my friends and they love it too.</li>
      <li>As far as clearing pores, oil, and blackheads, the sponge does not compare to my sisal washcloth, soap, and baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This does not exfoliate the skin at all because the sponge is soft, like a sponge you use to wash your dishes.</li>
      <li>, it cleans really well, and it lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>It also takes forever to absorb water when you first get it wet.</li>
      <li>For a while I&#x27;d use the string to hang it on a hook I have in the shower, but when you&#x27;re actually using the sponge the string will pull on hair follicles and all-around just make the sponging process kind of unpleasant (as a male with a normal amount of body hair).</li>

<li> Used this bad boy for about 3 months before it started to break down.</li>
<li> It was a $13 useless sponge.</li>
<li> in all, I found this sponge to be yet another useless beauty product.</li>
<li> It was just stupid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I tried this product and love it!  It is very unique, but works great.  I love that it is all natural, it cleans really well, and it lasts a long time.  I used the charcoal for detoxifying and oily skin and could tell a big difference after using only a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers are correct in saying this sponge has a strange sliminess to it, but I don&#x27;t mind and I like this sponge a lot. It could be slightly more abrasive but it is large and good for everyday use and is gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> my skin is squeaky clean</li>
    <li> It already looks like I had it for awhile. For the price, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used this bad boy for about 3 months before it started to break down. My only complaint is it&#x27;s rather hard to get all the soap out of it and, naturally, if you leave any soap in it a musty smell will happen over night. Takes a long time to dry, as well, and unless it was 80+ degrees that day it was always anywhere from 20-50% wet the next day.

    <li> Dr Sponge Facial and Body Cleansing Sponge is soft and easy to use. It fits nicely in one&#x27;s hand too. However, I have not experienced any exfoliating powers of this sponge. Its maker claims that the sponge achieves the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Improves the overall skin texture&lt;br /&gt;- Yields a healthy skin balance&lt;br /&gt;- Clears pores, removes makeup, oil and blackheads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the sponge for several weeks, my overall skin texture remained the same. I am not sure what the second claim even means. It sounds more like a cleverly worded marketing technique than anything else. I haven&#x27;t tried using the sponge to remove my makeup, so I cannot attest to its makeup removing powers. As far as clearing pores, oil, and blackheads, the sponge does not compare to my sisal washcloth, soap, and baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I found this sponge to be yet another useless beauty product.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a week now.  Product works as described.  UPDATE: After about 3 weeks the sponge fell apart.  Worked great up until then.  I will probably look for something with a longer life span than a 3 weeks to a month.  I did use this as a body scrub sponge so that probably shortened the life.  Would probably last longer as just a facial sponge.</li>
    <li> A better and safer alternative to the plastic loofahs. Works great and I think it holds my liquid soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) a lot better.</li>
    <li> I used it to clean the fresh rose mask as it&#x27;s very hard to clean with hand. it did a good job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit to using this product. It was too squishy to feel like it was doing any good exfoliating. It did suds up like it said and always dried up in my shower after each use and rehydrated well the next time I ran it under water. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Just an expensive sponge that doesnt really do anything, except always feel slimy. It also takes forever to absorb water when you first get it wet.</li>
    <li> This one seems so big that it stays too wet and soft. I like another one I&#x27;ve used better.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00ENJN8S0/ref&#x3D;aw_ls_2_2?colid&#x3D;3PGTO4HFL5YI9&amp;coliid&#x3D;I1PQ2J67KHXED8&lt;br /&gt;It seems more dense and exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Great sponge, but the very first thing I recommend doing is removing the string (unless you absolutely need it). For a while I&#x27;d use the string to hang it on a hook I have in the shower, but when you&#x27;re actually using the sponge the string will pull on hair follicles and all-around just make the sponging process kind of unpleasant (as a male with a normal amount of body hair). Sponges certainly always benefit from hanging rather than just sitting on a shelf in the shower, but for me personally it wasn&#x27;t worth the discomfort.</li>
    <li> Nice, large, easy on the face sponge.</li>
    <li> I bought the sponge because I heard about the benefits of charcoal in no way do I detect that in the item. I don&#x27;t know why it even comes in a variety of elements because all it is is a giant sponge. This does not exfoliate the skin at all because the sponge is soft, like a sponge you use to wash your dishes. It&#x27;s basically something you can use to get your body wash on the skin but I can get that by spending significantly less. I expected this to be similar to a soft loofa to buff away the dead skin , this product is hopeless for that. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love these sponges. . Just not very great if u travel all the time. . Needs  to be hung to dry.</li>
    <li> I have been reading tons of articles about charcoal and how great it is for your skin.  I have a charcoal mask and a charcoal moisturizer and the next step was a charcoal cleanser.  That is where this sponge comes in.  It is a great tool in the shower or bath for exfoliation.  It is soft and works really well. I think that you keep it for a few months and then toss it.  I love the feel of this sponge.  It is not scratchy and yet it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  Oh...it has a great hand feel, too...not too big and not too small.</li>
    <li> So soft and gentle, yet does a great job cleansing!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! I bought several of these Dr. Sponge sponges and I love them. I have oily skin so I particularly like this charcoal one. I have tried other brands before they are too small and flat in size. This one is big enough even for my body and works great on my face. I also bought a few for my friends and they love it too.</li>
    <li> It was just stupid. It was a $13 useless sponge. I ended up throwing the thing out after three uses.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this sponge because i have the smaller version for face and I LOVE it but for some reason this sponge has already begun to fall apart! I havent even used it for a month and the sponge is literally disintgrating before my eyes): For a 14 dollar sponge I was hoping it would last longer...</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of soap and suds up amazingly</li>
    <li> I like how it cleans but didn&#x27;t notice any difference to be honest</li>
    <li> Like these sponges, I went ahead and reordered the face sponges on their website with a coupon code I had.  I really enjoy the soft exfoliation of this sponge.</li>
    <li> This just seems like a sponge to me... nothing special.  I should have saved my money.</li>
    <li> I used this thing for about 2 weeks. It seems like it would just harbor bacteria and dead skin cells sitting in the shower. It was too soft to offer and real exfoliation. I did not notice any improvement in my skin, in fact I think it got a little worse.</li>
    <li> Rubbing this on my skin made me feel like a character in a fairy tale: Rub the magic sponge and be richly rewarded. Sadly, no magic happened. I think a good exfoliating cloth is better.</li>
