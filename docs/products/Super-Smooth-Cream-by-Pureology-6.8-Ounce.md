      <li>i use this religiously and it smells wonderful leaves</li>
      <li>I figured, why not; one more to try!!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

      <li>and I love everything about it.  </li>
      <li>Can be used on dry hair or after shampoo - best results with use of blower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other hair products, but this is the best one I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is colored.</li>
      <li>This product works well on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I did not get the smooth hair I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>I loved this product when it was used at a salon and my hair was blown out by a professional</li>
      <li>This is not at all like the Super Smooth oil.  </li>
      <li>I have very very fine hair that just keeps getting frizzier and crazier as I get older.</li>
      <li>Maybe this works better for people with curly hair, but my straight hair that gets frizzy</li>
      <li>I have pretty fine hair and this controls the frizz even in the summer.  </li>
      <li>When I use the Super Smooth Cream is looks thick, shiny, and beautiful.</li>
      <li>Working well, pleasant, very light smell, however Oribe light moisturizing cream and gold lust oil are the best for my mid length, naturally curly, dry, freeze prune hair, also dyed with natural hair colors in low humidity Colorado.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I know it seems pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything great!  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product by my hair dresser</li>
      <li>i have very thick, wavey, colored hair, and use super smooth shampoo and conditioner, and recently purchased the super smooth cream, and i love it!</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair that turns into a huge mess in the humidity.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have very frizzy hair and was expecting to see a difference.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference, but I just like to put some sort of moisture in my hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant yet subtle.</li>
      <li>There is no more frizz, and my hair looks amazingly healthy and shiny!</li>
      <li>The product seemed fine, but I paid a lot and felt it did exactly what other products from Target or Sally beauty supply would do.  </li>
      <li>This came highly recommended by a friend, so my expectations were set quite high..</li>
      <li>This hair cream helps to keep my hair smooth, shiny and straight after using a flat iron; and I only have to use it once (on damp hair).  </li>
      <li>A tiny bit of the product goes a looooong way, which makes very economical in the long run.</li>
      <li>My hair looks soft and SMOOTH, without any of those little ends sticking out all over.</li>
      <li>I found this at my old salon and now that I&#x27;ve moved I buy it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>This product controls my hair and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>Keeps hair soft</li>
      <li>It really helps keep my hair under control in especially humid conditions.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy or sticky.</li>
      <li>This thick cream is applied to clean, damp hair and it leaves the hair soft and silky, yet controllable.</li>
      <li>My son like it and using it, his hair are thin and not curly, he thinks his hair looks better with this cream.</li>
      <li>I was using way too much at first, which was a waste.</li>
      <li>A little heavy for fine hair.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t like to fuss too much; i just want things to work, and i will pay a little extra if they do, and this does what it is supposed to.</li>

    <li> Smells really good! Works well. A little heavy for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My hair is thick with some body, but becomes out of control with humidity. I needed a product that would not flatten my hair, nor leave it \\&quot;tacky\\&quot;. This thick cream is applied to clean, damp hair and it leaves the hair soft and silky, yet controllable. A tiny bit of the product goes a looooong way, which makes very economical in the long run. Very happy with this product.</li>

    <li> I have dry, unruly, wavy, thick hair.  This product tames it and makes it a bit sleeker.  I combine it with a curling gel and get great results.  It&#x27;s a go to item for me after an evening shower to add a little manageability.</li>

    <li> My hairdresser said this is now discontinued so I purchased this online. Whoever is selling it needs to tidy up the listing as in one area it says it is in a pump container. I read the questions and answers to make sure it was a tube as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>

    <li> Good for reducing frizz. I use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different products for years to take away the frizz after I wash my hair. I&#x27;ve used every product on the market made for frizz!! I finally heard about Pureology from a friend. I figured, why not; one more to try!!&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you! This product is the BEST on the market and really does work. My hair looks soft and SMOOTH, without any of those little ends sticking out all over. There is no more frizz, and my hair looks amazingly healthy and shiny! I know it seems pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I was using way too much at first, which was a waste. I now realize that a small amount goes a long way.

Go for it; you&#x27;ll be thrilled!</li>
    <li> I did not get the smooth hair I was expecting.  Maybe this works better for people with curly hair, but my straight hair that gets frizzy it didn&#x27;t do anything for.</li>
