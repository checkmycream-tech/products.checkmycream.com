      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and enjoy that it provides remarkable holding power.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best strong hold on the market.</li>
      <li>Using a lot of this might harm hair because its very strong.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 4/5 because it doesn&#x27;t smell good, IMO it should either smell good or no smell at all.</li>
      <li>And with the wax stick most products clump, this does not.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many spiking gels that I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
      <li>The barber I take my son to sells it for 5 dollars more that amazon.</li>
      <li>I use got2bglued ultra glue then spray with hairspray because that doesn&#x27;t fully keep it up either, but it works better than this and its $4 at the store.</li>
      <li>I love the Mohawk line from bedhead.</li>
      <li>It is great for my short hairdo, spiked on top.</li>
      <li>I put some on my hands and add a few drops of water, rub my hands together and run it through my hair from the roots out and it spikes perfectly.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome for holding up hair that wants to lay flat!</li>
      <li>It probably works fairly well for short hair.  </li>
      <li>It is all that I use to keep my hair vertical...great for mohawks and any other hair style that needs to be elevated for a great style.</li>
      <li>if you want a product with super hold, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I got this one faster than ever before; and they always come quickly.</li>
      <li>Have tried many other products that just got gooey and such a good price.[ASIN:B002N5MI3C TIGI Bed</li>
      <li>Strong hold for my 3 year old&#x27;s spiky hair.  </li>
      <li>but this combination does exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>safety first, protect yo face.</li>
      <li>Does exactly  what i want</li>
      <li>If you use too much hair will be crunchy and feel dense.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I got this gel because of good reviews, but it sucks.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love it but as stiff as it gets</li>
      <li>great product, really tight long lasting hold.</li>
      <li>Great for short, thick hair!</li>
      <li>Not worth the money for a &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; Mohawk- not cutting it close.  </li>
      <li>When used together my curls have a super firm hold without being crunchy.</li>
      <li>Good for a dirty devil locks style.</li>
      <li>Ordered it after using other products from Bed Head, this thing REALLY holds hair well.</li>

    <li> I had tried this TIGI Bed Head Hard Head Mohawk Gel in the past for my hair, but couldn&#x27;t find it any longer. Was getting desperate when I thought of Amazon and there it was! It is great for my short hairdo, spiked on top. Have tried many other products that just got gooey and such a good price.[ASIN:B002N5MI3C TIGI Bed Head Men Power Play Gel, 6.76 Ounce]</li>
    <li> Bed head hard head is the ultimate in keeping wild styles in place.  It is all that I use to keep my hair vertical...great for mohawks and any other hair style that needs to be elevated for a great style.</li>
    <li> I got this gel because of good reviews, but it sucks. It didn&#x27;t keep my mohawk up whatsoever. It just fell over. I use got2bglued ultra glue then spray with hairspray because that doesn&#x27;t fully keep it up either, but it works better than this and its $4 at the store. I&#x27;m disappointed with this gel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this gel for my son who has a mohawk.  He wanted his hair to spike up.  The gel dried very fast and got really hard.  Unfortunately his hair didn&#x27;t spike, probably because he has really curly hair.  This is a really good gel though, if you want your hair to stay put.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Great for short, thick hair!</li>
    <li> I got this one faster than ever before; and they always come quickly. Great great gel for my husband and we can only get it online.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best strong hold on the market. It doesn&#x27;t fizzle and lose its kick when drying like others.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many spiking gels that I&#x27;ve lost count. When my stylist used the hard head at one of my visits, I went right to amazon and ordered some. Its not gooey or stringy and it doesn&#x27;t clump your hair into separate globs. In other words it works just like it should. I put some on my hands and add a few drops of water, rub my hands together and run it through my hair from the roots out and it spikes perfectly. It lasts a long time but I&#x27;ve added the bed head hair spray recently and it stays perfect my whole 12 hour work shift, and wind can not touch the stuff. I love it but as stiff as it gets I would not recommend trying to brush it out \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love the Mohawk line from bedhead. I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to find anything that will make it behave. It works so well for me. Definitely makes a Mohawk stay! Delivered on time and plastic sealed too.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair....and this is the ONLY product that holds up all day long.  My hair is cut short with a bit of a spike...it molds beautifully...your search has ended for the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> It probably works fairly well for short hair.  Not worth the money for a &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; Mohawk- not cutting it close.  Good for a dirty devil locks style.</li>
    <li> Does exactly  what i want</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. Excellent product.  Highly recommended. Fast delivery. Great price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and enjoy that it provides remarkable holding power. Also gives different results depending upon whether applied to wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> great product, really tight long lasting hold. practically water proof. some gels run down into your eyes, blinding, stinging you. not bed head hard head. jet blast proof. toight like a toiger. like a hair hard hat. safety first, protect yo face.</li>
    <li> if you want a product with super hold, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair - I use this product along with a curling lotion. When used together my curls have a super firm hold without being crunchy. A little goes a long way. If you use too much hair will be crunchy and feel dense.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Wish I had hair so I could use it. I Ordered it for my wife.</li>
    <li> This product works great without leaving a residue on your hair!  Keeps hair in place all day, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Ordered it after using other products from Bed Head, this thing REALLY holds hair well. Using a lot of this might harm hair because its very strong.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 4/5 because it doesn&#x27;t smell good, IMO it should either smell good or no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this product was not effective for me.  Maybe because I don&#x27;t have a Mohawk???  Maybe my needs just didn&#x27;t meet the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
    <li> Strong hold for my 3 year old&#x27;s spiky hair.  Hair doesn&#x27;t fall down throughout the day.  Smells good.  Great price.  The barber I take my son to sells it for 5 dollars more that amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great with the. Tigi BedHead stick.  Mohawk stands up just how I like it!  And with the wax stick most products clump, this does not.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a Mohawk but I use a dab of this product mixed with my regular gel to add a little extra body to my hair.  I haven&#x27;t a good gel that gives me what I need but this combination does exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Very very very very thick product. Like rubbing glue in your hair. You can only remove product if you shower and shampoo it out. Turns flaky after about 2-3 hours.</li>
    <li> My boys all wear spiked hair.  This stuff is awesome for holding up hair that wants to lay flat! awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> The product came in a timely manner and I had no problems with the package.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years now, as I have a hairstyle that needs to stand up.  If you like stiff hold this product is for you!</li>
