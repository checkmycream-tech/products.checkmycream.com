      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping that I got an authentic product.</li>

      <li>I actually bought it on sale and the price was higher than from Amazon.  </li>

<li> after saying all that I must admit I ordered two sets of this shampoo and conditioner along with a two other large bottles of shampoo and conditioner for my husband (there were two other small bottles in the box as well).  </li>
<li> It does smell different and it is runnier than the small bottles I have purchased from the salon.</li>
<li> and it was a mess inside the bag.  </li>
<li> I use this on my kids hair and no more tangles.</li>
<li> They were all packaged together and the box was very heavy.  </li>
<li> My hair is between shoulder length and sometimes longer, thick</li>
<li> The person who received this item was told by a hair salon not to order it online because some people have reported getting what appeared to an inauthentic product or something that gone bad.  </li>

    <li> good product, good value</li>
    <li> Great product. Conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried out of many brands at Ulta, Sephora, and Salons. Conditioner literally takes out tangles instantly and leaves hair silky soft. I use this on my kids hair and no more tangles. Product does what it says. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> COLORPROOF CRAZYSMOOTH IS THE BEST</li>
    <li> Product smelled rancid when opened and not at all like the real thing. Given as a gift and opened after the return eligibility date.  The person who received this item was told by a hair salon not to order it online because some people have reported getting what appeared to an inauthentic product or something that gone bad.  $80.00 thrown away.  Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Leaves your hair smelling scrumptous and looking gorgeous!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am very happy with it.  I was very glad to find the 25 oz. with the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I love it. Good for the hair.</li>
    <li> Just got mine... the shampoo was opened and it was everywhere.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> It does smell different and it is runnier than the small bottles I have purchased from the salon. I am hoping that I got an authentic product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Could be a little paranoia but I feel like the formula is different than what I&#x27;ve used from a salon. Guess that&#x27;s what I get for trying to save $40! I will only purchase from a reputable salon from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I discovered it from a salon in Olympia, Washington while on vacation.  It really made a difference on my hair and it stays cleaner longer than before.  I actually bought it on sale and the price was higher than from Amazon.  My hair is between shoulder length and sometimes longer, thick although very fine, curly with a lot of grey on top of that so it is hard to find a good product that controls all aspects.  Of course like most women I don&#x27;t like the curl I have so I flat iron my hair and found it to be healthier now that I have switched products.  This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after saying all that I must admit I ordered two sets of this shampoo and conditioner along with a two other large bottles of shampoo and conditioner for my husband (there were two other small bottles in the box as well).  They were all packaged together and the box was very heavy.  Upon opening the box inside each set was in its own plastic bag.  When I opened the one bag of shampoo &amp; conditioner the pump top was broke and it was a mess inside the bag.  I believe there was too much weight inside the box without packing that kept the products from shifting which I&#x27;m sure caused the pump to break.  I don&#x27;t blame the person who sold tis product, I believe someone at Amazon wasn&#x27;t thinking when they prepared the order.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Costs more than most but definitely leaves your hair softer and more manageable</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps prolong my color and reduce frizz.</li>
    <li> company was wonderful to deal with.  Item is perfect.  My hair looks great and is so smooth.  Cheaper than buying at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
