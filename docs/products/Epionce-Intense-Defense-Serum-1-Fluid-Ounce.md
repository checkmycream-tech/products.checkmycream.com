### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent serum!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
      <li>Plus the price was great!</li>
      <li>Epionce is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>so I am happy.</li>
      <li>I love this line of skin care!!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>In love with Epionce Ultra Nourishing Cream, yet this serum didn&#x27;t prove to be as good.</li>
      <li>Healing is occurring very quickly thanks to all the excellent Epionce products I have used.</li>
      <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants a beautiful complexion at any age.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great Saram for the face I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Better yet, helps reduce fine lines.</li>
      <li>I initially bought this from a skincare doctor and was thrilled to find it at a much better price through Amazon!</li>
      <li>My skin looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>Since I have started using these products, I have not had any rosacea breakouts and my normally dehydrated skin looks better than it has in a while!</li>
      <li>This is such a great product to use in your daily skin care routine.</li>
      <li>Like I said, for $108 I feel very cheated!  </li>
      <li>This was half price of which I pay for this on another site, but this is nowhere near as good as the dearer one I pay for</li>
      <li>Epionce Intense Defense Serum was recommended by my skin doctor.  </li>
      <li>-- you really don&#x27;t need much of this.  </li>
      <li>It is very soothing and healing for the redness and inflammation that results from the Skin Pen.</li>
      <li>really like what it does.</li>
      <li>It ran out so fast and just laid on my skin.</li>
      <li>I use so many products that I am not sure which product or products is doing the job.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist&#x27;s practice pushes this line of skin products, but I feel like she is the only one benefitting from the line, really!</li>
      <li>But this bottle must have been old, filled with a similar or different product.</li>
      <li>So far makes my skin feel softer.</li>
      <li>I definitely see and feel a difference in my face when I use the Intense Defense Serum.</li>
      <li>how long this would last, I will say I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
      <li>Those dark spots on my face are less noticeable and my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It feels rich and expensive and it makes my face look much smoother.  </li>

<li> The false bottom actually is up about 1/2&amp;#34; below the word &amp;#34;Epionce,&amp;#34; but because of the clear plastic covering over the brown part, you really don&#x27;t realize that.  </li>
<li> as I just noticed that the fancy packaging used is a way to disguise the fact that the amount of product in the bottle is actually only about half of the amount shown.  </li>
<li> However, I have noticed younger looking skin that is less saggy</li>
<li> Results not as expected.</li>
<li> No greasy, filmy, heavy feel to this product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m 56 and people always ask me what my secret is.</li>
<li> I think Epionce is a terrific skin care line, however I am Disappointed!</li>
<li> Something wrong!</li>

    <li> Just started using this. So far makes my skin feel softer.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product to use in your daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
    <li> Something wrong! I have been using Epionce for over 6 months. I love it! But this bottle must have been old, filled with a similar or different product. It ran out so fast and just laid on my skin. I think Epionce is a terrific skin care line, however I am Disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a great Saram for the face I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product after a Skin Pen treatment. It is very soothing and healing for the redness and inflammation that results from the Skin Pen. Healing is occurring very quickly thanks to all the excellent Epionce products I have used.</li>
    <li> I use so many products that I am not sure which product or products is doing the job. However, I have noticed younger looking skin that is less saggy so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I definitely see and feel a difference in my face when I use the Intense Defense Serum. Those dark spots on my face are less noticeable and my skin is so soft and smooth.  Plus the price was great!</li>
    <li> I love this line of skin care!! I have ordered all the ones that are for oily, aging skin!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  No greasy, filmy, heavy feel to this product.  Better yet, helps reduce fine lines.</li>
    <li> Epionce Intense Defense Serum was recommended by my skin doctor.  It has truly changed to look of pores on my facial skin.  My husbands notices it.  His comment is always &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what it is but your face looks great.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Cannot detect any effect whatsoever on my skin, but I&#x27;m also feeling rather &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; as I just noticed that the fancy packaging used is a way to disguise the fact that the amount of product in the bottle is actually only about half of the amount shown.  The false bottom actually is up about 1/2&amp;#34; below the word &amp;#34;Epionce,&amp;#34; but because of the clear plastic covering over the brown part, you really don&#x27;t realize that.  Like I said, for $108 I feel very cheated!  My dermatologist&#x27;s practice pushes this line of skin products, but I feel like she is the only one benefitting from the line, really!</li>
    <li> This was half price of which I pay for this on another site, but this is nowhere near as good as the dearer one I pay for 👎👎</li>
    <li> Excellent serum! I initially bought this from a skincare doctor and was thrilled to find it at a much better price through Amazon! My skin looks fabulous. I&#x27;m 56 and people always ask me what my secret is. Epionce is a wonderful product. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with Lytic Tx and Renewal Facial Cream. Although I was initially concerned about cost and how long this would last, I will say I&#x27;m still on my first bottle -- you really don&#x27;t need much of this.  Since I have started using these products, I have not had any rosacea breakouts and my normally dehydrated skin looks better than it has in a while!</li>
    <li> It feels rich and expensive and it makes my face look much smoother.  I do really like what it does.</li>
    <li> Results not as expected. In love with Epionce Ultra Nourishing Cream, yet this serum didn&#x27;t prove to be as good.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  However, the box was smashed and the serum color was different than the one I bought at a local spa.  So It made me question it&#x27;s newness?  Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I lost 15 years using epionce. Is like a miracle and I recommend it to anyone who wants a beautiful complexion at any age.</li>
