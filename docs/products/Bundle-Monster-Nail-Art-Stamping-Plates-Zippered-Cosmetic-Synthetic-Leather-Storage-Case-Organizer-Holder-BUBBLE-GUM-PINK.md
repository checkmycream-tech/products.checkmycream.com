      <li>It&#x27;s just a very neat way to organize your image plates.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect case to hold all of your small round plates.</li>
      <li>but I like the Black Bundle Monster Zipper Case better.</li>
      <li>I have about seventy image plates, more or less.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this organizer if you don&#x27;t have one.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if the case included some pages with larger pockets to store the slightly larger wheels as well as the smaller ones.</li>
      <li>The vinyl like inserts are heavy duty not thin material that can easily wear out or tear.</li>
      <li>So far I have no complaints and would recommend this to others!</li>
      <li>It fit three of my sets with a few to spare.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchased directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
      <li>I have a few pages left for one more set of image plates too.</li>
      <li>The pages are durable and the outside is a pretty textured pink.</li>
      <li>This is a great little case for the money but keep in mind that it will only hold the small round wheels similar to Konad&#x27;s.</li>

    <li> awesome product good construction beautiful case</li>
    <li> Came in EXCELLENT condition! Extremely happy with the pink Bundle Monster nail stamping case. It fit three of my sets with a few to spare. Im ordering another one because I expanded my stamping set collection. There was nothing wrong with it, took awhile to get here- but it was worth the wait. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have many different brands of plates in my organizer and all fit great. I have both round and square plates in mine. Most of them I have back to back, so I can fit more in. I&#x27;ve owned this book a year now and do my nails almost daily and it&#x27;s holding up great!</li>
    <li> I love this case! The color matches what is shown in the picture and it has plenty of room for all of my disks. So far I have no complaints and would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> Love the color. Was super excited However when I got my plates,  they are way bigger than the slots in the case.</li>

    <li> This is the perfect case to hold all of your small round plates. I store BM, Gals, and MASH in mine. The zipper is heavy-duty as is the case. Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
