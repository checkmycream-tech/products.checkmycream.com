      <li>I purchased this product from a store and just love it!</li>
      <li>Nice moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>She said it was nice but in no way was a miracle worker to fight against wrinkles.</li>
      <li>In fact, because it is so good, do not wear any foundation any more.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, which is nice too.</li>
      <li>You must be patient and realize that as wrinkles go away, it is kind of like unfolding a paper-wad</li>
      <li>So I kept using it and also loving how it make my face with makeup glow.</li>
      <li>This is a nice moisturizing skin cream.  </li>
      <li>me wonderful complements about looking so young for my age.</li>
      <li>When I saw this product at the store it looked so nice in its cute pump bottle.</li>
      <li>However, for me, this is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and it HAS taken care of some very fine lines I had.</li>
      <li>It is okay but don&#x27;t see any difference in my wrinkles</li>
      <li>Works better that described.</li>
      <li>There have been too many stories like this.  </li>
      <li>I think there are to many lotions on the market to choose from, and I find that I can sit in an aisle at the store staring at the vast variety of lotions trying to figure out which is best for me.</li>
      <li>Though Olay products are better</li>
      <li>but if you do try it, make sure you discontinue use if you notice any reaction.</li>
      <li>Might be ok for a moisturizer and sunscreen, but didn&#x27;t see any difference in lift or wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I use this often and am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to sulfur (which many products contain).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I subscribed for this item to be shipped to me every 3 months,  because I am confident  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and many of my doctors</li>
      <li>I discovered this lotion and have stuck with it for some time now, and was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>(I can&#x27;t stop touching my face, and even with all the touching, no breakouts!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several years, and it has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have recommended it to many of my friends and family.</li>
      <li>So yeah, can you say LOVE?</li>
      <li>WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THIS INGREDIENT IS???</li>
      <li>but I like this one the most.  </li>
      <li>It works okay.</li>
      <li>I also love the dispenser as it is so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this in a retail store and was glad when I found it offered on Amazon at a reduced price.  </li>
      <li>This goes on easily</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to onion that was this strong before, so</li>
      <li>Garnier makes good products, so I expected nothing but good things from this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Not only does it work with fine lines, but it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer &amp; spf.</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this stuff in a magazine and figured I might as well try it.  </li>
      <li>I do this occasionally now and notice great differences when I do.</li>
      <li>and this feels light and greaseless.</li>
      <li>Not a bad buy at all, and it really seems to be effective in treating this winter-skin of mine.</li>
      <li>This happened with my first use, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what caused it until I tried the Garnier product again by itself.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have the words to describe this product, I love it so much!</li>
      <li>It spreads smoothly, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant fragrance and desired effects meets my every expectation for a facial creme.</li>
      <li>Clean fresh scent, goes on the skin lightly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and has good consistency and subtle, pleasing scent though.</li>
      <li>It does more than a reasonable job of filling in wrinkles for the day.</li>
      <li>I will say that it&#x27;s a good product in terms of feel and basic value, though.</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>I see a real change in my skin tone and look forward to seeing more.  </li>
      <li>(it has a rich creamy texture to it) and is absorbed into the skin quickly without leaving a layer on top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so thankful that I realized that this was the cause of my skin irriation so quickly (days instead of months).</li>
      <li>It feels good to apply and keep the face moisturized for a long time</li>
      <li>The product is also greeseless and is absorbed very quickly leaving very soft smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Where I first swiped it onto my face is a line that itches terribly, is bright red and hot to the touch.  </li>
      <li>I bough it out of desperation, tried a sample for three days and could see it was gentle on my skin and started to make my skin smooth and glowy looking...already.</li>
      <li>I am over 65, with sensitive skin and really love this product.</li>
      <li>And it is economical.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the product that Consumer Reports recommended in 2011, which is why I thought I&#x27;d try it out when I noticed laugh lines forming.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the eight bucks.</li>
      <li>This is a nice moisturizer; there are no apparent dyes in it</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Firming\\&quot; is probably not the right word for this product.</li>
      <li>strong yucky smells bother you, perhaps your money would be better spent on another product!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t trust the chemicals that they put into this, so I certainly won&#x27;t be slathering it on my face again!</li>
      <li>Finally I don&#x27;t have to experiment any more with moisturizers</li>
      <li>but I use this since I first started using.</li>
      <li>When I first applied it&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
      <li>I have used many different products but this one I have been using for a while.</li>
      <li>Very noticeable!</li>
      <li>, you may see more of the wrinkles and how deep they are as they move towards repair and going away.  </li>
      <li>This really does reduce wrinkles!</li>
      <li>I have mostly dry skin with very fine lines.</li>
      <li>After a few minutes I noticed that it was not fully absorbed by my skin, because my face still felt kind of greasy, like I just applied it.</li>
      <li>I expected to replace a wonderful German Nivea Visage Expert Lift day cream that I bought in the Dominican Republic last Summer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, the pump gives you just enough to cover your face.</li>
      <li>It may not be an offensive smell, but it&#x27;s certainly something I don&#x27;t want my face to smell like at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this product from a store and just love it! I have had no skin reactions whatsoever and I have sensitive skin. I use it on my hands and arms as well as my face because it softens dried wrinkled skin. I could not be happier with this Garnier product. I had been using a very expensive beauty product which did not work as well. I highly recommend this product. My skins looks much healthier and younger. I do believe they changed the formula because my previous product had a smell I did not like. This firming moisturizer has no smell and is a joy to use. This review is unsolicited. I just had to write about my experience when I read the other negative reviews. I am over 65, with sensitive skin and really love this product. I also love the dispenser as it is so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Might be ok for a moisturizer and sunscreen, but didn&#x27;t see any difference in lift or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product at the store it looked so nice in its cute pump bottle. Garnier makes good products, so I expected nothing but good things from this moisturizer. However when I used the first time, the first thing I noticed was the thick and kind of lumpy texture. The second thing was the weird smell. Some people say it has no fragrance, but it actually has a very subtle, yet unpleasant smell that I just can&#x27;t stand, very similar to diaper rash ointment, yuck! It may not be an offensive smell, but it&#x27;s certainly something I don&#x27;t want my face to smell like at all. After a few minutes I noticed that it was not fully absorbed by my skin, because my face still felt kind of greasy, like I just applied it. I expected to replace a wonderful German Nivea Visage Expert Lift day cream that I bought in the Dominican Republic last Summer (They sell lots of European cosmetics over there!) with this cream, but it failed miserably. Luckily, I found the same German cream on Amazon and even though it costs almost 4 times what this one costs, it is so lightweight and delicate, smells great and makes my skin look and feel like a million bucks, I really don&#x27;t mind the price. I will probably give this one away to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind the diaper rash cream smell, greasiness and gooey texture.</li>
    <li> My skin around the eyes seem to be sensitive to this cream, but the rest of my face and neck feel a cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for a while, but when I bought a new jar a few weeks ago I had a reaction - skin swollen under eyes, looked like I&#x27;d been crying all night. It took days to settle. Still not certain if it was the product or something else, I tried it again 2 days ago, and the same thing has happened. They must have changed the formula and I won&#x27;t be using the product again.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer.  Would have given it a 5 star rating if the scent were a little less strong.  Otherwise, works great.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and use it all of the time!  Great price for this cream and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I went to school for skin care &amp; no product that I learned about or used compares to this! Not only does it work with fine lines, but it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer &amp; spf. I subscribed for this item to be shipped to me every 3 months,  because I am confident  I will always use it. Love!</li>
    <li> My usual moisturizer was sold out so I grabbed this, and thus begins the nightmare.  I was chopping onions and my eyes began to burn so I flushed them with water.  Over the next two days my eyes have been raw and swollen.  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to onion that was this strong before, so I did some research and it turns out that a LOT of people have had similar reactions to this moisturizer.  My eyes are still a mess and at the moment they are covered in antibiotic ointment so hopefully this will end soon, but I will never, ever buy another Garnier product.  There have been too many stories like this.  They are an irresponsible company.</li>
    <li> Using this product for last five years and feels lot better than other similar stuffs. Though Olay products are better but I use this since I first started using. Also Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I use this at night, and a $90 cream during the day. This one seems to work just as well as the very expensive one!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I am allergic to sulfur (which many products contain).&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product and it is wonderful. I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and many of my doctors&lt;br /&gt;pay me wonderful complements about looking so young for my age. I was starting to get&lt;br /&gt;the little &amp;#34;marionette lines&amp;#34; on the sides of my mouth. That&#x27;s when I discovered this cream and it&lt;br /&gt;totally faded them almost completely away. I am extremely happy with this cream. If it helps&lt;br /&gt;me, then it should help almost everyone. I have used other very expensive creams and they&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t give results like this. I have recommended it to many of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is a sunscreen and that&#x27;s it. Ive read the indgredients and compared this product to the other skin products and see no anti wrinkle ingredients. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I use Garnier Ultra-Lift with other skin care products but I like this one the most.  I would give it a 5 if I knew for certain that it was responsible for all my wrinkle reduction.  I just don&#x27;t want to lie or exaggerate when I am not sure it is the cause of all my positive gain.  I use this product on all my more sun-damaged tough spots, i.e. elbows, knees, thighs, hands, neck and sometimes on my face.  When I use this product on my face, I do dilute it with water to prevent breakouts and as a result, I have not had any.  I know this product works.  I use to have extreme sun damage, now it is moderate damage.  I am getting to where I see positive changes almost daily.  I will say that I have used this product for over a year and will probably use it for a long time, possibly forever.  You must be patient and realize that as wrinkles go away, it is kind of like unfolding a paper-wad, you may see more of the wrinkles and how deep they are as they move towards repair and going away.  I have reached a point now where people come to me and tell me that I look as if I have no wrinkles on my face.  Persevere!  Garnier, I wish you would couple this product with a dark spot remover and reduce the price so I could use this as my morning and evening body lotion each day.  I do this occasionally now and notice great differences when I do.</li>
    <li> gardineer products are very good but this ones too greasy i havent used it</li>
    <li> It is okay but don&#x27;t see any difference in my wrinkles so will not be reordering nor recommending to my friends..</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 3 years, and cannot do without it. I do not like to go out in the sun with a Sunscreen on my face, and this takes care of all of my needs. Is not oily, as some sunscreens are, goes right into the skin, and helps to nurish and hydrate my 60 year old face. People cannot believe I am 60, so it is a must have in my makeup case. In fact, because it is so good, do not wear any foundation any more. Got to try to believe it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several years, and it has been the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I tried  the expensive brand names that I got from the Department stores, but this one has worked better than any of them.  The price is reasonable and it works well.</li>
    <li> This product really does help firm up over 50 skin.  Not too expensive so I can continue with usage.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this stuff in a magazine and figured I might as well try it.  I put it on before going to bed and woke up to the biggest breakout I&#x27;ve had since... ever.  I didn&#x27;t even get breakouts like this in middle- or high school.  It might be an allergic reaction, but I&#x27;ve never reacted like this to anything else, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different face soaps and lotions.  Bottom line: I&#x27;m never wasting time (and skin, and cover-up makeup, etc.) with Garnier products again, and I would recommend that people do NOT use this!</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this moisturizer, and Garnier is a great quality item. He uses about one bottle a month, applying it 1-2 times a day. It really moisturizes and protects his face (spf) without leaving it greasy or with any excess residue</li>
    <li> I use this during the summer and at night during the winter. Works very well for me that way. No dry patches of skin.</li>
    <li> This really does reduce wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Have used other Garnier products in the past but not this one. Cream is thick and seems to hydrate my skin well....only time will tell whether there will be a difference in the appearance of wrinkles and how firm my skin remains as well as how well this product measures up against the competitor&#x27;s product I had been using for years.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product. About two days after I started using it, I woke up with swollen, tender eyelids, and the skin around my eyes stayed red and dry for a few days. Once I stopped using it, the symptoms started going away. I don&#x27;t trust the chemicals that they put into this, so I certainly won&#x27;t be slathering it on my face again! This product was a waste of my money, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have mostly dry skin with very fine lines. Most face creams I&#x27;ve tried tended to leave my face with a greasy feel, which I hate. This goes on easily (it has a rich creamy texture to it) and is absorbed into the skin quickly without leaving a layer on top.&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin has improved and so has its texture. I am not religious about applying it, so cannot aver to it&#x27;s wrinkle reducing powers, but it has made enough of a change that I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I question the moisturizer/anti wrinkle claims when only sunscreen ingredients are listed.  A bad feature is this cream is oily and sticky!  Only used it one other time because of that.  Today I had a bad experience when doing a bit of yard work.  As some perspiration from my forehead got into one of my eyes, it started really stinging.  This was somewhat worse than other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used under the same circumstances, and I had to stop and go wash my face.  Too late; I couldn&#x27;t get the stinging to stop so I tried to wash it out by taking a shower.  The pain didn&#x27;t stop.  Tried herbal eyedrops, but my eye kept watering nonstop.  Finally I had  to take an Excedrin for the pain, which lasted almost another half hour.</li>
    <li> It works okay. No miracles. I like other products better. Probably will stick with my tinted Mary Kay moisturizer.l Inexpensive and great for every day use. Lynne</li>
    <li> I had my reservations, but I really like this product. I work nights, so I just apply a small dime sized amt and it just feels great and keeps my skin looking young and feeling moist and just terrific. I should try the night cream ultra lift, huh?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for a while. It keeps my face moist and I do not seem to break out when I use it. I just started ordering it off of Amazon though.</li>
    <li> Thanks for providing this product online and deliverable. It&#x27;s pleasant fragrance and desired effects meets my every expectation for a facial creme. Not to mention SPF 15.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer of this product. Works better that described. Will continue to purchase from Amazon as long as I can get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd container of this product.I can&#x27;t say I notice any \\&quot;firming\\&quot; but as a moisturizer it may be the best I have ever tried. I have dry skin and forever have applied lotion every morning and night. Recently, before trying this product, I tried the outrageously expensive Dior products. Excellent products but at 20 times the price of this not worth it. The backs of my hands and my arms seem to cry out for application of this product so now with this 3rd container I regularly apply to hands and arms and they feel fantastic! The product is also greeseless and is absorbed very quickly leaving very soft smooth skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer; there are no apparent dyes in it and though it does have a fragrance it doesn&#x27;t seem to be overpowering, nor has it irritated my sensitive skin thus far. Not a bad buy at all, and it really seems to be effective in treating this winter-skin of mine. Totally worth the eight bucks.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised as a firming cream/wrinkle reducer, but after I received it &amp; read the active ingredients, they were all 3 a form of sunscreen! Blah! All this product is is an expensive sunscreen, and its only an SPF 15 at that! Nothing but a big disappointment...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find out if it firms or helps wrinkles.  Like many others, I have had a bad reaction to this product.  Where I first swiped it onto my face is a line that itches terribly, is bright red and hot to the touch.  Thank goodness I put this nowhere near my eyes. This happened with my first use, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what caused it until I tried the Garnier product again by itself.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even have the words to describe this product, I love it so much! And I tell all my friends about it! I have SUPER SENSITIVE skin and every anti-wrinkle product I have ever tried irritation my skin like crazy and the retinol stuff in them made my skin not only red but even peel off in layers! Pain and terror!! And products like Oil of Olay made me break out. This stuff is however completely none-irritating in any way! Nothing, no redness, no pain, no peeling! Seriously, this is a first for me! And on top of it it WORKS!! I bough it out of desperation, tried a sample for three days and could see it was gentle on my skin and started to make my skin smooth and glowy looking...already. So I bought the bottle and after only about a week of using it I could see those deep wrinkles smoothing and softening. Very noticeable! So I kept using it and also loving how it make my face with makeup glow. And after a while I remembered about the wrinkles that i used to have, looked in the mirror and realized that I didn&#x27;t have ANY of them anymore. I don&#x27;t know how long had passed, didn&#x27;t even notice until they disappeared, but I can tell you right now they are 100% gone, there is not a single wrinkle on my face. So yeah, can you say LOVE? For sure!!</li>
    <li> I have used many different products but this one I have been using for a while. It is not greasy and covers well under makeup. great on neck area too.</li>
    <li> I use this often and am pleased with the results. Just as advertised, it works quickly and for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Every time I try something new&lt;br /&gt;I always come back to this. I have oily skin and this works best for me.</li>
    <li> What a misery. Terrible allergic reaction, even though I have never had this type of allergy before. Swelling and rash for days. Could barely look at myself in the mirror.Like some of the other people who  were stung by this product it took me almost 2 weeks to figure out what caused it. Wish I had read some of the reviews before, but then you never quite believe them until it happens to you. As far as I&#x27;m concerned this product is toxic when applied to my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay moisturizer. My 1st ever moisturizer in fact. I saw a video on YouTube with this product and thought I would test it out!</li>
    <li> Been hearing a lot about the Garnier line of skin care, thought I would give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake, money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awful, sort of like a funky smelling aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;And it is NOT for those of us with sensitive skin. When I first applied it&lt;br /&gt;my face burned and it made my eyes water.. wasn&#x27;t using it on my eye area, that was just from being on my face.&lt;br /&gt;However, being stupid I left it on went outside and started doing yard work. After about 20 minutes I had to go in and wash it off. It was burning that bad.&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin look like a lobster.&lt;br /&gt;So moral of this little tale if you have sensitive skin, and strong yucky smells bother you, perhaps your money would be better spent on another product!&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
    <li> Apparently, mileage on this product varies widely. However, for me, this is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and it HAS taken care of some very fine lines I had. (I&#x27;m only 29, so we&#x27;re not talking about wrinkle miracles here.) It makes my skin SUPER soft AND it hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all, as every other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried has done. (I&#x27;ve always had oily skin that tends to break out.) \\&quot;Firming\\&quot; is probably not the right word for this product. For me, it makes my skin incredibly soft. Like baby skin. (I can&#x27;t stop touching my face, and even with all the touching, no breakouts!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the product that Consumer Reports recommended in 2011, which is why I thought I&#x27;d try it out when I noticed laugh lines forming.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and loved it.  In April, I broke out with a horrible rash on my face.  After several visits to the Dermatologist, and finally a biopsy, we still could not figure out what I was allergic to.  I continued using it for about two months while this was going on.  The Dermatologist gave me some other moisturizer to use and it did finally clear up.  But, with all the other creams and medicines that I was on, it still didn&#x27;t dawn on me that it was this moisturizer.  One day when I ran out of the moisturizer that the Dermatologist had given me, I used the Ultra Lift again.  Within two hours, my horrible rash had come back.  I now remember that I had opened a new container of this in April but did not link it.  I found an old container in my travel stuff and saw that the new one contained sunscreens that were not in the old one.  Please make it very apparent when changing ingredients in products.  I spent five miserable months and a lot of money because of this.</li>
    <li> I am so thankful that I realized that this was the cause of my skin irriation so quickly (days instead of months). I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive skin but I am confident I broke out due to using this product. I have a red puffy rash all overy my face. I cannot recommend this but if you do try it, make sure you discontinue use if you notice any reaction. Really disappointing- especially since I am getting married in a few days and this moisturizer made my face look red and swollen</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It&#x27;s easy to apply, the pump gives you just enough to cover your face. It spreads smoothly, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, which is nice too.</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily skin and this feels light and greaseless. Keeps my face moisturized, great under makeup. Odor-free. (Can&#x27;t stand some smells.)</li>
    <li> Garnier ultra lift SPF 15&lt;br /&gt;Within hours of using this my face became itchy inflamed &amp; covered in bumps! It must contain something that is not the one without SPF! I&#x27;m not allergic to any other other creams. WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THIS INGREDIENT IS???</li>
    <li> Used this stuff for 3 or 4 years, thinking I was protecting my skin from the sun then I researched the product on paulaschoice.com and found all of Garnier&#x27;s claims are bogus and their SPF isn&#x27;t properly balanced as a broad spectrum product. There is no effective firming agent in this product either. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and has good consistency and subtle, pleasing scent though. Just don&#x27;t expect any anti-aging benefits.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. I would not recommend wasting the money on it. It feels good to apply and keep the face moisturized for a long time but I noticed zero anti-aging benefits...zero.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old man, and shopping for face lotion still feels weird. I think there are to many lotions on the market to choose from, and I find that I can sit in an aisle at the store staring at the vast variety of lotions trying to figure out which is best for me. And when I finally do make a decision, I doubt myself even after buying the product. There are not many lotions geared towards men, and as a man I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time looking for a face lotion. I discovered this lotion and have stuck with it for some time now, and was glad to find it on Amazon. I would say not to apply it before exercise if you sweat a lot like me. You will find it running off your face almost like when a woman&#x27;s make up runs. A few times I applied it right before I went to the gym, and after I started sweating It began running down my face. It was a little embarrassing to see a white&#x27;ish sweaty mixture all over my face. Other than that, I do think it make my skin look better, and feel hydrated.</li>
    <li> SORRY - THIS DID NOT DO &amp;#34;zip&amp;#34;  GET PTR PRODUCT (peter thomas roth)</li>
    <li> How does one know if anti-aging products work? I will say that it&#x27;s a good product in terms of feel and basic value, though. 3 stars represents the inability to really know, can&#x27;t give 5 for these products.</li>
    <li> I love the creamy, not greasy texture of this!  For a sunscreen, the white fades fast and soaks in deep.  For a moisturizer, this leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated all day!  The pump is really handy and gives you a perfect amount of lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizing skin cream.  I have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It provides just the right amount of moisture, without feeling heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Built in sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t have to also apply a separate sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Delightful smell.  It is sort of reminiscent of sun tan lotion, but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It actually does what it claims to do. Finally I don&#x27;t have to experiment any more with moisturizers and I&#x27;m going to keep using it. Thanks Garnier.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this in a retail store and was glad when I found it offered on Amazon at a reduced price.  Product has always worked well for me and I will continue to use it in my daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of face lotions and have very sensitive skin. I have a problem with any facial lotion with sunscreen in it, but I was hopeful. This particular lotion did better than some - it didn&#x27;t feel like burning on my skin, but I had much worse eye irritation all day long, so much that I did a lot of squinting and probably caused more wrinkles than I lifted with this product. I wore this for three days thinking that the eye irritation was allergies, and I didn&#x27;t put the lotion near my eyes, but, not using this product at night or during the day today, I can definitely tell the difference between when the lotion is on and when it&#x27;s not in terms of eye irritation. It&#x27;s a real shame at this price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty greasy, it feels sort of watered down as it goes on.  It also causes acne on me, where as my usual moisturizer usually doesn&#x27;t.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it helped with wrinkles at all.  It was worth a try, and it helps with dry skin but that&#x27;s about the best thing I can say regarding this product.</li>
    <li> Clean fresh scent, goes on the skin lightly. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom. She said it was nice but in no way was a miracle worker to fight against wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a week.  I see a real change in my skin tone and look forward to seeing more.  The few marionette lines I saw have flattened and my skin is far smoother.  Does this bottle come in a larger size?  Supprised by the small size bottle.</li>
    <li> For an over-the-counter product, you can&#x27;t beat this. It does more than a reasonable job of filling in wrinkles for the day.And it is economical.</li>
