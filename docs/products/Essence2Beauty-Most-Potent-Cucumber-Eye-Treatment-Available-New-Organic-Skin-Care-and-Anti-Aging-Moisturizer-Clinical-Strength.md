<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product!  Love how smooth it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> This arrived very quickly.  The packaging is very nice.  I have very sensitive skin and so far so good.  Seems like a really nice product.</li>
    <li> love it... it has worked miracles on my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Works really good, it absorbs really fast, no greasy sensation, I would buy again!! Totally recommend it</li>
    <li> Nothing about this product was moisturizing</li>
    <li> Gave this product to my mom and she loves it.  It&#x27;s making her eyes look more awake and she wears glasses.</li>
    <li> Simply awful!! I had high hopes on reading the reviews. After I first put it on, I noticed my undereye circles appeared even darker! I tried it for a few days and then switched to what I was using before. I then decided I might as well finish it, only to have only one more pump left! I used it as directed and it lasted for 5 applications. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am always sceptical of eye creams since I&#x27;ve tried so many but I was very impressed with this one. I saw noticeable results within a week and half. The dark circles were lighting up and even the bags under my eyes were tightening. I also love the fact that I can wear it under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Super love this product for my eyes, helps my skin around my eyes don&#x27;t show much of my age.</li>
    <li> Even though I got this at a discount price for my unbiased review, I LOVE this eye cream. I am 36 year old woman, eye cream is a must. I do not have many obvious fine line around my eyes nor do I have puffy eyes, so I can&#x27;t tell much about how it improves my eye&#x27;s condition. However, the minute I put on the cream, I can feel my eyes skin is tighter. Oh my, tighter is always good. I love it and it hydrates very well. I for sure will buy again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product! Could feel the difference in my skin during the first use! I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This little bottle is heaven! I absolutely love this anti aging eye cream. I have spent hundreds of dollars on beauty care products that I rarely see any results.  I have been using this product for little over a month and I am so impressed with it.  I don&#x27;t get much sleep so this product is great for hiding my dark circles.  Immediately after applying under my eye I can feel it working, i&#x27;m not kidding, like right after, it&#x27;s a tingly sensation and the skin around my eye starts to feel firmer and tight.  I use it both in the morning and night. I apply it under my makeup and almost works as a primer. The cream itself is lightweight, not sticky and very hydrating to the skin.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to take care of the sensitive area around the eye and for the price with these results, its such a good deal!!</li>
    <li> This has helped my dark spots under my eyes decrease.</li>
    <li> Good product. Able to tighten the skin around the eyes +++++</li>
    <li> I love this product! Only needed a small dab and it covers very well - a little bit goes a long way! I used morning and night to help reduce dark under eye circles - I could also feel my skin tighten a bit right after application!</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was advertised as \\&quot;October Special - 70% Off!\\&quot; for $21.97, which still puts it in the higher range for prices. A month later, the special was off, and it was being sold at its regular price....$21.97. I understand advertising, but outright lies make me automatically distrust a company.    They&#x27;re from Broken Arrow, OK, so that&#x27;s local, and the ingredients list is decent enough, nothing crazy popping up on CosDNA, and tested a pH of 5.    The product comes in an opaque white plastic airless pump container with a lid (0.5 oz/15 ml). It looks cheap, but no big deal. After a couple days of use however, the silver ring from the lid started flaking off into fine glitter and got all over my hands and face. I tried scrubbing and washing it to preserve whatever I could from the cap, but this is beyond unacceptable.    I&#x27;ve used the product for over a month, and have noticed no difference in anything. I dont use a full pump each time, just enough for my eye area, and I think I&#x27;m over halfway through the bottle. I will definitely not be repurchasing.    False advertising, cheap packaging that required me to take time out and fix, overpriced, and ineffective product makes this such a fail that while I never write reviews, I had to go make this one. Save your $20 and go buy some other product.</li>
    <li> I like the quality.  It is very easy to use it.after I use it, I can feel my face is very relax. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because I have somewhat sensitive skin but this burned when I put it on</li>
    <li> no noticeable changes, but it&#x27;s very soft and soothing when it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> i like how it work perfectly</li>
    <li> I like it except for the container. Not really a big fan for the &amp;#34; pump&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My eyes look good, I like the product</li>
    <li> A little sticky. Hasn&#x27;t seen any results!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any defense on my wrinkles under eye...works the same as the cheapest one from the local pharmacy.  Too much money for this product..didn&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It moisturizes my eye area and reduces my puffiness. It&#x27;s pretty thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love it! My under eye area feels very firm after putting it on! You feel the difference as soon as it applied.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well</li>
    <li> Love the product. This is my second bottle. Definitely try it out.</li>
    <li> I have bags under eyes. I have only been using this product for 2 weeks. Goes on great, smooth under my makeup and puffy eyes are not near as puffy in such a short time. Love it!</li>
    <li> No noticeable changes at all</li>
    <li> With my allergies kicking in real hard, I decided to give this a try. It works amazingly and easly hydrates my red puffy eyes and makes it all better. Will buy this product again if I ever need it.</li>
    <li> I received this eye cream really fast, In 2 days with standard shipping. I have been using for a couple days now and there has been a dramatic change in the puffiness, and using overnight i can even see a slight change in the darkness around my eyes. I will definitely continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this eye cream a few days but it is a great product. Only need a little bit, goes on very smooth, has a nice mild, tingly feel (great for walking up in the morning &amp; soothing at night!). I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long and I already see results. I&#x27;m a work hard, play hard kind of mom of 3. Little sleep is not a good look on the eyes, but I see results already!</li>
    <li> I suffer a lot from dark under eyes and puffiness &amp; have tried other products that did not work. This one did. I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes have lightened a lot &amp; it took all the puffiness away. It has a very cool feeling and leaves the skin around my eyes very smooth feeling. Love this product and would recommend trying it. Thanks..I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> My aunt ended up using this. She said it feels good on her skin. Doesn&#x27;t give sticky feeling not does it give any harsh feeling to the skin. It seems to work for her and she likes it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I haven&#x27;t noticed the difference after I started using it</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noted many benefits of this eye cream.  Not what I expected.  I prefer a cream to the gel.</li>
    <li> Eye gel arrived quickly as promised. Love the feel and smell and the cool feeling when applied. Makes the eye area feel wonderful. have been using for a few days and love it would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This product really leaves the skin feeling fresher and healthier. I suffer from allergies and this product helps the area under and around my eyes feel better. No more dryness. No more puffiness. No more dark circles. I know it says it might take time, however, I felt and looked better after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I highly recommend using this. Feels great around the eyes cooling feeling&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Donna Martens</li>
    <li> Awesome eye cream!  Goes on smooth.....no stickiness.  Gives the skin around my eyes a firming feel and look.  Love it!</li>
    <li> been using product for a few weeks now, noticed good results seemed to reduce puffiness and lighten dark circles from discoloration.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m always afraid to try anything new on my skin. My skin is very sensitive. Many products cause me to get a rash &amp; I waste money on products I try once &amp; can&#x27;t continue to use. That was not the case with Essence2beauty eye gel. I like that it&#x27;s ingredients contain organic Aloe. It feels very refreshing when applied. I suffer from insomnia &amp; very often my eyes are irritated &amp;  puffy. This product works well to brighten the areas around my eyes &amp; very much reduces the puffiness. It&#x27;s cool &amp; refreshing. Does not cause me to have any allergic reaction which is great so I can continue to use it. The pump works well too. My only issue is the writing on the container is hard for me to read because it&#x27;s  small but I got a great e-mail from them without contacting them explaining how to apply the gel.  I thought that was fantastic how they took the time to contact me. That shows me they care about their customers!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use the product before I wrote any comments.  I use it twice daily (a.m and p.m) I was truly surprised to find positive results.  Although I read several comments. I was not ordered any promotion or discounts. I found something that worked for me  and  I will purchase it again.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing around the eyes. Can only use before bed, though, because it causes my concealer to cake up a bit. Also tends to congeal a bit in the tube if not used very regularly.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is amazing! Within a couple applications (twice daily), I could already tell a difference in the skin around my eyes. The dark circles began to fade and skin was much softer. Plus the smell of cucumbers when applying the gel is nice. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried several similar products, but have never felt this Great!&lt;br /&gt;I skeptically applied this the first couple a days. Not really expecting more than the same old thing. It really felt good. Very soothing and even my husband took notice that there were positive changes around my eyes. When I applied it the cream felt very soothing and even smelled good. I was never as satisfied with similar products that I have purchased in the past. I really felt like this was much different than anything that I have ever purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend a purchase, you will notice a difference in the first  few applications.</li>
    <li> Like the feeling of the product when applied to the eyes, has a nice cooling feeling not too heavy and smells good</li>
    <li> Only used for a few days but can already see a difference in the dark circles under my eyes. Goes on smoothly and dries quickly. Only takes a small amount for each application. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have it for a week and my skin does look more hydratated and soft</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I am over 40 with oily, acne prone skin and a fair amount of sun damage. Though my skin is oily, the area around my eyes tends to be dry. I wear contacts daily. My concerns are sun damage and crows feet. I bought the product about 3-1/2 months ago and have been using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this product, but have only liked it. The customer service was very good. I have absolutely no concerns about the quality of the ingredients and the bottle and pump dispenser have been very good. The list of ingredients includes some powerful, first class ingredients, but the product is very affordable. The texture is gel-like and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative I have is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough for me. It&#x27;s described as a &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; eye gel, but I personally have to use another eye cream on top of this product. I don&#x27;t necessarily like using two eye products on top of treatment serums. (I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Renewal Smoothing Eye Cream to moisturize, and found I really like the level of moisture I get with it.) In terms of treatment impact, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it doesn&#x27;t mean this product wouldn&#x27;t work for someone else with different skin condition and concerns. I may go back to Timeless Skin Care&#x27;s Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid + Matrixyl + Algae Eye Cream, which was a light-weight gel that was more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my crows feet!  Great moisture.  Used in the a.m. And at bedtime.  Worked in 5 days using twice a day.</li>
    <li> Give it a try! you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It gives a cool soothing feel when you put it on, definitely refreshing! After putting it on in the evening I wake up looking refreshed.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoyed this product. You feel the effects immediately. Leaves your eyes feeling refreshed. Definitely worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> I must say that I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the results were great. My eyes are less puffy and I&#x27;ve actually started to see the wrinkles disappear....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely buying more..</li>
    <li> This product made my eyes brighter and look a lot less tired.  The nice cucumber sent is revitalizing.  Love how it makes my eyes look</li>
    <li> I received the product fast. I love the way it feels and it&#x27;s starting to take my wrinkles away. It also has been helping with the dark circles under my eyes. Pretty happy with the results so far. I would purchase this product again</li>
    <li> Eye cream worked well. Been using the cream for about a week.  I use it twice a day and the dark circles and wrinkles are almost gone.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks already. It is soothing immediately after application but so far no significant results nor improvements seen.</li>
    <li> Since I started using the anti-aging eye creme, i have noticed that the bags and puffiness under my eyes are gone and that the wrinkles under my eyes fadung.  I am completely satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I Recommend Best Anti-Aging Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness - New Organic Skin Care Products Contains Moisturizers, Peptides with Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe, Cucumber, L-Arganine, MSM - Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream Smoothes Fine Lines and Moisturizes</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally notice any difference after applying eye cream but this was totally different.  I love the consistency of the product and how smooth it goes on.  It is so soothing and I felt like my skin was tighter almost immediately after applying.  I am very happy with this cream and plan to continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional makeup artist for over 23 years and have tried many, many products.  This eye cream is really great!  I love it! It goes on smoothly and feels calming on your skin.  I noticed the results the next day. My skin looks great!  I recommend it highly, a must have sin your skin care regimen</li>
    <li> I was using a very expensive eye cream and I&#x27;ve been on the market looking for something that is as good as my favorite eye cream but costs less and I&#x27;ve finally found it! This product has a cooling cucumber effect that I love and it leaves my eyes feeling awake and ready to tackle the day! It takes away any puffiness and/or dark circles after only a few uses. This product is like a mini spa for your under eyes  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I noticed a difference around my eyes. The cream absorbed into the skin nicely so I could apply my makeup over it.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use! I was not allergic to it! It requires just a little bit when you use it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! easy to use and it really seems to work! My dark circles and puffiness seems diminished and considering I have allergies that says alot!!! I will definitely continue to use this!!!</li>
    <li> So easy to use! My under eyes improved and now i look more awake. Dark eye circles arent much of a problem.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and absorb very quick. I only use couple times and i did not see the dark circles getting any better probably i go to bed late. But i will keep using it and hopefully i will see better result for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I got this product very fast. I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but  I like how it hydrates my skin. It makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first of using this product because I have extremely dark circles under my eyes and it has finally been shown to me that this product the Best Anti-Aging Eye Cream for Dark Circles is truly a miracle. I have been using this product for a week and have already started seeing results. I will definitely be purchasing this again, and have already recommended it to others. I can say this has given me such great results and I am so happy with the outcome already!!</li>
    <li> I loved this product from the first time I tried it.  I especially like the scent which is very light and fresh.  It goes on smooth with just a finger and really smooths the under eye area.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Puffiness and dark circles have faded. Lines have lessened so overall it is a  great buy. I would definitely recommend for anyone that has starting getting fine lines.</li>
    <li> The first word sums it up! Best! I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams. This is by far the eye cream that really does what it says it does. I will be buying this forever.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams that are popular on the web. I&#x27;ve read customer reviews hoping to get some guidance and validation.  My last two eye creams were very pricey.  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.  I stumbled upon Essence2 and read the reviews. I have used it now for about 5 days.  I love the gel as it seems to be easily absorbed in the skin.  The spout is controllable which helps conserve the usage.  My skin feels softer and my skin seems to have a lighter appearance.  Using it twice a day apparently is giving me good results.  It is a good investment in beauty aids.  I think of it as super eye gel.</li>
    <li> Was purchased as a gift. I was concerned because I was not sure of how it would work for a woman of color, but she says that it&#x27;s amazing and does wonders for reducing the puffiness around her eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, but unfortunately she took it the wrong way!! She thought I was implying that she was getting old and ugly, but I NEVER SAID THAT!  I told her that she was as beautiful (even more) since I first met her.  Still, she gave me a cold shoulder and no sex for a week before she tried it without telling me.  She noticed how well it worked and slowly began to talk to me as if to say, &amp;#34;I forgive you&amp;#34;.  Overall, I think she just had an emotionally and psychologically bad day because she never reacts that way to something like this.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy her perfume.  I would hate to have her think that she was STINK!!. Anyway, I can really tell the difference and the make up sex is great :)  I would buy more just for the make up sex.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 7 days, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my dark circles already. Definitely worth the price if I can see improvement in such a short time.</li>
    <li> First of all, the shipping of this product was the fastest ever. Ordered on Thursday morning, delivered on Friday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been just a week and already I can see significant lessening of the nasty bags under my eyes and the dark circles are slightly less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt; I have complete faith in the is product and I am so thrilled that I have something that actually works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The amazing thing is.....I am 85 years old and I thought I was doomed to have these hideous bags and circles forever. OK, so I am a vain 85 year old. I am happy, happy, happy!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first.  But wanted something that wasn&#x27;t greasy.  My dark circles lightened up within a week and puffiness went away too.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. So far it is better and cheaper than my Clinique all about eyes &amp; Clinique repairwear laser focus wrinkle correcting eye cream. I just wish it is in a clear container so I know when to order next.&lt;br /&gt;After I apply the gel, I follow with a quick massage around my eyes (see youtube how to massage the eye area) for a better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I still like this eye gel to tighten the skin around my eyes; works better than some expensive eye gel/cream.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer- not sure I see a change in the dark circles though</li>
    <li> make&#x27;s the skin under my eyes feel a little tight, and haven&#x27;t noticed any rocking difference in the skin there.  Would probably be a great product for people who wear contacts -- feels completely grease free and doesn&#x27;t seem to migrate at all.</li>
    <li> Seem to work well. Ordering my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Does not do a thing for my eyes.</li>
    <li> This Gel is wonderfully soothing. My eye area is so incredibly sensitive to so many products, With the Best Eye Gel, I don&#x27;t have any irritation or burning. I am 55 years old, and I desperately needed an eye cream I could depend on</li>
    <li> I like that it tightens the dark bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m young, so I am not worried about wrinkles just yet, but I&#x27;ve had chronic dark circles under my eyes that have gotten more puffy in the last few years. I use this before bed and in the morning daily and have seen improvement. Don&#x27;t misunderstand, it will not take away the dark circles, but it lessens their appearance somewhat. For me, even a little bit of improvement is worth it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I&#x27;ve used higher-end stuff that works better. That being said, this is 100% worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Feels cool and refreshing. I can see improvement in a week.</li>
    <li> Good product. It&#x27;s very refreshing and I like how it feels. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This gel makes my arey around the eyes dry insted of moist and it looks like I&#x27;ve got even more wrinkles then before its use. I wish I could ship it back and get my money back. Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I put it around my eyes before going to sleep it is very soothing and more then I expected, my eyes are not as puffy as before. Nice!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least three to four days a week, once in the morning and once at night for almost a month. I must say that I am quite pleased with the results. It&#x27;s not greasy and I feel like under my eyes are rejuvenated and the dark circles under my eyes are minimal (depending if I&#x27;ve had enough sleep or not). Overall, I&#x27;d purchase this product again and will continue to use for the time being.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally like eye gels. This product is among the better ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> i used this product and its really work great and really good work result in just some days. you can see difference quick</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple days now I still have the circles under my eyes but the puffiness is gone. It works well with my sensitive skin so I&#x27;ll keep using and and see if the circles go away after a longer use!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality eye gel in a generous quantity. This went on silky and I could see a difference in how smooth and hydrated the skin under my eyes was after just a few days. I even tested it on one of my hands and not the other and it made a very visible difference in the fine lines on my skin that lasted even after I stopped the experiment.</li>
    <li> Love the way my eyes feel great and I can feel the energy when I put it on.  shipment was 2 days sooner than estimated and ordering was easy.  definitely will keep this product on my use list  love it</li>
    <li> This product it is a good choice and really helps with moisture..but I use it combined with some oil because for night it is not enough.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvement but no negative effects</li>
    <li> It is all that it says that it is!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Cool and refreshing.  Didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days and I can definitely say it works. A little goes a long way. The first time I applied one pump and I think that was too much. I only use a little and I can feel my skin tignting in a few minutes after applying.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 1 week, so I do not see if this product truly works yet. I like how this product feels on my face. Because of the aloe ingredient, the initial feel is a bit tacky but dries quickly on skin. I do not use this product solely for eye puffiness. Because I like how this feels, I rub it in onto my cheeks as well. The ingredient list is very attractive, too. I do continue to use this to watch for any changes to my skin.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great! Calming and soothing to the eye area</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve been applying this product 2x a day for two weeks and there is a very noticeable difference! I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> My dark circles still there. I have been applied the cream for the last 3 weeks with no visible results, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Item seems to have a lot of aloe in it which makes it very sticky. I would not use it during the day.</li>
    <li> I woke up two days later after using this serum, looking radiant! I even got compliments. I really like this product and will purchase it again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally do a review unless I feel the products work. They have to go above and beyond what they say they will. Well it certainly did and more! My product arrived on time actually think earlier than estimated. Could not wait to try it out! One little pump goes a long way on both eyes. The consistency was SO creamy, lightweight, did not settle into my fine lines after letting it sit and then applying my concealer on top. Smooth finish, no greasiness, concealer truly glided on. Favorite part was NO creasing of either  eye cream or concealer throughout the day. (my biggest problem) To top it off the company sent me the nicest email after receiving my product explaining how to use the eye gel correctly along with a discount for my next purchase. Which I know I will definitely be using!! Wish there were more than 5 stars to rave about this product! I am a makeup artist that has been sharing this product with all my brides looking for a nice feel and very comfortable eye cream! Definitely worth every inexpensive penny!</li>
    <li> The gel tightened under my eye. The circles under my eye are still there, but the gel brightens the area so I like to believe that the circles are less notable.  I realize that everyone would be paying a much higher price to get a product that actually removes dark circles.  Because my skin is tauter with the gel, I feel and look better, I am happy with my purchase.  My only gripe is that the dispenser pops out too much gel, so the product won&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve just recently begun my search, but I am very pleased.  This is a nice lightweight product that does what it says.  Bonus that its organic!</li>
    <li> I really liked the cream, but the pump just didn&#x27;t work well.  I had to routinely push in the little &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; on the underside.  Not going to buy it again until the packaging is changed.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this eye cream feels whwn i apply it and how its helped my dark circles. It doesnt irritate my sensitive skin. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I love this! I normally do not write reviews unless the product is great! It goes on very smooth and has a great cucumber scent! I have noticed less puffy eyes and smoother lines. It is not irritating and smells and feels almost like it is all natural. Other eye creams have irritated my eyes and at times burned them! I agree with the other reviews! I am so glad I came accross this product! Keep in mind healthy living and exercise can also benefit! There is no miracle out there, you have to take care of your body!</li>
    <li> Been using for about a week now so far i have seen good results :)</li>
    <li> When I hold the cream bottle, it is so sticky. I felt uncomfortable to hold it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Love the smell and leave my skin fresh and soft. I&#x27;d recommend this product to people loking to save their money and switching from expensive eye cream.</li>
    <li> Thus far, I am happy with the product! Love the texture, the smell and how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great price.</li>
    <li> Smells great, pump dispenses just the right amount, feels fantastic on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I love it!  This product has a nice refreshing smell.  The minute I put it on, my eye area instantly feels tighter.  I have no more dark circles and as a mother of 3 that is a plus!</li>
    <li> This product does nothing it claims to do. It is a waste of good money.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good consistency and fragrance and I&#x27;m seeing a difference around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and soothing to your eyes</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever and I highly recommend this product I had great results in as little as 2 weeks and I totally will be ordering again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it automatically makes your skin feel tight and it smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;m about to go ahead and order more so I&#x27;ll have it. It&#x27;s like I can feel it working.</li>
    <li> Ok I am bummed. Wanted to try this but so far 3 chemicals had a 2-4 rating on the EWG and Retinyl Palmitate has an 8! Doesn&#x27;t seem natural and safe to me. Glad I saved my money and checked before I bought it. So not an actual review but a warning to please check the label.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL_PALMITATE_%28VITAMIN_A_PALMITATE%29/</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for the last 10 days. The product has a nice cucumber smell and is a light weight gel. From the first time i put the product on, i felt a tightening sensation. The product did help reduce the puffiness under my eyes, however i do not feel it lasts for a very long time (maybe a couple of hours tops. I have yet to notice any of the darkening to reduce under my eyes.  I have noticed that once I put the product on and let it dry, make up does not go over it well.  After putting make up it seems to clump up. I&#x27;m not sure if it has anything to do with my foundation or if the product does that with all make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i fairly good product.  You feel instant tightening when you put the product on.</li>
    <li> Very nice fresh smell. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the skin around my eyes, but I have only used a few days.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get a discount on this eye gel. I am a sleep-deprived mother of four, and to top it off I genetically have dark circles under my eyes. My mom and sister suffer the same. I always look exhausted (and usually am!). I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for almost two weeks. While I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic improvement in my dark circles yet, my eyes feel less tired (if that makes sense!). The eye gel feels amazing when I put it on, and i feel tensions slipping away. That sounds corny reading that back, but it really helps! The skin around my eyes does feel like its tightening a bit and it looks better. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I am still in love with this cream. I was worried it would cause breakouts on my skin. Not at all!</li>
    <li> No more puffy eyes. Works great</li>
    <li> This really is a great product! Definitely tightens the skin under and around your eye.  Over time I have notices the dark circles lightening up a little too.  A good price for the results!</li>
    <li> great product, used for a week noticed a difference! Great eye gel.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m not sure there are words to describe the wonders this product delivers. The best eye cream I have EVER used. Totally worth the $</li>
    <li> I received this product right before a trip to Reno, where my skin always instantly dries up the moment I land.  I used this product during my trip, and my skin looked amazing!  My eyes had no puffiness with my little sleep, no dark circles under my eyes!!! I did use it as a facial moisturizer, and my skin stayed so naturally hydrated I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  This product is wonderful!! I have no regrets, this product does its job perfectly! I recommend it highly to anyone!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I do not see a difference,  maybe it&#x27;s because I am not a good candidate as I do not have terrible bags underneath my eyes.  May work great for someone else just not the product for me.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite eye cream on the market!  I’ve tried a lot of different products looking for a way to reduce my terrible dark circles, but nothing really worked except for this.  In just a few weeks, I’ve gone from people asking if I was feeling okay to complimenting me on my fresh looking skin!  I have very sensitive skin and I was worried about the potential for irritation but the all natural ingredients work well and are gentle on my face.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> WAS LIKE CUCUMBER GLUE...</li>
    <li> did not see much improvement&lt;br /&gt;terrible packaging</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this every night, but when I do I can feel it working, firming up the skin under my under eyes. I am in my early 30s and trying to prevent dark circles and wrinkles down the road.</li>
    <li> This product is good.  It is cooling and easy to apply and it does reduce swollen or puffy eyes.  Do not notice a change in wrinkles under the eye.</li>
    <li> I love it.it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Like fresh cucumbers. Works well to soothe eyes after a long night. I used it after not getting enough sleep and it helped with the bags under my eyes and dark circles.</li>
    <li> This stuff works miracles. Here is what you need to know about how to make this work for you. I have dark circles and very puffy eyes. It&#x27;s mostly due to wearing glasses all my life. You DO NOT need a lot of this to get results. In fact, I made the mistake of putting a little bit too much my first time trying it and it really stiffened up my eye area. You just need a small amount and you can feel it working almost immediately. If you put too much on, you get the sense that your eye area is very stiff. It did not do much for the dark circles but works wonders for my eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Very effective! Love it!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me and the packaging was sticky</li>
    <li> It is something between a gel and a cream in consistency and I don&#x27;t see anything special about it. It is too thick for me and the pump just works here and there. Definitely won&#x27;t buy it next time.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and not greasy. A little goes a long way. So far I am loving this product</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff was awesome, I feel my skin instantly start to tighten!</li>
    <li> This produce is very nice. It makes the skin under my eye&#x27;s feel tight and clean. They also look smoother after using just 5 times. Just apply twice a day and you&#x27;ll notice a difference in no time.</li>
    <li> This crime works wonders on your eyes, will definitely continue buying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sleep deprived mamma to a 14-month-old who doesn&#x27;t sleep well. Fine lines and crows feet have taken over! I have been using this gel for almost 2 weeks now, seems to be improving the eye area. The smell is wonderful! ...a light cucumber scent. A perfect addition to my before bed facial routine. It doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out my eyes as do most eye products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It has a cooling effect that I really like. I have noticed that puffiness under my eyes have reduced over the past couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 3 days. So  far I just loved it coz once u apply it under eyes it has cooling effect . But I hv to see for alto east 3 weeks to see the difference in black circles . But I&#x27;m sure I ll see difference coz this is really awesome product &amp; worth buying it !!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this gel for about 10 days and I cannot say enough good things about it. If is very soothing when applied and a small amount goes a long way.  I can already tell a decrease in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I have tried many other products but did not get these results and paid more. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The serum feels a little tacky when applied,  but dries very smoothly and can be worn under makeup with no issues.  The skin around my eyes definitely feel moisturized and the lines soften. I did not notice any hint of smell like most viewers posted and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week. I am very pleased with how it is starting to lighten to dark circles under my eyes. I have always had slightly dark rings under my eyes even as a teenager, but this product really helps and it leaves the skin around the eyes feeling so soft and smooth. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any firmness yet, but I am pleased with the results thus far.</li>
    <li> The eye dark circle, puffiness, wrinkle gel/cream is a billion dollar scam industry. This product is no exception. It is promoted on Amazon as \\&quot;the BEST Eye Gel, Cream for Dark Circles Wrinkles and Puffiness...\\&quot;  The truth is that Essence2beauty did nothing for dark circles and minimal (if any) improvement of puffiness. I did not buy this product to \\&quot;soothe or brighten\\&quot; the eye area as indicated on the container. I bought it to treat the dark circles and puffiness for which it claims to be the BEST. Just another ripoff, don&#x27;t waste your money. Unproven, outlandish product claims should not be permissible on Amazon. Favorable ratings of this product are suspicious.</li>
    <li> I wish I had remembered they had a money back guarantee prior to just now. I bought the product a few months ago after the great reviews, however I found that it did nothing for my circles or puffiness. It also made my skin peel when I applied makeup over it.  Very disappointing product. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far I love it. Feels very soft and leaves skin around my eyes feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> Definitely  reccommend this product! Arrived on time, not greasy, and only been using it for about 2 weeks and can already notice my skin around my eyes were considerably smoother and firmer, I&#x27;ve used several eye creams, and this by far is hands down the best, definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel.  I&#x27;ve used it every morning for about 5 days and it&#x27;s great.  It feels good when I put it on and it reduces the puffiness almost completely.  I definitely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> Have only used for a short time.  Smells nice.  Not sure what it will do long term.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my eyelids after having used almost a whole bottle over a few weeks time. At least it doesn&#x27;t irritate them though!</li>
    <li> Perfection in s bottle</li>
    <li> I really like this gel.  Makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
    <li> I started to notice improvement around my eyes almost immediately! I definitely recommend this to anyone who feels their eyes can use a pick me up!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of months and I haven&#x27;t seen a drastic difference, not like the reviews but I will finish the bottle, don&#x27;t know if I will re order.  as I don&#x27;t have puffiness and only minimal darkness, I haven&#x27;t seen much for the wrinkles yet.  will review again after I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice size!  Goes on smooth and cool. At first it felt sticky, but the feeling fades after a few seconds. This will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly, the gel goes on very nicely and feels good on your skin. It also does not crease up if you put makeup over it, I really like it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product consistently for a month now. Dark circles are genetic for my family. But this works. It does sting a little when you first using it but now this doesn&#x27;t happen. I highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! It is an every day use product and depending on weather and activity will wear off after 6-10 hours but works very very well.</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple of days and I can already see a difference. The skin feels tighter and looks great.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My puffiness under my eyes looks better already!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> After using almost a month, i see no improvement. The product does not have enough moisture for my mid-sixty eye area. Also not seeing any dark circle improvement. Might work ok for younger eyes.</li>
    <li> So glad I got to try this product&lt;br /&gt;Only tried it a few times but seems to be working great&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to Friends and Family&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use bottle as well</li>
    <li> Soothing eye gel, seems to work good.</li>
    <li> Product works great, makes my skin very soft and lessens under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Good product does what it claims and absorbs nicely in skin. Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
    <li> Nice bottle design and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It looks like eye gel, a little bit too light to me w dry skin</li>
    <li> Leaves eyes feeling soft and smooth. Goes on smooth and absorbs fast. Nice light scent, not over powering. Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best ever!  As old as I am, I have very good skin, but this product has made it even better!</li>
    <li> This is so smooth, love this eye cream.</li>
    <li> enjoyed the product, however the packaging made it feel cheap. The plastic bottle that it was in was flimsy and fell apart. Made me feel like I wasn&#x27;t getting a quality item because of poor packaging.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and have helped me to refind my youth.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Smell is nice,  it gives a nice cooling feeling.  Not sure that it works the way they suggest.  I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference to the dark under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about 4 days. I have hereditary dark circles - combined with having 2 young children -  and I definitely notice that my eyes look lighter, brighter and more refreshed using this product. It didn&#x27;t make the dark circles completely go away (nor did I expect it to), but it definitely made them require a lot less makeup. My general eye area is smoother, brighter, and &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34; for concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tingles during application, which I didn&#x27;t immediately like, but by the second use I decided the tingling felt refreshing.</li>
    <li> Have been using it regularly for the last few weeks (morning and night) and noticed that my undereye area have been less puffy. I don&#x27;t have dark circles, just the puffiness. Doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great!  First night I applied, it left my skin smooth and cool. Not heavy,  and did not irritate my skin at all. Will continue to use this product for full results.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims. I first tried it on my first week back to work after summer vacation. I was exhausted and knew that it would be the perfect time to see if this gel would brighten as is states. Yup! Even at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t look as tired as I felt, which was extra helpful when attending my own children&#x27;s back to school events after working with my own students all day. As an added bonus, after a couple days I noticed I have less wrinkles (yeay!) and that is always a plus! I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Nice product! I&#x27;ve had the product for almost 2 weeks.  It feels nice and I can feel my eye area tightening while it dries.  So far so good, I&#x27;m looking forwards to even more results as time goes by!</li>
    <li> Feels good on the eyes - but is she cheap packaging</li>
    <li> have used this in the morning before applying makeup and i love it! it helps with puffiness in the morning</li>
    <li> i use about the size of rice to apply dark circle, however, there is always a small amount of sticky serum come out first after press. After the first part of the wasteful sticky serum it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> it has a nice smell to it. i have only used it for less than a week and already notice a difference in dark circles.</li>
    <li> Did NOTHING for any of my under eye issues. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> ive only used it for a few weeks now...not sure yet</li>
    <li> The texture of the eye cream is light and can be easily applied. I like the pump design of the packaging. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice a significant improvement yet, but will continue to use it for longer.</li>
    <li> This eye gel has been amazing! Im definitely seeing a difference in the dark circles under my eyes.  Also makes my skin feel soft!</li>
    <li> moisturizes the area around my eyes pretty well and helps with my puffiness.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I have used it for about a year and haven&#x27;t had any type of reaction to it. It&#x27;s creamy and velvety when putting it on and makes my skin feel the same way.  A little secret about the container.....it has that small neck on it and just when you think it&#x27;s all gone, it&#x27;s not.  Unscrew the top and take a little implement that you can scoop around under the neck inside the bottle and you&#x27;ll get a whole lot more. I&#x27;ve managed to get about another weeks worth of use by doing that.  The implement i have used is a make-up Q-tip type of thing.  One end of it has a flat end and one end has a pointy end, the flat end has a little neck on it, too, that fits just under the inside neck of the bottle.</li>
    <li> i have super dark circles, puffiness, and some wrinkles under eyes. I&#x27;ve been using so many products in the past few years. Unfortunately, nothing seems to really erase my dark circles as well as reduce my puffiness. Anyways, I was a bit skeptical about this anti aging eye cream because I thought it&#x27;s be like the other products that I&#x27;ve used before. But this seller gave me a chance to try it for such low price and I went ahead and bought it. I was shocked with the result, it actually helped lightening my dark circles puffiness and reduce some of the wrinkles. I think with the long use, this will give me such great result. Can&#x27;t wait to try more items like this. Very recommended!! So try it out if you haven&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye gel and it feels good around my eyes and helps me feel like I&#x27;m getting the good moisture I need.</li>
    <li> I like to use this under my makeup. I noticed that it keeps my makeup out of the lines and creases.</li>
    <li> Good product ! It helped me to lighten my darkness around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and cannot attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness myself but she seems to like it!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Works well - you can really tell it plumps and moisturizes when you use it!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Great price!!</li>
    <li> The cream is pretty thick and I like that because after I apply it, I can feel it on my skin and It tingles my skin a bit also. Overall I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product. The label is a bit blurry which made it hard to read the direction. After using it for a while though, i came to like it, my face felt more silky-smooth and it doesnt feel sticky after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a discounted price to test and try it out then leave an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Works well and lasts</li>

    <li> Feels and smells great!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually working, but I like to think it does.  Keeps my eyes feeling moisturized and skin soft.  It&#x27;s a daily part of my routine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! The bottle feels a bit sticky when I have a bit of the product on my fingers, but my face feel smooth--it isn&#x27;t sticky. I like it.  There is no scent to this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my puffy sinus eyes.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and cute packaging. Dark circles seem to get lighter as I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle</li>
    <li> I like how it makes the under part of my eyes feel cool! havnt used it long enough to tell a difference..</li>
    <li> I used it daily, have not seen much difference on my dark circles.  The eye cream goes on smooth, however it leaves a sticky feeling under my eyes and areas I applied it to.</li>
    <li> It has been 2 weeks since I started using this eye gel and I can definitely see a difference. I love this eye gel so much , it keeps my eyes hydrated and feeling brighter. No redness or irritation at all. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes due to genetics and lack of sleep. This felt really nice and cool as I applied it. I hope it takes care of the dark circles as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am turning 30 in a Dec, and I have started to notice fine lines around my eyes. I decided to try this product, and I am glad I did. I saw a noticeable difference under my eyes after 2 days of use. I recommend this product for men and women of any age. It is never too late to start taking care of your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought three bottles of this stuff. I&#x27;m giving it three stars cause I really don&#x27;t feel it did what it said it would. I didn&#x27;t see any inproments after the third bottle so I stopped using it. I felt it left my eyes under neath greasy feeling and it was not just once it was eveytime I used it. There are plenty I mean PLEANTY of under eye creams that got great review the same price as this cream. So I will be trying them.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! Having kids means some sleepless nights and this gel definitely made my eyes less puffy and not as dark. :)</li>

    <li> Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having two young children under the age of 6 that wake up at 5 AM every morning &amp; being a full time working mom, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product out to see if it would decrease the dark circles &amp; puffiness of my eye area due to lack of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product this just that &amp; I cannot be more thrilled with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product feels so good around my eyes.  I can feel the tightness of the skin as soon as I apply it.  My eyes don&#x27;t look as tired as it did previously did.  Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have bags under eyes.  I am almost 67 and have really aged in the 4 years my 93 yr old mom has lived with me due to the stress of her dementia.  Never know what to expect.  I can see how much I have aged from last driver&#x27;s license to this one.  I am using in conjunction with a hyaluronic acid serum and moisture cream.  I have only been using this product for 3 or 4 days.  Had 2 men in Walmart making conversation with me today.  Hasn&#x27;t happened in a few years.  WOW.  I thought I could tell a difference but that helped confirm it.  LOL.  Goes on great, smooth under my makeup and puffy eyes are not near as puffy in such a short time.  When you see 5 star product and there is only 1 review be wary.  When you see a product with 60 or 70 good reviews of 5 stars then there has to be something to it.  Thanks all of you satisfied reviews for giving me good advice on this product.  Great product at a great price with very nice results.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money</li>
    <li> Totally reduces puffiness almost instantly!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised... this product is light weight &amp; I can actually see the difference!  thanks!</li>
    <li> If only I would remember to use this more often! I always see such a big difference the days I remember to use it. Great product. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Really helps with the under eye puffiness and dark circles.</li>
    <li> Love the cucumber scent and the light weight of the gel! Perfect for the hot summers here in the south. Will continue to use!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be a waste of money. It did nothing for my wrinkles after 3 weeks of using it.I got my money back as promised, thank u essential beauty for you justice. Unfortunately that cream wasn&#x27;t my best trial product.</li>
    <li> its very good. black circles go way after 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;and puffiness also. i am addicted to this product.</li>
    <li> This gel has really softened my skin and smoothed out my eye area. It is the only thing I have been able to use with my regular moisturizing routine that has not made my skin super dry or greasy. I really like it!</li>
    <li> What a grate product for the price. I have tryed alot of eye creams However this one out ranks them all.</li>
    <li> only been using it for like a week so I cant say to much yet when im like 4-5 weeks in I&#x27;ll rewrite a review!</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping. Feels cool and refreshing after a long day and is rejuvenating when applied in the am- goes on smooth under makeup.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, as it isn&#x27;t harsh, has a pleasant light cucumber scent and it really firms up around my eyes.  I have seen the difference in just a short week that I have been using it.</li>
    <li> The product shipped and delivered on time. I have only been using this for a couple of days but so far I love the scent and it seems to take down some of the puffiness around my lower eye are.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best Anti-Aging eye cream on the market. After the first use, my skin felt tighter and reduced the dark circles and puffiness around my eyes. I use it every morning and I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for the same results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have been using it for about a week and I love it! My eyes look brighter and no dark circles! I don&#x27;t sleep well so this stuff is great to put to wake me up for the day. It&#x27;s soothing and smells good. I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is wonderful. Soothing, not greasy and light. Recommended to all of my friends. Try it and you will see.</li>
    <li> Waking in the mornings can be an ugly sight. My eyes look like I have been smacked with someone&#x27;s fist. After application of  the anti-aging crime my mornings look much brighter!</li>
    <li> Does not moisturize at all - feels drying.  Also burned slightly when applied and has an unappealing smell.  Returned.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Great , exactly as ordered</li>
    <li> Thought it was over-priced for the .5 ounce bottle but I can honestly see the difference in my complexion that everyone around me has noticed. I&#x27;m 52 and have the complexion of someone in their late 30&#x27;s, or so I have been told. Healthy eating and lifestyle doesn&#x27;t hurt either but the Essence2Beauty has tightened around my eyes, along with my daily moisturizer, I&#x27;m just glowing with youthfulness and loving it.</li>
    <li> I took my forever to find this effective and affordable eye cream for my under eye bags.am soo glad with the results and ordering my next bottle now.thanks for the quick shipment too. It really the best eye cream out there.</li>
    <li> I saw results after only three days! Dark circles under eyes are visibly improved and my eyes look brighter and younger! Very happy with this product and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The product felt really great.  I like the cooling feeling and it did seem to help with puffiness.  However after the first couple of days my bottle would not pump product out anymore.</li>
    <li> I have even using this eye team twice a day for about 5 days. I have oily skin and this eye cream is the perfect consistency. It&#x27;s almost like a cream gel. And it&#x27;s not sticky at all. It absorbs into your skin very well. I can tell under my eyes looks brighter already. I will definitely keep using this. You don&#x27;t have to use much so this bottle will last awhile!</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and this feels so moisturizing on my skin when I use it!  I have only used it a few days and I can already see a difference on the skin around my eyes. I will certainly continue using it.</li>
    <li> This cream appeared to tighten the skin around my eyes, lessening the look of wrinkles  I think it is a good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this product. I have tried so many different types and brands of eye creams and none of them have worked as well as THIS PRODUCT. I&#x27;ve only been using if for 5 days and I already notice that my eyebags are diminishing, my skin feels softer and looks younger and it has also helped diminsh my wrinkles. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone looking to get rid of under eye bags.</li>
    <li> Love it! My mom loves it too!</li>
    <li> Using for a week now, no results yet. Still hoping.  Used the whole bottle. Did not work for me. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> I am loving this eye cream.  It doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes like some other eye cremes I&#x27;ve used before.  For how inexpensive it is, I think it is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in dark spots under eye after using it.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for.  I really liked the refreshing smell for one and could already tell a difference under my eyes in less than 48 hours.  My eyes were noticeably less puffy. And the cream really smoothed out the bags under my eyes.  I am happy to have found a product that actually works!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye gel!  Goes on easily and absorbs quickly, my skin feels smooth and silky, I have noticed after using 2 times a day for about 2 weeks that I have less puffiness, lines are less noticeable and my skin looks more refreshed. As for dark circles I&#x27;m not sure if they are getting lighter or if it&#x27;s that I look more rested and firmer? This product works really well with my moisturizer and makeup, there is no clumping or buildup and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Works really well I&#x27;m very sastified with this product.</li>
    <li> My eye area is very sensitive, and easily irritated, and this eye gel does not cause me any irritation or discomfort, and feels very cool and soothing. I was also able to wear it under my daily moisturizer without any issues or flaking as I&#x27;ve had this problem with other products in the past. You really only need a very small amount. An overall really good product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this gel but I can say for sure that there are immediate results. I double blind tested my husband the first few days I got it.  The first day I put it on my bare face and waited a few minutes.  I asked him if he noticed anything different about me and he did, but could not put his finger on what it was.  The next day I didn&#x27;t put it on and asked him the same question and this time he told me I looked tired, or like I didn&#x27;t have any makeup on.  The following day I put it on under one eye and not the other.  He was immediately able to tell that my treated eye looked better.  He said it looked less dark underneath and I had less puffiness too.  I don&#x27;t know about the long term benefits of this product as I have only used it for about 2 weeks but I can say for sure that there are immediate noticeable differences.</li>
    <li> It seems to tighten up my eye area a little, but I noticed a bigger difference the first time I tried it. I use this under my concealer and it works fine. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price. Would like to see this closer to $10.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in days. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I must say the shipping was super fast...the packing is great and the product itself is good it&#x27;s going to be on my October favorite products list it smells fresh and feels good when you put it on unlike some eye creams I have tried it&#x27;s not sticky ekkk I hate sticky products and this one is not at all I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels under my eyes. I use it in the morning and I feel slight tightening around my eyes, it works way better than other organic products I have used. The only downfall is it goes fast, it does not last me very long.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Defiantly will recommend</li>
    <li> Great product that truly works. Super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I hate for about two months and still haven&#x27;t seen results and I use it day and night looking for a product that really works especially for dark circles.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff! Smells good and is gentle on my skin</li>
    <li> dried out my skin and did not help with any of the &#x27;benefits&#x27; the product claimed to administer.  not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great product, my mother has been using it for a few weeks and I am impressed. The wrinkles around her eyes are less visible.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye gel for almost a week now and am very pleased with the results.  When I apply the gell, it feels tingly and cool around the eyes. I am prone to dry skin, and the gel adds moisture to my eye area that lasts all day. The gel does not have an order and feels pretty light weight.  Is also gets absorbed into the skin without leaving residue like some other eye products I have tried.  I am also a fan of the organic ingredients used in this gel. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a bigger bottle. I have been using for a couple of days now and i can see a small difference in my eyes. Hope to see a bigger difference  as I use it more.</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Gel!  The BEST EVER!! 100% Satisfied!!</li>
    <li> not bad but with no different with my other products.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product, but I am very disappointed.  I have used the product as recommended for over a month now and I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my dark circles or puffiness. Will not buy again; truly a waste of money!!! And they won&#x27;t let me return the unused bottle.</li>
    <li> Like it , works well but I&#x27;m going  back to my pure cosmetics  for my eye cream just wanted to try something  different.</li>
    <li> I usef this for the first time and I love it. It is cool and soothing. I feel like it has improved the tiny lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works as recommended, this is a silky cream as opposed to an oil based product. It does the job of helping my skin glow during the day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this gel! It does everything it says it will and more. It completely removes my undereye bags, does it fast, and has no strong smell. The price is right, and it&#x27;s really a miracle  worker. I give it more than 5 stars, and I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, this product is great.  It has been two days and I have already seen the difference in puffiness and lines.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This product made my eye swell and itch. It also dried out my eye area and it said that it moisturizes.</li>
    <li> best eye cream around</li>
    <li> I have used this everyday for a little over a month. It feels nice when going on but I can&#x27;t say that it has really done anything at all for my skin. The search continues........</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the BEST Eye Gel. I may have to use it longer to see better effects, but, I have had it for several days and not totally convinced yet.</li>
    <li> I am wondering if most of the reviews on here are fake. Because this has done nothing for my eyes! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to see that my anti-aging, eye serum had arrived in the mail.  I recently turned 35 and although I take really good care of my skin, there have been more noticeable wrinkles and dark areas on my face, especially around my eye area.  That being said, I really love the results of this eye serum.  Instantly noticed the difference in the appearance and feel of the skin surrounding my eyes.  In fact, I used some of the serum in other areas of my face and also noticed a difference within a few days.  Every since I was a child, I&#x27;ve always had really sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t use most face products as they use harsh chemicals and strip my face of its natural moisture.  That is why I&#x27;m truly impressed with this product.  My face looks radiant and feels great, not dry at all.  Also want to mention that although the portion of the serum is small, it only takes a little application of the product to cover the problem areas.</li>
    <li> this is amazing very happy,thanks</li>
    <li> i like it but black cycles are still there</li>
    <li> As a man, I never order this kind of stuff. But I&#x27;m been noticing my dark circles over the last couple of years and decided I better try something to lighten them up so I don&#x27;t look so tired all the time. Being in sales, I fear this might affect business if clients get the wrong idea or make assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this twice a day for two months, I can see absolutely no difference. None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, this product creates a slight burning sensation when applied to my skin. But that only happens about 1 every week or 10 days. I also do feel a tightening sensation after it&#x27;s applied. But at the end of the day, if I can&#x27;t see any difference, what&#x27;s the point? My wife brought home a competing product that I&#x27;m going to try instead.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great! I love that many of the ingredients are organic I love that is not tested on animals and I love that smooths cools and depuffs my eyes. It&#x27;s a small little bottle but you hardly need a pump per use. The smell is great and it&#x27;s cooling and rejuvenating right away when you put it on.I don&#x27;t have dark circles so can&#x27;t speak to that, but the puffiness under my eyes goes away wonderfully. WHen you 1st put it on it tightens as it dries, once you put moisturizer on that feeling goes away. I have been using it for about a month and will continue to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not used to natural ingredients, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this, but I liked the idea. The product is gel-like and quite thick. No matter how much or how little I applied to my eye area, it always feels a little crunchy when it dries. It doesn&#x27;t seem to soak in as much as dry.  It does feel moisturizing, though, and I love that the natural ingredients are soothing and I&#x27;m not loading up my skin with chemicals.</li>
    <li> The product has good quality.</li>
    <li> No sticky feeling at all, and absorb easily.  Very moisturize, and price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no improvement.  It arrived quickly, smells fresh, and has a nice consistency but does nothing for my dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels going on.</li>
    <li> not greasy, smells wonderful and makes your eyes feel refreshed</li>
    <li> When I first put the cream on it makes my eyelids feel warm, almost hot, and then it cools down, but I saw not noticeable improvement in the way my eye area looked or felt.</li>
    <li> good stuff, a noticeable difference under my eyes</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement of any kind; but it didn&#x27;t make things worse either.  I expected much better based on all the wonderful reviews.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great! Wrinkles are much diminished.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works...</li>
</ol>
