      <li>Fits perfectly upright and lays almost all the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product holds a nail polish bottle beautifully both upright and at an angle.</li>
      <li>Great deal.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made out of a semi-soft plastic/rubber material so it sticks to my surface well without sliding around (a happy accident of the design I assume).</li>

      <li>Cheap, yes, but it took forever to be delivered.</li>
      <li>But the bottom line is, with nail polish bottles being so intricately designed nowadays, they just simply don&#x27;t fit in both positions in the holder like I thought they would.</li>
      <li>I think the only reason I would suggest getting this would be if you want the comfort in knowing that most bottles fit upright and keep the bottle secure from tipping over when you go to get more polish on the brush.</li>

      <li>Hansen works well; a good product overall.</li>
      <li>Really does fit any size nail polish (except mini ones)</li>
      <li>I do own over 27 different names/labels (not manufacturers) of nail polish</li>
      <li>but well worth the wait</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>but I think it will be all right.</li>
      <li>I broke my right wrist and couldn&#x27;t hold anything.  </li>
      <li>it doesnt fit normal size bottles</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now for the nitty gritty details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start with the only two bottles that I own (there could be more</li>
      <li>Received quickly, great deal, anxious to use</li>
      <li>I like the holder and it&#x27;s flexible enough to hold most of the polished.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I was willing to wait because I thought it would do everything I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>I was willing to wait because I thought it would do everything I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>I have not had any problems with different sizes of bottles fitting in the holders.</li>
      <li>Short version, does not hold MOST nail polish bottles in the \\&quot;all the way\\</li>
      <li>It will take a little more effort to put the fat Orly bottles in it, but they still fit.</li>
      <li>Very helpful tool for painting nails holds many different shaped bottles.</li>
      <li>keeps your bottle nice and tight and snug when doing your nails</li>
      <li>Thanks for your time.</li>
      <li>but doesnt fit different shaped bottles.</li>
      <li>Never have to throw a partially used bottle out and no spillage from getting the most of the polish.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your time.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The size of the nail polish bottle you see in the picture is the only size nail polish that it fits comfortably.</li>
      <li>It should be noted that larger polish bottles, like OPI are tougher to fit.</li>
      <li>COVER GIRL BOUNDLESS COLOR: (almost a perfect square bottle fairly tall)</li>
      <li>This little item is wonderful, no more spilled nail polish and a price.</li>
      <li>(average round bottle) Fits perfectly in the holder upright and almost lays down perfectly as well, but tends to pop back up after a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice idea, but these holders do not fit my polish bottles which are more chubby in round or square shape....</li>
      <li>I have actually had nail polish bottles fall over while simply trying to get more polish because I knocked the bottle by accident.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work for bottles larger than opi.a ND even bottled that are smaller that i have doesn&#x27;t get them at the angle shown in photos.. little dissapointed</li>
    <li> Received both items on time. Well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Only gave 4 stars, not all my polishes fit in it. The rounder bottles are a bit too wide.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchased them</li>
    <li> Nice idea but doesnt fit different shaped bottles. Maybe the liitler bottles would work.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Never have to throw a partially used bottle out and no spillage from getting the most of the polish. Easy to use and maintains the bottle in the correct position.</li>
    <li> Works great-even with big OPI bottles.</li>
    <li> This product will save me from wasting polish - love it</li>
    <li> Fantastic at holding the nail polish just the way you want it.  It will take a little more effort to put the fat Orly bottles in it, but they still fit.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I think it will be all right. It only fits the round nail polish containers. I could not put my square or flat ones into it.</li>
    <li> Not big enough for the nail polishes</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!!  No more crazy balancing acts or spills while using the non-dominate hand to polish.</li>
    <li> Nice but doesn&#x27;t really fit all styles of nail polish bottles!!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t bad. I like them for my polishes that are round but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to get rectangular ones (like Butter London) or those bigger OPI bottles in these holders. You can get them in. It just takes a little wiggling and pushing to do so. I&#x27;d buy them again. They are quite helpful</li>
    <li> .........Short version, does not hold MOST nail polish bottles in the \\&quot;all the way\\&quot; laying down position. I will explain further for those who want more specific details. But the bottom line is, with nail polish bottles being so intricately designed nowadays, they just simply don&#x27;t fit in both positions in the holder like I thought they would. It is suppose to be able to hold the bottle both in the upright position and a laying position to get the little bit left when the bottle is almost empty. The holder opening is 1 inch in diameter, the slit is less than 1/2 inch wide and the total height is just under 2 inches tall from the highest point. The holder is made of flexible rubber, however the flexibility is still not enough to make the oddly shaped bottles fit comfortably. I do own over 27 different names/labels (not manufacturers) of nail polish so I feel I can give a FAIR assessment (not perfect) of the holder in question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the nitty gritty details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start with the only two bottles that I own (there could be more but i dont own them) that actually do fit and work in this holder as it should. The winners are.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETITES: BY SCHERER (short thin square bottle) and&lt;br /&gt;RIMMEL (LONDON) 60 SECONDS (short average round bottle) both are almost 2 and 3/4 tall and most of my other nail polish bottles are taller than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the other brands and their pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. SINFUL COLORS: (fat round bottle) BARELY fits in holder upright and must be manipulated to get in the holder. Almost too fat and round.

COVER GIRL BOUNDLESS COLOR: (almost a perfect square bottle fairly tall) Fits SNUGGLY in the holder. almost to wide. Does not lay down enough thru the slit to get to the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13. AVON SPEED DRY: (oval bottle) Fits upright.

NYC IN A NEW YORK COLOR MINUTE: (average round bottle) Fits perfectly upright and lays almost all the way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;29. L.A. COLORS ART DECO STRIPING POLISH: (tall thin round bottle) Too loose upright. But lays down perfectly snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, those are all the different polishes I have at the moment. Sorry if your polish wasn&#x27;t on the list. However, if you copy this list to your mail or phone and are at the store you can get an idea of what the bottles look like in actuality and can compare the ones you use to how the ones on this list fit in the holder. But after spending the $2.50 price with free shipping and getting two of them (one I gave to my daughter) I think the only reason I would suggest getting this would be if you want the comfort in knowing that most bottles fit upright and keep the bottle secure from tipping over when you go to get more polish on the brush. I have actually had nail polish bottles fall over while simply trying to get more polish because I knocked the bottle by accident. So I do use the holder to secure my polish from accidental spills. Just a note, I did have to wait 20 days before it arrived. It does state that length of time on the seller&#x27;s info section because it comes from HONG KONG. I was willing to wait because I thought it would do everything I needed it to do. I&#x27;m not sure how this got so many stars from other reviewers, but I can only believe it&#x27;s because they are using totally different brands or types of polish than me. I always go for the cheaper polish because I had a polish addiction that I had to eventually stop. So if you use the better quality/more expensive brands I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t comment on those brands. I would definitely read several reviews to get a broader opinion of this product. I hope that this list at least helps aid in your decision buying process.

COLORS ART DECO STRIPING POLISH: (tall thin round bottle) Too loose upright. But lays down perfectly snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, those are all the different polishes I have at the moment. Sorry if your polish wasn&#x27;t on the list. However, if you copy this list to your mail or phone and are at the store you can get an idea of what the bottles look like in actuality and can compare the ones you use to how the ones on this list fit in the holder. Butafter spending the $2.50 price with free shipping and getting two of them (one I gave to my daughter) I think the only reason I would suggest getting this would be if you want the comfort in knowing that most bottles fit upright and keep the bottle secure from tipping over when you go to get more polish on the brush. I have actually had nail polish bottles fall over while simply trying to get more polish because I knocked the bottle by accident. So I do use the holder to secure my polish from accidental spills. Just a note, I did have to wait 20 days before it arrived. It does state that length of time on the seller&#x27;s info section because it comes from HONG KONG. I was willing to wait because I thought it would do everything I needed it to do. I&#x27;m not sure how this got so many stars from other reviewers, but I can only believe it&#x27;s because they are using totally different brands or types of polish than me. I always go for the cheaper polish because I had a polish addiction that I had to eventually stop. So if you use the better quality/more expensive brands I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t comment on those brands. I would definitely read several reviews to get a broader opinion of this product. I hope that this list at least helps aid in your decision buying process. Thanks for your time.</li>
    <li> Good price. Would buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Tiles the bottle for you, and is stationary. Don&#x27;t have to  Worry about spilling product.</li>
    <li> Love, love,  love! ! Makes getting to the bottom of my polish bottles easier because I can tip the bottle without  having to hold it.</li>
    <li> Packaging sucked but the product works wonders.</li>
    <li> First, the only con: it does not seem to hold the bottle at quite as low an angle as shown in the picture. However, this may change with use as the plastic while pliable, is a bit stiff right now. It may not loosen up, but I think it will.&lt;br /&gt;This product holds a nail polish bottle beautifully both upright and at an angle. It&#x27;s made out of a semi-soft plastic/rubber material so it sticks to my surface well without sliding around (a happy accident of the design I assume). But the thing I love best is that it holds a bottle at an angle making it so easy to use a nail polish bottle and brush and really helps when the product in your bottle is low.</li>
    <li> A little tight with some bottles. Otherwise works great.</li>
    <li> So far, all of my polishes have fit in these and it holds them at the perfect angle. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> it doesnt fit all sizes. it doesnt fit normal size bottles</li>
    <li> most of my polish bottles are too fat to go into holders. They must  have mini bottle in the ones in picture.</li>
    <li> Works great! Would do business again</li>
    <li> Nice idea, but these holders do not fit my polish bottles which are more chubby in round or square shape....unlike those pictured.  Holder bends out of shape causing it to be unstable.  My own fault.  I should have realized.  I may notch or cut into them to see if I can make them work.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> works great for smaller bottles, a little tight for for OPI bottles.</li>
    <li> It took longer then expected to get here :( But I finally got it I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet</li>
    <li> Keeps polish from falling  over</li>
    <li> I bought these to make polishing my nails easier and this definitely helps. I accidentally ordered two more at the same time I ordered these two, no worries, they will make great gifts for my neices.</li>
    <li> Love these! Never spill nail polish again! Really does fit any size nail polish (except mini ones) shipping took almost 2 weeks but well worth the wait</li>
    <li> Love these.  They work well with all size bottles.  Although I don&#x27;t have any London Butter bottles to try with it.  I haven&#x27;t spilled a bottled since I got these.</li>
    <li> I like the holder and it&#x27;s flexible enough to hold most of the polished. However.... the product description says  \\&quot;2 x nail polish bottle holder\\&quot;. I only received 1.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I imagined. The size of the nail polish bottle you see in the picture is the only size nail polish that it fits comfortably. But once you break in the rubber, it becomes easier to cram in other bottles of all shapes and sizes. It&#x27;s kind of an awkward squeeze but it definitely gets the job done. It has made doing my nails easier.</li>
    <li> A WASTE OF MONEY!  IT IS HARD TO GET MOST BOTTLES OF POLISH INTO IT AND IT DOES NOT STAY IN PLACE.</li>
    <li> Not every weird bottle I have fits in here but that&#x27;s totally fine, holds most great and is a great product to add to my tool box! :)</li>
    <li> It should be noted that larger polish bottles, like OPI are tougher to fit. It can be done with a little finessing though.</li>
    <li> These things are the best invention ever!!!!  Love them...keeps your bottle nice and tight and snug when doing your nails and it does not move when trying to get the polish out of a bottle that is almost empty!!!  Would recommend to all ladies out there!!!!!</li>
    <li> Only holds small polish bottles.</li>
    <li> I love these! So glad I have 2 of them.</li>
    <li> I love this product is so easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to struggle with your polish anymore. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works fine with most brands and bottle shapes but some of them don&#x27;t sit as angled as needed. I bought this to hold the bottle and let me get to the bottom when the bottle was running low. The manufacturer can&#x27;t help the wide variety of available bottle shapes but neither do I buy weird brands with uncommon shapes. For that I am docking one star since the manufacturer should know its intended target customer base and consider what is available where they reside. None of the brands I use have changed bottles in years.</li>
    <li> These are great. I broke my right wrist and couldn&#x27;t hold anything.  But I could at least paint my toes.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and so useful! I use them when the polish gets a little low in the bottles. It also helps stabilize the bottles in case you get a little clumsy like I do! I have not had any problems with different sizes of bottles fitting in the holders.</li>
    <li> The best thing ever. No more having to hold the bottle and mess up nail polish. I got them for my sisters and friends, they love them.</li>
    <li> They do what they say but they smell god awful, almost never use them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. I hate throwing away bottles of nail polishe that have polish left in them.  This product helps you get every possible last drop of polish.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> Made for small nail polish.  I have to shove my nail polish in there but it does hold the polish just got to make it fit</li>
    <li> It does NOT fit Essie bottles. Not even smaller bottles of other brands. Cheap, yes, but it took forever to be delivered.</li>
    <li> Does not tilt well for larger bottles of polish, such as PINK ARMOUR or Nutra Nail .  SAlly Hansen works well; a good product overall.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit very many bottles.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This little item is wonderful, no more spilled nail polish and a price.</li>
    <li> I understood this to be 2 pieces, 2 holders. I only received one</li>
    <li> Perfect! I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Received quickly, great deal, anxious to use</li>
    <li> A little long getting here but these are great!</li>
    <li> Very helpful tool for painting nails holds many different shaped bottles.</li>
