      <li>amazing stuff  ..</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll have an amazing looking side part.</li>
      <li>every kind, Suavetico, Axe, etc.).</li>
      <li>If your going for the greaser look or a nice pomade this is for you plus the oils in it replenishes your hair and makes it healthier than ever</li>
      <li>the kind of tossled, volumnous look that i want</li>

      <li>I have tried the AXE and SUAVASITO brands and liked them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Murrays&#x27; Super Light pomade is awesome.  </li>
      <li>Pros: pleasant smell, GREAT hold that lasts all day, hair becomes very manageable after pomade has been in hair for a while, &amp; price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  applying to hair is a lot like applying a extra-thick honey.  </li>
      <li>very easy to deal with as I have  the ap on my phone</li>
      <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve used ocean salt sprays, axe pomade, got2be pomade and gel all before, and this is the best thing by far.</li>
      <li>&gt; Plus the tin container when washed and clean makes a good ashtray..or to hold nuts n bolts..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s Pomade for 2 years now and it has kept me as handsome as ever.</li>
      <li>The shipping everything was fast &amp; great but the product itself...</li>
      <li>I Really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love Murray&#x27;s i don&#x27;t use any thing els except for dax veggie oil for my pomp butt</li>
      <li>I also Love using it when I am</li>
      <li>interesting product</li>
      <li>If you have the foresight to use some veggie oil in your hair while showering followed by a shampoo you will remove more of the product.  </li>
      <li>It took me 4 shampoo washes + 3 washes with bar soap + 3 more with dish soap to get it ALMOST out.</li>
      <li>works better with dampened hair too.</li>
      <li>but i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>id rather pay a dollar more than wait two weeks .keep</li>
      <li>Often I find it looks better after I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>Very effective at holding all day and gives you that very shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you want the Rat Pack look, or the 50&#x27;s look, the Elvis look, even just a clean cut modern man look, its great for all of them.</li>
      <li>Best to get the product wet in your hands as well.</li>
      <li>My hair is more light and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But better to enjoy it for 2-3 days and easily wash it out with just shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The biggest problem and arguably benefit of Murray&#x27;s is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair easily.</li>
      <li>It sticks on hair and doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
      <li>i.e. it does NOT apply easily, does not wash off your hands easily, nor shower out easily.</li>
      <li>But once you get the technique down, this is the best product for the look.</li>
      <li>fine product, just not for me.</li>
      <li>Also on very hot days,it will become more plyable.</li>
      <li>So cheap...</li>
      <li>Fantastic pomade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
      <li>As many people have mentioned in reviews (why didn&#x27;t I read them first...</li>
      <li>To take it out, use Suave Groom &amp; Clean.</li>
      <li>by the way, my ORDER HISTORY lists this item as the SUPER LIGHT pomade.  </li>
      <li>the description was for \\&quot;super light\\&quot; pomade (there was no photo available at the time i made the purchase).  </li>
      <li>This is the best hair stuff for dudes with thick ass hair like mine.</li>
      <li>the pomp strong and the hair greasy ;)</li>
      <li>the product is dated, but is more suitable for those who don&#x27;t clean their hair as often or are going for the authentic old-fashioned styling (culturally this is fine as for some cultures washing the hair is not frequent).  </li>
      <li>Your hair stays in place the whole day but can easily be adjusted with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not considering price (a can of this costs about $3 at most stores), this pomade works better for me for all hairstyles than any of the higher end brands I&#x27;ve tried (American Crew --</li>
      <li>3 things I love about it,but as far as it making hair fall out...</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that will glue your hair into some shape for days on end without being &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; then this might be the right product for you.  </li>
      <li>As of the 21st century of America though, people tend to like products that wash out better since we wash hair more frequently on average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like that Murray&#x27;s is stiff and applies easily to my hair, keeps it tidy all day, and doesn&#x27;t discolor my pillowcase.</li>
      <li>The modern re-surgence of pomade popularity has corresponded to the ability of brands like Axe or Korg to actually be washed out of hair with soap and warm water.  </li>
      <li>It works great on Asian male&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>too greasy for my son..holds but feels like an oil slick..would not purchase again due to better products being available..</li>
      <li>, with many pomades, you&#x27;re essentially putting petrolateum in your hair.</li>
      <li>Sure, I&#x27;m a white guy.</li>
      <li>bought this at CVS for the first time and like it</li>
      <li>The Pomade is OK- if you&#x27;re looking for a shiny, slicked back look, this is the stuff for you.</li>
      <li>what i received was the regular Superior pomade, which i can find in any local store.  </li>
      <li>If U put too much in...get a hot towel + hot water and comb the excess out.</li>
      <li>only thing is you have to make sure not to use too much.  </li>
      <li>With Murray&#x27;s, I can spike my hair, give it a messy look, slick it straight back, and part it perfectly for more formal occasions like job interviews.</li>
      <li>Secondly, the mildly perfumed scent is kind of nice and a bit nostalgic.</li>
      <li>It had a high shine and holds pretty well.</li>
      <li>two more minor positive notes, the true waxiness of Murrays allows styling and strength even possible for some of the modern pomade formulations.  </li>
      <li>Lasts 24 hours, but easily washes out with no apparent build-up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic product and the only one I use.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and like the paste would order from there again ....</li>
      <li>the dish soap really clings to it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain about this stuff.</li>
      <li>It will loosen up and become much easier.</li>
      <li>so much i needed to review</li>
      <li>Really you can swim underwater, when you come up, Brad Pitt perfect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it gets to be too much if i use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i like it so much that i want people who see product to know</li>
      <li>- you can achieve effects that you could not other wise do, but its not something I&#x27;m going to be using on a daily basis for my 2&amp;#34; long wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>Usually both detergents and warm water wash out hair stiffeners like gel and some of the newer pomade (wax) formulations.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: I use less and it gets better each day.</li>
      <li>Most likely, I&#x27;ll donate the remaining two containers and try something different or buy more of what was my liking previously.</li>
      <li>Murrays is supposed to be greasy dont try to compare it to axe or anything else because this is about simplicity and getting a classic look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s Pomade for 2 years now and it has kept me as handsome as ever. My only complaint was that it was difficult to find at my local grocery store, so purchasing them as a 3 pack for the price was a no-brainer. With 3 containers of Murray&#x27;s Pomade, I would say that I am set for another 2 years.</li>
    <li> My sons are very happy</li>
    <li> too greasy for my son..holds but feels like an oil slick..would not purchase again due to better products being available..</li>
    <li> Murrays&#x27; Super Light pomade is awesome.  Unfortunately, Amazon keeps sending Murray&#x27;s Superior pomade, which is way too thick.  I have returned the item and been sent back the same thing, so beware, you may not get what you are ordering.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that can keep my thick hair in place! It&#x27;s a little hard to put in but, do yourself a favor and put something on top. I use royal Crown Pomade. Maybe an 80/20 ratio and you&#x27;ll have an amazing looking side part. To take it out, use Suave Groom &amp; Clean. I&#x27;m a definitely loyal Murray&#x27;s Superior Fan!</li>
    <li> Not considering price (a can of this costs about $3 at most stores), this pomade works better for me for all hairstyles than any of the higher end brands I&#x27;ve tried (American Crew -- every kind, Suavetico, Axe, etc.). And one can typically lasts me 3+ months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;m a white male with dark brown hair that curls and frizzes more than I&#x27;d like. In fact, every other product I&#x27;ve tried has made my hair frizzy. Not Murray&#x27;s. With Murray&#x27;s, I can spike my hair, give it a messy look, slick it straight back, and part it perfectly for more formal occasions like job interviews. No frizz, no curls. The stuff makes you look like a movie star after a while. Any hair length I&#x27;ve had, same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You almost have to apply Murray&#x27;s to wet hair; it&#x27;s like a glue. Best to do it after a shower. But a small, dime to quarter amount will work. Best to get the product wet in your hands as well. The hold will be pretty instant, but it will look more complete after drying (sometimes I blow dry my hair). Your hair stays in place the whole day but can easily be adjusted with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason a can of Murray&#x27;s lasts so long for me is that I only have to apply it every 2-3 days. In fact, it would probably stay in my hair longer if I didn&#x27;t shower. Often I find it looks better after I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;slept&amp;#34; in it and wake up the next morning. My hair is more light and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem and arguably benefit of Murray&#x27;s is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair easily. I like it that way: I use less and it gets better each day. But for those that have trouble getting it out with just shampoo, try a drop of dish soap, like Dawn. See, Murray&#x27;s is kind of like a thick grease (not to say it makes your hair greasy), and the dish soap really clings to it. But better to enjoy it for 2-3 days and easily wash it out with just shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fantastic product and the only one I use.</li>
    <li> I dont like this product. The shipping everything was fast &amp; great but the product itself... no</li>
    <li> I Really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I always use it for my clients with thining edges or to make&lt;br /&gt;there Hairline look great! I also Love using it when I am&lt;br /&gt;doing braids or cornrows. You have to try this stuff it is Great~</li>
    <li> Awesome product would recommend to anyone with thicker hair</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Its a great price, but my hair is defintiely &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; once i put it on. Also loses some of its hold after a few hours.</li>
    <li> the description was for \\&quot;super light\\&quot; pomade (there was no photo available at the time i made the purchase).  what i received was the regular Superior pomade, which i can find in any local store.  that&#x27;s why i ordered what i thought was the much more difficult to find \\&quot;super light\\&quot; product.  i was not informed by anyone that the \\&quot;super light\\&quot; was unavailable; just shipped the other product instead.  boo.  by the way, my ORDER HISTORY lists this item as the SUPER LIGHT pomade.  when i clicked on that heading i was conveniently re-directed to the product page for the Superior (now with a picture of the product that yes, i received, but DID NOT ORDER).  Double boo.</li>
    <li> I recently started use pomades. I have tried the AXE and SUAVASITO brands and liked them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw a deal on Murray&#x27;s Pomade so bought it. I found the product is extremely thick and greasy, not very water soluable, meaning doesn&#x27;t come off completely with one shampoo. Most likely, I&#x27;ll donate the remaining two containers and try something different or buy more of what was my liking previously. The one container I opened, I&#x27;ll keep it around to lubricate hinges for my wrought iron doors (LOL)</li>
    <li> Sure, I&#x27;m a white guy. This product may not be aimed directly at my dirty blonde locks, but that&#x27;s where it ended up. When my hair gets long, it becomes a mess! Hair gel has no effect whatsoever at taming the beast. But wax works. The only downside is that girls running their fingers through it are not big fans. But hey, it keeps it reliably out of my face all day, so I&#x27;ve always been quite happy with it!</li>
    <li> I just posted in the single product version of this but i like it so much that i want people who see product to know too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at CVS for the first time and like it so much i needed to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it took me a few tries to get the technique down but this stuff is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self-description: Male hair has been 2-4.5 inches while i&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST PUT THIS IN WET HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats the key, it feels like glue, i put almost nothing on my  finger and rub it vigorously into and on my entire head, the stuff stays immediately, i let it air dry and it looks and feels like nothing is in my hair but the kind of tossled, volumnous look that i want, i can run my hand through my hair and adjust the look a little if i want and it will hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this stuff with dry hair it will look like your hair is hard. because it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used ocean salt sprays, axe pomade, got2be pomade and gel all before, and this is the best thing by far. by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only use it about every 3 days, and i don&#x27;t really wash my hair, i have a homemade mix of like 80-20 conditioner/shampoo which i use every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use the murrays every few days and the ocean spray stuff to maintain a little hold in between but it gets to be too much if i use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;find your system but i love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Nice, Cheap, really good!</li>
    <li> Fantastic pomade. Best for the money. BE CAREFUL. I tore out quite a bit of hair. Just get your technique down. USE ONLY A DAB AT A TIME. If you start to tear your hair out, if it gets difficult to comb through. Use a hairdryer and heat up your hair. It will loosen up and become much easier. But once you get the technique down, this is the best product for the look. If you want the Rat Pack look, or the 50&#x27;s look, the Elvis look, even just a clean cut modern man look, its great for all of them. Its the same product Leonardo DiCaprio uses, there you go, celebrity. You&#x27;ll like it, just be careful and give it time.</li>
    <li> keep the pompadour up!</li>
    <li> The modern re-surgence of pomade popularity has corresponded to the ability of brands like Axe or Korg to actually be washed out of hair with soap and warm water.  Usually both detergents and warm water wash out hair stiffeners like gel and some of the newer pomade (wax) formulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murrays is a classic mainstay in that it really is heavy on the wax, and not a lot of other expensive organic addatives.  As a result~ just like was, Murrays is not really water or detergent soluble and needs either hight heat or lipid exposure (like washing hair with oil) to be removed after using.  Result?  if you put some Murrays in your hair is is going to stay there for days, and showering won&#x27;t bring it out.  If you have the foresight to use some veggie oil in your hair while showering followed by a shampoo you will remove more of the product.  Alternatively, shampooing like 10x in a row and using the warmest water possible will aid removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas the product is dated, but is more suitable for those who don&#x27;t clean their hair as often or are going for the authentic old-fashioned styling (culturally this is fine as for some cultures washing the hair is not frequent).  As of the 21st century of America though, people tend to like products that wash out better since we wash hair more frequently on average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On two more minor positive notes, the true waxiness of Murrays allows styling and strength even possible for some of the modern pomade formulations.  Secondly, the mildly perfumed scent is kind of nice and a bit nostalgic.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will glue your hair into some shape for days on end without being &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; then this might be the right product for you.  As many people have mentioned in reviews (why didn&#x27;t I read them first... oh, yea - it was only $8 for three tins!) this stuff is THICK and WAXY and hard to work with.  Most thick hair products you can thin out by either wetting your hands or by warming it by rubbing in your hands.  Neither approach works with this stuff.  You just have to take a pea sized glob and hope you can spread it out evenly.  Even getting a comb through your hair will be a challenge after you&#x27;ve put this stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting product - you can achieve effects that you could not other wise do, but its not something I&#x27;m going to be using on a daily basis for my 2&amp;#34; long wavy/curly hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tad stinky with a chemical kinda smell, but works well.</li>
    <li> The pomade is a little to hard for my liking. It makes it hard to apply evenly on the hair.</li>
    <li> I love Murray&#x27;s i don&#x27;t use any thing els except for dax veggie oil for my pomp butt i feel like I&#x27;m going bald waiting it to be in my mail box grate price butt id rather pay a dollar more than wait two weeks .keep the pomp strong and the hair greasy ;)</li>
    <li> Does not hold as well as we had hoped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few pomades, but the one still takes the cake in price and value. It works great on Asian male&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just your basic oil based pomade. Murrays has such a high hold. It can be a bit hard to comb through your hair with it. It had a high shine and holds pretty well. I can&#x27;t really complain about this stuff. It&#x27;s dirt cheap. Cheaper in stores actually and pretty basic. I have three tins of this. I use it occasionally. It&#x27;s just a nice pomade to have lying around.</li>
    <li> Rip off...you can buy Murrays at the store for $2.50-$3.00 a can.Also Murrays is usually stocked with jerry-curl and relaxers items.Murrays is VERY thick and greasy.It will stain your pillow.It will stain your cars head rest...and anything else your head touches.Dont expect it to wash out in 2-3 washes.It took me 4 shampoo washes + 3 washes with bar soap + 3 more with dish soap to get it ALMOST out.It works,it holds and its greasy...3 things I love about it,but as far as it making hair fall out...Im not sure.My barber said it can cause hair to fall out,but I used Murrays for 8 1/2 years and mine didnt thin.Also on very hot days,it will become more plyable.If U put too much in...get a hot towel + hot water and comb the excess out.It works and works well...just staining everything got kinda old.&lt;br /&gt; Plus the tin container when washed and clean makes a good ashtray..or to hold nuts n bolts..lol...but true.&lt;br /&gt; Cheers-</li>
    <li> It sticks on hair and doesn&#x27;t wash out easily. Very frustrating. I have to shampoo my hair at least 3 times to get it removed.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way (rub into palms to warm and distribute).  Calms fly-aways and frizz!  Much thicker than I expected; very much a wax.  I thought this would be a problem but it is not.</li>
    <li> Me gusto mucho.. me gusto lo cumplidos que fueron con el envio! un excelente producto!Yo recomiendo que lo ordenen....Les va a gustar mucho realmente son lo que yo como comprador online esperaba.</li>
    <li> The Pomade is OK- if you&#x27;re looking for a shiny, slicked back look, this is the stuff for you. One can will probably last you a while. Very effective at holding all day and gives you that very shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not what I was looking for. I&#x27;m trying to find a less-expensive alternative to American Crew products, and this is definitely not it. It&#x27;s almost impossible to wash out, for starters, and feels much greasier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- fine product, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Hey, it keeps your hair where you want it, and has been around forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, with many pomades, you&#x27;re essentially putting petrolateum in your hair. You can pay $20 or you can pay $3 for basically the same stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that Murray&#x27;s is stiff and applies easily to my hair, keeps it tidy all day, and doesn&#x27;t discolor my pillowcase.</li>
    <li> So cheap...So good. Really you can swim underwater, when you come up, Brad Pitt perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff lasts forever, and really holds firmly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds all day, easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is you have to make sure not to use too much.  Just work it in your hand for a while and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars would buy again, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and like the paste would order from there again ....great price too ...amazing stuff  ..very easy to deal with as I have  the ap on my phone</li>
    <li> Great hold - great value</li>
    <li> My 18-year old has used this product for 3 years now and swears by it. Lasts 24 hours, but easily washes out with no apparent build-up.</li>
    <li> Not only does this stuff work well, it works too well.  It&#x27;s hard to wash out, sticky, and smells bad.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you had no other choices.</li>
    <li> Pros: pleasant smell, GREAT hold that lasts all day, hair becomes very manageable after pomade has been in hair for a while, &amp; price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  applying to hair is a lot like applying a extra-thick honey.  i.e. it does NOT apply easily, does not wash off your hands easily, nor shower out easily.</li>
    <li> Best product for hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three years. For guys who like to spike their hair, this product works great. Apply this before a hair paste (I&#x27;d recommend Gatsby Grunge), and your hair will stay in any position, and still have the dry/not gelled look.</li>
    <li> Murrays is supposed to be greasy dont try to compare it to axe or anything else because this is about simplicity and getting a classic look. If your going for the greaser look or a nice pomade this is for you plus the oils in it replenishes your hair and makes it healthier than ever</li>
    <li> This is the best hair stuff for dudes with thick ass hair like mine. Just a dab will do us and it&#x27;s good all day. It lasts forever too. Just do yourself a favor and buy it already.</li>
    <li> The other reviews of how hard it is to get off are spot on. Mine came off only after a haircut!</li>
    <li> terrible product the packages i received were so stiff and hard i could not remove the jell from the container.  now i have to deal with returning them (3)</li>
    <li> Good stuff. old school, holds well. Style with a hair dryer or else its hard as a rock and you cant move your hair around. works better with dampened hair too.</li>
