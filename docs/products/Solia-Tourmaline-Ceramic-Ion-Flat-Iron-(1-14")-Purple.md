<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this iron. It damages my hair less than others I have used, and my first one lasted for 6 years of daily use. Reliable and high quality product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Had it Over a year now and it still works like brand new.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very pleased with my Solia flat iron. I was skeptical about using a flat iron because I was afraid it would fry my hair being as it gets damanged easily. But that one trip to the mall changed my mind. I got suckered into the Nume booth and allowed the salesman to do a free demo on my hair. As he ironed one section of my hair, I was instantly hooked. After he finished, I realized how much better my hair looked after being flat ironed. So I went shopping around to find one similar to the one in the mall because I honestly didn&#x27;t want to pay $100+ for something that I could find cheaper elsewhere.    I researched the latest reviews on flat irons and Solia was rated one of the top choices.  I bought my flat iron which arrived in 2 days. I was so excited! I tried it out the very next day and while it wasn&#x27;t exactly like the one used in the mall, it was very similar. The ceramic plates don&#x27;t fry my hair. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Best of all, it was sold in my favorite color: purple! It definitely makes getting ready for work or a night out more pleasurable with manageable (and tamed) hair.</li>
    <li> I had the same straightener prior to this one and I loved it! This one has met and exceeded its competition!</li>
    <li> Got this as anniversary gift for my gf who has natural kinky hair (&#x27;4a&#x27;... whatever that means) and it looked like she went to a hair salon. She was pleased and made me an extra happy man. she claims that this is the best flat iron she ever had.</li>
    <li> i thought i wouldn&#x27;t love anything as much as my chi. I was wrong. This is great!</li>
    <li> just didn&#x27;t straighten the hair much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife to replace her Chi. She is very happy with this product and says it is faster to do her hair now, which means less waiting around for me. She loves the temperature control which helps in not over heating her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair does seem to be softer and more shiny with this straightener compared to the chi. Guys if your looking for a gift that your woman will love get her this straightener.</li>
    <li> The Solia is a fantastic hair straightener.  I have had several others, but none compare to this one. This flat iron makes fixing hair easy...not the chore it used to be.  I can actually get to work on time.  I would definitely buy another one if this one ever breaks.</li>
    <li> Turned our counter purple.</li>
    <li> The product worked one week and then no longer worked.  Have not been able to get assistance in getting it replaced.  Do not think I will do this again online with other products.  Returns are too difficult.</li>
    <li> We have three of them in the house. Everyone uses it. It really works well!! Gets rid of frizzy hair very quickly!</li>
    <li> I have owned this straightener for 5 months and today I turned it on, blow dried my hair and started to pick up the straightener and the light wasn&#x27;t blinking like it usually does. That&#x27;s when I noticed that the heating plates were hanging off because the plastic or glue or whatever holds them on had melted. I don&#x27;t even use the highest heat setting!  So I thought I might could let it cool off and possibly be able to glue the plates back on but once it cooled, the plates are stuck in that position.  I owned another well known brand for years before it stopped heating up but it certainly never fell apart! I definitely will not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I finally retired my cheapy, run down flat iron and swapped it with this one. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s a great hair straightener that flattens hair quick and effectively. I love how hot it can get too. The only downside for me is that I can&#x27;t seem to get it to also curl like other flat irons with a bit of a curve on the sides can. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> Best one I have had, seems to do the job faster ands protects my hair better than others I have. I like to keep my hair straight all the time now.</li>
    <li> Love this iron. Great price!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair. I used to have a chi straightening iron but it broke.. I was going to get another chi because I did love it, but I decided to do some research. After a lot of research, I decided to buy this iron. Well, it&#x27;s amazing! It straightens my hair and keeps it straight! I didn&#x27;t even have to touch it up the next day! I highly recommend it, especially for thick hair!</li>
    <li> It warms up quick&lt;br /&gt;Has multiple heat settings and an on-off switch&lt;br /&gt;The construction is durable, robust, and practical. (Albeit it is pretty big, it&#x27;s not as compact as some of the other flat-irons, which was OK for me)&lt;br /&gt;I love the color options</li>
    <li> best flat iron i have better than the other one i have right now !! i been wanting to buy a new one but i wanted a good one so i ended up getting this and now I&#x27;m throwing the old one away and hello new one lol &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The product is really good, better than I expected.  It is easy to use and adjust and works great with short hair.</li>
