    <li> Long- lasting, non-sticky and non-irritating. Does not cause yeast infections and is the best lube I have ever used - and I&#x27;ve tried them all! Try this one - you will like it!</li>
    <li> This is the only lubricant that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate me. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have purchased some other natural/organic lubricants but they were smelly and weird texture.  This product does not have odor and works great.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> we are 60 y/o and need extra lube due to thinning skin and low hormones, and this product works great! it is water soluble and we use it in tandem with a silicone-based product for maximum slipperiness. easy to use, no bad taste, and easy to clean up afterwards. highly recommended. you can also add a few drops of water to surface areas to extend its effectiveness a little longer.</li>
    <li> I used to love this.  It was my go to lube.  The last batch I ordered was different.&lt;br /&gt;During use it was really uncomfortable.  I also noticed that the color was a bit off.&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the manufacturer and I was told that one of the ingredients that they were&lt;br /&gt;using is no longer allowed to be imported.  That ingredient helped give it the&lt;br /&gt;smooth feeling I was used to.  So it&#x27;s definitely not the product it used to be and I&lt;br /&gt;caution you to take care when using it.</li>
    <li> There is no better product of it&#x27;s kind.  Try it.  You will be very glad you did.</li>
    <li> Its okay.  Does not keep you lubricated very long.  I plan on using it, but I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for daily healthy support and times of intimacy. Quality, healthful, non-irritating ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is non-irritating, non-staining, non-scented, gel. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my flora or stain the sheets. It is easy to dispense in the amount you need. It works. I love this gel.</li>
    <li> I found this lube at Whole Foods when I was looking for a natural solution to enhance my pleasure and this product does the job with the help of my husband!  It&#x27;s smooth, has enough slipperiness to it and does not dry out during use. There is no odor or taste, but I would not recommended using it before oral pleasuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lube is hard to find in stores and my Whole Foods no longer carries this lube, so I would recommended stocking up and buying it here, as the price is competitive. (trust me, I&#x27;ve searched high and low for this lube after my initial purchase from Whole Foods because its just that good! )</li>
    <li> This is the best Vaginal lubricant I ever tried. It immediately relieves the dryness, burning sensation. Very great during intercourse. I love it.</li>
    <li> There are so many lubes out there but this one (out of the 6 I tried in the past few years) really does outstanding work. Doesn&#x27;t stick, no smell and provides very good lubrication.</li>
    <li> Not sticky and nice lasting.  I did not have to think about it again  A nice shaped bottle slips easily into the nightstand drawer.  Arrived quickly in sealed packaging.</li>
    <li> I started using this several years ago and love it.  It is the ONLY lubricant I&#x27;ve used since I first tried it.  I have tried several others over the years and this is the best of the best and is natural.  It does not irritate me whatsoever.  I highly recommend it.  I do wish it came in larger  bottles (or multiple packs) and maybe also a smaller travel size, too...</li>
    <li> I admit I was hesitant about this product. Recommended by a male friend of mine whom I trust I haven&#x27;t regreted the purchse. Having gone through menopause this gives me the lubrication I need when I need it plus it is good for me. A little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> A++++++++ this is the greatest stuff</li>
    <li> All natural, all the ingredients work well to provide a sound product that is the wife&#x27;s favorite of all gels, by far.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best lube available</li>
    <li> We have tried many other similar products, both natural and more conventional, this one is absolutely without a doubt the very best.  We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do: makes surfaces slippery without tackiness or noxious aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Nice.</li>
