      <li>I don&#x27;t know what product it is people are giving good reviews on, but it can&#x27;t be this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t shine or smell good</li>

      <li>As a brand they liked, this has been a great investment for my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves an beautiful shine to my highly color damaged hair and leaves a wonderful smell as well.</li>

      <li>My hair has never looked this shiny and healthy!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>My stylist suggested I use a glaze to protect my color, and this worked well, is easy to apply and gives great shine.</li>
      <li>I would say that unless you truly have damaged hair the in-shower treatment should be fine and works great for me.</li>
      <li>Smells so amazing.</li>
      <li>and this products works great to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>Amazing results.</li>
      <li>it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like the warm tones</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the deal: this KIND OF works.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice shine for 1-2 washes, then dissipates.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice.  </li>
      <li>This product provides a nice shine and even leaves her hair softer.</li>
      <li>Kind of a pain for the time you are supposed to leave it on every time.  </li>
      <li>and it does add a nice lighter-colored shine.</li>
      <li>Nice smell.</li>
      <li>To be honest my hair is curly</li>
      <li>Seems to add a nice shine to my hair but also may strip a bit of color if you color your hair to hide the gray.</li>
      <li>Some kind of stay-put gloss.</li>
      <li>But I find the once a week method gives me superior results and I like the way it looks even better than the salon treatment.  </li>
      <li>Really nice product, does as it says, but with medium length hair you need to apply quite a bit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This doesnt work as nicely as I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>This is very nice and shiny on my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Very soft, I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair soft and shiny, very happy!</li>
      <li>Great for fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
      <li>It gives it a nice shine and makes it look healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair when i used this</li>
    <li> After reading lots of good reviews, I was convinced I would finally have the shiny, silky hair I&#x27;d been hoping for.  Well, after trying the product numerous times, following instructions for both pre- and post-shampoo, I&#x27;m still waiting, dammit!  I see no difference whatsoever in my wavy, rather coarse and dry hair.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
    <li> i have long, fairly thin, blonde hair that easily becomes frizzy or curly. i put this on for 3 minutes on wet hair as recommended, and when my hair dried it was visibly shiner, much much softer, and silky smooth. it also did look brighter and not at all brassy.     i highly recommend this product, it makes your hair look lovely, and does everything it promises.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a year and it gives my medium-thick hair a noticible, lively shine.  I&#x27;ve only used it in the shower, generally followed by a blowdry and flat iron.  Here&#x27;s what experience has taught me:  1) Squeeze out as much water from your hair as possible before application 2) Use sparingly and stay at least 2\\&quot; away from the roots.  My hair is past my shoulder blades and I use no more than the size of a dime.  It&#x27;s easier to stay away from the roots if I part my hair with a wide-tooth comb first but that&#x27;s optional. 3) Leave it on AT LEAST 3\\&quot; per the directions, then rinse well.    As long as you stay away from the roots and use the product sparingly, you&#x27;ll have great results.  My hair is greasier the next day than it would be if I didn&#x27;t use the glaze, but not by much (My hair always looks greasy if I haven&#x27;t washed it).  I do not recommend the brown glaze - it made my hair feel dirty and I didn&#x27;t like how it immediately stained my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times, and like one reviewer said there isn&#x27;t much to it.     The product doesn&#x27;t spread in my hair well, I really have to work it in.  I leave it in my hair for quite a while before I shower - about 30 min. to an hour. When I wash it out, I do notice a slight difference. It&#x27;s a bit shinier, but not very noticeable.   At least it smells nice, I guess. And I didn&#x27;t have any problems with any sort of stains.</li>
    <li> Smells great, love this product!</li>
    <li> First, I am an honest reviewer. I purchased this item from my local K-mart about two weeks ago. I have Middle back length, soft, silky, relaxed hair....(well prior to using this product I did). I followed the instructions to a T, where I used it on unwashed, dry hair for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes passed, my hair FELT so DRY! I went ahead and washed my hair, deep conditioned, and rollerset my hair. sigh...After I rollerset my hair, my hair felt so STRIPPED, and it was so frizzy!! I even noticed breakage! I can CONFIDENTLY say that this product has attributed to the negative results in my hair because I have been using my same shampoo, deep conditioner, and foam lotion for the past several months now, and they produce nothing but desirable results. I also did not see any difference in terms of shine either. I don&#x27;t know what product it is people are giving good reviews on, but it can&#x27;t be this. In fact, after I felt how hard my hair FELT, I immediately threw the bottle away. For those who received desirable results, kudos to you. I will NOT be using this product ever again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all to make hair shine and I have exceptionally good quality hair!  Nope, don&#x27;t buy this!!  Try the recharge by Vidal Sassoon instead, much better result.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair. I went blonde. It was dumb. I only lasted two weeks before I bought some red and dark brown dyes and fixed my costly experiment. The problem was that, although I had my normal color back, my hair still felt horribly dry and had zero shine to it. I used this as directed along with a pretty intensely moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and it made a huge difference in the texture and shine of my hair. Absolutely recommend it. I use it every time I shampoo (which is only once a week) and will do until my non-damaged hair grows out.</li>
    <li> I use this maybe once a week after I shampoo my hair; I try to leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it out.  It makes my hair really soft and shiny once I dry it.  The only down-side is that it also makes my hair rather greasy by the end of the day, so I don&#x27;t use it super frequently.  Overall, good stuff.</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I was going to try to grow out my hair and was getting tired of it not looking good. I was going to cut it when I ordered this product and with 1 use I love my hair! I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally bother reviewing stuff, but this stuff was so awful that I had to. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways - using on wet hair and on dry. When used on wet hair it did nothing, so I tried it the dry method. Firstly - my hair is naturally brown but I&#x27;ve bleached and highlighted myself to blonde. Needless to say, it&#x27;s taken a beating - and is now on the dry and brittle side. But I&#x27;ve been treating it kindly the past few months and it was starting to recover. While it got much softer and more manageable over time, it wasn&#x27;t very shiny anymore so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I wish I could say it was merely disappointing. I used it on dry, unwashed hair, left it on for about 15-20 minutes, then rinsed out thoroughly. Then I went to blow dry it, with a round brush, as usual. I couldn&#x27;t get the brush through. I sectioned it into smaller sections and tried again - my brush would not slide through. It made a squeak as I pulled harder but I realized that if I pulled any harder it would just break the hair. I&#x27;ve NEVER had this problem before. If anything, my hair is usually too slippery and I have trouble getting good tension while drying. So, I gave up the round brush and used a regular paddle brush, which should have been easier, but it also wouldn&#x27;t slide through. Eventually I gave up and just finger combed gently while drying (had trouble running my fingers through as well). Once it was mostly dry, I tried the round brush again and had limited success. Then, I used my normal heat protectant and ironed the top sections to get it smooth. I&#x27;ll say this - my hair feels awful and is definitely not shiny. It feels significantly drier and more brittle, I still can&#x27;t run my damn fingers through it and it just looks like a limp, stiff, strawlike mess. I&#x27;m pretty sure it looks worse than it did the time that I bleached it twice in one day. I really hope that as I wash it in the coming weeks the glaze will just wash out and my hair will not be permanently screwed up, but honestly, I&#x27;m just so disappointed and annoyed. I know it&#x27;s just hair, but what a load of false advertising!</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE COARSE SUN DRIED HAIR LIKE I DO THIS IS A LIFESAVER!!! ADDS SHINE AND MANAGABILITY AND SO EASY TO USE.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal: this KIND OF works.  But don&#x27;t buy it.  Head to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and buy semi-permanent glaze there.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t work that well.  Sometimes your hair looks a little bit shinier, but not by much.  Sally&#x27;s stuff is easy to use, lasts longer, and makes your hair 10x shinier!</li>
    <li> I tried this product 3 times (the brown shade) and hated it from the beginning. It does not spread throughout the hair at all, so it&#x27;s impossible to fully cover all the hair. I noticed absolutely NO shine or any change in my hair. What I DID notice was a dirty stain on my shower floor which the John Frieda company has admitted that the product caused. Their suggestion to me? Clean it with bleach or if that doesn&#x27;t work, hire someone to remove the stain. Oh, and they offered a free coupon for another product of my choice. What a thrill.... Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk staining your shower.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Glaze doesn&#x27;t have any alluring scent but the basis of the product promises shine and it delivers. I first tried the clear color glaze and liked the result. Now I&#x27;m using the blonde glaze just for kicks on my chestnut hair and it does add a nice lighter-colored shine. I recommend this for anyone looking to improve the softness and shine of their hair.</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t tell a difference after using this product. the only positive thing i can say is that it didn&#x27;t color my hands or shower curtain like the brow glaze did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a weekly treatment (leaving it on dry hair for at least  20 minutes and then shampooing). My theory was that  this will coat each strand of my hair increasing it&#x27;s diameter and therefore adding volume. I really do feel that it has added some volume and I intend on keeping this as part of my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Sadly i saw no difference in my hair. But on the negative side, after using it for few days i noticed it started to build up on my hair and made it look like i didnt wash it at all. I had to go get a special shampoo to get rid of this greasy look. Extra expense. Yeah, its going to the garbage!</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff makes my hair feel.  Super soft and shiny.  A must for every other wash use.  The scent is a bit strong but I&#x27;m picky on scents.  Not strong enough to keep me from using the product though.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair that is usually pretty healthy looking. However, after using this product as a pre-treatment (left it on for 20 min.), I instantly noticed negative results. It has been four days since I used it and my hair is still dry, brittle and coarse. For me, it did the complete opposite of what it was supposed to do! I am just hoping that my hair will so return to normal. I am very disappointed as I normally like John frieda haircare products!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying glaze. I have strawberry blond curly hair and this really makes my hair glow! It&#x27;s not conditioner, you use it after you condition.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel like I just came home from the salon. I put it on dry hair and then showered after a half hour. It didnt seem much different while it was still wet, but once it dried it was shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have curly dark brown hair, that tends to become frizzy.  I was hoping this product would help with the frizz.  It did nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> This is just a really great product. I have very thick and curly hair, so I leave this in my hair for 20 minutes when I shower, and this tames my hair. In addition to that this makes your hair smell great. The best part of this is that you are styling your hair, before you even come out of the shower, so it saves you plenty of time. Really great for all hair types, but if you have thick, curly hair like me, this would be great for you!</li>
    <li> when I had heavily highlighted hair, this used to do wonders. Now that it is ombre with natural color 2/3rds down, it suddently does nothing to my natural hair! No shine, no smoothness, no nothing. I used to do the 20 minute treatment once a week, did one today after a very long break and nada, nothing, zero. Maybe I need a new bottle.  That being said, this is the only \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; glaze that will not lighten your hair. Avoid Clairol brand glaze, not even sure if they still make it or not, but I&#x27;ve done it once and it lightened my hair.</li>
    <li> This took the life out of my fine hair.  It made it straighter as well, which I don&#x27;t like.  Lasted 2 or 3 shampoos.  If you have course hair or straighten your hair this might do the trick for you.  However, you can get the same result from a heavy shampoo for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> It smells absolutely fantastic and works far better than expected.  It sort of &#x27;locks in&#x27; the fullness from the JF Luxurious Volume Shampoo &amp; Conditioner while adding incredible gloss. And to think I almost didn&#x27;t buy this based on the mixed reviews...it&#x27;s now an integral part of my regular hair care routine.</li>
    <li> this surprisingly works pretty good. But the shine only last until the next washing. if you use it the day you want extra shiny hair looks great. I think using it on dry jair and letting it sit for 20-30 minutes before you wash your hair is the best option,. seeems to &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; in better that way.</li>
    <li> I got this and expected more. It is very mild on my hair. Yet stains your skin fast and bad. My husband likes it to help with his gray hairs, but I don&#x27;t have any and my hair is rather dark brown. Maybe a lighter brown would notice more then I do. I have also noticed it makes my hair a bit oilier then before so I have stopped using it daily. About every other day is good and it still keeps the shine up some. I use this product with the shampoo, conditioner, and shine shock to get the best result. I really think without all the items, none work all that fantastic alone. Together is about four and a half stars. Plan on highlights for summer and this may make things pop more.</li>
    <li> Far more expensive than other sources, nothing else on market is packaged exactly like it - similar but not the same... Something is not right</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products that I have EVER used.  My hair is crazy shiny after using &amp; feels incredibly soft and manageable.  This is one hair care item that I will definitely keep around forever.  Hope that they never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;Side note - I use it as an after conditioner treatment.  I shampoo and condition like normal, then put a very generous amount on my hair.  I start at my scalp and them pull down to the ends of my hair, concentrating the majority of the treatment at the ends and away from my scalp.  I leave on for 2-5 minutes, rinse completely &amp; then style as normal.</li>
    <li> This product was excellent in adding shine to my hair. I used it per the directions on the bottle and that was simple enough. When I finished my usual routine, my hair was softer, shinier and had more body.</li>
    <li> For those of us who already deal with frizz and coarse hair, this product is not worth it due to the long term damage to hair from use and the short results of the product. I have coarse thick wavy hair that is pretty tough to tame. Naturally I try everything at least once. I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect product for my type of hair, I haven&#x27;t found it yet but Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Out is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far.  Although I&#x27;m about ready to just go for a Keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> This glaze makes my hair look fresh and shiny.  I live in a humid climate and have a little bit of curl to my hair.  This glaze keeps it smooth and shiny without weighting it down.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The best way to put shine back in your hair without salon color.  The first thing someone notices about a woman is her hair.  It shows care and youth.  The shine takes even less time than the instructions say, you can even mix it with conditioner if time is a problem - it&#x27;s better than conditioner with shine and it&#x27;s hard to find, but worth looking.</li>
    <li> Again I feel like I tried to go by the amount of stars people were giving this product...does nothing. Another waste of money type of product.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Leaves my hair clean feeling and shiny.  Tames my frizz.  and no wierd perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The effect is cumulative and after the 3rd use, I found my hair was lank and felt heavy from product.  the shine doesnt really last more than a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesnt work as nicely as I thought it would.  But it does help with the frizzies.  So maybe only use it once every 2 weeks...</li>
    <li> I was expecting what the name indicates: true shine. Some kind of stay-put gloss. Instead, this is a rinse-out &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; you put on BEFORE shampooing... and it gives a ugly texture to the hair when wet. I didn&#x27;t notice any special shine or softness, nothing that my regular conditioner doesn&#x27;t provide already... and less than the Moroccan Oil I occasionally use. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have only used this about 4 times in the shower. I swear it makes my dry ends look 100x better. I don&#x27;t use it daily because I have long hair. I&#x27;d be using a bottle every 4 days! But I do use it when I want my hair to look extra silky smooth. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Depends on your length as well as texture of hair. If u have long hair that is medium/thick and expect the result advertised, you will be disappointed. This bottle lasted 5 washes. You have to squeeze out ALOT (!!) to coat entire hair before you feel it get smooth. NO shine, but smooth. It says the shine will happen over time...so if you are willing you can keep having this sent to your home, at least 2 or 3 months worth to get the effect. I think it&#x27;s really too much that have to be squeezed out each time..but if you don&#x27;t you won&#x27;t feel any difference in hair texture/look.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference. I am not sure why there are such great reviews. I found this by doing a google search &amp;#34;how to get shiny hair&amp;#34; and found this. hmmm... did not find it improved nor damaged my hair. I am glad I did not spend a lot of money on it. Maybe there is a reason it is not in the store anymore!</li>
    <li> I used to go to a salon once a month to have my hair glazed.  I am going gray pretty rapidly (I&#x27;m 52) and love the way my new hair looks.  I&#x27;m growing it long.  It&#x27;s not salt and pepper, but rather salt and sand (medium honey blonde naturally).  I use Phyto Phytargent shampoo once a week (intensely blue/violet) and I mix John Frieda Volumizing and Sheer Blonde shampoos and conditioners for daily use.  It is past my shoulders and the ends are still honey-colored but can appear brassy against the lighter grays up top.  The blue shampoo helps, but the glazing did wonders.  It makes an intense shine that does not add any color to your hair.  The way the shine reflects light, my white/grays are glowing and the honey ends are softened, making the blend beautiful.  And it does not contribute to \\&quot;build up\\&quot; on hair. But I was paying $35 a month to have my hair glazed and I found it needed to be done every 1-2 weeks.  I found this product and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two ways to use it.  First, shampoo and condition as usual.  Then add enough of this to wet hair to cover (I use a quarter-sized puddle) and apply through hair.  I leave it on a couple of minutes then rinse.  That is for daily use.  I REALLY LIKE using the product this way.  BUT I LOVE the results from using it the second way.  Once a week, on dry hair, apply enough glaze to completely saturate the hair (I get five uses from one bottle doing it this way).  Gently comb through. Allow to stay on your hair 20 minutes.  Rinse it out, shampoo and condition as usual.  You can choose which of the two methods like best, you can&#x27;t go wrong either way.  But I find the once a week method gives me superior results and I like the way it looks even better than the salon treatment.  It does not cause yellowing or dullness, just intense shine that will fade very gradually.  I can technically stretch the treatment to once every two weeks if needed.  This is for any color hair, but I love the way it works onmy unintentional \\&quot;ombre\\&quot; hair.</li>
    <li> Great for the price! My mom loves this product. She has grey hair and does not like to color her hair. This product provides a nice shine and even leaves her hair softer. She has been using it for over a year and it does not cause any undue buildup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and have used this product for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago my stylist wanted to use Sebastian&#x27;s on me, but never got the chance.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something comparable but less expensive. I switched from Jazzing clear  to this John Frieda product.&lt;br /&gt;You get more for your money, I think. I think it help retain moisture so I don&#x27;t frizz or revert as fast in-between washes.</li>
    <li> I honestly never review beauty products. Mainly because the whole &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; thing has never applied to me. It&#x27;s all a big scam, in my opinion. Is this a miracle product? Maybe not, but it comes pretty damn close. I can tell a distinct difference in my hair when I use this. I wash my hair maybe 3 times a week and use this in the shower after I shampoo and condition. My hair is shinier, softer, and feels healthier. I know it&#x27;s just a temporary fix, but I think in the long term it will help my hair be healthier because it will tangle and break less. Just a theory, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it either way because it makes my hair look better.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Sorry but this product did not change the shine of my hair!</li>
    <li> Works well but chemicals used so its damaging to your hair</li>
    <li> Background: I have long, thick, silky hair that has lost a bit of luster after I went ombre last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed both sets of instructions exactly - wet on Saturday, and dry on Monday. Absolutely no difference whatsoever. Complete waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my hair.   Gets my kinky curly hair smooth and shiny and keeps it that way until the next shampoo.  So happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Ohmygosh! I have had such horrible dry hair that frizzes and has just been so hard to deal with forever! MY aunt gave me this stuff because she said it would help, but that was a few weeks ago and I only just used it last night. I wish I had used it three weeks ago! After just ONE FREAKING USE my hair was extremely soft, shiny, and had NO knots all day! I highly recommend this product, it works MIRACLES!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product. I am 37, with brown and some grey hair, medium-length. I wanted something to make my hair shiny. This product&#x27;s effects were noticeable after the first use. Very soft, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I have only done the 3-min leave-in wet treatment - you can also do a 20 min dry hair (once a week option). The product does have a perfumey smell - but I like it, and I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to strong odors. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Never knew what Hair Glaze was  until I came across reviews on Amazon. I really Love this Glaze the first time I used it I saw immediate results SHINE! Anyway there are two ways to use this one is on dry hair and one is Shampoo and Condition hair while in shower run glaze through hair cover hair evenly from Root to tip leave on 3 minutes or loner than rise and style I personally prefer the weekly treatment with dry,unwashed hair same thing apply from root to tip leave on 20 minutes than shampoo and condition I wear a shower cap when I do the once a week treatment kick back and read a book.I am amazed how much shine I had and no Frizz and super smooth hair .This bottle goes pretty fast when doing this with dry hair but I see better results however everyones hair is different.This is Ammonia,Dye and peroxide Free and will not change the color of your hair I was afraid of that my first use but that wasn&#x27;t the case.I am placing another order and hope Amazon always has this because I cant find this product any where.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I get constant compliments on how shiny and soft my hair is.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy like other products can.</li>
    <li> Love this glaze- John Frieda products are great for my color treated hair!</li>
    <li> Exceptional value!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I cannot understand how anyone gave this product a four star review. I followed directions as written and my hair was not anymore shiny than it was before use. Not only that, it stayed in my hair no matter how long I rinsed. It felt like I had some nasty product in it.</li>
    <li> My stylist suggested I use a glaze to protect my color, and this worked well, is easy to apply and gives great shine.</li>
    <li> Amazing results. I did a weekly treatment and hair look really shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice any difference as far as shine, however as far as FRIZZ and STATIC i noticed a TON of that. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I tried the tinted glazes in the past and have found them to be very messy.  This one is clear so it matches any hair color and makes no mess.  You can even use it in the shower so it&#x27;s really convenient.  People always ask how I get my hair so shiny.  Definitely will continue to use forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a week and have noticed that my hair is a little smoother and touchable when I blow dry it. No product is a miracle worker but this is great for a boost in texture and shine!</li>
    <li> I have used it once on dry hair, and I applied it as a hair color.&lt;br /&gt;the result is not as good as the glase my hair colorist uses.  but again, I did not pay as much.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. It is fine but nothing exceptional. I think my hair is too dried out to make a major difference.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product on YouTube so I decided to try it but I could only find it on Amazon.com. It worked exactly as described in the video. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very soft and shiny. I really like this. It seems to be helping with my dry ends.</li>
    <li> I love the John Frieda Liquid Shine Clear Hair Glaze. I am not sure if it penetrates your hair and actually makes it healthier or is more like a shine coat (which I think it&#x27;s what it does). I probably wouldn&#x27;t say this product is for people with extremely damaged hair but if you are looking to give some shine and healthy look to your hair (without expecting it to reconstruct your damaged hair) then I would definitely buy this product. I put it on my dry hair 15 minutes before washing it instead of doing it on wet hair. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> a great product at an inexpensive price.  it leaves my hair silky and shiny and helps keep the color looking good.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  It stripped the color out of my hair and made it feel like straw.  This product even removed my nail polish from my nails as I was using it.  I am still using deep conditioning treatments a month after using this to try to bring my healthy hair back.  And there was no shine at all from using this product.  Feeling like John Frieda should be paying me for using their product that ruined my hair.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product several years ago and used it off &amp; on. Mostly off. Just didn&#x27;t bother. I needed some life to my silver hair and started using it again and loved it, but I was almost down to nothing. I started looking in drugstores, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and was surprised at how expensive it had gotten. (Over $10 at CVS). I looked on Amazon and it was listed at $7.99 as an &#x27;add-on&#x27; product with a $25 Prime order. Perfect for me.  I love this product, love the way it makes my hair feel after it is rinsed out...almost stronger, and it does add shine to my silver hair</li>
    <li> love this product for keeping my highlighted hair shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, so I was worried this would make it look greasy and heavy BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T. My hair is soft and shiny without the weight of regular hair oils</li>
    <li> My hair is so shiny and soft after just one use (followed instructions for weekly application). This just became a new staple for me!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shine for 1-2 washes, then dissipates. This is great for a special event, but don&#x27;t expect it to last an entire vacation.  I received lots of compliments on day 1 though!</li>
    <li> Keeps my grey hair from dulling.</li>
    <li> Meh. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in the appearance or sheen of my hair. It wasn&#x27;t but, just not impressive.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shine.  Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My hair is turning gray and it really makes my hair look shiny and healthy!  love it!</li>
    <li> EDITED 8/31/2013:  AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT A NUMBER OF TIMES, I DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE ANY SHINE OR GLOSS FROM IT.  MY HAIR LOOKED THE SAME SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED.  I ALSO HOPED IT MAY HELP SEAL MY COLOR BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product once, and my hair is very silky and manageable.  I always let my hair air dry and it is usually on the fluffy side and knots easily.  I went to sleep with a wet head after using this and my hair was silky straight, smooth and untangled in the morning.  It looks very healthy and rich, and feels so silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to continued use as the shine is supposed to increase over time.  I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s the case.</li>
    <li> Looking to make my gray hair glossy, so I tried this product out today.  I used the method of applying to dry hair and leaving on for 20 minutes.  After rinsing, shampooing and drying my hair ... hair looked pretty good.  It was a bit more glossy, and this product did not make my hair limp or weighted down ... like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried (I have very fine straight hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ... the perfumed smell of my hair was overpowering!  It smelled like I had dumped an entire bottle of perfume on my hair.  Jumped back in the shower and shampooed twice more using a clarifying shampoo, and my hair still has a strong perfume smell.  At this point I&#x27;m hoping a 4th shampoo will get rid of it.  Won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair is super thin and frizzy and in really bad shape.  Hardly anything makes it look good.  Except this clear gloss.  It gives it a nice shine and makes it look healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have frizzy or damaged-looking hair or broken hairs that you want to tame down, try this glaze.  Strangely enough, I don&#x27;t feel like it weighs it down that much, even though it does weigh the fly-aways down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on wet hair and don&#x27;t do anything special (like section my hair off or anything like one reviewer suggests), but I have thin hair, so I probably don&#x27;t need to.  I have yet to try it on dry hair, but I plan to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thin hair tangles easily, and it does seem to tangle more right after using this product compared to just conditioner, but it&#x27;s completely worth a little extra work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have thin, frizzy, damaged-looking hair and blow dry it at least once in a while, try http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AE07GX0/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00AE07GX0&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;dragonundergl-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;NSFNFYUHAGXTJLEI&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Nexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray, 7.5 Ounce&lt;/a&gt;, which makes blow-dried hair much smoother and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best two products I&#x27;ve found for my crazy hair.</li>
    <li> I do daily battle with my hair, and I usually win. But I win at a cost. The harsh dye I use to cover my stubborn grays (L&#x27;Oreal Feria), and the twice-weekly blowouts and daily flat-ironing required to manhandle my frizzy, cowlicky strands into something resembling a modern style leaves my hair dry and, when left to its own devices, even frizzier than it otherwise would be. Until I found this miraculous white fluid, I had more bad hair days than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS: Smooths and shines, eliminates frizz and keeps thick, cowlicky hair from looking like an unruly mane. With careful application, gives consistent results. In short, this stuff does what it says it will, which is an extremely rare feature among hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS: Very intense perfume smell (probably camouflaging an equally intense but less pleasant chemical smell). Relatively high cost (I get about 6-8 uses out of one $10 bottle). Needs to be applied carefully (almost expertly) for best results. Effects are temporary, lasting only until the next wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE FOR USE:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the bottle give two methods of use: one for wet hair and one for dry. I believe anyone who actually needs the product would be wasting it by using it on wet hair (which amounts to diluting it). I recommend using it on dry hair only, and not only that, but my results are by far the best when I section off my hair and apply the product to one section, comb it through, and then move on to the next section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the directions recommend leaving the product on dry hair for 20 minutes. But I have found that, for me, 20 minutes is too long. My hair reaches a point where the improvement process actually seems to reverse if I leave the product on longer than about 10 minutes. Once, I left it on overnight and saw no effect whatsoever. So, as to the amount of time to leave it in the hair, I expect everyone is a bit different, and it might require some experimentation to get that right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL IMPRESSIONS:&lt;br /&gt;At $10 plus tax for 6-8 uses, this stuff is expensive. But frankly, it&#x27;s a better investment in my hair than what I&#x27;ve paid my last half-dozen stylists, and it works better than anything from Aveda at three times the price. An added benefit I see with this product is that my hair stays shiny, clean-looking, and manageable for longer, which means I can put off washing for an extra day when I need to. Before I found John Frieda Color Glaze, the only way I knew of to not look like Reba McEntire circa 1987 without also taking all the body out of my hair was to sleep on it! I&#x27;m now happy to report that I can actually leave the house with my hair freshly coiffed and with no nap required. This stuff is life-changing.s tax for 6-8 uses, this stuff is expensive.

    <li> i haven&#x27;t even dared to try it yet: the fragrance is soooo strong/sweet that it leached through the plastic bottle and made the box smell like a fashion magazine. the fine print suggests that one wash their hands thoroughly after use (meanwhile it&#x27;s soaking into your skull) and to immediately clean off of household surfaces (again, while it&#x27;s permeating the skin holding your brain). as much as i want softer hair, i am just not comfortable trying this product.</li>
    <li> I love the sleek shine this product give my dyed blonde hair. I read many complaints, mostly from brunettes, so I believe this is an excellent product for dry, straw-like blonde hair. My hair is shiny shiny shiny!!!!</li>
    <li> I use the clear glaze the first time and I also found it to a bit greasy and wasn&#x27;t as shiny so I did this. Use a light weight conditioner before using it and don&#x27;t put it on the roots rinse the glaze out after like 10 min don&#x27;t use it every day then when you go to style it put a serum in it to help with shine I did that and had wonderful results if u have dry hair like gets staticy then I don&#x27;t recommend u use it</li>
    <li> Love this product so far. I will continue to use it I can tell right after I use it that my hair looks healthier and shinier.</li>
    <li> I can see some difference, though I expected to see more shine. I use almost daily. I will try daily and see if that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have colored treated blonde hair and the hair glaze does get rid of the dullness. The glaze also acts as as a styling tool when I blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I did the 20 minute weekly treatment. Applied to dry hair, no styling products and freshly cleaned, allowed to sit for 20 minutes then washed it out. The product is very heavily perfumed, it actually gave me a terrible headache &amp; the smell didn&#x27;t go away after washing. I really can&#x27;t tell that my hair is any shinier but it does seem more voluminous.</li>
    <li> Very heavy on the hair, it really builds up on my strands. I did like the shine, but not worth the it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I may have reviewed this in the past, not sure but I just wanted to make SURE I added my two cents. :)&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big fan of salons and have learned to relax, condition and even cut my own ends. I&#x27;m Spanish with &amp;#34;mixed har..&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an inexpensive life savor. EVERY single time I use it I know what the result will be. Bouncy, shiny and soft hair. I have gone through some expensive conditioners that do not give me the affect that clear liquid glaze does.&lt;br /&gt;I always apply it on dry hair. Sometimes I&#x27;ll leave it on all day, run errands and sometimes I apply it and do gardening letting it sit. I then lightly shampoo, condition and put rollers on.&lt;br /&gt;BAM.. bouncy and fabulous. I love the bouncy look not the stick straight look. Channeling my inner farrah facet. :) Some commented on the smell.. I really don&#x27;t mind it. If they sold a ginormous bottle of this stuff I would buy it. When I want clear shine, I use this.. when I want color shine..I use Sebastian cellphane. There is a $20 difference.. yet this product works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps everyone&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised. Easy to use, smells great and excellent results. Did not alter the color of my color-treated hair (salon services - highlight, low light and a base).</li>
    <li> Really nice product, does as it says, but with medium length hair you need to apply quite a bit. I will probably get 2-3 uses from the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for year.  I use it in the shower after my shampoo.  I work it through my hair , let it set and rinse.  Then I finish with a light conditioner.  My hair is healthy and shiny.  I have straight fine hair.  The price was great  and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to work so far.. I have regular straight, healthy hair but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this (the CLEAR one) yesterday as it was on sale at my local W drugstore, and they didn&#x27;t have clear haircolor (which is what I was looking for initially). I have somewhat damaged hair (thanks to dyes) which is naturally curly/wavy so is prone to flyaways and a tad lackluster. I tried it on with the dry hair method, left it on for about 30mn then rinsed, shampooed and conditionned my hair as usual. I have to say, to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in shine or manageability of my hair, I&#x27;m even tempted to say it was worse than without... The hair cuticles weren&#x27;t smoothed out at all... :-/ And, as other reviewers mentioned, it has a very strong smell that reminded me of shoe varnish... I returned it to the store today. I will stick with my natural method instead, which brings shine and is healthy for your hair: coconut oil! Warm a little organic coconut oil in the microwave (to make it warm, not super hot!), saturate your hair with it, leave it on for 30 mn or more. Then rinse, shampoo, and condition. You might not see much of a difference aside from instant shine (which won&#x27;t last after the following shampoo), for example it won&#x27;t make your hair easier to detangle, but over time the oil strengthens your hair and makes it more resistant to chemicals, flat irons and other aggressions...</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;glaze&amp;#34; stripped the oils off my hair, and leave it completely dry and brittle.  I tried it several times following the package directions, with the exact same results.  Highly disappointing experience.</li>
    <li> It smells pretty weird the smell in your hair stays for days.. Not very pleasant I still have it, I’ve only tried it once because of that reason. Hope my review helps to determine your purchase</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought it... first time, I didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair. Second time, I bought it after reading some rave reviews saying it was a HG product. Anyway, same thing... I don&#x27;t notice a change in my hair. But, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair... so I guess I won&#x27;t rate it poorly. I much prefer clear demi permanant dye for amazing lasting shine. But I am wearing extensions, so wanted to try something else while I had them in. Drat.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that it did anything for my hair color (I read that it would make your natural color &#x27;pop&#x27;) but I can say that wow, has it conditioned my hair! I have been using this daily for three weeks, and my hair is softer and even looks thicker than ever before. It just feels great!</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair that tangles easily. My hair always tangles underneath at the back of my neck and takes lots of patience to comb out after being washed. I&#x27;ve found a few products that help and this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair tangles when I wear scarves, if I&#x27;m in any wind, or if I wear textured clothing (think sweaters or fleece). I suppose it tangles if I think about too much or shake my head &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on wet hair in the shower--mostly on the underneath part and a second smaller application over the rest where I&#x27;d like shine or where it likes to tangle. I leave it on 5 minutes and rinse. I do that every other time I shampoo. It takes a few times of daily use to build up to proper behavior-- or you could try the 20 minute treatment route and then try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel heavier but smooth and nice. I don&#x27;t put it at the crown or scalp so I can&#x27;t speak to other people&#x27;s issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this at times but sometimes I get tired of taking an extra 5 minutes all of the time and then I use It&#x27;s a 10 spray after I&#x27;ve gotten out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is blond, highlighted, layered but down to my waist.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything to my hair. Left it feeling dirty.</li>
    <li> I praise this product. When I know rain is coming and I want to avoid a bad hair day, I use this product and all is well. On non rain days I have beautiful, shiny and great smelling hair. I will preface that my hair is already coarse and healthy so this just boosts what I already have.</li>
    <li> umm that&#x27;s the average product ,I can&#x27;t see any change in my hair I don&#x27;t known maybe works for other people.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS  IRIDESCENT BLING BLING  SHINE ! GREAT FOR ALL HAIR COLORS AND TEXTURES ,&lt;br /&gt;PERMS, NATURAL, STRAIGHT, WAVY, KINKY  , GREAT TO USE AS A TREATMENT AFTER BLEACHING YOUR HAIR !&lt;br /&gt;HELPS TO RESTORE LUSTER TO HAIR COLOR ,&lt;br /&gt; IT&#x27;S A WAKE IT UP TYPE OF TREATMENT WHEN YOUR HAIR COLOR BEGINS TO&lt;br /&gt; FADE OR LOOKS DULL, DRY AND LIFELESS !  CAN BE USED AT HOME AND AS MANY TIMES AS NEEDED,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;THE HAIR TREATMENT WITH NO LIMITS&amp;quot;!!!</li>
    <li> hated it. did absolutely nothing for my hair. waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now, and really love the extra shine it brings to my healthy brunette hair. The very first time I used it my husband commented on how shiny my hair was and asked if I had done something to it. It made me realize this was a great product-my husband never notices my hair!I use it 2-3 times a week. It doesn&#x27;t damage hair at all; in fact, I think it acts as a protector. It especially helps on humid days because my hair is fine and has flyaways. This product helps keep all that at bay. My hair is smoother and much, much shinier when I use this. I&#x27;ve started using it in my little girl&#x27;s hair, too, and have notice how silky and soft it makes it. The only drawback is it does seem to make my hair take longer to dry. Great product!</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot.  My hair seems to last longer between washes for some reason.  Smells a bit chemically when first put it on but fades after dry.</li>
    <li> Completely regret this purchase. I bought it because I thought it would be like the glaze that comes with the hair dye kits which makes my hair smooth and shines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glaze, however, makes your hair completely greasy. I&#x27;ve tried this twice and both times I&#x27;ve had to wash my hair again with a deep clean shampoo because I didn&#x27;t want to go out with hair looking as if it hadn&#x27;t been cleaned in a while. Don&#x27;t purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have thick, healthy hair. (Maybe it only works on damaged hair?)</li>
    <li> My favorite product hand down, this works wonders for my hair. I am lucky enough to already have decent hair, and this glaze works great to tame flyaways and leave it smooth even in humid weather. I would say that unless you truly have damaged hair the in-shower treatment should be fine and works great for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, noticeable difference when washing my medium dirty blonde hair. Feels softer and definitely eased the brassy tones from the summer sun.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel any difference !!! No glaze but I give 4 stars Cz make my hair smooth</li>
    <li> John Frieda Liquid Shine Clear Hair Glaze, 6.5 Fluid Ounce is an OUTstanding project.  totally returned the shine to my lifeless hair.  I use it after every shampoo, and it works with my other hair products wonderfully.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde/light brown, but I&#x27;ve been dying it VERY blonde for longer than I can remember. I recently dyed it very dark brown...like a shade lighter than black, and I straighten my hair all the time. Not as much as I used to...because I started just washing it every other or every 2 days (which I highly recommend...if your hair gets oily, use dry shampoo on your roots, or even baby powder in an emergency!), so needless to say, I have very long,abused, damaged hair. I&#x27;ve used every product you can think of...so I figured hey why not try one more haha. This glaze is great. I used it for the first time last night, I did the 3 minute in the shower treatment. I didn&#x27;t put it on all the way up to my roots because its really only the ends that are a wreck, and because so many people said it made their hair oily looking. I shower at night so I didn&#x27;t get to see the result til this morning, and I was very impressed! Super smooth and silky. It&#x27;s not like a HOLY SHINY! that every girl wishes for, but definitely an improvement, and that&#x27;s after just one use. I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth a shot for anybody.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff is so cheap and works. Yes, it adds another step to your conditioning process but worth it when you see the results. Shiny hair.</li>
    <li> This really does make my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Product works great in every way for my hair. Completely happy with it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost all the way through this bottle, and every time I use it I get no long-lasting results. The shine is of pretty good quality for the first 24 hours at most, but then I might as well not even have used it. It&#x27;s enough so that I&#x27;ll be finishing the bottle, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing another. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> As busy mom, who has time or the money for salon treatments. This is every bit as good, and what a bargain. Leaves hair super shiny! People will notice! Love this glaze!</li>
    <li> This glaze makes my fine hair smooth and frizz free.  I use it each time in the shower for about three minutes as directed.  Worth the $7</li>
    <li> The shine part definitely works, but I can honestly say my hair isn&#x27;t softer and has the same kinky texture. I am Caucasian but I have lots of hair with frizz and weird texture. I suppose it helped the frizz a bit but the product is something you can live without. I think you want to believe that it helps a lot but it&#x27;s only somewhat helpful. If I could go back, I&#x27;d still buy it because it helped some, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll be constantly buying refills.</li>
    <li> I saw little difference compared to a salon glaze. Didn&#x27;t hurt my hair.</li>
    <li> To be honest my hair is curly so I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference unless I straighten my hair. I bought 2 bottles. I am maybe 3/4 of the way through the first maybe it gets better.</li>
    <li> I agree with some previous reviewers this stuff makes your hair dry. I have dyed damaged hair, maybe it will work better on virgin hair though. If you really want to disguise damaged hair and have them shiny and healthy looking use organic oils like argan or almond. That will do better for your hair than any synthetic laminate.</li>
    <li> I used this product once, was surprised when people stopped me that day to ask how I got my hair so shiny. Seriously, strangers have stopped me to ask. I told them about this product. I use it daily now, just leave it on a few minutes after shampoo, conditioner, thorough rinse, and then about a tablespoon of this stuff, 3 minutes and rinse with warm then cool water. I need to buy more!!</li>
    <li> And got a scalp full of open sores instead. I&#x27;m glad it works for others; I wish it had worked for me!</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly, coarse, color-treated hair (from a salon only) &amp; this just didn&#x27;t give any shine to it at all.  In fact, it didn&#x27;t do anything at all.  It was just an extra step in the shower.  I was quite disappointed after reading all of the glowing reviews.  I have had the gloss treatments at the salon which give great shine &amp; seem to last.  I have used John Freida&#x27;s products &amp; have liked the Frizz Ease line with the exception of the very strong fragrance which I am unable to tolerate.  The other products that I have used work well but cannot use due to the fragrance.  I wish they had a fragrance-free line.</li>
    <li> The product was brand new, and just as specified. However, during this time period (I was buying several items for a trip I was planning) my card number was stolen and used for purchases I did not make. I am not saying this is the seller that committed this fraud, I&#x27;m just putting a warning out there.</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I got a ceramic perm and although the damage was minimal, my hair no longer had the lustre I&#x27;m used to having.  Trying everything from masks to argan oil, nothing worked. I&#x27;ve been looking all over Singapore for a similar product to restore shine but it just doesn&#x27;t exist in this island nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not available for shipping to Singapore but a friend was traveling to Singapore from the USA so I purchased it for her to courier it me despite the negative reviews. No regrets here at all. I followed the daily use method but did not use it on my roots. After a blow dry, my hair was soft and bouncy as if I just stepped out of a salon. My hair dilemma solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI... I have Asian hair but it is fine, color treated, and fairly straight.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews from others who purchased this glaze and thought I&#x27;d give it a try...I must say I didn&#x27;t see any difference at ALL. I have been told my hair is shiny already and that&#x27;s the reason I cant see a difference???? Maybe its true that if your hair is on the shiny side you might not see any difference I don&#x27;t know, but I was looking for something and didn&#x27;t see anything at ALL that&#x27;s why I gave the product 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well to make my hair less tangled and adds shine.  Too much and it&#x27;s flat, but if used 3x/week as recommended it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> An excellent product for fine-textured hair.  It gives the hair shine and strength, seals split or dry ends.  Retail stores charge almost double the price online here.  The bottles are smallish and the hair really absorbs the product.  If you put it on dry hair you will use up quite a bit of the product fast.  To get the best benefit from this product:  apply to wet hair, cover with shower cap, leave on about 20 minutes, then rinse out and shampoo etc.  Do that about once every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Moving from Seattle to Los Angeles has wreaked havoc with my hair. I have straight, fine, blonde hair that easily dries out. This product helped me get my normal, healthy hair back.  This is one of three inexpensive steps I use to make me feel like my hair is pretty again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Styleshots Epic Volume Shampoo, Aveeno Nourish Plus Moisturize Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda Full Repair Perfect Ends Deep Infusion&lt;br /&gt;Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It smells awful..I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how horrible the smell is. But otherwise the product works amazingly and leaves my hair with more shine and helps maintain my color.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to see some shine difference, but I didn&#x27;t.  Kind of a pain for the time you are supposed to leave it on every time.  Tried the weekly booster method also, and didn&#x27;t tell any difference from that either.  I was disappointed.  Maybe a straighter hair texture would get better results.</li>
    <li> easy to use, hair looks great - was hard to find a product for natural hair - most were for color treated.</li>
    <li> I Love the product, it is the first time I purchased it, &amp; it works great, I will continue to purchase. Easy to use</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the better oart of 2 years.  I have very fine yet frizzy curly hair that I straighten daily now that it is in a short cut.  This product leaves an beautiful shine to my highly color damaged hair and leaves a wonderful smell as well.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING, seriously I am blown away. I&#x27;ve probably spent a couple hundred dollars and tried 20+ hair products to treat my damaged hair (breakage and chronic split ends) due to wearing a ponytail pretty much daily for years (don&#x27;t do that btw, nearly ruined my fine straight hair). It&#x27;s super healthy underneath but the top layer is bad. I&#x27;m now getting regular trims, wear my hair down, satin pillowcase, NO PONYTAILS, only wash twice a week, hair vitamins, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried deep conditioners, leave in conditioners, various oils, products for african american hair, serums, GROCERIES (eggs, beer, avocado, olive oil), etc. Some of the products did nothing, a couple were actually good but still the top layer of my hair looked abysmal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about John Frieda Hair Glaze online and ordered it right away due to the incredibly affordable price. First time I used it I knew I had found my miracle product! Upon drying (air dry, no heat) my hair felt thicker, stronger and very soft. The top layer was smooth and shiny like I haven&#x27;t seen it in years. I do a weekly 20 min treatment and use it as a 3 min treatment on the other day I wash my hair. That might be too much for a person with oily hair (mine is normal to dry) so once a week might be best. Or use up to 3 times a week as stated on the bottle if your hair is dry. People have complained about the scent but I think it&#x27;s mild. You will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, but have been unable to find it in retail stores.  I have used this product w/ Silver Expressions Shampoo mixed 1/2 to 1/2 as a 2nd wash on my hair after a clarifying 1st wash &amp; leave it in to soak until I&#x27;m ready to rinse &amp; finish my shower.  I am always getting compliments on how shiny &amp; silver my hair looks.  My grandaughters love to shower @ my house &amp; use this product...it makes their hair shiney, too.  An excellent product that actually works is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love the shine this product gives without making my hair sticky or heavy</li>
    <li> I used this for weeks and found that it did not work as advertised. My hair was no shinier and actually felt drier and looked frizzier after using it.</li>
    <li> Meh..... Not even sure if it does anything won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
    <li> I use this product 2-3 times a week and it has made my hair so soft and silky ...LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product at all. I have thick, wavy, long hair, and it made my hair extremely FRIZZY and dry. I used it twice because I thought the first time I had done something wrong, yeah it was the product, my hair was unmanageable, I never have knots in my hair after taking a shower but I did after using this. My hair became extremely puffy (I looked like a chia pet), very frizzy and dry. I did not notice any difference with the shininess of my hair. I would not buy this product again nor would I recommend for anyone who has wavy, curly or thick hair in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not fragrance free, it is a pretty strong smell when it is first applied but after you wash it out it&#x27;s not as strong, and it has a slimy consistency.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. My hair has never looked this shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I thought it was awful. It left my hair feeling rough and tangled. Then I read the directions, something I tend to ignore. You aren&#x27;t supposed to use this stuff instead of conditioner, but as an addition to your usual hair care routine. If I follow one of their 2 suggested application methods I get excellent results.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Used this on my dry over processed hair, it made a BIG difference....</li>
    <li> I have only used this once. It did make my hair very shiny and pretty. The smell is strong and kind of a chemical smell when you first put it on. Good price on Amazon and came very fast.</li>
    <li> After trying this, I signed up to receive this every other month now and it works great for a deep conditioner on my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use once a week and it makes my hair soft and silky.  Note that it has a similar ingredient as hair spray so it does a number on nail polish so wear gloves if your nails are painted.</li>
    <li> I use the entire bottle per use! i use about 3/4 on my dry hair (i have long thick hair) and leave it in for about an hour (just put it in a bun and place a shower cap over it) and then put the remaining 1/4 and leave it in for another half hour. Its actually really easy, i just do errands around the house and watch a little TV. Results are definitely noticeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because this product is a bit harsh on nail polish...so my manicure gets ruined each time i do this. It doesnt strip hair dye at all, but it strips nail polish.</li>
    <li> so easy to use and makes a wonderful difference on how shiny my hair is, thank you</li>
    <li> Wow this is pretty cool, somewhat changes the texture and improves the appearance of your hair  (temporarily) for the better!</li>
    <li> Let me just say I have tried a lot of products and nothing has ever made my hair feel this great, ever!  I stripped my hair last summer and then 6 weeks later I stripped it again because I wanted light ash blonde/brown and I don&#x27;t like the warm tones so I stripped it to get to what I needed then used dye to get the color I wanted but for some reason, the color wasn&#x27;t holding and I was constantly dyeing my hair like every week.  yes I know this is very bad but the color just wouldn&#x27;t hold.  I don&#x27;t think it was really the stripping that killed my hair, I think it was the constant dyeing but anyway it was so damaged and I even cut a lot of my hair off because I couldn&#x27;t stand the way it felt.  my hair is naturally wavy/curly and it was so damaged that is was straighter and frizzy big time.  I tried different things but nothing worked.  Then I heard about this product and heard that it was good for shine and softness so I decided to give it a try.  After shampooing and conditioning I put it in and left it in for the 3 minutes.  I really didn&#x27;t feel that great after I rinsed it out but let me tell you when it was dry it was amazing.  it&#x27;s so soft and my wavy is back.  there&#x27;s no knots and I love touching my hair, it&#x27;s so soft.  I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
    <li> I use this product midway after a month or so of having my hair colored. It really make my hair shiny and soft and extends the color.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my hair shine as much as has done for other reviewers.  I stopped using it after a few months and only use leave-in conditioner and a hair serum</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would help with my frizz, or at least make my hair shinier.  Instead, it did nothing I noticed at all to my hair.  It also has a very chemical smell.  The best thing i can say about it is that at least it didn&#x27;t seem to hurt my hair at all.</li>
    <li> Feels like residue stays in hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has always looked course &amp; dry (it runs in the family). I have tried many different products out there but nothing really work. I like this stuff. Not only does it feel soft, it took the dullness out of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried leaving it on for the suggested time for the DEEP shine and using it in the shower for touch-ups.  I&#x27;m not even a big fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Makes your hair soft and shiny, very happy!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to wash out. Love this product. Makes my hair real glossy! Will buy again. Makes my blonde hair really shiny.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shine or smell good</li>
    <li> Seems to add a nice shine to my hair but also may strip a bit of color if you color your hair to hide the gray. You use this in the shower after your conditioner. I think when it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;ll stick to shine products that I use after fixing my hair.</li>
    <li> this glaze leaves your hair shiny, and soft therefore hair looks healthy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! My bleach damaged hair is noticeably shinier and softer. I will buy this forever. It didn&#x27;t change the color at all.</li>
    <li> My blonde hair really shines.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Got many compliments.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this made my hair any shinier. I have used it according to the directions on the bottle for regular use. I have not tried using as the 20 minute treatment, for those directions you wash the product out of your hair. I won&#x27;t buy it again, but it may work for you.</li>
    <li> After using this for two months, the magic had worn off. It made my hair very dry. I was so sad. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shelf wear or depending on your hair type (I have wavy hair). But the effects didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product when once a week and months had passed and it just dried out my hair. This is one of John Frieda&#x27;s products that I cannot trust anymore.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair &amp; this product not only makes my hair look better but it makes it healthier. It grows better is less frizzy &amp; fuller.</li>
    <li> One day I was reading a beauty blog (the beauty department) and they recommended using hair glaze...  The next day I started reading up on the product and really getting interested in this.  As a brand they liked, this has been a great investment for my hair.  I use it once a week and end up with less dry, much more silky and smooth hair afterward.  I have lots of flyaways and frizz over the winter months, and this helps tame it.  I love this product and plan to replenish my supply soon!</li>
    <li> Came in a couple days late, and that&#x27;s just about it for the negative stuff.  I love John Frieda products and I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  Complete addict to the line.</li>
    <li> Left my hair softer but a little greasy.</li>
    <li> After applying and then rinsing out per label instructions, my wet hair felt greasy.  After completing styling, hair felt heavy and I did not see any visible difference in the normal sheen of my hair.  After two days, my hair which is normal not dry or oily, was like a grease bowl!  I tried it again thinking I may not have adequately rinsed the lotion out of my hair.  However, I experienced the same results.  Altho pricey stuff, I squeezed the remaing liquid out of the bottle, rinsed it out and threw the bottle into the recycle bin.  May work for some but not for me.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product based upon my experience with it.</li>
    <li> I regularly visit my hair salon to get my hair glazed professionally for about $50-60.  I discovered this product and gave it a try.  Usually, the salon job repairs 80-90% of my split ends and it definitely boosts up the shine.  I used John Frieda on my dry hair and left it for about 15-20 minutes.  It covered about 60% of my split ends, but I&#x27;m not sure wether it gave my hair extra shine at all.  For the price, I find this a great alternative to my expensive visit to a salon.  Plus I really like the fragrance!!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, thick hair - styled in a medium-length bob, getting some grey! I didn&#x27;t want to color my hair, but wanted a polished &#x27;work&#x27; look - &amp; this really did the trick. My main goal was shine &amp; having healthy looking hair; mission accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use once a week, on dry hair, &amp; apply sparingly but thoroughly; I do wait 30 minutes before showering, &amp; have not had problems with greasiness. My hair is softer &amp; has more sheen, &amp; stays consistently well-kept looking until the next week&#x27;s application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had a horrible allergic reaction, my scalp, neck , ears  all were itchy as if they were on fire  ... throw it immediately.</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and shiny as I had hoped after reading the reviews!  Will be ordering more of this!</li>
    <li> John Frieda Hair Glaze is a wonderful hair product.  I have used it for years and will continue to.  It leaves your hair silky, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in great condition and has proven to be very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Only used twice so I think it&#x27;s too soon to rate but if i had to I would say walk don&#x27;t run to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years. Still the best shine I can get from the drugstore. Glassy fresh from the salon shine, no greasy or weighed-down look.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine and decided to give it a try.  I just love how my hair&lt;br /&gt;Looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I honestly could not see a significant difference in either the brunette color nor the amount of shine after using this product.  Worse, it stains like crazy! My hands were instantly stained, it stained where it splashed on the kitchen counter (came off with bleach), and worse, stained all around my hairline! I had to scrub my skin with conditioner and a nail brush to get it off, and it didn&#x27;t all come off until a few days later. The second time around, I wore gloves, and smeared my face with Vaseline, but it still stained a small area on my temple covered by my bangs.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again given the price and the staining problems, which were way worse than my permnent hair color, which is minimal. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t use it in the shower and let it drip on my bare skin for 3 minutes!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, I really did. A product that would give some shine to my rather dull, graying locks, and not require an expensive salon visit, and it does. What I can&#x27;t get past is the smell. Like other reviewers said, the odor is very strong and chemical, fake perfume-y. Could smell it before I opened it, but tried it anyway. Product works okay, but the smell of it is more than I can handle. I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like this. And, when applying it for the first 20 minute session, it irritated the skin of my hands. Stung a little. Scary- what does that? So, I&#x27;ll go back to clear henna. Henna gives shine, is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t need to be applied so often, smells natural, like a plant, not unpleasant, like this. What was I thinking? A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because the ingredients were listed, and fragrance was not listed in the ingredients.  I am allergic to fragrance and cannot use products with fragrance.  I was not able to use it, and the Amazon web site is telling me I cannot return it, so I wasted my money.  I will not order cosmetics or hair products from Amazon.com again.</li>
    <li> Most of the time this product works well to shine my hair, but other times it doesn&#x27;t. Obviously, I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I&#x27;ve usually used it after shampooing and conditioning-maybe I don&#x27;t rinse out the conditioner well enough. Some of the best results have been when I put it on damp hair and let it sit there for an hour or so before washing and conditioning. I AM fond enough of this product that I&#x27;ve kept buying it. What I&#x27;m trying to say is: find out YOUR best way of using it, because it DOES help make hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly; item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly had and this products works great to smooth it out.  You can leave it on as a once a week treatment or use with every shampoo for for about 3 minutes.  A little of this product goes a long way.  If I use too much my hair will be a bit flat, but just a little leaves it smooth and shiny until my next shampoo. Be careful on using too much product because it can also leave your hair greasy.  But, overall a nice finishing product if you want to get rid of frizz and have soft touchable hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything special to smooth out my curly hair.  Left it frizzer than any cheap conditioner.  Might be good for straight hair.</li>
    <li> After using this product for the first time today, my hair was shinier but not as much as I hoped. I did notice my hair was less frizzy. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair softer, but not heavier. Especially works for the upper part of my hair (near the scalp), on which I cannot apply regular conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t do much for my very dry ends though.</li>
    <li> I use this weekly. It keeps my hair looking fantastic and glossy.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I get a &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; like effect once I use it in the shower for a few minutes. Very shiny! I love it!</li>
    <li> Product is okay, but not spectacular. I have long black hair. Convenient because you use it in the shower. This product has to be rinsed out.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and shiny on my fine hair.  I like to use it with a cap over my hair for an hour.  The smell is nice.  Last a long time.  Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of it.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I used this product and expected it to do something for my hair.  It did not.  I am really disappointed for my wasted of money.</li>
    <li> Unless I am using this wrong, my hair looks the same....</li>
    <li> It did add shine, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the trouble.  I did not try leaving it on for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a weekly treatment and didn&#x27;t noticed any additional shine, but I did notice that it left my hair manageable frizz free</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I found the glaze chunky and it was difficult to smooth through my hair evenly (as instructed). After using for a few shampoos, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair&#x27;s shine but felt like this product dried my hair out.</li>
    <li> I had this product before &amp; could not find it in the stores. Love it, it makes your hair so shiny &amp; I love the smell. Get compliments on my hair all the time, shows the most on black hair like mine. Gotta order again &amp; Amazon pulls through as always!</li>
    <li> Just like all John Frieda products this one is great too. My hair has a shine that makes it glisten. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and absolutely love it! This does a phenomenal job of keeping my hair shiny and smooth feeling. After not being able to find it in stores, when I found it on amazon and started using it again my hairdresser even asked me if I was using something different on my hair because he couldn&#x27;t believe how much softer my hair felt! I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but try to use it multiple times a week because my hair feels so much softer and looks so much shinier when I use it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or heavy feeling which is a huge plus compared to other products. I have even recommended this to my hairdresser and friends because I am so impressed with the job it does! You can actually see a big difference in the mirror after using this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and believe it improves the appearance of my colored, curly hair.  My hair is in good condition, but tends to frizz and look dry.  I used this as a conditioning product once a week before shampooing and this works for me.  I can&#x27;t always find it in local stores and Amazon prime delivers it right to my door.</li>
    <li> disappointing... REALLY strong smell of cheap perfume.. Not as effective (or strong smelling ) as my fave gloss, Madison Reed, but this is also 25% of the price when you factor in Madison Reed price ($24) plus shipping, vs. $7 for J.F. &amp; free shipping via AMZN prime..</li>
    <li> No I didn&#x27;t like this clear shine, it certinaly did not put a shine on my hair, it made my hair coarse and very dull, a completr waste of money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no change in my hair. No shine at all.</li>
    <li> I live in an extremely humid environment and have to battle frizz constantly.  I have used many products that claim they tame frizz to no avail.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the results of this glaze.  There are two suggested methods on the package, one to use for a few minutes on wet hair and a 20 minute treatment on dry hair.  I used the 20 minute treatment, making sure I saturated the ends, combed the product completely through my hair with a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was slightly disappointed when I washed it out and my hair did not feel glossy or slick plus I had to use a really good conditioner.  Because of the humidity I NEVER let my hair air dry but decided to take a vacation from the hair dryer and flat iron.  Wow! Amazing!  I have fine slightly wavy hair that was transformed into full bodied shiny waves!  Usually the next day my hair goes flat but I am on day three of shiny bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems if you use this product daily you will get build up and eventually limp hair, I would suggest once a week treatment. As far as the smell that people are talking about, I really didn&#x27;t notice anything bad.  Also I want to address the cost, considering how much I pay for glazing at the salon which runs about $30 this is a bargain!  I think the other reviewers looked at this as a conditioner, and if you do then yes it is a tad expensive for a conditioner.  But this saves me the cost and time of going to the salon! Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this. Smells so amazing. Works great. But a lot of them!</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars because I suppose it does work. I have light brown (colored) hair with blonde highlights (naturally dark brown hair) and this did make my color brighter and more dramatic (a bit too blonde maybe) BUT it didn&#x27;t matter. It dried my hair out more than anything ever has! I tried everything, lots of conditioner before I applied it in the shower, conditioner while my hair was still wet after shower and never rinsed it out, I tried using only a tiny amount, (I have long hair) no matter what, my hair was so dried out and coarse it was horrible I hated it.</li>
    <li> This was not in no way what I wanted. It does not and did not bring out shine in my hair if anything it made it worse and brittle. Won&#x27;t buy this at the store nor on here again. thanks but no thanks :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading positive reviews. It worked only fair on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is coarse, naturally curly and tends to be dry. This hair glaze made it&lt;br /&gt;feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;I like the option to straighten my hair, which makes it look even more dry. I&lt;br /&gt;found that using this product made it look less dry. However, it still tangled&lt;br /&gt;easily, and was only a little less dry-looking than when just using conditioner.</li>
