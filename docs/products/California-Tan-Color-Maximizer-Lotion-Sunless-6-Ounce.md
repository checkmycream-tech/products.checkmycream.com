      <li>and I don&#x27;t honestly know the specifics of how it works</li>
      <li>VersaSpa makes their own, but to me it&#x27;s greasier and I don&#x27;t care for that feeling.</li>
      <li>so I am able to honestly give a valid opinion.</li>
      <li>&amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 :) :) :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>with this product - the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is more like a gel consistency</li>
      <li>My color is more even now.  </li>
      <li>Much more even application.</li>
      <li>i am going through the bottle kind of fast, but it is a good price compared to the salon.</li>
      <li>it gives a better color when spraying each time  lll</li>
      <li>It helps develop the DHA in the spray tan to a darker, more even tone.</li>
      <li>The price for this on Amazon is much better than at the salon</li>
      <li>I know women are more picky about there lotions</li>
      <li>You would be better off with nothing, &amp; and the money you paid for to get this product still in your pocket.  </li>
      <li>I believe this product did make my tan go on more smoothly.</li>
      <li>The cost at the salon is more than double what I paid on here - Makes for a great even tan that lasts longer.</li>
      <li>this stuff does just fine...</li>
      <li>It seems to help the color not flake off as quickly and it goes on more even.</li>
      <li>I love that its a gel it absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight gel lotion and glides on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous product that softens the skin and helps to retain moisture whilst tanning</li>
      <li>I use the whole California Tan line of products and they are amazing.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than at the salon but same great product!</li>
      <li>It does not work near as good as the Versa Spa version.</li>
      <li>New favorite primer!</li>
      <li>So far I love this product!</li>
      <li>This California Tan color Maximizer Primer smells fresh and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Light scent and soaks in right away.</li>
      <li>, it is a gel like texture that dries quickly</li>
      <li>: it does smell good &amp; it does dry quickly.</li>
      <li>I think the price is excellent and it last a super long time.</li>
      <li>I think it helps my spray tan last longer and smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve only used this product 2 times, but i feel like my tan looked amazing when i used this before i sprayed</li>
      <li>I bought the set of the California Tan sunless tan maximizers, 1, 2 and 3 at &amp;#34;At the Beach&amp;#34; for a considerable amount more than you can get them for through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I use this brand at a higher cost at the salon and had worked well to preserve the tan.</li>
      <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>This product really helps even spray tans out.</li>
      <li>I really like this product in the spray, but I&#x27;m not fond of it in the gel.</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>It is much cheaper than the salon</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover your whole body</li>
      <li>I put it on lightly all over my body and face and rub it in well 10 minutes prior to spray tanning in the Versa Spa Spray tan enclosure.  </li>
      <li>Just started spray tanning regularly and this product has made a significant difference.</li>
      <li>and it went on fine, but took FOREVER to dry.</li>
      <li>Its important that you let it dry before you apply your bronzer.  </li>
      <li>Besides it costing a lot less, the tan looks much better.  </li>
      <li>you can get it at a decent price too....</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and it is a clear gel.</li>
      <li>Exact same product selling for double at the tanning salon.</li>
      <li>right before I get in, and the dry time was too much, and if I didnt let it dry enough</li>
      <li>Really works and spend much much less than the salons overpriced items.</li>

<li> Not sure if it made much difference.</li>
<li> I layer this underneath the Sun self tanner lotion (i use Ultra Dark Instant Tint).</li>
<li> some brands are super expensive and overpriced...</li>
<li> Not very sticky.</li>
<li> no, not really</li>
<li> BUT 1 bottle only lasted me a few tans.</li>
<li> Most of the other brands (like versaspa) have a horrible smell or smell like baby powder, which stinks on top of the sunless tan smell.</li>
<li> Occasionally spray tans can apply unevenly or create a small racing stripe.</li>
<li> and I was sooo dark</li>
<li> It does what it said for nearly half the price.</li>
<li> and it is less than 1/2 the price on Amazon.</li>
<li> I achieve the same results as with the Versa lotion - darker color, longer lasting, etc, but this is just easier to use and much less expensive.</li>
<li> I do feel this helped a little bit.</li>
<li> My spray tan was so dark and even after using this!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly like the spray, so my spray tan came out uneven.</li>
<li> I have been using a similar product by Versa but thought I would try this one because it is less expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it with fake tanner but I did not see a difference in the tanning bed unfortunately.</li>
    <li> great price and use it every time i spray tan it gives a better color when spraying each time  lll</li>
    <li> I use this for sunless tanning...preps skin to get maximum results...you can get it at a decent price too....some brands are super expensive and overpriced...this stuff does just fine...I&#x27;m assuming it works well for regular tanning beds too</li>
    <li> I have the annoying problem of never ever feeling the tingle in tingle lotions, they don&#x27;t even make my skin pink at all.  The girl at the desk where I tan suggested I put this on before the tingle and just like that I finally felt the tingle!  I am so so so so happy I found this product! I love that its a gel it absorbs quickly and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover your whole body so the product lasts a lot longer then a lotion.  If you have the same problem with tingle lotions or if you have built up a tolerance to tingle lotions GET THIS BOTTLE ASAP! LOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEE ITTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 :) :) :)</li>
    <li> LOVE! My spray tan was so dark and even after using this! Light scent and soaks in right away. New favorite primer!</li>
    <li> This California Tan color Maximizer Primer smells fresh and goes on smooth. I think it has a citrus like scent and it is a clear gel. Most of the other brands (like versaspa) have a horrible smell or smell like baby powder, which stinks on top of the sunless tan smell. I have had great results in versa spa at Sun Tan City salon using this! I haven&#x27;t had streaks at all. I think the price is excellent and it last a super long time. For me a bottle of this lasts all Spring and Summer. This is also an excellent price as this sells for 2x the price in the salon! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product or buy a salon product from Amazon. I love California Tan!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It is excellent to use before a spray tan or before laying in tanning bed. It truly does help prep your skin for receiving a great tan. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you tan at a tanning salon and you want a deeper, darker tan then you need to buy this. I use it on the body parts that don&#x27;t tan as well: feet, lower legs, side of neck and this evens my tan. It hs a nice smell and it is less than 1/2 the price on Amazon. Great deal, great product.</li>
    <li> This product really helps even spray tans out. Occasionally spray tans can apply unevenly or create a small racing stripe. This product evens the spray tan out wherever it is applied. It also has a nice smell. I do not however see any benefit from this product when using a regular tanning bed though.</li>
    <li> Love it! Same as what you buy in the salon.</li>
    <li> Love this product line!</li>
    <li> This is awesome I mixed this with a tingle lotion and a bronzing lotion and I was sooo dark it look like I had did the spray tan without the orange tint. I would buy this again. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps make your tan last. I layer this underneath the Sun self tanner lotion (i use Ultra Dark Instant Tint).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing. Smelled great though.</li>
    <li> use this product in the versa spa &amp; have no problems what so ever.  works well, no problems &amp; would recommend to any potential customer thinking about purchase.  I have purchased both versa spa products &amp; California tan so I am able to honestly give a valid opinion.</li>
    <li> I do the Versa Spa Spray tan weekly and use this prior to as recommended by my tanning salon. The cost at the salon is more than double what I paid on here - Makes for a great even tan that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I do feel this helped a little bit. I like rhis brand because they seem to use good/healthy ingredients. I believe this product did make my tan go on more smoothly. The price for this on Amazon is much better than at the salon BUT 1 bottle only lasted me a few tans. I wish they would make a larger bottle. . . Will I buy again? probably. Do I think it&#x27;s a necessity for an even Spray Tan? no, not really</li>
    <li> Exact same product selling for double at the tanning salon. Packaged well. My wife and I used it for sunless tanning. It seems to help the color not flake off as quickly and it goes on more even. I used with and without. Product is a like a gel, not a lotion. Goes on easier for me. Not very sticky.</li>
    <li> I really like this product in the spray, but I&#x27;m not fond of it in the gel. It doesn&#x27;t go on evenly like the spray, so my spray tan came out uneven. When I used it in the beds, I didn&#x27;t notice any change from regular tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Really works and spend much much less than the salons overpriced items.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Sunless PRO pre-tan developer from VersaSpa.  My daughter and I have used both, and we like this product MUCH better!  Besides it costing a lot less, the tan looks much better.  This product is a gel whereas the Versa Spa product  is a lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Helps with my spray tan and helps with the smell too! I will be buying more ASAP!</li>
    <li> Good stuff just started using it. The QT arrived on time and was as the product was discribed.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it made much difference. It arrived while I was at work and it was 108 outside. I was told at the salon that itvis heat activated  and that&#x27;s why it may not if worked since it day in the heat until I got home that day. I use this brand at a higher cost at the salon and had worked well to preserve the tan.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. It works very well and I would recommend it to others to build a great tan.</li>
    <li> My color is more even now.  Its important that you let it dry before you apply your bronzer.  I use it every time.</li>
    <li> Just started spray tanning regularly and this product has made a significant difference. No streaking! No running! I actually didn&#x27;t use it on one area and I could definitely notice a difference. Much more even application.</li>
    <li> great product, this brand is awesome, a must have, great for tanners/fake tanners, color looks great not orange , I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, i cocktail and it works great</li>
    <li> I add this with my tanning lotion and it helps me get tanner faster.  I have bought it two years in a row and will buy it this year too.</li>
    <li> I bought the set of the California Tan sunless tan maximizers, 1, 2 and 3 at &amp;#34;At the Beach&amp;#34; for a considerable amount more than you can get them for through Amazon.  The only California Tan product that I have continued to use is the #1.  I order it through Amazon as it is 1/2 the cost that I would pay at the tanning salon.  I put it on lightly all over my body and face and rub it in well 10 minutes prior to spray tanning in the Versa Spa Spray tan enclosure.  It helps to even out my tan, keep my skin subtle and non-greasy and eliminates that stinky self tan smell.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I used the VersaSpa product prior to this and it went on fine, but took FOREVER to dry. I like to go to the spray tan booth after work, so I put the lotion on right before I get in, and the dry time was too much, and if I didnt let it dry enough I would come out spotty. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this product - the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is more like a gel consistency but it goes on and dries in a flash. I achieve the same results as with the Versa lotion - darker color, longer lasting, etc, but this is just easier to use and much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I use this product before spray tanning in a VersaSpa. It helps develop the DHA in the spray tan to a darker, more even tone. It&#x27;s a lightweight gel lotion and glides on smoothly.  It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks in so you&#x27;re not coated in it. VersaSpa makes their own, but to me it&#x27;s greasier and I don&#x27;t care for that feeling. I use the whole California Tan line of products and they are amazing.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used this product 2 times, but i feel like my tan looked amazing when i used this before i sprayed, it is a gel like texture that dries quickly and I don&#x27;t honestly know the specifics of how it works but I do know that my tan looks great.</li>
    <li> I like having something to apply before I spray tan. This moisturizes and I feel makes for a smoother application.</li>
    <li> Great product to maximize your color</li>
    <li> I think it helps my spray tan last longer and smells pretty good. i am going through the bottle kind of fast, but it is a good price compared to the salon. It says it helps intensify tanning beds as well, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> this stuff works for me, but I&#x27;m a guy I know women are more picky about there lotions but I like it and its way cheaper to buy than at a salon</li>
    <li> It does not work near as good as the Versa Spa version. Won&#x27;t buy this ever again! Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than at the salon but same great product!</li>
    <li> So far I love this product! It does what it said for nearly half the price.</li>
    <li> This product is a great product but it is no longer available from the manufacturer and had to find another product to replace it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders when used with the Sun Labs self tanning lotion. Would definitely buy again! Gonna get more to keep on hand!</li>
    <li> You would be better off with nothing, &amp; and the money you paid for to get this product still in your pocket.  Personally, I saw no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it does smell good &amp; it does dry quickly.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product that softens the skin and helps to retain moisture whilst tanning</li>
    <li> I have been using a similar product by Versa but thought I would try this one because it is less expensive. I guess you really do get what you pay for. This product was irritating to a few areas on my body and didn&#x27;t make any difference on my sunless tan color. I do notice a difference when i use the Versa.</li>
    <li> I buy one a month for spray tanning.It is much cheaper than the salon (I spray 5 times a month,maybe 6) and a great product.</li>
</ol>
