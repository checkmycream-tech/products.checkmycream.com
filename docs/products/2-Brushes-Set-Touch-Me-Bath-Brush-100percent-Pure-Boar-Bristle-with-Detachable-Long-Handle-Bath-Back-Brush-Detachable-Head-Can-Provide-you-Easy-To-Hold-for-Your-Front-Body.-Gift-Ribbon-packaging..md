      <li>/&gt;It is nice there are two, one for me and one for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The brushes were nice, but I wanted more bristles.</li>
      <li>If I do not add anymore to this 1/15/14 review, after a week or so, then please consider that as my way of saying that I am pleased with the performance of the brushes when bathing.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>These really do work great.</li>
      <li>I use the body brush with Nivea Body Wash products, which is fabulous for the skin!</li>
      <li>This item arrived promptly and really works great.</li>
      <li>Not peeling off, more like wearing away.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush and now my husband and I both have one for our bathrooms.</li>
      <li>more thing.  </li>
      <li>I will buy it again if I can&#x27;t find a better one.</li>
      <li>Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This one is ok, nothing special.</li>
      <li>The finish is fine</li>
      <li>Wish I had more time on weekday mornings, but a quick shower is about all the time I have.</li>
      <li>I had a brush similar to this one before and it was great.</li>
      <li>This is not as good as the loofah for my own taste, but I do prefer a harder brush.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>just right!</li>
      <li>Then it dries quickly, too.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and was just as described online.</li>
      <li>It actually feels perfect on your more sensitive areas such as neck and even face.</li>
      <li>My husband says the slight angle in the handle is what he likes the best, besides the natural bristles of course.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it was a good buy.</li>
      <li>The bristles are just the right firmness for me.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the bristles were a little stiffer, but I still give it five stars because it is a good quality product.</li>
      <li>I bought my first set about 6 months ago</li>
      <li>They come exactly as the picture shows... with a plastic cover over the brush and a bow.  </li>
      <li>The wood is now absorbing the water and soon the handle will not be able to slip into the back of the brush.  </li>
      <li>Good quality bristles that last a long time and don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
      <li>I can easily reach my whole back.</li>
      <li>And, the handles were much shorter than these.</li>
      <li>But is ONLY effective, in my opinion, when used dry.</li>
      <li>guess the manufacturer couldn&#x27;t get his hands on some decent polyurethane?&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>highly recommend these brushes.</li>
      <li>But I decided to keep it anyway for those more sensitive areas that tyne loofah is too harsh on.</li>
      <li>I tend to put a little pressure on them to scrub hard and the cheap plastic ones break very easily.</li>
      <li>The bristles seem a little stiff at first, but after several uses, they limber up and do a good job.</li>
      <li>The bristles have gotten soft</li>
      <li>Order came fast, my husband likes the wooden handle.</li>
      <li>The brush is firm but not painful.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brush in the shower daily for over a year and it still looks like new.  </li>
      <li>They look fine to me and the brush hairs appear to be stiff enough.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like the removable brush head for scrubbing all over then putting the head back on the handle for scrubbing the back.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for decent back scrubbers for quite a long time and these ft the bill</li>
      <li>Bristles are just stiff enough to give a good scratch to an itchy back yet not harsh enough to be irritating.  </li>
      <li>If I want to save these brushes I will need to dry them completely out and then re-polyurethane them.  </li>

    <li> Received in good shape, well wrapped (ribbons even), beautiful wood and do the job in the shower. I use both - one with the handle on and the other with the handle off. Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Order came fast, my husband likes the wooden handle. One disappointment is, he thoguht the handle was longer. Still unable to get to those hard to reach areas. Other than that, it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> This item arrived promptly and really works great. I particularly like the removable brush head for scrubbing all over then putting the head back on the handle for scrubbing the back. The bristles are just the right firmness for me. I would recommend this item to others.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and now my husband and I both have one for our bathrooms.The handle is great and the brush is fantastic. I would reccommend this to all.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. The head slips off to use as a hand brush, or you can leave it on and use it for your back. The bristles seem a little stiff at first, but after several uses, they limber up and do a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought one like this 35 years ago.  When it finally died awhile back, I thought I&#x27;d never find another.  I&#x27;m so happy I could replace it with this pair!  My husband and I now each have one.  I attached a silver-dollar-sized suction cup to mine and stick it to the shower wall when I&#x27;m not using it.  Then it dries quickly, too.</li>
    <li> The brushes were nice, but I wanted more bristles. I had a brush similar to this one before and it was great. This one is ok, nothing special. I will buy it again if I can&#x27;t find a better one.</li>
    <li> These really do work great. I am now on my second set-so my 3rd brush. I bought my first set about 6 months ago and I use them every Saturday and Sunday when I can take a long bath and exfoliate. Wish I had more time on weekday mornings, but a quick shower is about all the time I have. Before purchasing these I had been through numerous plastic brushes that I bought in stores. I tend to put a little pressure on them to scrub hard and the cheap plastic ones break very easily. And, the handles were much shorter than these. After going through maybe five of those I decided to shop on Amazon. I came across these and have been very happy. I can easily reach my whole back. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the bristles were a little stiffer, but I still give it five stars because it is a good quality product.</li>
    <li> A boar bristle brush was recommended by a medical site for small clogged body pores. I purchased this for my son and he loves it. I use it myself and I think the boar bristles are just perfect for exfoliation. I have used others that were way to stiff. This is a Goldilocks, not too soft and not too stiff...just right!</li>
    <li> This is not as good as the loofah for my own taste, but I do prefer a harder brush. It actually feels perfect on your more sensitive areas such as neck and even face. But is ONLY effective, in my opinion, when used dry. Wet, for me, it&#x27;s just way too soft. But I decided to keep it anyway for those more sensitive areas that tyne loofah is too harsh on.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t last very long after they get wet. The bristle plastic holder separates from the wood base. It will do for a short time</li>
    <li> The product description is a bit confusing.  Because each brush is 2 pieces (pcs), a brush and a detachable handle, you are actually getting 4 pieces, that being 2 brushes and 2 handles. They look fine to me and the brush hairs appear to be stiff enough.  However, I haven&#x27;t used them yet.  I rushed this review because I wanted to address the &#x27;4 pieces&#x27; issue.  If I do not add anymore to this 1/15/14 review, after a week or so, then please consider that as my way of saying that I am pleased with the performance of the brushes when bathing.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing.  They come exactly as the picture shows... with a plastic cover over the brush and a bow.  It is a nice presentation if you wish to give it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;**********************************&lt;br /&gt;May 11, 2014 - Changed my rating!!!&lt;br /&gt;It was about after 5 uses when I discovered that the varnish was coming off.  Not peeling off, more like wearing away.  Now the brushes that I bought have almost no varnish (i.e., lacquer / polyurethane / whatever substandard coating that was used) on them.  The wood is now absorbing the water and soon the handle will not be able to slip into the back of the brush.  If I want to save these brushes I will need to dry them completely out and then re-polyurethane them.  I am concerned about, after I have re-coated the wood, whether the handle will still slip into the slot on the back of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the manufacturer couldn&#x27;t get his hands on some decent polyurethane?&lt;br /&gt;What a pain and a disappointment.  The last handle and brush combo that I had like this lasted 5 years, not just 5 months.</li>
    <li> I needed something to scrub my back after my loofah on a stick bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice there are two, one for me and one for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I monogrammed them both and put on hooks in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is sturdy.  The brush is firm but not painful.  That&#x27;s just what I wanted, some brush that stays firm even when wet.  I was not disappointed.  The boar;s hair bristles take the soap well and lather up so nicely.  They make shaving brushes out of boar&#x27;s hair because it will lather so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly one can take the brush off the handle and just wash with it alone.  I was not able to get the brush off of either handle.  Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for a pair of nice brushes, these are very nice.  You should not be disappointed in these brushes unless you are looking for a really stiff or soft brush.  These are definitely in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Good quality bristles that last a long time and don&#x27;t fall out.  I use the body brush with Nivea Body Wash products, which is fabulous for the skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this brush in the shower daily for over a year and it still looks like new.  I simply hang it in the shower to dry.  The finish is fine and I have had no deterioration of the wood or the bristles.  Bristles are just stiff enough to give a good scratch to an itchy back yet not harsh enough to be irritating.  I put a longer cord in the handle to hang the brush with and I would not object if the handle was 2 or 3 inches longer.  But it serves well as is.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> ...There were bristle brushes. I&#x27;ve had one that is almost identical to these, the head is marginally bigger, for over thirty years. The bristles have gotten soft so I was looking for a replacement and found these. They are perfect. The heads slip off the handles so you can use them in your hands and the strap keeps them in place as you reach for hard to get places. The price is excellent and I can&#x27;t see spending more because I can&#x27;t imagine how these can be improved.</li>
    <li> My husband says the slight angle in the handle is what he likes the best, besides the natural bristles of course. No better way to scrub your back!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for decent back scrubbers for quite a long time and these ft the bill and it is glorious.</li>
    <li> This is nice brush. I thought I was buying two brushes, when in fact I bought four! I thought one brush consisted of two pieces---the handle and brush head. Instead, I bought a two brush package x 2. Had a couple to give as gifts. I&#x27;d also like to see a hook included for customers whose shower doesn&#x27;t have a hook to hang the brush.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, I could scrub a tank with one. and yes I am as big as a tank. at least a pink one.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Came quickly and was just as described online.</li>
