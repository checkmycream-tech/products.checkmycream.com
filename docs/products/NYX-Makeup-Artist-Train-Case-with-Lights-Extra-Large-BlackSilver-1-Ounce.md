      <li>my girlfriend loved it - She loves make-up</li>
      <li>Package better!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok !</li>
      <li>it gives a nice presentation</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is true that the lights are not that bright, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the rating of this product at all.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better</li>
      <li>it don&#x27;t do much, more a mood</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>Secure the mirror!</li>
      <li>but it fits most of the stuff you need and it keeps it in place once you close it.</li>
      <li>and I need more space</li>
      <li>The product is not only great, but the shipping was really fast and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it seems i need one more.</li>
      <li>This is very cute, i am a professional makeup artist and it works really good for me.</li>
      <li>Received on time have had it since last year still very good</li>
      <li>we haven&#x27;t had any problems so far nothing has brokenand the packaging during the shipment was even great.</li>
      <li>It was easy to set up and everything was included.  </li>
      <li>Easy assembly, even came with light bulbs.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super cute...</li>
      <li>The light bulbs were included.</li>
      <li>You cant put a big amount of things in the interior but is great to put evertthibg</li>
      <li>I recommend this case for any makeup artist, it&#x27;s really help me to tidy my makeup products.</li>
      <li>The bulbs it comes with are cheap China brand</li>
      <li>then it feeling light and cheap.</li>
      <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a beautiful set up.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not packaging these right!</li>
      <li>This is good if you are wanting to have a personal set up in your studio or home</li>
      <li>It does look good though and thats the only praise i can give it</li>
      <li>Love this item, super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I sent out for a replacement unit which was sent quickly and received another damaged unit with a crack in the front of the case.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d advise just investing in better quality bulbs if you really want better quality as far as the bulbs .</li>
      <li>Great concept, but lugging a 70-80 pound up and down stairs is not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;The lights that come with</li>
      <li>At this point I don&#x27;t think its worth it to request yet another product and have it be defective.</li>
      <li>worth the price</li>
      <li>Otherwise its strong and professional!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very heavy but build quality in great and packaging was perfect.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty sturdy as well.</li>
      <li>and I hope it will be ok, but these are way to fragile to not have padding inside.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bought as a Christmas present for my daughter who I know will absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
      <li>My Girlfriend really wanted this for christmas!</li>
      <li>Good product, but one part was missing.........</li>
      <li>Seeing as your options are quite limited for this kind of product, i would go for it if you really really need a portable makeup station.</li>
      <li>The bulbs are only 40w and the max on the dimmer won&#x27;t make it bright enough to do any sort of makeup.</li>
      <li>On of the bars punched through to the front of the case causing a large crack in the front.&lt;br /&gt;I would have exchanged it if I had the time to</li>
      <li>only down side maybe the legs because I feel that it could be better but over all worth the $$$!!</li>
      <li>btw shipping was so fast</li>
      <li>and she absolutely LOVES it.  </li>
      <li>This was a Christmas gift and my wife was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it is a little heavy, it is very well built and she was able to check it in with the airline she was flying out with, no problem (and arrived almost in perfect condition at the other end of the world!)&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly there are two reinforcement bars on the sides of the main makeup tray that opens up.</li>
      <li>For such an expensive item, the shipping package should be more protected and the product should be made of a better quality.</li>
      <li>paid too much for a product that is really worth half the price</li>
      <li>Money worth spent.</li>
      <li>Mine arrived slightly damaged in one corner because of terribly basic packing as some other fellow reviewers have mentioned they are not packing these good enough.</li>

<li> The lights are alright but too yellow if prefer if it is white lights..it is heavy enough by itself imagine if u will put your makeup inside it then u will have to lift it up when the legs are set up so watch your back when u lift it up</li>
<li> Just a little foam to protect it is not enough for international shipping.</li>
<li> The space inside it limited</li>
<li> the quality of construction is well below average and the stands that are included are quite wobbly, i hope it does not collapse in the future....</li>
<li> only downside of the item itself is that i think the bulbs must be removed every time you are setting down.</li>
<li> I was skeptical after reading so many negative comments..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s about 20 pounds empty.</li>
<li> I only give this a 3 Star is bc of a small crack on the bottom of the mirror .</li>
<li> and im too lazy to ship it back and</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> Delivery time was speedy, arrived before expected deliver date with no damages!</li>
<li> I am extremely dissapointed in the product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m extremely dissapointed in the quality of shipping and product.</li>
<li> the build quality is not worth the price tag.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a little bit heavy</li>
<li> Heavy however.  </li>
<li> She loves it and uses it everyday.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really heavy</li>
<li> and I pulled up a few YouTube videos that would familiarize her with the makeup case.</li>
<li> heavy</li>
<li> however it is very heavy.</li>
<li> the quality and the shipping of the product is not very good.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very slick if you&#x27;re a make-up artist.</li>
<li> You would at least think NYX would have learned by now to put some bubble wrap in there at the very least.....</li>
<li> I must admit after reading a lot of bad reviews I was actually taking a chance on buying</li>
<li> I received the item and it was defective(wheel stopper broken and dented in two places).</li>
<li> Very disappointed for the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good product, but one part was missing.........</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took 5 days from US to UK!&lt;br /&gt;It is very heavy but build quality in great and packaging was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Bought as a Christmas present for my daughter who I know will absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> My daughter is a makeup artist and I got this for her birthday and she absolutely LOVES it.  It holds all of her products and serves as a mobile station when she goes out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really heavy but AMAZiNG!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;For those Makeup Artist as my self you must get this. The space inside it limited but it fits most of the stuff you need and it keeps it in place once you close it.</li>
    <li> This vanity case is amazing...super durable and met my expectations. Delivery time was speedy, arrived before expected deliver date with no damages!</li>
    <li> LOVE this!! It&#x27;s my favorite purchase for my freelance business and is very good quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-K</li>
    <li> Excellent !! Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after reading so many negative comments.. However I ordered because the pricing is $100 off of nyx website. I Love it!!! only downside of the item itself is that i think the bulbs must be removed every time you are setting down. Which becomes a hassle. Otherwise its strong and professional! Recommend it to freelance MUAs like me!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for my wife and she loves it. Arrived on time. Works reallly well. Money worth spent.</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist and getting this ligth case was wonderfull , it&#x27;s a little bit heavy and I need more space but it&#x27;s ok ! it gives a nice presentation definetly it&#x27;s a MUST HAVE !!! btw shipping was so fast Im so happy ❤️</li>
    <li> Great concept, but lugging a 70-80 pound up and down stairs is not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;The lights that come with it don&#x27;t do much, more a mood setter.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome if you have an in house studio though, the design is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s pretty sturdy as well.</li>
    <li> This is good if you are wanting to have a personal set up in your studio or home however it is very heavy. The lights are alright but too yellow if prefer if it is white lights..it is heavy enough by itself imagine if u will put your makeup inside it then u will have to lift it up when the legs are set up so watch your back when u lift it up</li>
    <li> I must admit after reading a lot of bad reviews I was actually taking a chance on buying this butmy girlfriend loves it and I pulled up a few YouTube videos that would familiarize her with the makeup case. we haven&#x27;t had any problems so far nothing has brokenand the packaging during the shipment was even great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very slick if you&#x27;re a make-up artist. my girlfriend loved it - She loves make-up and she loves this case! - Recommended if you or your girlfriend loves make-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side maybe the legs because I feel that it could be better but over all worth the $$$!!</li>
    <li> This is very cute, i am a professional makeup artist and it works really good for me. You cant put a big amount of things in the interior but is great to put evertthibg you need while you are working. The light bulbs were included.</li>
    <li> Everything came packaged well however the build quality is not worth the price tag. The bulbs are only 40w and the max on the dimmer won&#x27;t make it bright enough to do any sort of makeup. You&#x27;ll need to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;The unit they shipped me didn&#x27;t have have the Edison plug to plug into instead it was the European version.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly there are two reinforcement bars on the sides of the main makeup tray that opens up. On of the bars punched through to the front of the case causing a large crack in the front.&lt;br /&gt;I would have exchanged it if I had the time to and I didn&#x27;t need something ASAP. Very disappointed for the price.</li>
    <li> I recommend this case for any makeup artist, it&#x27;s really help me to tidy my makeup products. well i still have a lot and it seems i need one more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who lives abroad and was visiting here in the US. The product is not only great, but the shipping was really fast and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a little heavy, it is very well built and she was able to check it in with the airline she was flying out with, no problem (and arrived almost in perfect condition at the other end of the world!)&lt;br /&gt;It is true that the lights are not that bright, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the rating of this product at all.</li>
    <li> Seeing as your options are quite limited for this kind of product, i would go for it if you really really need a portable makeup station. My Girlfriend really wanted this for christmas! Be warned though! the quality and the shipping of the product is not very good. Mine arrived slightly damaged in one corner because of terribly basic packing as some other fellow reviewers have mentioned they are not packing these good enough. Just a little foam to protect it is not enough for international shipping. You would at least think NYX would have learned by now to put some bubble wrap in there at the very least.....????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid too much for a product that is really worth half the price and im too lazy to ship it back and hope for areplacement. My girlfriend will have to make do with it.....the quality of construction is well below average and the stands that are included are quite wobbly, i hope it does not collapse in the future....fingers crossed! It does look good though and thats the only praise i can give it</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife.  She loves it and uses it everyday.  It was easy to set up and everything was included.  The only thing I had to change was the power cord, as we are in Australia.  All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> I am extremely dissapointed in the product. I received the item and it was defective(wheel stopper broken and dented in two places). I sent out for a replacement unit which was sent quickly and received another damaged unit with a crack in the front of the case. This was a Christmas gift and my wife was really looking forward to using this product. I&#x27;m extremely dissapointed in the quality of shipping and product. At this point I don&#x27;t think its worth it to request yet another product and have it be defective. For such an expensive item, the shipping package should be more protected and the product should be made of a better quality.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not packaging these right! I received mine today and the mirror was in pieces! They&#x27;re sending me a replacement and I hope it will be ok, but these are way to fragile to not have padding inside.  Package better!  Secure the mirror! Other than that it&#x27;s super cute...Heavy however.  I cant  see myself traveling with this.  Any airline would charge you a fortune. It&#x27;s about 20 pounds empty.</li>
    <li> Received on time have had it since last year still very good</li>
    <li> Love this item, super fast delivery. Easy assembly, even came with light bulbs. Totally portable, or jist leave it set up like I do.</li>
    <li> Beautiful case . Bought this for my gf for our 2yr . I just opened it to inspect .Really heavy but it&#x27;s better then it feeling light and cheap. I only give this a 3 Star is bc of a small crack on the bottom of the mirror . The bulbs it comes with are cheap China brand so I&#x27;d advise just investing in better quality bulbs if you really want better quality as far as the bulbs . Other then that it&#x27;s a beautiful set up. Hope she likes it lol.</li>
