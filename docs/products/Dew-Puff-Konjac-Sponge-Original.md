      <li>I loved it so much</li>
      <li>I loved this so much</li>
      <li>I appreciate that this sponge has a very nice, almost jelly-like squishy texture that would be great for people who can&#x27;t use abrasive textures, but after using it religiously for two weeks straight (I stopped using my Clarisonic during those two weeks)</li>
      <li>Provides very gentle yet effective exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Very gentle , exfoliates nicely.</li>
      <li>I noticed on the one I got that the texture is not as fine as the texture on the Konjac brand sponges.</li>
      <li>This sponge still works just fine, it doesn&#x27;t feel any rougher.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect light exfoliator on days where you just want a little face cleanse.</li>

      <li>Awesome little sponge!</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re done using the sponge, the best you can do is try to squeeze it dry, but that doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>I have to say, this is a product that&#x27;s exactly as described and works as well (or perhaps better) than my Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>skin leaving it feeling it can breathe and look completely clean not feeling scrubbed to death.</li>
      <li>Cleans my face really nicely and makes my skin really soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a face towel to clean my face</li>

      <li>Some sugar or an actual scrub used lightly seems just as good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice sponge, but very soft.  </li>
      <li>i really with this product was better......</li>
      <li>It works like a nice smoother, but is soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I love it SOOO much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll make your skin feel ridiculously clean and at this price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try a different kind...</li>
      <li>I love the Dew Puff Konjac Sponge, I have even put it thru the washing machine and it still works like new.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face super soft and feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>My face has been much smoother and blemish free since I have been using it.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use.</li>

      <li>This little thing feels really nice!  </li>
      <li>Very gentle.</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>I have to remove my makeup first before using it,</li>
      <li>Very luxurious feel!</li>
      <li>Like butter smooth soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and soft!</li>
      <li>I use it with whatever cleanser I feel like using and it always gets that extra bit of makeup off and leaves my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times but so far I love it!</li>
      <li>It really makes a small amount of cleanser foam up very nicely and really removes all makeup and oil at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I liked this sponge for the first couple of days because it worked well and the whole process of using it all over my face was oddly therapeutic.</li>
      <li>Its super soft and gentle.</li>
      <li>Love the shape and feel when it is wet.</li>
      <li>This is a gentle exfoliating sponge.  </li>
      <li>I really like how it makes my face look and feel</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect much exfoliation from it.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this I was amazed at how soft my face was.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I think I had more dead skin,</li>
      <li>It does loose its original shape, but the effectiveness is still there.</li>
      <li>I get so nervous just thinking about all the bacteria that might live in that sponge.</li>
      <li>Never washing my face with my hands again, literally all i use and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think its worth the hassle of hanging it up to dry and whatnot.</li>
      <li>I had a Clarisonic, which recently broke, and in desperation, ordered the dew puff as hearing positive reviews regarding it.</li>
      <li>Will buy again, leaves my skin soft,  baby soft!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super interesting concept that it is made of plant and that it is hard until you wet it.</li>
      <li>But i&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now and my skin is clear now.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and acne prone.</li>
      <li>and it is still soft and completely cleans</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome! I love it SOOO much</li>
    <li> I really do not understand how this can scrub away dirt and leave my skin so soft because it is not abbrasive at ALL! I am used to using hard and abrassive prducts for the result this gives me. RECCOMEND!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this because I feel like it broke me out even more. My skin is sensitive and acne prone.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, leaves my skin soft,  baby soft!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I have sensitive skin and it is soft once it&#x27;s soaked in water. I&#x27;m going to buy more, because I&#x27;m happy with this product. And I love the fact it was shipped to my home very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this is a product that&#x27;s exactly as described and works as well (or perhaps better) than my Clarisonic.  Blasphemy, I know.  The only thing I will say is that if you overuse the konjac sponge, it will tear up your skin.  I like using it so often that this actually happened, so just be careful that you&#x27;re using it gently, once a day, tops.  It&#x27;ll make your skin feel ridiculously clean and at this price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle exfoliating sponge.  Great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love these puffs! I use in the morning &amp; evening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice sponge, but very soft.  Don&#x27;t expect much exfoliation from it.  I like that it is all natural as I prefer that to using a man made product.  Hang it up after each use.</li>
    <li> This little thing feels really nice!  When you wet it, it gets squishy and soft.  I use it in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t leave that tight &amp;#34;i need to put lotion on my face NOW&#x27; feeling.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> Never washing my face with my hands again, literally all i use and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love the Dew Puff Konjac Sponge, I have even put it thru the washing machine and it still works like new.  I loved it so much I bought another one for my Mom and two of the bath sponges.</li>
    <li> maybe it is just me, but the sponge didn&#x27;t last very long at all  - it started falling apart on me .&lt;br /&gt;i did like the softness of it though.</li>
    <li> best facial sponge I have ever used. wont be going back to a boring washcloth</li>
    <li> This is very good when  you want a thorough but gentle cleansing sponge, it softens but still through cleans your face but this&lt;br /&gt;is very good for a baby&#x27;s skin too because it&#x27;s gentle but thoroughly cleans the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want a deep clean removing dead skin cells I use the charcoal one it&#x27;s not too rough and it is still soft and completely cleans&lt;br /&gt;your skin leaving it feeling it can breathe and look completely clean not feeling scrubbed to death.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Konjac brand sponges and thought I&#x27;d try this one since it costs less. I noticed on the one I got that the texture is not as fine as the texture on the Konjac brand sponges. This sponge still works just fine, it doesn&#x27;t feel any rougher. I&#x27;ll probably still go back to the other brand when this one needs to be replaced. Hanging string is a tiny bit shorter.</li>
    <li> My skin looked better after 1 use-no kidding! I use it daily with water only. I have sensitive skin &amp; there is no irritation. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> I really love this sponge. It leaves my face super soft and feeling very clean. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Very gentle. I have to remove my makeup first before using it, though- it&#x27;s not powerful enough for that.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!! Very luxurious feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the dew puff! its so soft on my face. you can use it with or without a facial cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since I got it in the mail. I&#x27;ve been using a face towel to clean my face but I honestly wish I had found this sooner. I, myself feel that the dew puff cleans my face better. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I liked this sponge for the first couple of days because it worked well and the whole process of using it all over my face was oddly therapeutic. However, I stopped using it after I noticed small bumps (blocked pores?)  begin to appear on my skin. After that, I started washing it with soap following a use and hung it up to dry in a different location. I suppose you could continue to get mediocre results from using this sponge but I don&#x27;t think its worth the hassle of hanging it up to dry and whatnot. Some sugar or an actual scrub used lightly seems just as good and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out due to sanitation issues with this re-usable sponge. It&#x27;s not the sponge necessarily, because that can be an issue with any product you use to cleanse your skin but don&#x27;t throw into a washer or sorts. I won&#x27;t re-purchase and I think a washcloth or something abrasive used very lightly is also good if you want to avoid the possibility of breaking out.</li>
    <li> This one if good if you use a certain cleanser. my boyfriend uses this one and i have the charcoal one, the charcoal to me doesnt make a difference..</li>
    <li> Works really well! Better than my clarasonic in my opinion. Its soft on the skin yet you can feel how clean it makes your face.</li>
    <li> i saw this being averetised on youtube and i had to have it. for the price i think it is a rip off! i was not very gentle however i was using it as much and as often as i normally would with a facial sponge and 3 days into using it i noticed that it was tearing. tearing, and tearing and tearing, and by the 5th day of using it it was starting to leave a hole and when you touched it it left and weird mineral on my fingers like, if a babys dipar got wet and riped, it felt like that. also i did not like that it was not easy to dry between washing my face at night and then  again the next night the sponge was still wet. and even if you had a container to store it in a see it smelling like mildo. i really with this product was better......</li>
    <li> Awesome little sponge! Cleans my face really nicely and makes my skin really soft and smooth afterwards. Would highly recommend it. I like to use this in the morning and my clarisonic at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times but so far I love it! I use it with whatever cleanser I feel like using and it always gets that extra bit of makeup off and leaves my skin feeling super smooth. Seriously cannot beat this little tool for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this Dew Puff beyond words! It leaves your skin feeling clean and soft! I use mine with a mild soap and it seriously works wonders. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My skin is in love with this. I love using this instead of my hands because it is much more gentle on my skin. (And is it just as good as the 30 dollar ones I have seen in Sephora!)</li>
    <li> I am floored by how amazing this sponge is. I had a Clarisonic, which recently broke, and in desperation, ordered the dew puff as hearing positive reviews regarding it. My skin is not only extremely sensitive but extremely acne prone and I have seen my acne (in combination with a good face wash) diminish...it&#x27;s literally an amazing product that I am recommending quite often to friends. This product combined with a good face wash can really work wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my dew puff. I will be repurchasing. It&#x27;s a gentle but very effective exfoliate. ❤️</li>
    <li> For reference, I am around 20 years old and have combination skin with occasional acne and very occasional redness; my skin is usually rather well-behaved, and I use a Clarisonic twice a day. I appreciate that this sponge has a very nice, almost jelly-like squishy texture that would be great for people who can&#x27;t use abrasive textures, but after using it religiously for two weeks straight (I stopped using my Clarisonic during those two weeks), I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin. I think I had more dead skin, actually.&lt;br /&gt;What really bothered me was that keeping this thing bacteria free is basically impossible since it&#x27;s almost always damp - it&#x27;s like a loofah concept. I also dislike loofahs. When you&#x27;re done using the sponge, the best you can do is try to squeeze it dry, but that doesn&#x27;t do much. You&#x27;re forced to just hang a damp sponge somewhere in your bathroom, which is super humid by the way. I get so nervous just thinking about all the bacteria that might live in that sponge.</li>
    <li> Very gentle , exfoliates nicely. This one is softer than the black charcoal  puffs. Great for every day use Good product , great price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Still using it till this day. It&#x27;s still in good shape.</li>
    <li> Provides very gentle yet effective exfoliation. It really makes a small amount of cleanser foam up very nicely and really removes all makeup and oil at the end of the day. I love it.</li>
    <li> The product I got had a weird smell :(</li>
    <li> Love this konjac sponge for exfoliating my face.  Have been using every other day with a mild moisturizing cleanser, and can already feel a big difference in my skin after only a week of use.  Definitely recommend for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great for cleansing my face. My face has been much smoother and blemish free since I have been using it.</li>
    <li> Works great, lathers well, gentle.</li>
    <li> Love the shape and feel when it is wet. Gets the job done. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good size, has held up well. Not the biggest fan of the teardrop shape, but it does what it says and does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Feels so good on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing!!! i bought it after hearing about it on youtube.  I have to say, it&#x27;s one of my favorite purchases ever!!!</li>
    <li> Although I enjoyed using this sponge, it broke me out like crazy. It also took forever to dry out, main reason my I think mine broke me out.</li>
    <li> I loved this so much I bought one for all the girls in my family for Christmas!  It works like a nice smoother, but is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I was amazed at how soft my face was. Like butter smooth soft. I broke out the week I was using it but I was also using other products so it could be from that. But i&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks now and my skin is clear now. I really like how it makes my face look and feel and it really removes all my face makeup with a light exfoliation. Its super soft and gentle.</li>
    <li> This feels really nice! It&#x27;s a super interesting concept that it is made of plant and that it is hard until you wet it. It&#x27;s the perfect light exfoliator on days where you just want a little face cleanse.</li>
    <li> I struggle with acne, and the unfortunate dry skin that follows it. Since switching to the dew puff, I&#x27;ve experienced slightly better skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as raw. I&#x27;ve been using the sponge for about a month now and its giving the same, soft wash every time. It does loose its original shape, but the effectiveness is still there. I&#x27;m excited to try a different kind... the bamboo or the charcoal.</li>
