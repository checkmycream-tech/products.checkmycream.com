      <li>more to say about this product.</li>
      <li>Love it and the watch.</li>
      <li>This stuff is nothing more than KY Jelly in a tube.  </li>
      <li>makes machine work better</li>
      <li>its ok did not hold the pads well as I would have thought but worked ok</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed more accuracy with my heart rate monitor since using this product.</li>
      <li>I am wearing a heart monitor and needed more conductive gel for the electrode patches.  </li>
      <li>Some folks are more conductive than others as are pads.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>more can one say?  </li>
      <li>See below for more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this gel to help the chest strap of my HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) to work better, to start working quicker and to produce a more accurate result.</li>
      <li>Best of all it works... I&#x27;ve not had a single drop in connection between the transmitter on the chest strap to the HRM receiver (watch) on my wrist.</li>
      <li>I use this in conjunction with my Polar FT4 monitor and it has worked perfectly every time.</li>
      <li>It works better than water and one doesn&#x27;t need to wait until a sweat is worked up to get accurate readings.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more comfortable to use the gel than splash water on the strap and yourself before heading out for a run in the winter.</li>
      <li>Definitely good for intense workouts.</li>
      <li>Rinses easily with water afterwards.</li>
      <li>Washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>Washes off easily.</li>
      <li>Washes off easily.</li>

      <li>This product normally does a good job of providing contact between my chest and heart monitor&#x27;s chest strap.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works really well with my Polar F4.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly how described. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was very frustrated trying to get consistent heart readings while bicycling in cold weather. At the start of the ride I would get nothing.  Once I was warm enough to sweat, I&#x27;d get something.  NONE of the readings were as good as summertime readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the very first cold weather ride with Spectra on my heartband, I got readings as consistent as my best summer readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for cold weather biking... but I use it all the time now!</li>
    <li> I received my Spectra 360 Electrode Gel in a timely manner and am using it with my Alpha Stim micro-stimulator electrodes. It works to keep the electrodes in place and improves the conductivity of the current. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank God!  FINALLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Garmin Forerunner, I decided, just hates me.  After a grueling workout it tells me I&#x27;ve burned 38 calories.  Tried wetting it, all kinds of ways, I yelled at it, threatened it, called it names, put it on time out, considered giving it to a GPS/HRM orphanage....nothing worked. I&#x27;m obsessed with the numbers...distance, time, calories....so I decided to try this stuff out before I ended up in therapy.&lt;br /&gt;So when I tried this, I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to put on.  I under-applied the first time and ended up with another &amp;#34;38 calorie&amp;#34; burn.  I thought I&#x27;d try it one more time before I took to drinking heavily.  The second time, I gooped it on, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  After my run/bike workout, the results were in.  2,300 calories burned.&lt;br /&gt;Alrighty then.  We have a winner!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Garmin and I are getting along splendidly these days, our relationship is strong, honest and expressive.  As long as Parker Gel is on the electrodes, we are a force to be seen.  Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> It worked okay with my abb electrodes</li>
    <li> as advertised, huge tube of it</li>
    <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t know how anyone could go without this stuff.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Made in the USA. Works just like you need it to with just a little dab. Some folks are more conductive than others as are pads. If you&#x27;ve got issues, this is the stuff you need.</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Is as product states.</li>
    <li> If you use a heart rate monitor for health or measuring workout statistics this gel is worth its weight in gold.  I use a Polar F11 heart rate monitor.  Before using the gel, I would have inconsistent connections at the start of my cycling or elliptical workouts (before generating any sweat) and interruptions in connection after 2 hours or so of riding.  I would try to adjust the chest strap while riding (dangerous) and this sometimes would work, sometimes not.  If you are really into maintaining accurate records of your workouts this is frustrating.  I tried a new chest strap, replacement batteries in strap and receiver but this was not the root cause.  I purchased an 8.5 oz tube of this gel and have been using it for 10 months.  I wet the chest strap with warm water and apply a one inch line onto the two chest contact strips.  I also place a dot onto each of the transmitters buttons before snapping it onto the front of the chest strap.  Then I put on the strap- no need to have it fit tight.  I have used the gel over 200 times for roughly 350 hours and have not had a single lost connection- not one.  The gel is easily removed with water and does not stain nylon/spandex/cotton based fabrics.  It also does not adversely affect the strap or contact points of the transmitter.  At this point I have only used about an ounce.  The tube has a beefy screw cap which prevents water from evaporating out of an opened tube.  The 8.5 oz tube will last a long long time. If you use a heart rate monitor and want consistent operation BUY this gel.</li>
    <li> Good product for extending Electrodes longer than normal.</li>
    <li> works great on my TENS unit</li>
    <li> My big tube of electrode gel just came in.  It is a lot of gel for the money and the gel works good.  (I&#x27;m using some now as I am writing this to check out the FT4 HRM.)  I gave it a 3 out of 5 because the bottom of the tube is not sealed and I&#x27;m going to have to find something else to put all of this gel in so I can keep the air from getting to it.  So, the gel is good.  The tube ...not so good.  It&#x27;s Bush&#x27;s fault no doubt.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use with my Polar FT7 heart rate monitor. The tube is large and will probably last me for years since only a dime size amount is needed. Goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Washes off easily. Best of all it works... I&#x27;ve not had a single drop in connection between the transmitter on the chest strap to the HRM receiver (watch) on my wrist.</li>
    <li> Great not only for chest straps but for hand contacts on your treadmill.  Just wash or wipe off what is left when you are finished... even that is not necessary.</li>
    <li> A good product at a fair price. It does what it is designed to do.</li>
    <li> Im going to school to be a Personal trainer and bought an ems machine to stimulate my muscles after workouts. The electrode gel ran out fast..so I thought, why not buy a bottle? Wrong move. For anyone using any sort of diffibulator machine with electrodes, knows this. Within 3 uses of the gel, not only did it not stick and was slimy, it took off the pad. This is great if you like to get zapped and stung by electricity from the pads not full sticking. No thanks. Buy the replacement pads!!!! They are cheap. I already got some on their way.</li>
    <li> You probably will not need to use this with your heart rate monitor for most exercise programs but if your torso moves a lot - like when you are climbing - or if you use a weight vest it may save you some aggravation. Also if you are using Polar&#x27;s \\&quot;wearlink\\&quot;, revertng to the old style t31 coded belt is an enormous help.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know I needed this until amazon suggested it under &amp;#34;frequently bought together&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m glad I got it. my heart rate is being tracked throughout all my workouts (yoga, hot yoga, Pilates, cycling outside, spinning, barre). Great addition to my heart rate monitor (which is the Polar FT4)</li>
    <li> Good price, Works as it says</li>
    <li> The gel does an excellent job ensuring that I get a strong heart beat signal every time. Previous to using the gel, getting a heart beat signal was hit or miss, especially after the transmitter strap had been used a while.</li>
    <li> The Spectra 360 Electrode Gel came in a lovely large tube.  I am wearing a heart monitor and needed more conductive gel for the electrode patches.  The gel turned to runny liquid on my skin and ruined the patches.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this again.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong product, as the gel from the hospital was thick and sticky, and stayed in place.  Just my experience.</li>
    <li> Use for my polar heart band and I feel it gives great results.</li>
    <li> Good product, need just a dab on each electrode</li>
    <li> Have only had to use it once so far, it is great stuff.</li>
    <li> Good product, shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> Parker Laboratories Spectra 360 Electrode Gel is Awesome, I use it daily for my training runs. It is quick apply and a little goes along way. my HR chest strap is automatically recognized by my Garmin 310XT and 420. I own both the old tradition Garmin Chest Strap and the new Premium HR Strap.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my polar Ft7 watch and heart rate monitor and so far I have not had any problems. A little goes a long way on the band. I am happy I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> caused reaction to my skin</li>
    <li> Works great with my polar FT 4</li>
    <li> I thought it would be gooey but it&#x27;s not bad. Love it and the watch.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Great! Been using it for weeks now.... Huge tube will last for ages. I use it for my Heart Rate Monitor. A tiny BB size dollop on each contact is all you need. It&#x27;s bluish due to the copper infusion. No need to &amp;#34;lick&amp;#34; or wait till you sweat. I get an instant response from my HRM.  After sweating, it seems to wipe away easy and is not building up on the strap! Good solubility.  You&#x27;ll be happy you use the right amount!.</li>
    <li> I am getting more stable and reliable readings from my heart rate monitor when using this product without any mess.</li>
    <li> Large tube, probably won&#x27;t have to buy again for a long time.</li>
    <li> Keeps my Polar FT7 HRM nice and wet, and helps the electrode band to not slip around too much.  Definitely good for intense workouts.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this gel if you use electrode pads--it will extend their life substantially and it is very easy to use.  See below for more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with the Spectra 360 gel.  I use an Intelect Legend Combo with eight pads going per sitting on the interferential mode.  Needless to say, I go through pads very quickly.  The gel, of which you only need to apply a dollop and spread evenly on the pad with the tip of your finger, rejuvenated the pads leaving their &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; as good as new or better.  I&#x27;ve already applied the gel twice to the same set of pads and see no reason why I can&#x27;t carry on for a good while.  Whereas a set of pads lasted a couple of weeks, I can see them lasting four/six times as much.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time believing anyone would ever have any issues with this gel.  I lube up my HRM belt every time I hit my rower and I never have any issues whatsoever.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with the gel staining clothes either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can one say?  It works!</li>
    <li> Works well, large tube will last a long time. Washes off easily.</li>
    <li> Use for a Polar FT4 heart rate monitor. Picks up reading right away!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with a tens machine.  The pads that came with it had lost all their stickiness.  You just add a dab of this gel to the pads and spread it around and your good to go again.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue behind.  It&#x27;s also a good sized tube for the money.</li>
    <li> Does the job for pennies on the dollar. Enables me to keep using the electrodes after their original adhesive has worn off.</li>
    <li> I use it for my heart rate monitor. Never had a problem with it. I highly recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
    <li> With this gel I get accurate pulse readouts from the very beginning of each workout.  It works better than water and one doesn&#x27;t need to wait until a sweat is worked up to get accurate readings.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a supplement to the Slendertone Belt.  Didn&#x27;t really need it - didn&#x27;t know that at the time of purchase.  It&#x27;s a gel.</li>
    <li> Got this to increase adhesive ness and strength of pads on electric stimulation massager unit (TENS).  Works, increases longevity of pads and u get a good amount too.</li>
    <li> if you need gel for electrodes then this is a good option it is the same like they use in the hospitals and clinics</li>
    <li> The gel is excellent and is used on knee stimulators for people who are trying to build up the cartlage in their knees.</li>
    <li> I have for several years experienced problems with chest monitors because of poor contact. Once I started using Spectra 360 I have never experienced lost or loww contact.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my Polar FT4 monitor and it has worked perfectly every time. You only need a very tiny amount to get the job done and it has lasted every work out I&#x27;ve had and some have been in excess of three hours. This tube will last you a very long time. I also have sensitive skin and I had no issues as far as breaking out or rashes.</li>
    <li> I use it for a heart rate monitor for exercise machines and it makes the sensor very reliable.</li>
    <li> If you wear a chest strap heart monitor, you need to get some of this.  Work way better than water and the strap doesn&#x27;t chaff as bad.</li>
    <li> So glad I purchased the gel to go with my HR monitor. It really helps keep the reading accurate during a heavy workout.  I thought the gel would be a little goopy, but not much is needed, and I can hardly tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I used this for electrodes and it works perfectly.  It is not as slimy as another product that I used and it conducts the pads very well.</li>
    <li> I have one of those Slim Tone Abs  and the Flex Mini muscle Toning systems.  This gel extends the life of the replacement pads....</li>
    <li> works well......being used with the breast enhancer massager.  Hospital grade gel.</li>
    <li> Got this for my heart rate monitor strap because just using water was causing my signal to be lost in the middle of my workouts. So annoying. Using this instead, works like a charm.</li>
    <li> The product is great.</li>
    <li> Has helped prolong the life of the pads, since I don&#x27;t want to constantly purchase replacement pads. I would defiantly purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, package is perfect, do not waste product by its elongated dispenser. And is really cheep</li>
    <li> The gel is very helpful in maintaining a consistent signal from my heart rate monitor even through strenuous movement and extreme perspiration.</li>
    <li> Would have loved it but found out it wasn&#x27;t the gel I thought it was. Works though...</li>
    <li> I have never bought any other electrode gel before so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does work well and really makes the pads stay on</li>
    <li> Enough to last for a while,(trust me) over all not bad .</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older my skin has dried out.  In a particularly dry climate the heart rate monitor I wear when working out malfunctions because my skin will not conduct the signal to the monitor sensors.  I purchased this Electrode Gel to see if it would solve the problem.  Voila.  Problem solved.</li>
    <li> Problems with erratic Heart Rate from my Polar watch are finally solved with this. No need to even have to tighten the strap as much as I needed to before.</li>
    <li> used it with garmin heart rate monitor. working like a charm. thanks</li>
    <li> This product works excellent for my heart rate chest sensor. It does not leave any sticky or  any other unusual residue after removal. Rinses easily with water afterwards. I immediately noticed more accuracy with my heart rate monitor since using this product. Highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit on my garmin chest band and it detects my heart rate right away, will last forever.</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome.  It has increased  the intensity of the pads on my TENS unit.  Wish I had discovered it sooner! Great price and value!!</li>
    <li> works exactly as expected...prior to using my HR monitor would not pickup my heartrate until I started sweating...so sometimes I would miss the first date from the 1st 15 minutes (or more depending on how cold it was outside) of my ride, which then skews the ride data.  Now, my HR is picked up from the moment I put the chest strap on.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Seriously...why didn&#x27;t anyone ever tell me about this??  I was shopping on Amazon for a new polar when I found out about Spectra 360.  Sorry, Amazon!  But I was able to save $179 but NOT buying a new Polar...but by spending a few bucks on this gel.  I had become completely frustrated with my Polar because I could never get a good heart rate reading.  I had followed all of Polar&#x27;s instructions, but I&#x27;d look at my watch and see a heart rate of 214...then suddenly it would be 0.  Did I just die??!  Ever since I found out about Spectra and started using it, my Polar has accurately read my heart rate from the moment I put it on.  I wet the chest strap first with water and then apply a thin layer of the Spectra 360 on each.  Then I add a dab to each of the electrode thingys before snapping it into place.  Works amazing!  I used to spend up to 30 minutes cleaning, wetting, anything in order to get my old Polar to read my heart rate.  Now, for the past two months, I just use the gel and I&#x27;m off and running!</li>
    <li> This product is anazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anazing seller- will be returning. :)</li>
    <li> This is a really good electrode gel.  It really works well.  I&#x27;m using it for my blood electrification unit.  It is a large tube and will last me a long time.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Use it on a heart monitor for working out. Purchased because it was suggested, but I don&#x27;t really think it is necessary.</li>
    <li> I use this gel for exercising with a Polar Heart Rate Monitor. It worked well for the first couple of weeks of use, but then I started having trouble getting the HR Monitor to pick up my heart rate reliably. I found that wetting the electrodes of the heart rate monitor was necessary before applying the gel in order to get a consistent reading right from the start of my exercising workout. Then i found that by holding the electrodes under running water i did not even need the gel at all. THat is the trick - you have to get the elctrodes fully emersed in water, not just damp on the surface. Get them soaking wet through and through. I have found that doing this works every time (for over a year now) and i have not used the gel since. Try it, you might just discover that the gel isn&#x27;t necessary, and water emersion works even more reliably than the gel. Note: when i am outside and not near running water, i just douse the electrodes with a little water from my water bottle.</li>
    <li> Works well for the Polar chest heart-rate tracker.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Fast ship.  Thanks much</li>
    <li> I only use it on the electrodes that are on the top or a shoulder, or anywhere they are forced to bend sharply, causing the electrode to NOT stay attached or at least partially pull away from the body.  This is a BIG tube and therefore will cost almost nothing per electrode.  No complaints with this at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gel for my Garmin heart rate monitor.  This gel works perfectly and prevents the bad readings that I was getting before using it.  I only use two drops per ride so this giant tube will last for years.</li>
    <li> Used this with a slender tone belt to help the electro whatever pass better into the muscle lol it makes the pads last a lot longer and I think it increases the effectiveness of the belt!</li>
    <li> Great stuff--if you keep getting that &amp;#34;check the transmitter&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;no signal&amp;#34; message on your wrist receiver, this will fix it.  Gives you good contact between skin and chestband to make sure the wrist unit picks up your heart rate.  Washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue.  It is advertised as not containing salt, which I suppose is a good thing, although I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re likely to eat it anyway.  I suppose it&#x27;s like saying bottled water doesn&#x27;t contain caffeine.  Go figger.</li>
    <li> I applied it to the tens electro pads covering the whole pad, very thin application then I set the pads back in their plastic for a day. By the next day they were sticky. Works great! I use my tens unit every other day.</li>
    <li> Great when using an exercise heart rate monitor in situations where you don&#x27;t make enough sweat for the electrodes to have consistent contact. I live in a cold climate and several months out of the year run in temperatures a little below freezing.  Without this gel it took 10-15 minutes to work up enough of a sweat for the HRM to read. Using just a small smear on each contact makes the HRM read consistently from the very start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Polar T31 strap but expect results would be similar for any other HRM of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that&#x27;s needed is a tiny bit on each electrode. This tube has lasted several months and will probably be enough for a year or even more. On a per-use basis that&#x27;s about (counts on fingers and toes...) uh, pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nothing more than KY Jelly in a tube.  There is NOTHING sticky about this product. Don&#x27;t use it on electrode pads, or your pads will be ruined immediately.  Extremely disappointed in the hype.</li>
    <li> It works great and it does what it says.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use with my pulse monitor. Works great, and large size at a great price! I also like that the tube is very thick and durable, with a very secure screw-on cap. I keep it in my gym bag, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming open while being jostled about in the bag.  The product works great for conductivity with the pulse monitor. Very clean, not sticky and only a tiny amount needed. Very happy with this purchase! :)</li>
    <li> makes machine work better</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my NuFace.  I had an allergic reaction from the gel that came with the NuFace.  This gel works well, and is much cheaper than NuFace&#x27;s brand.  I&#x27;m very happy that I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble getting the pads to last. My friend told me about gel products.&lt;br /&gt;Still not happy, I almost gave up on using them until I ordered this product. It works GREAT.</li>
    <li> Works better than water or saliva.  With this gel, if I don&#x27;t get great HR tracking, I know it&#x27;s the batteries in the chest strap or watch.  When those are good, the HR is picked up solid.  It is easy to clean off which you should do after every use.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Product as described</li>
    <li> Always a great deal. Tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Really extends the life of the pads for my TENS unit.  Just a small amount spread on the pad and it sticks like crazy.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this with my NuFACE and its great. A lot cheaper than the gel NuFACE sells and it lasts longer as well.</li>
    <li> This is super and last a long time, love it! The cost is very good and will order more when needed.</li>
    <li> Amazing just amazing!! must buy with a polar watch.</li>
    <li> I was using the jell that came with the hair removal device. I took a chance and bought this here at Amazon and it is far superior. The elect. pads cling better to my face and convey the current through the hair shaft better, I can feel it even, not in a bad way but a better tingle deep in hair shaft.</li>
    <li> I bought this gel to help the chest strap of my HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) to work better, to start working quicker and to produce a more accurate result. It works, but really no better or faster than water, and it is messier than water. It leaves a residue that needs to be removed. Water is still the best solution for me.</li>
    <li> My first mile heart rate was always whacky.  254 -- I&#x27;m not a hummingbird!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a drop of this gel on each side of the strap my first mile heart rate was back in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run 300 times a year and I expect the tube to last multiple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have purchased this years ago.</li>
    <li> It  works great  with the eletro pads and gives it the stickiness to  stay and work well. I  recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of colder weather bike riding.  This product normally does a good job of providing contact between my chest and heart monitor&#x27;s chest strap.  However, when riding into a strong March/April wind or when riding down a steep hill, the contact can be lost.  As the weather has warmed, the product works great.  This is a huge container and is too big to carry on your bike.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Very inexpensive, fast delivery and works well.</li>
    <li> But be careful and don&#x27;t use too much.  If you let it get too sloppy it will short from one electrode to the other.  So just use a small dollop at each electrode location.</li>
    <li> Non-sticky and allows the tense to work well.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for a friend. I also purchased the Timex heart monitor watch for this gel. Hope my friend uses it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this gel for my tense unit. I activated an old back injury, I have to use the unit every other day. The tense unit requires the usage of the electrode gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago when originally had my back injury I had to do the same thing. At that time the electrode gel cost an arm and a leg and it came in a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place your could buy it was through an equine or vets office. Now you can buy it from a medical supply site on the internet and it costs a fraction of the old price. The size of the old tubes were 50 grams. The tube I just received is 250 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and I am extremely satisfied with it. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my heart rate monitor chest strap. I have never used the HRM without the gel, and I don&#x27;t plan to. I have a strong, steady signal/connection through all of my workouts every time. Cleanup is a breeze - I usually just wipe it off and don&#x27;t bother with water - and don&#x27;t feel any residue.</li>
    <li> its ok did not hold the pads well as I would have thought but worked ok</li>
    <li> i am comparing this to the tac gel. the use of this is not sticky u don&#x27;t have to wait to dry and it won&#x27;t burn or leave scars from the electrodes.</li>
    <li> works great with all my stim products</li>
    <li> This is one amazing gel. Finally find something that stops chafing and burning due to friction on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to stop the chest chafing and burning from your heart rate monitor, and at the same time, keep sending signals, this gel its THE THING for it.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey but definitely meet expectations pretty well. Next october we will test the gel on Las Vegas Silverman, ill tell you how it went.</li>
    <li> Helps the heart rate monitor pick up my heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I used this gel with my Polar FT4 Heart Rate Monitor watch. Ordinary water doesn&#x27;t seem to get the watch to register my heart rate. This gel does the trick and works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really an expert. Are there any other better electrode gels? I don&#x27;t know. But this works for what I got it for!</li>
    <li> Works for what I needed.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty much essential for heart monitors.  I never lose connection when I use this!</li>
    <li> I had problems with my heart rate strap. I would put water on it and it would not read correctly or not at all. I ordered another strap, same thing. Gave this a shot. No problems since.</li>
    <li> Cheap and got the job done.</li>
    <li> Brought my polar watch heart rate monitor back to life!!! Highly recommend if your watch is not picking up on heart rate.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> you sure get a lot for your money with this. It&#x27;s a huge tube that will probably last me forever... i use it on my heartrate sensor - you only need a single drop on each of the two areas that I&#x27;m guessing read your pulse. with running 2-3 times a week I don&#x27;t see when I&#x27;ll every need to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I never had any connection issues using these and the gel is not sticky or greasy - so no complaints.</li>
    <li> Stuff works great. Not smelly, greasy or obnoxious in any way. Seems a bit more than I&#x27;ll ever need but a great value and too much sure beasts too little. Spit is disgusting.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Been having trouble with my polar heart rate monitor not reading but got this and it helps out a lot with accurate readings</li>
    <li> I use the Parker Lab gel for my heart rate strap while cycling.  It helps the strap pick up my heart rate and cuts down on errors.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great, product.  I use this with my heart rate monitor to make sure that I have a good connection to the HRM strap - especially at the start of the workout and in colder winter weather.  It&#x27;s much more comfortable to use the gel than splash water on the strap and yourself before heading out for a run in the winter.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I would rather have purchased two smaller ones but this will work.  I use just a little bit each time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with inconsistent Heart Rate (HR) readings using an ANT+ HR strap. I would find that may workouts would begin with abnormal or completely missing Heart Rates. Using just a small dab of this stuff seems to have completely solved the issue.  I use both a Garmin Premium Soft Strap and a Bontrager HR strap. This size (8.5oz) should last well over a year and I exercise 6-7 hours per week, roughly 9 workouts that would use this.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a ABS Belt, and it worked, nothing special. It lasted around a month so it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s gel just like the pros use but a cheaper price parker electrope gel does the job a must have for all your electro needs.</li>
    <li> This item is something I buy often.&lt;br /&gt;Really a cool product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Get some soon..They are running low..&lt;br /&gt;No more to say about this product.</li>
