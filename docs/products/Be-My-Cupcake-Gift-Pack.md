      <li>Honestly i cant choose between the two yet.</li>
      <li>Lmao.</li>
      <li>i willstick to try and amake my own.</li>
      <li>The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old thought these were awesome!</li>
      <li>The packaging was adorable as well.</li>
      <li>The bath bombs were ok.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>The frosting on the top doesn&#x27;t dissolve and isn&#x27;t soap or anything.  </li>
      <li>Completely satisfied with both quality of product and shipping.</li>
      <li>These were just okay.</li>
      <li>these smell good exept for when you put them right to you</li>
      <li>Bought this as a gift for my 23 yr old daughter and she loved it!  </li>
      <li>The grand kids love them and what a way to get clean</li>
      <li>If you never had lush these may be good for you</li>
      <li>Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good.</li>
      <li>From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My little girl loved them!</li>
      <li>Great scents and overall of very high quality.</li>
      <li>Great to give individually as little hospitality gifts or friendship gifts.</li>
      <li>but in this case were worth it.</li>
      <li>Once you consider you can get lush ones a dollar more per bomb, you feel robbed.</li>
      <li>so i actually took a bite of the top part.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re gonna shell out the cash, get lush and not these cheap knock</li>
      <li>The icing on the cupcakes did not fizz.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful scents created a relaxing experience and the pretty colors added another sensory dimension.</li>
      <li>Cheap alternative to LUSH USA.  </li>
      <li>She said it is so pretty</li>
      <li>product comes with more packaging than actual usable product.</li>
      <li>They melted too quickly and didn&#x27;t really make the water smell much.</li>
      <li>The top part doesn&#x27;t fizz and takes a long time to melt or disintegrate.</li>
      <li>much easier and cheaper</li>
      <li>It felt like a real rip off.</li>
      <li>And as a guy I don&#x27;t really do baths.  </li>
      <li>Great for kids; not so much for adults; plus the frosting is weird as it does not dissolve or anything.</li>
      <li>Only reason she used a second was to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a faulty bath bomb.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend seller and product line.</li>
      <li>My wife has a drawer with 100$&#x27;s of Lush bath oils, bombs, bubblebars, etc.</li>
      <li>But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience.</li>
      <li>When she gets out of a lush bath, I want to lick her from head to toe</li>
      <li>/&gt;They look cute, but are not worth anywhere near the money spent.</li>
      <li>they smell too much like strong citric acid~aND THEY ARE VERY SMALL for what you pay for like really tiny  </li>
      <li>I wrapped each individual cupcake in clear cellophane with a tulle bow and gave them as favors at a luncheon.  </li>
      <li>These barely fizzed and the tops don&#x27;t disintegrate.  </li>
      <li>Also, the &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34; soap in ours looked like a little hotel soap, not the interesting green chunk shown in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>From both standpoints, male and female, I would just stick to lush.</li>
      <li>Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something.</li>
      <li>The product itself fell a little short, but the price was very affordable, so</li>

    <li> Horrible.  These barely fizzed and the tops don&#x27;t disintegrate.  Once you consider you can get lush ones a dollar more per bomb, you feel robbed.</li>
    <li> Cheap alternative to LUSH USA.  I mean if you can even really compare anything to lush...  Smells aren&#x27;t as fragrant.  The frosting on the top doesn&#x27;t dissolve and isn&#x27;t soap or anything.  My wife has a drawer with 100$&#x27;s of Lush bath oils, bombs, bubblebars, etc. and I wanted to see how these compared...  She used 2 cupcakes and gave the rest away.  Only reason she used a second was to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a faulty bath bomb.  If you&#x27;re gonna shell out the cash, get lush and not these cheap knock offs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess she&#x27;s spoiled.  And as a guy I don&#x27;t really do baths.  If you never had lush these may be good for you but I can tell you this...  When she gets out of a lush bath, I want to lick her from head to toe she smells so good.  After these cupcake baths it was a kinda chemically/artifically taste I can&#x27;t explain.  From both standpoints, male and female, I would just stick to lush.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My 4 year old thought these were awesome!</li>
    <li> The bath bombs were ok.  They don&#x27;t perform as well as I thought they would.  The packaging was nice and the shipping was great.  The product itself fell a little short, but the price was very affordable, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with both quality of product and shipping.</li>
    <li> Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> These were just okay. They melted too quickly and didn&#x27;t really make the water smell much.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful product, Very decorative and smell wonderful. Almost a shame to use them!  Highly recommend seller and product line.</li>
    <li> these smell good exept for when you put them right to you nose they burn my nostrals it scares me too take a bath with them they smell too much like strong citric acid~aND THEY ARE VERY SMALL for what you pay for like really tiny  i willstick to try and amake my own. much easier and cheaper and i know what goes int them~</li>
    <li> Great for kids; not so much for adults; plus the frosting is weird as it does not dissolve or anything.</li>
    <li> These were darling!  I wrapped each individual cupcake in clear cellophane with a tulle bow and gave them as favors at a luncheon.  The ladies raved over them! They looked darling and smelled delectable! A little pricey but in this case were worth it. Great to give individually as little hospitality gifts or friendship gifts.</li>
    <li> The grand kids love them and what a way to get clean</li>
    <li> These bath fizzies were good except for one thing.The icing on the cupcakes did not fizz.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful scents created a relaxing experience and the pretty colors added another sensory dimension.</li>
    <li> Very cute bath bombs that smell great! The packaging was adorable as well. My little girl loved them! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my 23 yr old daughter and she loved it!  She said it is so pretty she almost didn&#x27;t want to use it.  She said everything arrived intact and adorable!</li>
    <li> Inspired us to make our own! Great scents and overall of very high quality.</li>
    <li> Save your money. These are not very good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my daughter. They barely fizzed, and the plastic (we thought it was soap, but it appears not to be) &amp;#34;frosting&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t break down or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with more packaging than actual usable product. Also, the &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34; soap in ours looked like a little hotel soap, not the interesting green chunk shown in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look cute, but are not worth anywhere near the money spent. It felt like a real rip off.</li>
    <li> Ok. I was new to Bath Bombs just late last year so i went on a testing spree. This review will be the same for each one except the stars will be different.&lt;br /&gt;Ok. From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two best choices are Lush(only one I&#x27;m reviewing not sold on amazon) and Moon&#x27;s Harvest Bath &amp; Body Shop. Honestly i cant choose between the two yet. But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next. This one. Blissful Bath and Lather and Fizz Bath Boutique. These i think are the same company. Both are a 3 1/2 to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last on my recommended list of good reviews is Level Naturals. They are great quality. My problem is they are small as idk what. Like golf ball or smaller. I had to use 2 at a time which is why im giving them a 3. Scents are Earthy which i like. If they increase the size and keep the same quality, id have them at a 4 with the 2 above. Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good. Which would bring these to a second place(not a tie with the ones above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience. Ps. The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc. what you expect from a bath bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Naturals and Village Naturals are the worse. I give them 1 star. Enough said. They are not in the game anymore. I used all 3 village ones that come in that pack at the same time and it still didnt come to a 2 star level. Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something. Ok. Thats all. Time to copy and paste this to all the others. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add on this one. The top part doesn&#x27;t fizz and takes a long time to melt or disintegrate. Um....lol. It smelled good so i actually took a bite of the top part. I don&#x27;t think its edible. Lmao. But it wasn&#x27;t nasty. Correction, i took 2 bites. I was curious because i think i read Sugar in the ingredients and i was wondering if it was a candy treat or something. Lol. Don&#x27;t judgeme. Lol</li>
