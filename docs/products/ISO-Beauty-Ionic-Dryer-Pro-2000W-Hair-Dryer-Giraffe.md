    <li> I like this ionic dryer.  It is good-looking and not to heavy.  It is a good dryer to straighten curly hair (with an ionic brush) and a good dryer when I want to leave my hair curly.  The only problem I have is that I had to search the world over to find a diffuser that fit.</li>

    <li> I was very excited when this cute hair dryer arrived.  It is light and pretty and came with two nozzles.  Unfortunately, the heat is inconsistent.  I set it on the hottest and highest setting and one moment it is hot the next barely warm.  Needless to say, takes longer to dry hair this way.  After a few months, the dryer just stopped working and will not turn on.  I have contacted Iso Pro and will update as to their customer service.  Needless to say, I will not recommend nor buy another Iso Pro dryer again.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> LOVE this blow dryer! Works fast and has multiple settings!</li>
