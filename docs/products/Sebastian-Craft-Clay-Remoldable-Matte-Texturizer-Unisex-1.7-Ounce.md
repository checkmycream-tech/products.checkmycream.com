      <li>Why do they discontinue good products??</li>
      <li>It has good hold</li>
      <li>basically, this is a good product.</li>
      <li>I loved my hair after that.  </li>
      <li>I was hopeful that it was as good as their &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>, It&#x27;s very  satisfying to use it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beatriz</li>
      <li>To make it work as good, you have to use more of it to get the spikey effect with good hold, but you can get the job done with it.</li>
      <li>i love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Works great, and is easily remoldable when needed.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s absolutely amazing</li>
      <li>so basically i thought it was an amazing product</li>
      <li>Easy to use, practical results, amazing look!</li>
      <li>they look good on drawings, but they dont look good on real life.)</li>
      <li>Not the kind of strong hold wax to use for spiking hair, etc..</li>
      <li>The nice thing about it is, it is easy to work and mold, but still holds it&#x27;s shape after you put it in place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enjoy it!</li>
      <li>Way better than any Gatsby products.</li>
      <li>Would work for most people</li>
      <li>Most store products seem waxy.</li>
      <li>I was able to find it on Amazon.com</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>It doesnt feel like theres anything in my hair, works better than hairspray, gel, anything.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of got a smooth matte sort of texture to it.</li>
      <li>After many showers it leaves my hair clumpy so i discontinued using it</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>; I was so glad that I found it here.</li>
      <li>Its a lot thicker than any hair product I have used before but mixing it with a thinner product or diluting it with some hairspray makes it much more workable.</li>
      <li>I just order it when she needs more.</li>
      <li>This is made better...</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Just a tiny bit on my finer tips tames the fly aways and creates a nice texture and shine.</li>
      <li>Perfect if you&#x27;re trying to make your hair look extremely greasy, didn&#x27;t realize that is what I was buying</li>
      <li>Overall good product!</li>
      <li>I order it from Amazon and it arrives very quickly.  </li>
      <li>and it is definitely a strong hold.</li>
      <li>is a matte finish and a reasonably strong hold without drying crunchy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered, which is always nice.  </li>
      <li>This is hands down the best hair product I have ever used, I have bought it 5 ties now and will never use anything else.</li>
      <li>I find that a fingernail-sized amount of Craft Clay, smeared between my hands and roughed through my clean wet hair, dries it perfectly with shape and body, and keeps it that way all day.  </li>
      <li>Must buy for fine hair.</li>
      <li>The product is fine</li>
      <li>Easy to wash off but not as strong of a hold compared to the original Xtah clay.</li>
      <li>I do spray it lightly with a quality hair spray.</li>
      <li>Sebastian Craft Clay is a great short hair product.  </li>
      <li>To start, I&#x27;m the kind of guy that is very cautious about what goes in my hair and how it looks.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years now and it is an awesome product.</li>
      <li>Great stuff for short spiky styles.</li>
      <li>this is great for holding up hair if you want it to spike it some places, curl off the side in others and do a messed up look with solid clumping effect, without the crunchy, shiny, or oiliness.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s important to have clean hands before using any hair styling products that you apply with your hands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a couple more uses, I found how easy of an application it really was.</li>
      <li>definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited about this.</li>
      <li>This product is NOTHING like the original.</li>
      <li>At first, it has an okay, salon smell.</li>
      <li>You really need a fair amount of shampoo, and sometimes I have to shampoo twice if I really want it all gone.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like that wet look, then this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair, but simply because it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it could.</li>
      <li>The real deal for a fantastic prize, recomended!</li>
      <li>The second day, after sleeping on it, it still looks good, too.  </li>
      <li>If you use too much it could look greasy, so don&#x27;t do that :)</li>
      <li>Great hold and does not weigh hair down.  </li>
      <li>It is more of a natural look.</li>
      <li>, bed head didn&#x27;t have the power to keep my hair voluminous and gatsby was powerful but my hair didn&#x27;t move at all...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product! I have tried EVERYTHING for my hair and this is the only stuff that works.</li>
    <li> Ordered at the request of my teenage son. He was not pleased with the effect - said it makes his hair look and feel dirty.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! Just a tiny bit on my finer tips tames the fly aways and creates a nice texture and shine. If you use too much it could look greasy, so don&#x27;t do that :)&lt;br /&gt;Also, warm it up with the blow dryer or rubbing between you fingers for a second, goes on much nicer when it&#x27;s a little warm</li>
    <li> Definitely not as good for certain types of Asian hair. As my hair is very thick and straight, it is hard to mold sometimes. This is good if you have medium to long-ish hair. I have it longer on top and short on the sides, so I put up the middle and pat down the sides. The clay gives it a nice, deliberately messy look, as well as keeping that natural, dry look. I could see this working really well for a lot of Caucasian hair, but only well for some Asians. The nice thing about it is, it is easy to work and mold, but still holds it&#x27;s shape after you put it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t work with my hair, but simply because it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it could. At first, it has an okay, salon smell. But it just has a pretty bland &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; smell overall. I&#x27;m used to using Gatsby products which smell great! However, I have been using this as my daily driver for a couple months now and it is treating me pretty well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the wet look you get some pomade and pomade doesn&#x27;t feel as shapeable throughout the day. This gives you a dry look, doesn&#x27;t flake out, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and stays pretty light and shapeable throughout the day. I am a male with straight short/medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Sebastian Crude Clay, (although i&#x27;d like to), but although i can;&#x27;t compare it, it works great for me. It doesnt feel like theres anything in my hair, works better than hairspray, gel, anything. My hair DOES NOT curl.It doesnt. But after i use ths, the curls stay! I&#x27;m really excited about this. It seems a bit pricey, considering the size, but it accually will last a long time so i&#x27;m not worried. I&#x27;d highly suggest it. Use your thumb to dig out a little, warm it up/ run it in your palms, and evens apply to hair. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Over-all, it gets the job done. It&#x27;s a bit expensive for the size, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. There&#x27;s a lot inside and I&#x27;m sure this will last. However, this clay is a bit odd and takes effort to work all the way through your hair evenly. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get it down, it&#x27;ll just take some practice. I&#x27;ve never tried the Crude Clay before, but I might purchase that on E-bay and see which one is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But basically, this is a good product. It does what it says it will do and the hold is firm. If you only use a little bit it&#x27;s perfect, but use too much and it&#x27;ll clump your hair and make it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not thrilled about this product, but I&#x27;m content.&lt;br /&gt;Or in other terms: it&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the shipping took forever. 14 days to be exact - but it arrived and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> Well, I was also a many-year used of their Xtah crude clay product, and I was also annoyed to see it made unavailable. After reading people&#x27;s contradictory opinions about the replacement \\&quot;craft clay\\&quot; I broke down and bought one.    Here&#x27;s the deal:   1) the product contains most of the same ingredients.  2) the product looks identical and is only a little bit different in touch/use (a bit harder, but the same general effect once it&#x27;s in the hair). If I had to choose I&#x27;d take the Xtah, but honestly, they&#x27;re practically the same.  3) the new boxes are 2.5 times smaller than the Xtah clay standard size (50 grams instead of 125 grams), but similarly priced per box. So it&#x27;s about 2.5 times more expensive.  4) The Xtah said \\&quot;Made in the USA\\&quot; on the box - the Craft Clay says \\&quot;Made in Mexico.\\&quot; Cheaper labor! I couldn&#x27;t believe that when I saw it.    Summary: it&#x27;s (practically) the same product as Xtah, but repackaged and made 2.5 times more expensive for the consumer, while Sebastian has conveniently used Mexican labor to reduce their own costs even more!     Shame on Sebastian for resorting to such below-the-belt money-making tricks.</li>
    <li> I bought this in attempt to replace a discontinued product called Matrix Dirty Trix.   To make it work as good, you have to use more of it to get the spikey effect with good hold, but you can get the job done with it. It leaves a cool looking grey haze to your hair too. I use it in combination with Stephen Knoll New York Clay Wax Matte Styling Clay 1.5 OZ. They make a perfect combo. I was almost tempted to put them both in one container and mix them up :P Try it, you&#x27;ll like the result!</li>
    <li> What a rip off AND it is crap compared to the original !!&lt;br /&gt;4.4 oz for $17.99 vs 1.7 oz for $14.99!  Anyone see the problem here?&lt;br /&gt;It is slimy/ oily  and does not hold like Crude Clay did.</li>
    <li> After all the negative comments about this replacement product for the xtah crude clay. I was a bit worried that my hair wont be looking as sharp as it used to. I have typical asian black thick hair, and im not one of those wanabe kids with japanese anime hair (ive always thought they looked a bit, immature. they look good on drawings, but they dont look good on real life.) Anyway, I&#x27;ve used Xtah Crude Clay thoughout my highschool life (im now going to college), but ive gotten compliments not just from my peers, but from hair saloon stylists and beauty shop owners for my hair styling. xtah crude clay did the job well, and it made me look GEWD :]    Now about the CRAFT clay. I was obviously disappointed when the original got discontinued. BUT, don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this product. compared to the original Xtah Crude Clay, the Craft Clay has less odor and have more of a creamy consistency. Yes, it does have a little bit of a weaker hold than the original, but it&#x27;s nothing a good hair spray can&#x27;t fix. the craft clay is a slight change from the crude clay, but i believe once you get used to it, ultimately, the Craft Clay is a bit easier to work with. The reason I gave this product a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because... i guess i still miss my Crude Clay. But it still gets the job done, and it will make you lookd GEWD :D</li>
    <li> works as described, can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I have short hair, and I want a product that can shape and hold it without looking greasy. After trying many products, I settled on \\&quot;Sebastian Xtah Raw Modeler Crude Clay\\&quot; many years ago. I was disappointed to learn that it was discontinued.  So a couple months ago I searched for a replacement. I bought 3 products and tried varying amounts of each for several days. \\&quot;Alterna Hair Concrete\\&quot; is not too bad, but not as good as the crude clay. \\&quot;Redken Rough Clay 20\\&quot; is pointless.   I&#x27;m happy to say that the \\&quot;Sebastian Craft Clay\\&quot; is as good as the Xtah Crude Clay. It&#x27;s a little thicker and takes more effort to work evenly through hair, but the hold and finish is on par with the original.  Price per ounce is way up though. Packaging is improved, not that it matters.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible replacement to the original (Crude Clay). I was a happy customer for years. When they discontinued Crude Clay, I was told to use this instead. This product is NOTHING like the original.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; service!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It does wonders for my hair. My hair stylist recommended it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere; I was so glad that I found it here. I shipped fast and arrived way before expected, I believe it was two days after I ordered it, and it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be in for a week.</li>
    <li> Always what I&#x27;m looking for, comes protected and I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> It works great!  I have been using it for years, and now it seems it&#x27;s getting harder to find!  Happy I was able to find it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I bought this because they discontinued Crude Clay and it&#x27;s not nearly as good.  :-(  Why do they discontinue good products??</li>
    <li> My husband and I used Xtah Crude Clay for years, and then suddenly it was discontinued. So we decided to try out this new product (what we assume is a replacement) and were sorely disappointed. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s terrible -- it&#x27;s just average. It&#x27;s like any of a hundred similar products that does an okay job.    Crude Clay was particularly good at holding thinner hair in place, but this makes my hair limp and just a bit oily to be honest. We purchased it once, and it will be the only time we make that mistake. I really, really wish Sebastian would have a strong-holding product similar to Crude Clay. If not, we&#x27;re going to have to go elsewhere.    I noticed Sebastian is putting out Matte Putty in July 2009, so we may give that one a try.</li>
    <li> This is a poor substitute for Crude Clay. It much harder than crude clay (I have to heat it to use it) and does not hold as well. Good bye Sebastian.</li>
    <li> Basically like throwing clay in your hair.. works really well. Keeps it in place but you can&#x27;t really tell that its in your hair like normal gels. Just be sure to use a small amount in your hand and rub it around REALLY well, other wise.. it gets stuck in your palm and when you apply it to your hair, puts a gob in 1 spot. But works great!</li>
    <li> Pretty tacky stuff.  When I used it to spike my hair it pulled out a lot of my hair.  I can&#x27;t say that it works better than other products at keeping my hair fixed and in place once I use it since I live in a humid part of the country.  I was hopeful that it was as good as their &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; clay used to be, but it is pretty close.  Would work for most people I&#x27;m pretty sure unless you have a tendency to loose hair pretty easily.  I also have to wash my hair every night when I use the product since it doesn&#x27;t rinse out thoroughly.</li>
    <li> After receiving a bad haircut I needed something new to try to fix it. I hadn&#x27;t used a clay before so it was a bit weird the first time using it. Its a lot thicker than any hair product I have used before but mixing it with a thinner product or diluting it with some hairspray makes it much more workable. The only smells it has is a faint clay smell and its hardly noticable.I like to use it as a finishing step after I have used something else to give my hair hold, using fingertips to give my hair texture. The stuff will probably last a while the way I am using it although its a rather small tub</li>
    <li> I used Xtah Crude Clay for years and loved the firm hold and \\&quot;invisibility\\&quot; of it. My hair is thick and blond, I keep it short - max 5 cm (or 2 inches for the metrically challenged). The Craft Clay is useless for me. No hold whatsoever, my hair just falls flat down and looks heavy and even a bit oily. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair product I have ever used, I have bought it 5 ties now and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, even before they switched over to this packaging, and it is awesome! It will hold your hair for days if you want it to. It&#x27;s matte, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the flakiness of gels. It doesn&#x27;t look like you have anything in your hair.  I have thick hair that can handle the heaviness of this clay.  It feels basically like modeling clay.  I would recommend this to anyone serious about keeping their hair in place.</li>
    <li> OK - I was an XTah Crude Clay user for YEARS and then....no more Xtah :-(  I agree that this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version is not even close to the original - leaves my short hair looking limp &amp; greasy.  I tried alot of other products but like many of the other reviewers - they were NOT nearly good enough to be a substitute.  On the advice of a beauty supply store, I tried the Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete and it is about as close as I have gotten to the Xtah. So for everyone lamenting the loss of Xtah (thanks a bunch, Sebastian) there is hope in a jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the Xtah so I have no comparison there. My stylist cut my shoulder-length bob to a really short (too short) boy cut about eight weeks ago, and it didn&#x27;t need any product at all.  But as it grows out, it needs a little something.  I find that a fingernail-sized amount of Craft Clay, smeared between my hands and roughed through my clean wet hair, dries it perfectly with shape and body, and keeps it that way all day.  The second day, after sleeping on it, it still looks good, too.  Love this stuff.  It has even replaced my Osis Dust It, which I used to swear by, because this is easier to wash out (I alternate between Drench and Volupt shampoos).</li>
    <li> Hard to wash out, but it gives me any style I want and holds it while being very workable and re-workable throughout the day if necessary.  Wind?  No problem!  Rain?  Let it dry and restyle without more product.  Heat? No problem!  Sweat? Same as rain.  I do two shampoos to get it out, and clarify once or twice a week.  I love this product.  If you want a less expensive alternative, try the Gatsby Clay.  A little different texture, definite difference in smell, but very similar results.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  (Oh, I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, and I occasionally let it grow out to a medium-long length. I can do everything I need to as far as styling goes even when it&#x27;s long.  You&#x27;d obviously need to use a little more product, but it&#x27;s very versatile.)  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The product is fine but I was expecting (or hoping) it would be the same as (or closer to) the old Xtah Crude Clay (which i still do have a little left to directly compare with).  The main difference it, the new product is much wax-ier and leaves a slightly wetter shine.  I always liked the drier clay feeling of the old product which had great thick hold without the shine and waxy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are expecting to get the same product you will be dissappointed but if you are just looking for another typical mud / wax product, it will work fine.</li>
    <li> I originally used the Xtah crude clay that was replaced with craft clay. I have read other reviews. I continue to use this product because it gives my short hair the shape and fullness I want. I do spray it lightly with a quality hair spray. I probably would get the original crude clay if&lt;br /&gt;it was available at a cheaper price...it is slightly thicker, I think. Most store products seem waxy.This is made better...good quality.</li>
    <li> It has good hold the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily. After many showers it leaves my hair clumpy so i discontinued using it</li>
    <li> I chickened out and bought this despite the outrageous prize as I was hoping it was as good as the crude clay but this was not nearly as effective. I wish I never spent the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered, which is always nice.  Firm clay for a firm hold.  Container&#x27;s a little small, for the price, but I like the product.</li>
    <li> perfect for what i need</li>
    <li> I wrote this review because I saw that it was getting such low reviews because it was being compared to the now discontinued \\&quot;Xtah Crude Clay\\&quot;  To be fair, I have never used it, but that&#x27;s also why I thought it might be helpful to have a review that wasn&#x27;t biased with the former users of Xtah Crude Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an EXCELLENT product.  First, let me describe my hair and style that I wanted to achieve.  I am a male with short to medium hair length (3.5 inches at the longest areas), very fine and soft so that there is no volume whatsoever, but I wanted to achieve the carefully placed messed up, voluminous look, where the hairs are clumped together, the kind you find in luxury magazine layouts.  And this did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this stuff is like hard clay/wax.  it&#x27;s super hard, so you have to dig it out and then rub it out in your palm or finger tips first and then when it&#x27;s just a paste in your fingers you can just work it into your hair.  there is no residue, no scent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave it hard or crunchy and it washes out easily.  so basically i thought it was an amazing product cuz everything else i tried didn&#x27;t have the strength to clump my hair together. i tried bumble and bumble, bed head, and then cheaper brands like gatsby (the japanese one).  bumble and bumble just didn&#x27;t have the power to keep my hair clumped, bed head didn&#x27;t have the power to keep my hair voluminous and gatsby was powerful but my hair didn&#x27;t move at all... it&#x27;s like glue that dries...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know how good Xtah crude clay was, but if THIS product is getting a 2 star in comparison to Xtah crude clay, then it must have been fantastic beyond belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  this is great for holding up hair if you want it to spike it some places, curl off the side in others and do a messed up look with solid clumping effect, without the crunchy, shiny, or oiliness.  and it is definitely a strong hold.</li>
    <li> Since using this product I have come to a sad realisation.  It is nowhere near as good as the old Xtah Crude Clay, not for people with hair like mine.  The old Xtah Crude Clay was a revelation.  After years of searching I couldn&#x27;t find anything and then Xtah Crude came along.  I loved my hair after that.  Now it is always limp.    I am staggered they discontinued such a fantastic product.    Can anyone help me with a possible proper alternative or anywhere I can buy the old stuff?</li>
    <li> my hair is short and spiky.  i have been using this product for years and it holds and texturizes without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Got this to help style my new short do. It works ok, my hair may be a little to long for its normal use. Husband seems to like it a lot! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or greasy looking. Overall good product!</li>
    <li> This product is exaClay what I was looking for. I have soft wavy hair not unmanageably so, other products sort of allow me to shape my hair the way I want but they leave my hair hard and stringy to the point where I can&#x27;t mold it back in place if it gets messed up.   This product feels natural in the hair (soft and matte as opposed to hard and shiny). I could mess my hair up just for fun and shape it right back into place with out applying more.  It&#x27;s not annoyingly sticky, to get the clay off your hands all you need to do is rinse and wipe your hands dry. It washes off your hair with shampoo, if not like if you just wet your air not really wash it you&#x27;ll still have some product in your hair, if you have fairly soft hair you can it&#x27;ll still have hold, you might even be able to reshape your hair without adding any extra product if you like. It doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent so it doesnt collide with youre natural pheremones and choice of cologne.  I first bought this online and put my faith in the reviews, now it&#x27;s my turn to do the same for you.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it for years and it makes my short, fine hair do what I want while looking thicker!</li>
    <li> When get my haircut the lady who cuts my hair uses Bumble and Bumble Sumotech. That stuff works great but is expensive. This is very similar and much cheaper. I like it. You don&#x27;t need to use to much at all. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> Easy to wash off but not as strong of a hold compared to the original Xtah clay.</li>
    <li> To start, I&#x27;m the kind of guy that is very cautious about what goes in my hair and how it looks. A little description couldn&#x27;t hurt to. I have long thin straight hair but I have a thick head of hair(so lots of volume but no movement--just a flopped doo&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using only hair wax (not Sebastian) for a while now and although the hold is great for the wax in question, texturing is a mess. I would twist and twirl a few hair strands to create a textured effect however because of the nature of the product it would just stick to other hairs. Essentially what I was doing was making &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; like people do with gel, except not to that extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where this product comes in. Admittedly at first use(okay, a couple of uses) I was at lost. I tried replacing my wax with the Craft Clay and was upset about the hold. But during my usual hair styling routine when I got to the texture part I noticed how wonderful this product worked. It had the effect I wanted: It was matte, it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and the &amp;#34;spikes&amp;#34; I made didn&#x27;t stick to other strands of hair. Now I use both my old wax and the Sebastian Craft Clay in combination to achieve my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple more uses, I found how easy of an application it really was. I learned that after rubbing the clay between your fingers you can just run it through your hair, rather than individually texturing a few strands of hair. A BIG time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, solid product. 4/5. Would rate higher but the steep price. I&#x27;ve added below a few things people should know when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Do not rub the clay too fast, doing so you might &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; off the dead skin off your fingers and it will be absorbed in the clay thus having a visible effect similar to dandruff in your hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Do not touch your hair after your use your hairspray. I noticed my hairspray would have a chemical reaction with this clay. If I didn&#x27;t touch my hair it&#x27;s unnoticeable however if you mess around with your hair you&#x27;ll notice white flakes, again similar to dandruff however it&#x27;s just clumps of wax.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash your hands before using the wax. Because I have black hair it&#x27;s obvious when there&#x27;s something in my hair so it&#x27;s important to have clean hands before using any hair styling products that you apply with your hands.</li>
    <li> This product is more like a pomade than Xtah Crude Clay.  In fact, do NOT buy this product expecting Xtah Crude Clay, one of the best hair products ever made.  There were some downsides to Xtah, but there has never been a product to replicate the hold, and the matte and natural look for straight and fine hair.  If Sebastian reps are reading this, bring it back to the market.</li>
    <li> All the stores that I go to stopped carrying this.  I like the clay because it isn&#x27;t greasy.  It feels dry and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds well.  For me, it holds better than most gels and doesn&#x27;t leave a hard crispy look.  It is more of a natural look.</li>
    <li> My partner and I both have greying, short thick hair. Crude Clay preceded this product and we liked it better but after a short adjustment period we find this to be the best product on the market for giving the tossed-look to short, heavy hair.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works great with my hair - leaves a nice matte finish.  First hair product that holds just like I want.</li>
    <li> My husband will only use this product.</li>
    <li> Always reliable product. Ordered through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sebastian crude clay was awesome. Craft clay is average, and everyone agrees, why on earth did they swap a great product for a useless product???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, finally I have found something that works just the same as crude clay, stiff miracle mud, amazing!</li>
    <li> Very good. I am using it for years.</li>
    <li> The real deal for a fantastic prize, recomended!</li>
    <li> Sebastian Craft Clay is  a great product, it fulls my need, It&#x27;s very  satisfying to use it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beatriz</li>
    <li> It is what it is, a Sebastian hair wax. This is the kind of wax you use to style and mess up your hair, it holds pretty well for hair separation. Not the kind of strong hold wax to use for spiking hair, etc.. Also, there&#x27;s a faint \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; smell, which pretty hard to describe. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or whatsoever, in fact you can barely smell it off your hair. Definitely good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  A little dab will do ya!</li>
    <li> perfect for styling your hair with a matte look i love this product! a little goes a long way i use only a dime size of it on my hand and it lasts me like several months i still havent even run out yet.</li>
    <li> This has been my usual product for years now.  It used to come in a bigger container for the same price, but it takes me long enough (~2 months, I would guess) to go through even one of the current 1.7 oz. containers that it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I look for in a product is a matte finish and a reasonably strong hold without drying crunchy.  This stuff delivers on all counts, though it will hold hair straight up only if you use a fair amount of it.  When my hair is shorter, I tend to apply this product dry because it stays stickier that way.  When my hair is longer, I tend to apply when my hair is damp because it results in a smoother look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real downside is that this product is hard to get off of your hands and out of your hair.  If you look at the ingredients, the first one is petrolatum (i.e. petroleum jelly) and another is &amp;#34;earth.&amp;#34;  So one way to think about this is that it really is clay -- it&#x27;s kinda like Vaseline plus dirt.  The petrolatum part is probably why it&#x27;s hard to wash out. You really need a fair amount of shampoo, and sometimes I have to shampoo twice if I really want it all gone.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a true clay/mud since Matrix discontinued Dirty Trix.  This is it!  Matte finish.  Hard clay texture that must be dug out of the can.  Great hold and does not weigh hair down.  Must buy for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I just received my order in the mail, but I have used this product in the past so I know what I&#x27;m talking about. The first thing I did was open the container to confirm it&#x27;s the same stuff I used before. Indeed it was. If you don&#x27;t like that wet look, then this stuff is great. Has hold and mold without the extra shine. If you straighten your hair, then it won&#x27;t wet it down like a gel, so you have more options to style your hair. The only issue I have is that the longer your hair is the more of this product you have to use, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for longer hair. Unless you want to invest a lot of money in your hair and buy several of these.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use it and we both like it! It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky it&#x27;s kind of got a smooth matte sort of texture to it. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s absolutely amazing but I&#x27;m very happy with the shape it gives my hair. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I was a little disappointed in the size of the jar. It&#x27;s pretty small but on the other hand a little goes a long way so it just depends! We&#x27;re happy with it! Subscribe to my YouTube channel (dmarievintage) I&#x27;ll be posting a review video about it on there soon! - Cam and Dani</li>
    <li> Worth buying again.  My wife uses it from time to time and has never had any negative remarks about this product.</li>
    <li> This comes from China and is not the same texture as whatsoever as what you would get it at Beauty brands</li>
    <li> Perfect if you&#x27;re trying to make your hair look extremely greasy, didn&#x27;t realize that is what I was buying I guess.</li>
    <li> I watched a video on how to make your hair piecey. The model said she used Sebastian Craft Clay Remoldable Matte Texturizer. It looked like it worked so I ordered the product. It takes a little time and technique, but the product does what it is supposed to do. It looks great as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I had never used the previous crude clay but, this product works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it is an awesome product. It gives your hair some shine but not so much that it makes it look greasy. I would recommend this product for anyone with short to medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Always great..but you will need a decent shampoo to get it out!</li>
    <li> Just like the old molding putty that lasts forever!</li>
    <li> i have been using this stuff for years.  i have tried many other clays out there, and none compare!  definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for it yet! I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Works great, and is easily remoldable when needed.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for short spiky styles.</li>
    <li> I have hard to manage hair.  This remoldable styling clay holds my hair in place better than any product I have previously used.  The product is easy to handle, and it lasts me approximately three months.</li>
    <li> I love this clay!!!! Way better than any Gatsby products. I will never use any other clays from now on.</li>
    <li> I used to use Their Crude Clay, but that&#x27;s been discontinued. The Craft Clay is slightly different, but still the only modeling product of it&#x27;s kind that I have found - holds like crazy, gives your hair great volume and body</li>
    <li> the surface of the product is quite dry, I can clearly see some cracks on the surface. When I use my finger to scrape some, the surface is crispy, and I can hear sounds of crack. When I apply the product, it looks much greasier than I expect.</li>
    <li> No complaints whatsoever.  Just hoping that sebastian doesn&#x27;t stop making it!!!  Been using this product for years and am thankful for Amazon as it&#x27;s impossible to find in salons / pharmacies in NJ.</li>
    <li> Sebastian Craft Clay is a great short hair product.  I have used it for many years.  I order it from Amazon and it arrives very quickly.  I have thin hair and I wear it short.  The Sebastian Craft Clay gives it texture and body, making it look thicker than it is.</li>
    <li> Somehow dry stylisher product! Recommended to oiled hair type. Easy to use, practical results, amazing look! That&#x27;s a great idea to have one of this at home! Enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I just order it when she needs more. So it must be good if she has me re-order it. This the 2nd time I have ordered it but a different seller this time.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The substance is a little too hard.  However it does work to give your hair the appearance of volume.</li>
    <li> Claims to be matte finish not very matte especially for fine hair. To heavy and not enough hold.</li>
</ol>
