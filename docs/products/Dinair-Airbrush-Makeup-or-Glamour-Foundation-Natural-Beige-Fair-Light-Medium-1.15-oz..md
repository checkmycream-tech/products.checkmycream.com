    <li> This makeup is better than I expected. It goes on great and for the price it is well worth it! I would recommend this product to anyone with an airbrush system.</li>
    <li> perfect coverage and lasts all day</li>
    <li> ordered natural beige, dont know what color it is but not natural beige. Way to pale from the natural beige I ordered last year. Have other colors so Im able to blend to find a better color.</li>
    <li> I have bought this makeup direct from Dinair and this was a much better deal! Arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> I must admit after a 2-year treatment of my acne, I was excited to use this.  I loved it the first week.  But then I&#x27;m noticing that there&#x27;s so much whitehead build-up and next thing I know I&#x27;m breaking out all over my face.  So I did took photos and emailed it to Dinair to share my concern as consumer.  They said all their products are hypoallergenic. I think having a very sensitive skin would not be easy to find a good match.  I&#x27;m searching for a new brand.</li>
    <li> The color is a perfect match to my complexion. I enjoy the convenience of this website to make purchases like this.</li>
    <li> I always use Dinair, Natural Beige.  Since I had part of a bottle left when this one arrived, I never really looked at it.  When I did look at it, I was surprised to see how much lighter it was from my current bottle. I double checked to make sure it was the same shade on the bottle &amp; it was.  I was going to return it, but I tossed the envelope &amp; paperwork (my bad!! lol).  So I mixed it with my 1/2 bottle of the bottle I had to even out the shade a bit.  Ordered another bottle off of e-bay and got the same shade as I had.  Go figure!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the product to use in my air brush kit. It is way too thick and after using this makeup my air brush kit does not work correctly because the make up was too thick for it. In addition it goes on way too thick and looks bad once on. My face felt bad like being smothered once applied. The makeup comes off on everything your hands, your cloths, ect. This is the worst air brush make up I have used and I have tried three different ones. I bought it because it was cheaper; you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I really love it. Excellent coverage and the color is perfect.  It has a nice fragrance. I&amp;#34;m going to order some blush from Dinar next.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND WILL USE IT FROM TIME TO TIME BUT I PREFER GLAM AIR, BUT THIS IS A CLOSE SECOND.  IT WORKS AND FLOWS WELL AND LAST ABOUT 12  HOURS OR MORE.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this make up!!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. It is so light!! I don&#x27;t even have an airbrush, I just applied it with my real techniques buffing brush, and it still goes on flawlessly!!I love how well it covered my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much too thick to use in an airbrush system.  I have cut it with water (which you&#x27;re supposedly not supposed to do) and even with the wand opened fully, it barely comes out.  Won&#x27;t buy again :(</li>
    <li> i love this product and i use this to all our customer and they really like because it feels really great on your skin</li>
    <li> I took a guess when I ordered it for my wife.  She loves it and says it matches so well on her light/medium skin tone with a summer tan thats fading.  when it arrived, it looks pinkish, but its actually not.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Dinair products and have been looking for a cheaper solution than purchasing directly from Dinair. This is it! Same great quality!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there, stays on longer, doesn&#x27;t rub off like other makeup, not oily, just a perfect product</li>
    <li> Colour was excellent. I have a medium-light skin tone and the natural beige works perfectly for me. Liquid is smooth and easily applied with my air-brush equipment. I would recommend this product and will buy it again as needed.</li>
