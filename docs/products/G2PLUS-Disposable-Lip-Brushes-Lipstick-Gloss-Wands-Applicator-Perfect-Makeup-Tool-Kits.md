    <li> Like these &amp; they serve my purpose during lash extension application, but they do have some areas of the white tips separating (kind of like some fuzz balls that you can pick off before use. These don&#x27;t make the wands unusable.</li>
    <li> Came quick, product was as expected. I don&#x27;t use them for makeup though. I&#x27;m a electrical engineer, I use them for cleaning delicate sensors with alcohol</li>

    <li> The applicator head is the same thickness as the wand. So the wand gets more product on it than the applicator head. The head doesn&#x27;t absorb much lip gloss either so I have to use multiple wands to apply lip gloss on one person.</li>
