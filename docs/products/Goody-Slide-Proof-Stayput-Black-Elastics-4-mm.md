### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>She loved them!</li>
      <li>These are great for keeping a ponytail in place.</li>
      <li>works great-</li>
      <li>These are amazing!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Initially I really liked these.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores and they are her favorite.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Glad it happened at home and not at work.</li>
      <li>My favorite hair bands.</li>
      <li>so i was glad to find them on amazon.</li>
      <li>They break too easily.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the true test.  </li>
      <li>The four stars is because they seem to break quickly for me.</li>
      <li>They stretch out quickly.</li>
      <li>I have fairly fine hair and these didn&#x27;t really hold that well for me.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind I use on my hair.</li>
      <li>So far they are the best ponytail holders for thin hair unless you can find the original goody ponytail holders with the metal seal.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thick hair and the old style brown bands with the brass crimped clasps worked perfectly for my hair.</li>
      <li>great for my daughter&#x27;s thick but slippery hair.  </li>
      <li>I wore one during my hot yoga class yesterday...</li>
      <li>I have to wear my hair back for work every day, and I love these.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Instead, gently take them out to avoid hair breakage.</li>
      <li>I tried these bands and they really do grip your hair.</li>
      <li>They are a pain in the butt to take out (the whole stay-put idea, I guess).  </li>
      <li>They hold my hair securely even when I am outside in the wind working on our ranch.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get loose easily.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>These are good for people who have thin hair, they don&#x27;t slide off.  </li>
      <li>The new styles &amp;#34;without metal&amp;#34; are dismal for me.</li>
      <li>These elastics stay put after a long day at school and playing on monkey bars :)</li>
      <li>keeps my hair in through activity and normal daily wear and having delivery set up makes it much easier to keep on hand!</li>
      <li>my hair is fine but thick and heavy and falls out of most hair-holders, but these work for me without falling out.  </li>
      <li>These are the only pony tail holders that really keep my pony tail in place.  </li>
      <li>Not awful, not amazing, but</li>
      <li>I only had to adjust this band once during the day to keep my ponytail up high.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair, but also straight and smooth hair that always has me readjusting hair elastics several times a day, unless I manage to wrap them super tight to give myself a headache.</li>
      <li>So, many of the typical hair bands that I have used are constantly slipping down and sometimes the ponytail band slips right out of my hair.</li>
      <li>Also much more bulky than I expected, and not really comfortable.</li>
      <li>ponytail stays in all day with no slipping.  </li>
      <li>They gave me enough &amp;#34;twists&amp;#34; around to hold my thick hair tightly, but they have stretched out faster than the old kind used to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using the first elastic that I purchased about 4.5 months ago, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold tightly anymore.</li>
      <li>The grip is strong enough to hold heavy hair without slipping, and they last a long time before breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The grip is strong enough to hold heavy hair without slipping, and they last a long time before breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> She is as active as any eight year old girl.</li>
<li> I have pretty thick hair and the regular Goody bands snap after continued use.</li>
<li> This does hold my very thick and slippery Asian hair well (all other hair bands always slip out) and will stay in place through a full running exercise.</li>
<li> I have such thick hair, so I was amazed at how well they stayed put throughout a long day of wearing a relatively high ponytail and chasing my kids.&lt;br</li>
<li> The only thing I would want to mention is that if you don&#x27;t remove them carefully, you may break some hair, so don&#x27;t yank them out from where you have them.</li>
<li> Will continue to buy these as long as they make them!</li>
<li> Any other ones, I end up having to retie my hair several times a day.  </li>
<li> They are not very stretchy; I&#x27;ve broke a handful of them already trying to get a tight enough hold on my har.</li>
<li> I was a little afraid because the price was so cheap ($1.38 a piece) that it would only be ONE elastic, instead of one ten-pack.  </li>
<li> The hair ties stay in place without slipping.</li>
<li> /&gt;You do need to be careful not to yank them out of your hair though, because you will rip some of your hair out.</li>
<li> And are big enough to work on my thick hair.</li>
<li> But no quicker than other hair bands that I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
<li> I did find some expensive ones elsewhere online, but these were inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
<li> I have really thick, medium-length hair, and after discovering these a few years ago, these are the only hair bands I will buy now.  </li>
<li> Goody Slide Proof Stayput Black Elastics, 4 mm, 1 Count, and</li>
<li> My only complaint is they tend to break on me after a few uses.</li>
<li> As long as you don&#x27;t have very thin hair, I would definitely recommend these.</li>
<li> Also, after using them a few times, they stretch out.  </li>
<li> these are sometimes hard to find in the store</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not thrilled.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair</li>
<li> My daughter has thick thick hair.</li>
<li> This may just be because my hair is so thick.</li>

    <li> This is an excellent product. It doesn&#x27;t get loose easily. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well, have bought multiple packs.</li>
    <li> These are the only pony tail holders that really keep my pony tail in place.  I have to wear my hair back for work every day, and I love these.  Any other ones, I end up having to retie my hair several times a day.  I never have to do that with these, and they don&#x27;t seem to break my hair either.  Will continue to buy these as long as they make them!</li>
    <li> great for my daughter&#x27;s thick but slippery hair.  ponytail stays in all day with no slipping.  these are sometimes hard to find in the store so i was glad to find them on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have fairly fine hair and these didn&#x27;t really hold that well for me. Also much more bulky than I expected, and not really comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, but also straight and smooth hair that always has me readjusting hair elastics several times a day, unless I manage to wrap them super tight to give myself a headache. These actually do stay put! And are big enough to work on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind I use on my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Ripped before I had a chance to use it even. Glad it happened at home and not at work.</li>
    <li> These are good for people who have thin hair, they don&#x27;t slide off.  Wished Goody would offer a smaller size slide proof ponytail holders.  Also, after using them a few times, they stretch out.  So far they are the best ponytail holders for thin hair unless you can find the original goody ponytail holders with the metal seal.</li>
    <li> The hair ties stay in place without slipping. The only thing I would want to mention is that if you don&#x27;t remove them carefully, you may break some hair, so don&#x27;t yank them out from where you have them. They seem to last longer than regular ponytail holders too. As long as you don&#x27;t have very thin hair, I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, medium-length hair, and after discovering these a few years ago, these are the only hair bands I will buy now.  The grip is strong enough to hold heavy hair without slipping, and they last a long time before breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another bonus: I ordered them with this description: Goody Slide Proof Stayput Black Elastics, 4 mm, 1 Count, and I did receive one ten-pack.  I was a little afraid because the price was so cheap ($1.38 a piece) that it would only be ONE elastic, instead of one ten-pack.  Nope, it was still a 10-pack.  Yay!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick thick hair. She is as active as any eight year old girl. These elastics stay put after a long day at school and playing on monkey bars :)</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They stay in place, I almost never have to tighten my ponytail. I have been using the same one for weeks and no issues with it breaking, as others have mentioned. They also do NOT hurt or pull the hair out when you remove them.  I wore one during my hot yoga class yesterday...that&#x27;s the true test.  Drenched in sweat, and it did not budge.</li>
    <li> These just aren&#x27;t the hair elastic for me.  They are not very stretchy; I&#x27;ve broke a handful of them already trying to get a tight enough hold on my har. They are a pain in the butt to take out (the whole stay-put idea, I guess).  I&#x27;m not thrilled.  I&#x27;ll stick to regular hair elastics for now on.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair bands. Stay put as advertised.</li>
    <li> my hair is fine but thick and heavy and falls out of most hair-holders, but these work for me without falling out.  Just wish I could find them in local stores.</li>
    <li> The Stayput Elastics hold the hair in place.</li>
    <li> These are the only hairbands I will use. They hold my hair securely even when I am outside in the wind working on our ranch. I know my hair will stay where I put it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and the old style brown bands with the brass crimped clasps worked perfectly for my hair. The new styles &amp;#34;without metal&amp;#34; are dismal for me. They break too easily. They stretch out quickly. Initially I really liked these. They gave me enough &amp;#34;twists&amp;#34; around to hold my thick hair tightly, but they have stretched out faster than the old kind used to. I&#x27;m still using the first elastic that I purchased about 4.5 months ago, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold tightly anymore. Not awful, not amazing, but okay.</li>
    <li> These are great for keeping a ponytail in place. My only complaint is they tend to break on me after a few uses. This may just be because my hair is so thick. The pack that I got was open when I opened the box, this is amazons fault though not the product.</li>
    <li> works great- keeps my hair in through activity and normal daily wear and having delivery set up makes it much easier to keep on hand!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a stocking stuffer for my sister for Christmas. I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores and they are her favorite. I did find some expensive ones elsewhere online, but these were inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! She loved them!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I like to wear it in a ponytail. So, many of the typical hair bands that I have used are constantly slipping down and sometimes the ponytail band slips right out of my hair. I tried these bands and they really do grip your hair. I only had to adjust this band once during the day to keep my ponytail up high. I have such thick hair, so I was amazed at how well they stayed put throughout a long day of wearing a relatively high ponytail and chasing my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be careful not to yank them out of your hair though, because you will rip some of your hair out. Instead, gently take them out to avoid hair breakage. I will definitely continue to buy these hair bands to keep my pony tails in place!</li>
    <li> These bands stay on SOOO well. I have pretty thick hair and the regular Goody bands snap after continued use. I will continue to order these.</li>
    <li> This does hold my very thick and slippery Asian hair well (all other hair bands always slip out) and will stay in place through a full running exercise. The four stars is because they seem to break quickly for me. But no quicker than other hair bands that I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
