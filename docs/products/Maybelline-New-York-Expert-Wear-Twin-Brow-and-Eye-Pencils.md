      <li>It shows good and contrasts well with my skin tone (very fair) and it still has a natural color to it.</li>
      <li>This one is the best nice soft color esp.</li>
      <li>However when they lose their point &amp; need to be sharpened, they break very easily after they come out of the sharpener.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these Maybelline Expert Eyes Eye Pencils for years and love them.</li>

      <li>but they&#x27;re becoming more sparse as I age.  </li>
      <li>I liked that it was an auto-sharpening pencil, but I didn&#x27;t like the price or how quickly I went through the product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Adds life to blonde brows.</li>
    <li> The only eye brow pencil I ever use!</li>
    <li> After losing my brows due to illness, I use this daily to draw brows. Occasionally they can be hard to sharpen and the lead breaks (wasting a whole pencil usually). I always have a dozen on hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, this product is a little to dark for my eyebrows, I was expecting more of a light blonde-dirty blonde color.</li>
    <li> Perfect for defining eyebrows or lips, I had been looking for this color in many stores with no luck.  Glad I found it on Amazon and it ships free as a Prime add on item.  The shade is a dark blonde.  Although you can blend it, it is not greasy so does not smear.</li>
    <li> I just cannot find any better products even after paying three times more. Funnily, I am an oriental with dark hair, and this pencil colour (blonde) suits me the best!</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and dirty blonde eyebrows. My eyebrows are not dark enough to use a brown eyeliner/eyebrow pencil but not extremely light either. I&#x27;ve been comparison shopping for a while, reading reviews to see which blonde eyebrow pencils people had the most success with, and the Maybelline pencils seemed to have the most positive reaction from customers. I ordered the Maybelline eyebrow pencils in 107 Blonde and even after reading the raving reviews, I was still a little skeptical that the pencil would be so great. But for practically a dollar a piece, I was willing to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I only have one word to say about them: EXCELLENT!!&lt;br /&gt;These are probably the best eyebrow pencils that I have ever used, they match my natural dirty blonde eyebrow color almost perfectly. My eyebrows now look sculpted yet natural and all I did was brush on a little bit of the pencil, blend, and then highlight underneath.&lt;br /&gt;This was a fantastic investment and getting two of these babies for two dollars and quick shipping, it&#x27;s a steal! I will definitely be repurchasing, but hopefully these last a while.</li>
    <li> This is the only vendor I could find that sells BLONDE eyebrow pencil. The service was fast. The product speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used for several years now. I love that it&#x27;s a twin pack so it&#x27;s a better value than most eyebrow pencils. It also stays put, doesn&#x27;t smear like others I tried in the past. I really wish it came with a sharpener, though.</li>
    <li> Nice blonde color, not too reddish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these Maybelline Expert Eyes Eye Pencils for years and love them. A few years back I decided to change the color of my hair to blonde and while I love it, it&#x27;s now extremely difficult to get eye brow pencils that go nicely with blonde hair. Maybelline has them but most stores carry the other traditional colors and have dropped the blonde line. I had tried the local stores, both general merchandise and drug stores, and could no longer find them. I tried on-line and was successful. I think they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t consider any other brand.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Maybelline has been making this type of pencil in the twin pack forever, way before I was born.  A cosmetic standard for many women.  Got these for my mom who always used the black in this pencil, but then she went completely gray over the years and needed something much lighter.  This did the trick.  Happy mom is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Received the product and the color is perfect. That is the only reason it is getting 2 stars. The smoothness when applying it is awful. It is hard as a rock and I have seen it have hairs on after I get done applying it. I decided to sharpen it to see if that would help it and that did not. I think I will stick with my current brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eyebrow pencil for years.</li>
    <li> I wear the blonde color, and while they are the best, it amazes me how the pencil is one size but the lead is way smaller.  I throw away one third of the pencil every time. check it out next time, you&#x27;ll see.  They should make the lead as long as the pencil, otherwise show us the actual size of the lead because one inch of a pencil with no lead is one inch we didn&#x27;t receive when we bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Walgreens is 2.97, Walgreens is 4.39, Rite-Aid is 3.39 for one twin pack.</li>
    <li> I recently became a blonde and my brows were too dark. These pencils are great quality and lasted me for quite some time considering their size. I just wish they were standard size like eyeliner pencils.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into brow pencils, and admittedly I don&#x27;t really know exactly how to use them properly. I am in the process of going blonde, so I figured that these blonde pencils would be necessary to offset my dark eyebrows. I expected them to be creamier - they are really hard and I had trouble getting color to transfer at first. The pencil is also a bit darker than I thought it would be - there isn&#x27;t too much of a lightening difference, but there definitely is still some. I think that this will work better if concealer is first applied, but I just wanted to test it bare first. Overall, not a bad product but I also don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> they are not soft as previous product it is very hard to put them on they did change something about this pencil</li>
    <li> Tried and true!  These may not be fancy but they are the best eyebrow pencil or enhancer I&#x27;ve ever used.  The color stays true and doesn&#x27;t turn. Iwill not use another product for my eyebrows but this one.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried that the color of this pencil would be too light for me, but thankfully, it is perfect! I have wheat-colored medium ashy-blonde hair and my eyebrows are about the same color as my hair. I thought that this pencil may be for those with much lighter blonde eyebrows, but the color matches my brows very well: perfect for filling in areas that need more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would imagine that this color would work well on someone with a shade or so lighter or darker than mine as well. These pencils are great!</li>
    <li> This is good enough, even though I resent having to use it. My hair has lightened (greyed, #$%^&amp;!), and without eyebrows, I look totally washed out.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I have a very hard hair color to match. I&#x27;ve gone to the makeup counter at department stores for brow liners before and ended up not using them. I have naturally dirty blonde hair with highlights and the Blonde matches my hair PERFECTLY! My eyebrows get really light in the summer from the sun and this is perfect for filling them in. It gives a soft look to my brows. It&#x27;s fairly easy to apply and lasts pretty much the whole day. I will say that it allows for error too since it gives that soft look. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased that such a cheap product ended up beating out the department store brands.</li>
    <li> As a fair-skinned redhead, I have completely blonde and clear eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been using this daily since I was a teen and stole it from my mom&#x27;s collection and it makes SUCH a difference. There might be better products out there, but why fix what aint broke, am I right?</li>
    <li> Will never change brands from Maybelline. They stopped making Charcoal Grey but the closed alternative is Blonde. Fantastic price and works quite well for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Maybeline New York expert Wear eye brow pencil is about the best I have ever tried, it glides on easy and doesn&#x27;t leave lots of crumbs behind, plus its long lasting.  Would be totally interested if Maybeline ever comes out with 1 shade lighter.</li>
    <li> I love these eyebrow pencils when they are new and up until they need to be sharpened. However when they lose their point &amp; need to be sharpened, they break very easily after they come out of the sharpener.  I&#x27;ve tried different sharpeners &amp; the same thing always happens.  Is it just the &amp;#34;cheap wood&amp;#34; that wants to splinter or are all the crayon parts terribly fragile?  I don&#x27;t know....</li>
    <li> My eyebrows look great!</li>
    <li> its the only eye brow pencil I have ever used.  The gold standard.</li>
    <li> The blonde shade is the lightest I&#x27;ve been able to find. Most brands call their color \\&quot;blonde,\\&quot; but it&#x27;s too dark for my brow/hair color. This color is super natural for lighter blondes.</li>
    <li> It looks very well with my coloration; it is easy to apply (others I&#x27;ve tried were too hard to go on easily); sometimes the lead breaks off, but that&#x27;s probably unavoidable with the soft lead; and the price is right!!!</li>
    <li> It is incredibly difficult for me to find makeup light enough for me to use, but this works!  It also doesn&#x27;t wear off throughout the day.  I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference an eyebrow pencil would make but it actually makes a huge difference - I look better in general and also more put-together and professional.</li>
    <li> I have been using these pencils for a long time.  I can&#x27;t find this color in the stores any more so have to order on line but will continue to do so as long as I can.  These little pencils are inexpensive and just as good if not better, than more expensive ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> Maybelline pencils have always worked for me. Easy, inexpensive, and long-lasting. And, Amazon is the only place I can find the 107 Blonde. Thank you . . .</li>
    <li> Was having a hard time finding this color. Works great and now I have a good supply.</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to finally figure out a blonde eyebrow pencil works best for me.  My eyebrows are light brown but they&#x27;re becoming more sparse as I age.  Using light brown shades always give a fake look and still appear too dark.  I falsely assumed (from just looking at) Maybelline&#x27;s blonde pencil color that it would be too light.  Until I actually tried it--this one is perfect.  It applies easily, stays put, and looks very natural with light brown eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the color of this pencil fool you.  Obviously from the good reviews here, Maybelline blonde pencil works great for blondes, but it also works well for light brown eyebrows too.  I was worried I&#x27;d never find anything to complement aging eyebrows, but this works wonderfully.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon made this hard to find item available through their add-on program at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Glides on smoothly, color is a medium neutral blonde so will fit most blondes shades, only need to be applied once during the day (unless it&#x27;s a really hot day spent outside then maybe I would need to reapply.... so far I haven&#x27;t needed to though) and it causes no irritation on my sensitive skin. I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Great if your eyebrows are light blond but you want to shape then nicly with the pencil! Glad i bought these :)</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and very fair eyebrows. This is the only pencil that works well for me.  Perfect color, stays on, and low cost.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very light blonde, and although I have eyebrows, they&#x27;re not visible. This pencil has enough pigment for both light lines and thick, full eyebrows - and the color still stays natural. The tone is like gray-blonde, but I found it perfect if your want prominent eyebrows. The pack comes in 4. I&#x27;ll be using these for while, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> It is not easy to apply on your eyeline. applying to eye brows is good</li>
    <li> my favorite blonde eye pencil for my fair face</li>
    <li> Perfect especially for blondes</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY eyebrow pencil that matches my brows. (I&#x27;m a natural medium blonde.)  For some reason they are not sold in my little town any more so I turned to Amazon and...Hooray!!!</li>
    <li> This is great for my light eyebrows!</li>
    <li> The color is good, but the application result is disappointing.  I think the conclusion is that powder is more subtle than a pencil for eyebrow enhancement...</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my eye brows.  I have blonde hair, and very very light eyebrows.  Using this pencil is just what I need to add enough dimension to my eyes.  And easy to use.</li>
    <li> .... Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive pencils  that leave smudge marks. The blond pencil goes on well and non-smudgy. I have been using this pencil since high school. Occasionally I&#x27;ll try a different brand but i&#x27;m always disappointing because this one is that good!</li>
    <li> soft pencil which is easy to apply but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to.  Having a hard time finding a color for brows that I like so It&#x27;s not Maybellines fault that this color isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other blond eyebrow pencils and they have been either too dark, too hard and dry, and too thick. These &amp;#34;old-timers&amp;#34; are the best I have used because they are the correct color and they sharpen into a nice point without breaking. The price is also reasonable so keeping them sharp doesn&#x27;t seem wasteful.</li>
    <li> This product is still in the markets but hard to find the Blonde color. So when I found it on amazon for an amazing price I bought 2 packs. 2 packs will last me forever but I might buy more in case they discontinue product as most companies do with the items I love.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my brows from high end to cheap.  Although these are low cost they work as well as $20-30 pencils.  The blonde color is a light ash color - NO red tones, which I discover with many cheap pencils, or even more expensive light browns.  The texture is superb.  Many inexpensive pencils are too creamy, so they leave crumbs in your brows, don&#x27;t have staying power, are hard to get precision, &amp; require constant sharpening.  This product is firm &amp; waxy enough to work &amp; last perfectly.  My brows are so fair I like to pencil them in all the time - this product stays thru my workouts! I use it with Clinque light brown powder when I want a dramatic brow, &amp; alone when I want a regular brow.  This will become a staple for me, very happy I found it - it is as well performing as my fav MAC, but without the price!</li>
    <li> This is not &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; it is light brown just as the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; is auburn.  Why  change the name of the colors except to sell more products.  Works but if I could find another brand I would buy it.</li>
    <li> I have brown hair, but the blonde is the right color to fill in sparse areas without making me look like Joan Crawford. I&#x27;ve used this brand forever and swear by it. I almost cried when I could not find at Target, but thankfully, I could get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST BLONDE SHADE EVER! I have lost count how many diff brands I have tried for blonde eyebrows. This one is the best nice soft color esp. When freshly sharpened. doesn&#x27;t look heavy. Can get dark if you use heavy strokes. I found this pencil 6 years ago and don&#x27;t see them sold in any stores near by anymore. Glad for internet shopping</li>
    <li> I have used this eyebrow pencil for years. It&#x27;s the only one I can find that will stay put on my oily face. Good color for a medium to light blonde, also.</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow pencil for me - awesome for blonds and redheads! The only one I use for many years!</li>
    <li> I have black eyebrows and fair skin and reddish brown hair. These fill-in the sparse areas of my brows with just the right color. Great price and great service from UrBargain.</li>
    <li> Only product I use for my eyebrows in blonde color of course have tried others and go back to these every time thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect color for a medium blonde.  No red hues.</li>
    <li> It perfectly fills in my eyebrows. My local store wasn&#x27;t stocking it, so I tried another brand. It did not work as well as this brand. It sharpens to a point and is not soft and creamy. It makes individual lines to fill in your brows perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I have blonde hair and my eyebrows are so light. This color is a perfect match for me, not too dark, but not so light that you can barely see the product. I would recommend this product but only if you have blonde eyebrows, seeing that it would be too light even if your eyebrows were a light brown.</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find brow liners for blondes and this shade is just great- not too brown or too yellow. I have medium blonde hair, naturally and this is great for me.</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding Blonde eye pencils.  Really need this light color.</li>
    <li> These are great. They go on easy, stay on, and look great. Also, the twin pack is affordable. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least twenty years  and it&#x27;s still wonderful. The price is also great. Try it. You&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
    <li> Nice pencils, easy to apply and don&#x27;t wear off easily.  They last a long time, and don&#x27;t seem to dry out.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product and have been using it for years&lt;br /&gt;after it was discontinued in  BC stores I was very upset until I found out&lt;br /&gt;I could still buy it across the border or order it on-line&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Doris</li>
    <li> Not gona lie, im picky to the CORE about brow pencils. Finally one made for blondes that doesnt make you look like a clown! Thank you maybelline and thank you to the company for getting it shipped to me so quickly!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to apply but that is exactly what i wanted so i am pleased</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair and this is my favorite eyebrow pencil.  It is inexpensive and the blonde color fills in without making your eyebrows look thin or drawn in.  One of the few inexpensive beauty products I love!</li>
    <li> I have used tons of eye brow pencils throughout my life. If you like the more &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34; of eyebrows, the pencil is the way to go. I have natural blonde hair and the blonde color of the Maybelline eyebrow pencil is the perfect shade for me. Not too light, not too dark. It shows good and contrasts well with my skin tone (very fair) and it still has a natural color to it. I use a liner brush and concealer to outline my eyebrows which make them look flawless. People ask me how I get my eyebrows so perfect on a regular basis. I use it every day and I have about 20 of them stocked up. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I love this shade and the texture. It has a little waxy feel. The blond is not dark at all. I simply love it. My friends always compliment me.</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for me since I am so fair!</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde hair and thus naturally blonde eyebrows. It is SO HARD to find a good eyebrow pencil for my colour.  I might have to bite the bullet and go to MAC.  These are just okay.  They&#x27;re too golden/brownish.  They always make my skin look a little bit like a fake tan if they get outside of my eyebrow hairs a little bit.  I don&#x27;t like the warmth they have.  I probably won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> I am ash blonde and have always had a hard time finding eyebrow pencils that look natural on me and would last all day. Well this one does all that! Love it, can&#x27;t do my makeup without it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Good Service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an eyebrow pencil before, but my experience with this product is great. I love it! It goes on well and lasts all day, not to mention it was a perfect match to my hair. I&#x27;m glad it came with two. It was a great deal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a pencil that doesn&#x27;t look artificially dark for my hair and complexion.  This combination works perfectly.</li>
    <li> As a grandma in her mid-60s, my naturally light brown hair has become lighter (whiter?) over the years, and my eyebrows have become thinner and lighter, as well.  I&#x27;ve always used other, more expensive brands of brow color in the lightest shades of brown I could find, always to be disappointed because they were too dark or too red.  After reading reviews on Amazon for Maybelline&#x27;s blonde pencil, I found it at my local grocery store.  The color is perfect!  If I have one complaint, it&#x27;s that the pencil is harder than any others I&#x27;ve used, but a little extra pressure when applying takes care of that. The color makes it worth 5 stars in my book!</li>
    <li> One of the better brow liners. Good staying power, precision, not to dark and not to light. Nice natural looking brow filler, although i have the blonde one and it can be a little yellow in some light. All in all, I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde and it seems stores are carrying less and less to none of these BLONDE colored pencils. I have tried the light brown and hate it for me at least, thank goodness I could find them here on AMAZON. Actually my hubby suggested I try online and stock up, so I did. Love this pencil</li>
    <li> My hair is light ash blonde &amp; these pencils are perfect! They are neither soft nor hard. They&#x27;re perfect so you are able to fill in your brows as light or dark as you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend these for light blondes!!!</li>
    <li> Previously I was using Clinique brow liner.  I liked that it was an auto-sharpening pencil, but I didn&#x27;t like the price or how quickly I went through the product.  It was hard to find an equivalent at the drugstore.  These pencils are great.  I have them in blonde which is perfect for me.  My hair is bleached platinum.  Also a benefit of not having the auto-sharpening is that they are much sharper when I sharpen so I can be more precise.  The other thing is that though these are pencils that need sharpening the product is not at all hard, which I had feared.  It is a softer consistency just like my auto-sharpening pencil was.  Overall this is a great product and a great value!  I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Will not buy again. Pencil is too soft for my liking.</li>
    <li> Great color for brunettes if you don&#x27;t want an obvious line.  Works well. Great price.  Also, two pack so you can share if you don&#x27;t need both.</li>
    <li> I had looked for this item in the local retail stores for about two years after it had been removed.  It is one of my favorite cosmetic items</li>
    <li> The color \\&quot;blond\\&quot; adds a light shade of neutral brown to my eyebrows, which are sparse and very light. I tried \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; but that color is reddish and more suitable for a redhead. These pencils last a very long time and are easy to sharpen with an ordinary hand held pencils sharpener of the one that sometimes accompanies Maybelline&#x27;s packaging. The price on Amazon was almost $1.00 less than at my local chain pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I have used these eyebrow pencils for many many years after trying every really expensive product out there with unsatisfactory results. These have become hard to find in the store and I am too busy to go running around all over town trying to find this one item. So, I am delighted to be able to buy this here AND to be placed on an auto order program! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the order.  Everything was good.</li>
    <li> Too dark for light blondes, does not look natural.  The description should of been dark blonde or taupe, this way I would not have wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Great color and applies easily. Just soft enough to go on smoothly but lightly. This is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have strawberry blonde hair and these are the best natural looking color pencils for my eyebrows!!!</li>
    <li> What would I do if I couldn&#x27;t paint my eyebrows on with these wonderful pencils!!  They work out just right for my complexion and problem.  Highly recommend them.  And, I was pleased with the service I received.</li>
    <li> I have used this for ever and I haven&#x27;t found one better</li>
    <li> The best blonde brow pencil ever!</li>
    <li> Blendable color that shapes brows and defines eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof and long wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Contact lens safe&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic&lt;br /&gt;Safe for sensitive eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife uses this everyday without any harm and it is very well priced, good buy.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and received quickly</li>
    <li> This is a nice eyebrow pencil that comes in nice colors and works fairly well on my eyebrows I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that for filling in dark brown but thinning eyebrows this is better than a darker color. It&#x27;s true. Really subtle, but dark enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not what you&#x27;d want if you want to pencil on dark eyebrows from scratch.</li>
    <li> i loved and adored the auburn one forever till they discontinued it several years ago and replaced it with the darker one and charged more. i have written so many times to them asking to reinstate the twin red ones in auburn. they won&#x27;t. no other auburn pencils work for me, all too dark.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend just bought me these eyebrow pencils from my wishlist and I feel bad that I have yet been able to use them for more than the test run. I like to go very light on the eyebrow in order to keep from having a very harsh looking brow. I don&#x27;t want my brows to be the focal point of my face. If I draw light with these pencils it looks like a red-brown. If I go nuts and draw on some scouse brows then the color seems to look more brown, but honestly I do not favor the intense brow look. I am genuinely surprised by the amount of 5 star votes. That is the only reason I decided on this pencil. Getting it now, I&#x27;m wondering what hair color these 5 star voters have or if they just favor very severe brows!</li>
    <li> I used this eyebrow pencil for more years than I can remember.  Because I have thin brows, I can not use the powders that are popular right now.  The blonde color is perfect for me.  I have tried some more expensive brands but they aren&#x27;t any better so always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> I hope they never quit making this. I shaved my eyebrows years ago for Halloween and they never grew back. I have to draw them in every day and this is the only one soft and subtle enough to look natural. It&#x27;s not too soft and creamy like some of them.</li>
    <li> These pencils work fine but be where they go on much darker than they look. The Splawn shade was too dark for me.</li>
    <li> Great for natural blonde- to define eyebrows. I&#x27;m not sure why it is advertised as also an eye liner, this isn&#x27;t dark enough to make a difference around my eyes. But it is great for blonde eyebrows. It is nice that it is a two-pack and the price is far below others like Benefit brand.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dirty blonde eyebrows and finding eyebrow pencils to match is pretty hard unless I go for the higher-end brands.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give these a shot as a more affordable option.&lt;br /&gt;They are definitely darker than expected, but if I use a very light touch they do a pretty good job in accentuating my brows.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tested wear in hot or humid weather but will update when I do.</li>
    <li> GREAT COLOR FOR LIGHT BROWN HAIRED GALS.  WISH IT DIDN&#x27;T RUB OFF EASILY WHEN I RUB MY EYE BROWS, BUT AT LEAST IT COMES OFF EASILY WITH SOAP AND WATER.</li>
