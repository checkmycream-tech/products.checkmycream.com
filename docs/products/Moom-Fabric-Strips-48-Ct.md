      <li>Otherwise, I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>These are much better than the paper strips.</li>

      <li>You need more strips than the wax gives you.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Sugar waxing is much better than regular waxing, and these strips make it more wonderful.  </li>
      <li>better bang per buck</li>
      <li>I love them and the Moom sugar waxing hair remover.</li>
      <li>love the reusability of these.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I was able to buy additional strips to cut to custom fit areas that need hair removal.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done I just rinse the strips off in warm water, and the sugar melts right off.</li>
      <li>I needed more strips than what the original Moom starter kit had.  </li>
      <li>easy to wash and easy to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just be sure to clean by hand and not by machine</li>
      <li>Reusable fabric strips are eco-friendly and easy to wash.</li>
      <li>They hold up just fine in the wash.  </li>
      <li>Washable in warm water, fast drying on a towel rack</li>
      <li>Just soak in a bowl of warm water for a couple of hours and rinse off with soap and warm water and lay out to dry on a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They did not come clean, there was still hair on them.</li>
      <li>The excess wipes off quickly with water.</li>
      <li>Definitely going to order more!</li>
      <li>Does the trick for most of the hair (except the really fine blonde ones).</li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>This is so worth it if you use the moom hair removal.</li>
      <li>The strips don&#x27;t bond with the wax and there was not enough sternght to pull the hairs effectively.</li>
      <li>Not only are these strips super easy to use, but they&#x27;re reusable!</li>
      <li>They are the right size and hold the sugar solution well without bleeding through.</li>
      <li>Very quick to use on facial hairs and does a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them for legs and arms for years and the original batch that came with the initial kit is still going strong.</li>
      <li>Very mild (my dermatologist thinks I have a sensitive skin around legs) --</li>
      <li>Great strips you can cut to size or use as large or smaller more narrow ones as they are</li>
      <li>Works exactly as described</li>
      <li>I promise no ones hair is more coarse than mine, and this works for your stubborn hair.</li>
      <li>they work great and they&#x27;re going to last a long time</li>
      <li>so I think one pack is okay and enough</li>
      <li>just ordered more of the fabric strips and a larger jar of the Moom.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>They wash easy and it&#x27;s nice to have extra on hand, especially if you&#x27;re going to do a large area like your legs or something.</li>
      <li>Good investment with the wax as well, saves money so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying more strips, you just rinse them off, they air dry within a few hours, and they&#x27;re plenty of strips to use.</li>
      <li>Strips really need to be washed before first use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty particular about my wax products.</li>
      <li>This stuff is much less painful...and easy to rinse off in cool water.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>I have been using the same strips for a long time now, they are easy to clean with Moom&#x27;s Sugar Wax.  </li>
      <li>the stripes works ok at first but still leave little pieces of thread on your skin.</li>
      <li>and they rinse out easily and dry</li>
      <li>I do have to heat it a little more than directions to liquefy it enough to apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>The new wax would remove my hair, but not all of it.</li>
      <li>Make sure you dry them flat on a towel after each use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You can also tear them easily to any size you like, I find it easier to wax by ripping them in half</li>
      <li>so if small areas are your primary area of waxing you may want to look at a package with a higher number of those.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with them is after I wash them they don&#x27;t hold onto the hair or wax as well as the first time.</li>
      <li>No waste of paper, no garbage... just soak them in hot/warm water after use and the wax dissolves, wash them with mild soap, rinse them and leave them to dry...</li>
      <li>Overall very dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
      <li>These cut down really well with pinking</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work great with the Moon waxing kit. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> they work great and they&#x27;re going to last a long time</li>
    <li> This product really works! It&#x27; a little messy and time consuming to use on legs, but well worth it. Very quick to use on facial hairs and does a fantastic job. The excess wipes off quickly with water. It is such an improvement over waxing. It doesn&#x27;t irritate. I do have to heat it a little more than directions to liquefy it enough to apply smoothly. Have to be careful not to heat too much.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered more of the fabric strips and a larger jar of the Moom. Love this product!</li>
    <li> The strips are nice but I haven&#x27;t been able to wash and reuse them. Other than that they do the job.</li>
    <li> These are much better than the paper strips. They are easier to use, handy, and most important of all they are eco-friendly!!! No waste of paper, no garbage... just soak them in hot/warm water after use and the wax dissolves, wash them with mild soap, rinse them and leave them to dry... and you can use them again and again and again. I just wish they could be washed in the washer.</li>
    <li> Sugar waxing is much better than regular waxing, and these strips make it more wonderful.  No strings to remove from the strips, and they can be washed and reused forever (well it has been forever for me).  I love them and the Moom sugar waxing hair remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty particular about my wax products. I have serious allergies to things . But this one worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> If you have dense body hair like myself, you&#x27;ll find yourself running out of fabric strips in the regular moom set.&lt;br /&gt;For better bang per buck, I recommend getting this, and a larger 12-ounce Jar of M4Men (or 2 jars), and bunch of popsicle sticks as applicators. I don&#x27;t apply a thick coating of the hair remover, but the fabric strips still get nasty with hair after 3 to 4 passes. These are long strips, so if you&#x27;re working on areas where you don&#x27;t need a long strip, you can try cutting one of these in half length - it might still work.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using with the moon wax which is hands down the least painful I have ever used.</li>
    <li> These cut down really well with pinking shears- then they won&#x27;t fray- and they rinse out easily and dry well when pressed flat between two towels.  Way better than using the Moom &#x27;pre-made&#x27; strips, which I can&#x27;t get to work for some reason.</li>
    <li> Feels like caramelized sugar. Very mild (my dermatologist thinks I have a sensitive skin around legs) -- no chemical odor/texture. Reusable fabric strips are eco-friendly and easy to wash. For those who are looking the least invasive DIY hair removal tool, this is it.</li>
    <li> Love these strips. Their sugaring formula doesn&#x27;t work perfectly for me but the strips are affordable for what quantity and quality, so I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> these strips are great for people who love to wax using strips. They are reusable and don&#x27;t leave fabric all over.</li>
    <li> Love these strips. They are the right size and hold the sugar solution well without bleeding through.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same strips for a long time now, they are easy to clean with Moom&#x27;s Sugar Wax.  Just soak in a bowl of warm water for a couple of hours and rinse off with soap and warm water and lay out to dry on a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also tear them easily to any size you like, I find it easier to wax by ripping them in half and some more in thinner strips for more define waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to clean by hand and not by machine and you&#x27;ll get many years of use out of them.</li>
    <li> you can wash them with losing fibers so it well last forever. the quantity is also good so I think one pack is okay and enough</li>
    <li> This is so worth it if you use the moom hair removal. No other strip have worked with it other than this.</li>
    <li> Sooooo many! Washable with just water!</li>
    <li> Washable in warm water, fast drying on a towel rack and they work great with Moom&#x27;s tea tree oil sugar hair remover.  Recommend it for all waxing needs.</li>
    <li> No complaints, works as they should</li>
    <li> Great products. love the reusability of these. easy to wash and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These strips are great. You can use them with either the Moom or making your own sugar wax. They are well made (basically unbleached muslin) and with the Moom or your own sugar wax you can rinse them out and reuse. About the only thing I could add would be there are a limited number of the small strips in the package so if small areas are your primary area of waxing you may want to look at a package with a higher number of those.</li>
    <li> This MOOM product was exactly as described and is a truly great product. Works exactly as described and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> Best and easiest hair removal system, I have used on my sensitive skin. Still not perfect but much easier and less intrusive than waxing!</li>
    <li> the stripes works ok at first but still leave little pieces of thread on your skin. And as soon as you wash them, they fall apart.....</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I was able to buy additional strips to cut to custom fit areas that need hair removal. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Good investment with the wax as well, saves money so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying more strips, you just rinse them off, they air dry within a few hours, and they&#x27;re plenty of strips to use.</li>
    <li> I have very, very coarse hair. No wax could ever remove my hair, but I found one. The new wax would remove my hair, but not all of it. I decided to reseach my strips, and went with moom. After trying this, I will no longer use another strip again. The best by far! Between the honey wax and the moom strips I have done the impossible. I promise no ones hair is more coarse than mine, and this works for your stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> These strips work well (with the MOOM was, I don&#x27;t know about other products).  They hold up just fine in the wash.  No problems.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Not only are these strips super easy to use, but they&#x27;re reusable! Can&#x27;t complain about that! I especially love that all you have to do is rinse them off when you&#x27;re done. Couldn&#x27;t have made the process any easier. I will absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked fine! Directions say you can wash them after use; I don&#x27;t bother because too messy. I suppose if I bought a separate basin to soak them in.... Definitely going to order more!</li>
    <li> Great strips you can cut to size or use as large or smaller more narrow ones as they are</li>
    <li> Strips really need to be washed before first use.  Mine came with a lot of muslin dust fabric shed in the package.  Other than that they are sturdy and I recommend</li>
    <li> I tried to wash these, what a joke!! They did not come clean, there was still hair on them. Waste of $$$......</li>
    <li> if you have a moom body sugaring kit, these are great. They wash easy and it&#x27;s nice to have extra on hand, especially if you&#x27;re going to do a large area like your legs or something.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll get 36 Body-sized and 12 face-sized washable reusable application strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used everything but epilators and have decided on waxing as my go-to method. No allergies (thank you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips adhere to Moom better and pull hair way better than the paper-synthetic ones you may get at a drugstore. I&#x27;ve used them for legs and arms for years and the original batch that came with the initial kit is still going strong. I just wanted extras so this is a good investment for those who wax often.</li>
    <li> Does the trick for most of the hair (except the really fine blonde ones). The overall process is as messy as one might anticipate.</li>
    <li> This stuff is much less painful...and easy to rinse off in cool water. Way easier than wax. Only slight redness. I would have given 5 stars. But, it seems it does miss some hairs. Don&#x27;t know for sure. But, maybe its just me. Otherwise, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I needed more strips than what the original Moom starter kit had.  I purchased these and have no problems.  Had no problems with shipping or the shipper.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt, but didn&#x27;t work, either.</li>
    <li> I started making my own &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; (from sugar, water, and lemon juice), and this works great with it. The was recipe claimed you didn&#x27;t need any strips to use it, but I used it both with and without strips, depending on the area I was waxing. Since its sugar based, I heat it a little, apply like a soft wax, use the clothe strips, and voilà!  When I&#x27;m done I just rinse the strips off in warm water, and the sugar melts right off. I then stick them in my wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have found is that they tend to wrinkle a lot when washed. If I had time, I might iron them to make them easier to apply. It&#x27;s really not a big issue for me, though.</li>
    <li> Overall very dissapointed with this purchase. The strips don&#x27;t bond with the wax and there was not enough sternght to pull the hairs effectively. I am not sure why other people gave high rating for this product. Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Doesn&#x27;t pull up thick hairs.</li>
    <li> These are great strips!  You need more strips than the wax gives you.  The will wash up several times.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I love these strips! The only problem I have with them is after I wash them they don&#x27;t hold onto the hair or wax as well as the first time. If someone has a tip for washing I&#x27;d be grateful for it!</li>
    <li> I bought the starter kit a little while ago and found that when I waxed my legs I didn&#x27;t have enough strips which is why I bought these extra. I love that the strips are reusable and I will never have to buy more. Make sure you dry them flat on a towel after each use. Great product, thanks Moom!</li>
