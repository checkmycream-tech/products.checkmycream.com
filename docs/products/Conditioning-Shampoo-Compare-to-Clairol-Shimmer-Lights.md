### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the flip side, I had a friend who let it soak in their hair overnight in order to PURPOSELY color their hair lilac, and it worked flawlessly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about Clairol shimmer lights</li>
      <li>Happy toning and brightening ladies.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>so I was happy that this GVP shampoo did not smell as strongly.  </li>
      <li>It honestly looks so pretty and feels great!</li>
      <li>so I have to make sure I pair it with a good conditioner, (preferably a toning one as well)</li>
      <li>so make sure you use a really good conditioner, preferably one with moroccan argan oil like Tresemme.</li>
      <li>I use it about once a week to keep that nice silver sheen to my hair.</li>
      <li>well worth the money!!!</li>
      <li>but all in all this is really not bad and the price is great.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best shampoo for my bleached platinum hair, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of purple shampoos.</li>
      <li>It was also filled all the way to the top!</li>
      <li>and I was going to purchase it from amazon to hopefully save some money and ended up with GVP Conditioning Shampoo to save even more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok with that.  </li>
      <li>Have used it for years and love the effect on whiteness of my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did it, but it seemed like my hair was getting yellow-ey as the days passed.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review after using it for a week :)</li>
      <li>Excellent for grey hair, or to remove the brass look from colored hair.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly though, it works, it took away the yellow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s plenty purple which is the most important thing for a toning shampoo.</li>
      <li>Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights shampoo works fine</li>
      <li>I also use sulfate and paba free products.  </li>
      <li>I have really light blond dyed hair.  </li>
      <li>it turns my hair a light lilac in a patchy way.</li>
      <li>and you really can&#x27;t beat the price! :)</li>
      <li>I was going to buy the original clairol shimmer lights</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it</li>
      <li>It actually is super conditioning.</li>
      <li>(I washed quickly) and your crown doesn&#x27;t turn purple.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll keep your hair soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>I just used it this morning, and I can officially say that I am loving being blonde now.</li>
      <li>Anyways, I highly recommend this shampoo for light blondes and my silver haired ladies.</li>
      <li>Coming out of the salon, my hair was a beautiful light blonde, getting darker as it came to my ends because of the leftover dye I had from previous dye jobs; it looked like a reverse ombre.</li>
      <li>this shampoo helping with lifting the bronze from my hair and only too 4 washes to make it white great work</li>
      <li>This product has done a pretty desent job.</li>
      <li>Overall it works just as well as its corresponding name-brand products, and is a much better bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to any blonde :)</li>
      <li>(and I guess if I had to describe the smell, it&#x27;s like a mix of chemicals and cheap old lady perfume)</li>
      <li>but this generic version tones my hair better and makes it way softer.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo for getting out those yellow tones in grey and white hair, that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t leave it in too long or your hair will turn a silvery purple.</li>
      <li>The last dye I used washed out very quickly</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t stick to certain patches of hair.</li>
      <li>It takes a large quantity in order to get bubbles and suds</li>
      <li>This product works really well at what it&#x27;s made to do: lighten your bleached hair and help to remove coppery/ brassy tones.</li>
      <li>(Oh yes, the product seemed very drying to my hair despite use of conditioners afterward.)</li>
      <li>I usually bought it from Sally&#x27;s, but when I moved to a new city that did not have a Sally&#x27;s, I looked online and found this even better deal!</li>
      <li>I think once I receive my TIGI Bed Head Dumb Blonde Reconstructor to use with this product, my hair will be back to perfect health!</li>
      <li>and they cost a lot more for a small bottle.</li>
      <li>I mixed this and my normal shampoo and let it sit in my hair for about 5 minutes while I showered, followed with a deep conditioner, and now my hair is a lovely soft cooler toned blonde, which is what I was striving for when I went to the salon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this because I was tired of paying the higher price for the brand name shimmer lights product.  </li>
      <li>But I noticed that a few days after getting it done, it started getting more of a dark blonde, turning into even a light orange</li>
      <li>This is a generic product, but it compares very well to a name brand.</li>
      <li>But, I did read another review that said their hair was too soft afterwards...</li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo that I have used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
      <li>I recently went all out and decided to go blonde for the first time ever.</li>
      <li>This shampoo comes in a large bottle and it lasts a long time...</li>
      <li>I carefully read the instructions (followed them exactly) and everything written on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>This morning and all day today my scalp feels like it has a major sunburn</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only shampooed my hair with this twice so far</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it leaves my hair kind of brittle or dry after leaving it in for awhile as was suggested on a few sites.</li>

<li> My only complaint is that it leaves my hair kind of brittle or dry after leaving it in for awhile as was suggested on a few sites.</li>
<li> If i recall correctly i am almost positive it did this to me in the past</li>
<li> I have been wanting to go blonde for a long time so last week</li>
<li> if I leave it in too long, don&#x27;t distribute it evenly, or use it daily</li>
<li> I used this once, so far, and while I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in shine, I think it may have actually made my silvery salt and pepper hair a little darker.</li>
<li> My natural hair color is black</li>
<li> I rarely use this product seeing that i went back to natural dirty blonde color...</li>
<li> Make sujre not to leave it in too long</li>
<li> I have used the Clairol shimmer lights for a long time just because I&#x27;m in cosmetology school</li>
<li> But i just wanted to state that i recently ran out of my other shampoo</li>
<li> However, for my hair all purple shampoos make my hair feel dry even after conditioning and this was no exception.</li>
<li> I recommend using it only a few times a week, and focusing it only on roots, because it sometimes will take my ends to lilac since they are already toned.</li>
<li> platinum, bleach blond hair and this dark purple shampoo truly helps to tone the yellow tones out of my hair.</li>
<li> but I read reviews on the generic version which was about half the price and decided to save some money.</li>
<li> my regular Martix Essentials Amplify root lifter 3 volumizer applied as usual after rinse and dry, I couldn&#x27;t do anything with my hair, it just wanted to lay flat</li>
<li> Be warned, the purple will stick to your hair if you let it sit in too long, and you may end up with a purpley glow on your locks for a few days.</li>
<li> Other well- known \\&quot;Brand Name\\&quot; products work,too, but not as well</li>
<li> You might want to check a small area before using on your entire head....</li>
<li> It leaves my hair feeling a little dry</li>
<li> It is working well to keep my highlights from turning red and/or dull.</li>
<li> The past shampoos I tried turned my hair purple and DRY.  </li>
<li> I ALWAYS am very careful to not get hair products in my eyes, but in the shower I accidentally got a little of the product in one eye.  </li>
<li> I like this shampoo, this generic brand is not different at all from the brand name in my opinion, just less expensive.  </li>
<li> But the worst part was that it made my fine hair so soft it was limp and even with</li>
<li> no matter my dry with round brush as usual, or even putting it on velcro rollers and spraying with Ion shaping spray.</li>
<li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, although it maybe a little \\&quot;chemically\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Only works on newly bleached/porous hair :(</li>
<li> However, the eye is still red, and it has resumed slight burning and bad itching.  </li>
<li> so well I hardly need to use conditioner.</li>
<li> It immediately began to painfully burn and despite my flushing the eye with water for several minutes, it continued to burn for hours.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m a poor college student.</li>
<li> Just like the expensive stuff.</li>
<li> However, for a broke student with lots of bills to pay, $15 a bottle wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
<li> I hated the smell of the brand name product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent for grey hair, or to remove the brass look from colored hair.  This is a generic product, but it compares very well to a name brand.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I was going to buy the original clairol shimmer lights but I read reviews on the generic version which was about half the price and decided to save some money. I&#x27;ve only shampooed my hair with this twice so far but I can see the difference. My natural hair color is black but I&#x27;ve bleached it and have been dying it red for awhile now. The last dye I used washed out very quickly so I decided to go blonde instead. This is the first shampoo that I have used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. It actually is super conditioning. It has lightened the orange tones about 1 1/2 shades per wash. I started out strawberry blonde and am now about a medium ash blonde, no bleach. Keep in mind that this is not a lightener, it only repairs damaged hair and takes away brassiness (orange and yellow) tones in your hair. I think once I receive my TIGI Bed Head Dumb Blonde Reconstructor to use with this product, my hair will be back to perfect health!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd purple shampoo I have tried.  I have really light blond dyed hair.  The past shampoos I tried turned my hair purple and DRY.  This one keeps the hair feeling NOT like straw (I washed quickly) and your crown doesn&#x27;t turn purple.  My daily regimen is WEN.  I also use sulfate and paba free products.  This is not.  I&#x27;m ok with that.  I like the results.  I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I rarely use this product seeing that i went back to natural dirty blonde color... But i just wanted to state that i recently ran out of my other shampoo and i used this just to wash .. Not to lighten... This morning and all day today my scalp feels like it has a major sunburn and it hurts to brush hair... You might want to check a small area before using on your entire head.... I left shampoo in for a couple minutes before rinsing... If i recall correctly i am almost positive it did this to me in the past but i am just now putting 2 + 2 together...</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3 years. I usually bought it from Sally&#x27;s, but when I moved to a new city that did not have a Sally&#x27;s, I looked online and found this even better deal! I have platinum, bleach blond hair and this dark purple shampoo truly helps to tone the yellow tones out of my hair. A word of advice...if I leave it in too long, don&#x27;t distribute it evenly, or use it daily it turns my hair a light lilac in a patchy way. I recommend using it only a few times a week, and focusing it only on roots, because it sometimes will take my ends to lilac since they are already toned. It takes a large quantity in order to get bubbles and suds so it doesn&#x27;t stick to certain patches of hair. Overall it works just as well as its corresponding name-brand products, and is a much better bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, I had a friend who let it soak in their hair overnight in order to PURPOSELY color their hair lilac, and it worked flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I recently went all out and decided to go blonde for the first time ever. Coming out of the salon, my hair was a beautiful light blonde, getting darker as it came to my ends because of the leftover dye I had from previous dye jobs; it looked like a reverse ombre. But I noticed that a few days after getting it done, it started getting more of a dark blonde, turning into even a light orange and so I looked up some purple shampoos. I actually got my bottle at Sally&#x27;s after researching some possible things. It&#x27;s the second day using it and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair getting lighter. I&#x27;ll update this review after using it for a week :) It is quite drying on the hair so make sure you use a really good conditioner, preferably one with moroccan argan oil like Tresemme. It&#x27;ll keep your hair soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to go blonde for a long time so last week I took a day and went through a three hour bleaching and toning process to make it happen! I&#x27;m glad I did it, but it seemed like my hair was getting yellow-ey as the days passed. I started to research purple shampoos and remembered that my stylist recommended to me shimmering lights. I went to the nearest Sally&#x27;s and came across the generic brand and went with that since it was cheaper and I&#x27;m a poor college student. I just used it this morning, and I can officially say that I am loving being blonde now. I mixed this and my normal shampoo and let it sit in my hair for about 5 minutes while I showered, followed with a deep conditioner, and now my hair is a lovely soft cooler toned blonde, which is what I was striving for when I went to the salon. It honestly looks so pretty and feels great! Would recommend this to any blonde :)</li>
    <li> Only works on newly bleached/porous hair :(</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, this generic brand is not different at all from the brand name in my opinion, just less expensive.  For someone with &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hair, the shimmer lights takes out any yellowing that can happen from treated water etc.  I use it about once a week to keep that nice silver sheen to my hair.</li>
    <li> this shampoo helping with lifting the bronze from my hair and only too 4 washes to make it white great work</li>
    <li> Neat, but time consuming</li>
    <li> It keeps my white hair white</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to maintain my blond color job....was recommended by a hair stylist.  I carefully read the instructions (followed them exactly) and everything written on the bottle.  No warnings on the bottle.  I ALWAYS am very careful to not get hair products in my eyes, but in the shower I accidentally got a little of the product in one eye.  It immediately began to painfully burn and despite my flushing the eye with water for several minutes, it continued to burn for hours.  The next morning my eye was swollen almost shut and my vision was blurred.  I used Benadryl and eye drops and after 3 days it started to improve.  However, the eye is still red, and it has resumed slight burning and bad itching.  I have an appointment with a doctor today......beware! (Oh yes, the product seemed very drying to my hair despite use of conditioners afterward.)</li>
    <li> This product has done a pretty desent job. I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about Clairol shimmer lights and I was going to purchase it from amazon to hopefully save some money and ended up with GVP Conditioning Shampoo to save even more lol.&lt;br /&gt; It arrived on time and was neatly packaged. It was also filled all the way to the top! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, although it maybe a little \\&quot;chemically\\&quot;. Most importantly though, it works, it took away the yellow.&lt;br /&gt; My only complaint is that it leaves my hair kind of brittle or dry after leaving it in for awhile as was suggested on a few sites. I&#x27;ve been using Joico K-Pak shampoo and conditioner and that has helped a lot with the breakage. I wash once a week with Gvp and i&#x27;ts kept the yellow out and I can&#x27;t ask for more than that. The bottle is so big I can see it lasting me a year.&lt;br /&gt; Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and you really can&#x27;t beat the price! :)</li>
    <li> Just like the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for getting out those yellow tones in grey and white hair, that I have ever used. Other well- known \\&quot;Brand Name\\&quot; products work,too, but not as well and they cost a lot more for a small bottle. This shampoo comes in a large bottle and it lasts a long time...well worth the money!!! I recommend it to everyone who asks me, \\&quot;what do you do to your hair that makes it so shinny and silver?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have used the Clairol shimmer lights for a long time just because I&#x27;m in cosmetology school and it was recommended to me by my instructor. However, for a broke student with lots of bills to pay, $15 a bottle wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I just recently switched over to the Generic brand and to me it works just the same. However, for my hair all purple shampoos make my hair feel dry even after conditioning and this was no exception. But, I did read another review that said their hair was too soft afterwards...I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible but, I guess so. Anyways, I highly recommend this shampoo for light blondes and my silver haired ladies. Be warned, the purple will stick to your hair if you let it sit in too long, and you may end up with a purpley glow on your locks for a few days. This however hasn&#x27;t been a problem with the generic for me yet. I haven&#x27;t left it on longer than the suggested 3-5 on the back of the bottle. Happy toning and brightening ladies.</li>
    <li> This product works really well at what it&#x27;s made to do: lighten your bleached hair and help to remove coppery/ brassy tones. Make sujre not to leave it in too long or you&#x27;ll end up with lavender bits like I did. xD</li>
    <li> I used this once, so far, and while I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in shine, I think it may have actually made my silvery salt and pepper hair a little darker. But the worst part was that it made my fine hair so soft it was limp and even with my regular Martix Essentials Amplify root lifter 3 volumizer applied as usual after rinse and dry, I couldn&#x27;t do anything with my hair, it just wanted to lay flat no matter my dry with round brush as usual, or even putting it on velcro rollers and spraying with Ion shaping spray. I believe I will return for refund and keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this because I was tired of paying the higher price for the brand name shimmer lights product.  I hated the smell of the brand name product so I was happy that this GVP shampoo did not smell as strongly.  (and I guess if I had to describe the smell, it&#x27;s like a mix of chemicals and cheap old lady perfume) It&#x27;s plenty purple which is the most important thing for a toning shampoo. It helps take the yellow tones out of blond hair, (and is a must for anyone going for white hair.) It leaves my hair feeling a little dry so I have to make sure I pair it with a good conditioner, (preferably a toning one as well) but all in all this is really not bad and the price is great.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and love the effect on whiteness of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo for my bleached platinum hair, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of purple shampoos. Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights shampoo works fine but this generic version tones my hair better and makes it way softer. It conditions my hair so well I hardly need to use conditioner. Just make sure you don&#x27;t leave it in too long or your hair will turn a silvery purple.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this product after I got blonde highlights.  It is working well to keep my highlights from turning red and/or dull.</li>
