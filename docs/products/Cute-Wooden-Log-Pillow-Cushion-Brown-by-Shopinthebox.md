<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had tiny holes in it..leaked out the silicone beads</li>
    <li> Coolest pillow. Very comfy, flexible and often get compliments/questions about it.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a few months.</li>
    <li> The color scheme and log design is exactly what I was seeking.  The pillow is very flimsy.  I would prefer something as nice looking, but much firmer.  I need a back and side support while sitting on my sofa.</li>
    <li> The last two ordered were gifts. I already have four (4) for myself!</li>
    <li> Just what my son wanted. He loves it. However, the seams could have been stronger. I had to repair it 5minutes after he got it.</li>
    <li> Not as realistic as I would have liked, but soft and cuddly</li>
    <li> Very cute and good lumbar support.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> It comes from China. Came within the time frame given. It is cute and the size I expected. My only complaint is that it does have a strong chemical stench. It&#x27;s almost nauseating, even after spraying it with Febreeze. I bought it for my 5 year old&#x27;s forest themed room. It&#x27;s more of a decoration than a play thing since it smells so strong.</li>
    <li> They are cute, they are soft but it didn&#x27;t really state why they are a green product. Also, the sticking came undone and the stuffing fell out I  had to sew it back together. The price is good I&#x27;ve seen these at the store for twice the price. Also the shipping takes a long time</li>
    <li> Ordered 2, seam broke on 1 had to be sewn shut</li>
    <li> Perfect for my woodland theme back patio.  Also gave one to everyone in our camping group to use with their sleeping bag.  It makes sleeping on a log so very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Item is very small and not what it seems. This is more like a small bean bag not a pillow.</li>
    <li> This pillow is very soft and great quality. No matter you put in sofa or in car,it is very easy to carry.Creative item, I like it.</li>
    <li> My son loved it for his bear bedroom.</li>
    <li> Cheap.  Seams came apart within  a few weeks.  Smelled really bad too but that finally went away.</li>
    <li> poor quality..had to throw it away 2 weeks after getting it</li>
    <li> So cute and useful too!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever lost money on.  I would give it a minus five stars if I could, it is so bad.  It stinks to high heaven throughout the whole pillow, smells like something toxic.  i am afraid to even bring it in my house.  Plus the coloring is so hideous, very unlike the picture.  The ends are very, very orange and orange permeates the background of the whole log look.  Cheapest material in the world, so flimsy.  If you have ever paid attention to a bad review, pay especially good attention to this one, because I am usually generous with my reviews and try to cut some slack.  But with this item that would be impossible.  Needless to say it is in the trash.  A feral cat wouldn&#x60;t even sleep on it.</li>
    <li> Used as a back pillow for sitting..excellent!</li>
    <li> I wish the fabric was nicer - it&#x27;s kind of slippery and cheap.</li>
    <li> This pillow is not filled with micro-beads, as written in the product description. It is literally as hard as a log, and took FOREVER to arrive, but I was refunded my money.</li>
    <li> Not only is this pillow fun... it&#x27;s very comfortable!</li>
    <li> Great. Not much structure but looks great and somewhat functional.</li>
    <li> If you buy this pillow be prepared to open it and restuff it yourself! The stuffing inside is very sparse and starts to disappear after using!!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews at all. This pillow does not stink. Maybe someone got one from a bad batch? All I know, is that I LOVE this thing. I sleep on it every night, and my boyfriend used to try to steal it from me all the time! It&#x27;s super comfy. My only complaint is that there could be more filling. It gets a little flat after awhile, but still comfortable!</li>
