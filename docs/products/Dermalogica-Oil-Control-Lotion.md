      <li>I have lupus and have fought butterfly rosacea for a number of years and tried many products and while this is not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; it has done the best to balance keeping my face moisturized while minimizing the oil that can cause acne.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum</li>

      <li>You&#x27;ll have to put on a dab of face lotion to get rid of the residue but overall still great product.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used several of their products and this is one of the most accurate.</li>

      <li>When I ran out recently it took me awhile to order some more.</li>
      <li>You get wonderful oil control and it lasts you a long time because you need very little of it each morning.</li>
      <li>Felt very comfortable all day long.</li>
      <li>Some difference, not dramatic though, in oiliness on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
      <li>Too much just flakes.</li>
      <li>Very embarrassing.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and was hoping this lotion would make a difference.</li>
      <li>The oil control lotion has really worked to reduce the oiliness.</li>
      <li>i do the whole system and use them with my clarisonic brush.</li>
      <li>I have VERY oily skin and this lotion helps reduce the appearance its oiliness and it also helps control it.</li>
      <li>very light.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Often times too much lotion came out, so I felt like I was wasting it.  </li>
      <li>I hope they put it in a different kind of bottle in the future.</li>
      <li>This product really helped clear up my skin (oil and acne - specifically in the T-zone) - it feels extremely light-weight when you apply it, and at first I was skeptical that it would provide any kind of moisturizing at all, but it&#x27;s surprisingly efficacious and long-lasting.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole Medibac line</li>
      <li>Highly recommended mositurize for oily &amp; acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>It seems kind of expensive, but once you put it on your face and wait 1 minute you see and feel how worth it is!</li>
      <li>and it comes back pretty fast after washing my face</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this lotion.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive oily skin give this a try.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give too much moisture, just enough to heal rawness and redness.</li>
      <li>oh so soft...</li>
      <li>I decided to give the entire Medibac system a try and am noticing a huge improvement on my skin that other products (including Jan Marini) couldn&#x27;t touch.</li>
      <li>I have a very oily &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; and nothing really seemed to work to help reduce this oiliness, especially at the end of a long work day.</li>
      <li>The first few times I squeezed it, a ton of lotion came out that I ended up wasting because it was way too much for my face.</li>
      <li>When I first got this, I tried to use it only on my T-zone, but I didn&#x27;t notice that big of difference on the T-zone.  </li>
      <li>There are no other products that work like this line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a squeeze bottle, so at first I had hard time controlling how much lotion I dispense when I squeezed it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for my adult acne.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes skin but haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference other than that.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion, but as someone else said before, the bottle is not useful.</li>
      <li>Squeeze it gently without holding the bottle upside down.</li>

    <li> I do not have a dermalogica dealer in my town, so if I wait until the last minute to order, I have to use something else, which usually sends my skin for a loop. If I ever decide to \\&quot;try\\&quot; something else, I always come back to dermalogica. It has been my favorite for years. I will always use dermalogica. Nothing compares!</li>
    <li> I have a very oily &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; and nothing really seemed to work to help reduce this oiliness, especially at the end of a long work day. Very embarrassing. The oil control lotion has really worked to reduce the oiliness. I have been using it for about a month and the lotion has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the perfect moisturizer for balancing problematic, acne-prone, oily, sensitive, hormonal, reactive skin. It doesn&#x27;t give too much moisture, just enough to heal rawness and redness. It also seems to normalize the skin pH so that it doesn&#x27;t get too oily or too dry. I can&#x27;t live without this lotion. I pray that they never discontinue it! My skin stays perfect as long as I use it. I&#x27;ve tried oil-free moisturizers from Shideido, Dr Brandt, Bliss, Clinique, Philosophy, etc, and this is BY FAR the best at regulating sebum and keeping skin clear without irritation.</li>
    <li> It seems kind of expensive, but once you put it on your face and wait 1 minute you see and feel how worth it is! It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had! It&#x27;s not greasy, and it makes your skin feel SO much better! I&#x27;m really happy with it and I would give it a 10 if I could!</li>
    <li> Hard to say if my skin is any less oily than before I started using this moisturizer. If there was any effect, it didn&#x27;t begin until several weeks after I started using it. I use this moisturizer twice a day, right after washing my face with Dermalogica&#x27;s Skin Clearing Wash (the gel one). Probably will not re-purchase when I run out. But it does make my skin feel oh so soft...</li>
    <li> i really love the dermalogica brand. i do the whole system and use them with my clarisonic brush. great for oily skin</li>
    <li> I started using this when it first arrived at my doorstep and it works great. I always had a shiny oily forehead through out the day but with this product no more shine. The only down side is the residue form the product on occasion. You&#x27;ll have to put on a dab of face lotion to get rid of the residue but overall still great product.</li>
    <li> I can go the entire day w/o blotting my face b/c of this product!  I am also acne-prone, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.  There is a little bit of salicylic acid in it, so that is probably why.  I have noticed that the acid does dry my skin out a little bit, but not to the point where my skin is flaky and I can&#x27;t apply make-up.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does. I&#x27;ve used several of their products and this is one of the most accurate. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but rather alternate it with my every day moisturizer as a supplement.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 7 months. When I ran out recently it took me awhile to order some more. I haven&#x27;t been using this product for about three weeks now and my skin is no different (actually it might be looking a bit better). I have combination skin and am prone to brake outs on my chin with some minor blemishes on my cheeks from time to time. This lotion has salicylic acid in it which is supposed to be good for acne prone skin. My breakouts never improved while using this product and now that I&#x27;ve discontinued using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference except that my skin actually seems to be looking clearer. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be restocking this item in my medicine cabinet since I never saw an improvement in my skin while using it. I&#x27;m still using Active Moist as my general facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Controls oil all day and prevents breakouts.  I had an issue with my skin getting oily during the day.  I use Active Moist then Oil Control lotion.  I never have a problem with oil skin anymore.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended mositurize for oily &amp; acne prone skin. Pricy product. Shopped around to get the best price.   Make up goes on easy with out smearing. Lasts all day</li>
    <li> I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I combine it with the clay cleanser and the cleanser I definitely give 5 stars. I have oily skin and it comes back pretty fast after washing my face so I tried this. It will keep the freshly washed feeling for a while but I can&#x27;t see any substantial difference as after 3-4 hours my skin is shiny again. No harm from the product, just no results for me personally either. Skin types differ, so it may work for you and I&#x27;m definitely still sticking with the brand, I&#x27;ll just try something else.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see an oil control product that was more clean, not loaded with chemicals, or parabens, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t shine free from the start, &amp; after an hour or two, I was blotting oil like usual.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see the positive reviews, and willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It would&#x27;ve been nice to have to have in my teen years, the salicylic acid probably would&#x27;ve helped with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time to work. I only used it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give it another try before giving up on it.&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to try it, use a light applicaton. Too much just flakes.</li>
    <li> Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it after the gel mattifier.</li>
    <li> One of the few lotions that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. If you have sensitive oily skin give this a try.</li>
    <li> Very effective lightweight oil control lotion that caused no skin irritation or breakouts. Felt very comfortable all day long. I wore it under the oil-free matte foundation also sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help and in the end felt like I wasted a lot of money</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I tried to use it only on my T-zone, but I didn&#x27;t notice that big of difference on the T-zone.  So, I started using it on all my face.  This works better as a moisturizer than an oil controller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Pros&lt;br /&gt;- very light.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on my skin without stickiness, and gets absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- Some difference, not dramatic though, in oiliness on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t like the bottle.  It&#x27;s a squeeze bottle, so at first I had hard time controlling how much lotion I dispense when I squeezed it.  Often times too much lotion came out, so I felt like I was wasting it.  Squeeze it gently without holding the bottle upside down.</li>
    <li> This product really helped clear up my skin (oil and acne - specifically in the T-zone) - it feels extremely light-weight when you apply it, and at first I was skeptical that it would provide any kind of moisturizing at all, but it&#x27;s surprisingly efficacious and long-lasting. I can only use it in the humid summer months when I struggle with oil and breakouts though, it&#x27;s not for people with normal/dry skin and acne problems (it&#x27;s a shame Dermatologica doesn&#x27;t have a range for this population subsection). I found the face-wash (medibac) to be too harsh, especially along with the moisturizer (all of the products contain salicylic acid, which I find to be excessive) - I would recommend a gentle cleanser to use along with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product of Dermalogica and it&#x27;s worth every penny. You get wonderful oil control and it lasts you a long time because you need very little of it each morning. And it does work. I buy mine once every three months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole Medibac line and I love it. I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for my adult acne. I love the way this Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling clean and light as though I&#x27;ve put nothing on it. I was nervous at first using a moisturizer because others are often way too heavy and thick. I decided to give the entire Medibac system a try and am noticing a huge improvement on my skin that other products (including Jan Marini) couldn&#x27;t touch.</li>
    <li> This I the perfect stuff for your face to keep that shine away for dinner and drink out all evening! I don&#x27;t recommend it for all day wear as it doesn&#x27;t provide a good moisturing like you should have. But after an evening shower on your way out to town it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily skin and this lotion helps reduce the appearance its oiliness and it also helps control it. With other lotions my skin would look and get oily by noon, but this lotion seems to work all day when controlling the oiliness. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> I have (or I should say had) oily skin.  I use this in conjunction with the Dermalogica mattifier and I must say my face stays oil free all day.  Don&#x27;t let the little bottle make you not purchase this.  You only need a couple drops making this bottle last you several months.  Amazon always has the lowest price compared to anywhere else that sells Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, but as someone else said before, the bottle is not useful. The first few times I squeezed it, a ton of lotion came out that I ended up wasting because it was way too much for my face. Since then I squeeze very lightly. I squeeze for a while and nothing, squeeze a little harder, nothing. Squeeze a little harder and it comes spilling out once again and I waste the rest that I don&#x27;t use on my face. Even when holding it upright I either can&#x27;t get any out or I get a surplus. Otherwise it is a great product. I hope they put it in a different kind of bottle in the future.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer and changes my face&#x27;s oil output. It is great! My face feels matte and clean. Not really any fragrance at all other than a very faint, almost undetectable fresh scent. It feels slightly cool to the touch when you put it on. I love it!! It&#x27;s perfect for summer months or for every time of month during my period.</li>
    <li> I use the entire medibac Dermalogica line for years now. Nothing compares. There are no other products that work like this line. Always very impressed with their products including this oil control lotion.</li>
    <li> I have lupus and have fought butterfly rosacea for a number of years and tried many products and while this is not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; it has done the best to balance keeping my face moisturized while minimizing the oil that can cause acne.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> i think this product had been tampered with.  I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and this bottle appeared to be watered down.  Plus it did not come in a sealed box.</li>
    <li> Controls oil without drying skin.  This seems expensive, however, a little goes a long way so this small bottle lasts me several months.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes skin but haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference other than that.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and was hoping this lotion would make a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and have not seen a difference in my skin. It moisturizes, but no real effect on my oily skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it does control oil especially when used under make-up. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that have acne problems and oily skin.</li>
