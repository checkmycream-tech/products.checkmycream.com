      <li>The morning-fresh fragrance of this Shower-to-Shower is great.  </li>
      <li>We are happy to find it on Amazon, and I will be ordering again-and-again.</li>
      <li>Happy to see it available on Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Items were purchased as a gift for a friend who loved them when I presented them.</li>
      <li>and the bonus was it smelled good as well.</li>
      <li>received in good condition</li>
      <li>In addition, we never had any kind of skin reactions to it, which is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really nice scent.  </li>
      <li>It was a good price and came on time and most importantly the scent is nice and clean without being overpowering or perfumy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.</li>
      <li>If you need the convenience of home delivery, go ahead and order, otherwise, your best choice may be local.</li>
      <li>Lovely powder.</li>
      <li>I have used this product many years ago when I worked construction and sweat a lot.</li>
      <li>fragrance is a light, sweet scent that is pleasant, not over-whelming.</li>
      <li>All the products l have bought so far are great.</li>
      <li>The pack of 3 is a good offer, with a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It is a very light and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Light and airy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this powder ever since it was the only thing available in Iraq 03, while I was deployed lol, now I&#x27;m hooked on the smell, nothing is as fresh!</li>
      <li>This is a great product in the sense that it soaks up extra moisture on your body and imparts a clean, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>I also like to wear it to bed at night after my shower because it makes me feel so clean and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They were received very quickly, safely, and very well packaged.</li>
      <li>We love this specific Body Powder, because it is always refreshing and comforting.</li>
      <li>A light fragrance in a light-feeling body powder that also contains lavender - a very soothing powder to use to feel fresh and drier after a shower.  </li>
      <li>you live in a warm and/or humid climate where you can&#x27;t seem to keep dry, this is your go-to product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very grateful that Amazon carries it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>However, Shower to Shower has a much smoother, drier, silkier feel.  </li>
      <li>This is almost the only powder I use, except for White Shoulders scented powder on special occasions.  </li>
      <li>powder is gentle and soothing, after showers and baths, or anytime that your skin needs some extra care.</li>
      <li>When we have intense heat in the summer of AZ, with 3 digit temps, our skin needs extra care, especially after profuse</li>
      <li>I prefer the Morning Fresh with Lavender scent over any of the others because it&#x27;s less floral and obvious.  </li>
      <li>Very hard to find locally any more</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m hot, sweaty and miserable, and don&#x27;t have the luxury of showering right away (our summer and fall temps can get up to 110 or more), a dusting with this and a change of clothes will instantly refresh me.  </li>

<li> Tried other brands and they don&#x27;t smell like Shower to Shower, nor are they as soft.....</li>
<li> The Morning Fresh is new to us, and difficult to find in the stores.</li>
<li> I would put a small amount in my hands and dust it around my hair for several minutes then brushed my hair as I normally would.</li>
<li> It also lasts quite a long time without rubbing off.  </li>
<li> I was taking a medication that was causing my hair to fall out, especially when it was wet.</li>
<li> We like to always have this powder available at home for immediate use, especially this time of the year as we battle with brutal heat and high humidity.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I ordered the 3-pack from Amazon and it&#x27;s three 8-ounce containers for the price I would pay for three 13-ounce containers at a local discount cosmetics shop (I won&#x27;t mention the name).</li>
<li> In fact, a few of the different scents offered on Amazon, I have not yet found in any stores.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like talc because it usually globs up in the places skin touches together and creates a potential for bacterial growth.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, like some other powders do.</li>
<li> I like this particular scent and find it very difficult to locate in retail stores.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to rate body powder.</li>
<li> Lately, I have used it in my hair.</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t mean I wanted to smell like one.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any bad Shower to Shower scent</li>

    <li> The morning-fresh fragrance of this Shower-to-Shower is great.  A light fragrance in a light-feeling body powder that also contains lavender - a very soothing powder to use to feel fresh and drier after a shower.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it. It&#x27;s a simple way I pamper myself after a bath!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate body powder. It works well for my husband.</li>
    <li> This is a great product in the sense that it soaks up extra moisture on your body and imparts a clean, fresh smell. My only complaint is that I ordered the 3-pack from Amazon and it&#x27;s three 8-ounce containers for the price I would pay for three 13-ounce containers at a local discount cosmetics shop (I won&#x27;t mention the name). If you need the convenience of home delivery, go ahead and order, otherwise, your best choice may be local.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many years ago when I worked construction and sweat a lot. Just because I was working a man&#x27;s job didn&#x27;t mean I wanted to smell like one. It is a very light and fresh scent. Lately, I have used it in my hair. I was taking a medication that was causing my hair to fall out, especially when it was wet. I would put a small amount in my hands and dust it around my hair for several minutes then brushed my hair as I normally would. It helped to keep my hair cleaner longer and the bonus was it smelled good as well.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent.  Light and airy.  This is almost the only powder I use, except for White Shoulders scented powder on special occasions.  I haven&#x27;t had any bad Shower to Shower scent, I like them all.  Smaller sized container vs the 13 oz - didn&#x27;t notice until it arrived.  Seems Shower to Shower keeps going up in price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like talc because it usually globs up in the places skin touches together and creates a potential for bacterial growth.  However, Shower to Shower has a much smoother, drier, silkier feel.  It also lasts quite a long time without rubbing off.  When I&#x27;m hot, sweaty and miserable, and don&#x27;t have the luxury of showering right away (our summer and fall temps can get up to 110 or more), a dusting with this and a change of clothes will instantly refresh me.

    <li> received in good condition</li>
    <li> Tried other brands and they don&#x27;t smell like Shower to Shower, nor are they as soft.....there just is no substitute.</li>
    <li> I like this particular scent and find it very difficult to locate in retail stores.  Happy to see it available on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This powder smells great and I am very happy with my purchase. It was a good price and came on time and most importantly the scent is nice and clean without being overpowering or perfumy.</li>
    <li> All the products l have bought so far are great. All your employees are very good at their jobs. Amazon Rocks! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder ever since it was the only thing available in Iraq 03, while I was deployed lol, now I&#x27;m hooked on the smell, nothing is as fresh!</li>
    <li> Lovely powder. Very good bargain.</li>
    <li> Items were purchased as a gift for a friend who loved them when I presented them. They were received very quickly, safely, and very well packaged.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find locally any more so I&#x27;m very grateful that Amazon carries it.  Have been using this product for years and it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> We have been using this body powder for several years, but are now trying different scents. We love this specific Body Powder, because it is always refreshing and comforting. When we have intense heat in the summer of AZ, with 3 digit temps, our skin needs extra care, especially after profuse sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder is gentle and soothing, after showers and baths, or anytime that your skin needs some extra care. It doesn&#x27;t clump, like some other powders do. In addition, we never had any kind of skin reactions to it, which is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a light, sweet scent that is pleasant, not over-whelming. The Morning Fresh is new to us, and difficult to find in the stores. In fact, a few of the different scents offered on Amazon, I have not yet found in any stores. The pack of 3 is a good offer, with a reasonable price. We like to always have this powder available at home for immediate use, especially this time of the year as we battle with brutal heat and high humidity. We are happy to find it on Amazon, and I will be ordering again-and-again. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great powder with pleasant scent!</li>
