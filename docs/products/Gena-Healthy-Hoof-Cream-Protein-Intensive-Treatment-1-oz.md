      <li>it&#x27;s got an unique scent which I don&#x27;t know how to describe....</li>
      <li>Was excited to try this cream because I figured &amp;#34;if</li>
      <li>am using it at my own risk cause no instructions and on top of  it there was a tape around the jar that when you take it out takes away all the tiny letters.</li>
      <li>This is truly a great product for anyone who has dry or ragged cuticles.</li>
      <li>It keeps my cuticles soft and my nails looking healthy!  </li>
      <li>Although you do have to wait a couple weeks to see a real difference, its soooo worth it! :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good enough for a horse....</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say more about this inexpensive product that has done so much to grow my nails.</li>
      <li>&quot; It isn&#x27;t bad, exactly, it&#x27;s just a wonderful smell, lol.</li>
      <li>Not anymore, I now use HH all year long, good to strengthen nails too</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and love this stuff so far, using twice a day and even like the smell, read the reviews</li>
      <li>HIGHLY worth the four dollars for this bottle.</li>
      <li>Keeps my cuticles soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Healthy Hoof conditions my cuticles so that they are soft and look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product smells good and does tame the dryness for the moment, but in terms of genuine improvement, there has been none.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many other cuticle products, but none work as well as Healthy Hoof.</li>
      <li>The cream was just the right consistency . . .</li>
      <li>Quick shipping and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>and I will order this again like it very much..</li>
      <li>It instantly makes my cuticles look better, and it keeps them moisturized.</li>
      <li>(Gena healthy hoof cream) at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Finally I came across an article that said to look for something that contained lanolin and recommended Healthy Hoof.</li>
      <li>I buy almost everything from Amazon and this is the first time I have been so enamored with a product I felt I needed to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so glad Amazon sells it because I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local drug stores anymore!</li>
      <li>I have been using Healthy Hoof for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use Healthy Hoof regularly, my nails are stronger and will grow to approx.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t break or split if I bump them against something and for the first time</li>
      <li>My nails have never been good, and in the last few years they&#x27;ve become quite brittle and would split easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to strengthen my nails any time soon, but it is a good bed time hand cream.  </li>
      <li>It really helped when I was working</li>
      <li>This really makes your cuticles softer and it seems to be helping with nail growth.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore this stuff.</li>
      <li>and she was very pleased with it, as she has had problems in the past with fungus on feet, and this with Hoof helped prevent that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Neigh! Was excited to try this cream because I figured &amp;#34;if it&#x27;s good enough for a horse....&amp;#34; After a few days, realized it is basically Carmex for your nails, smells like menthol and has Alcohol in it. Perfect recipe if you&#x27;re trying to GET dry skin. This stuff is all hype, gallop away ye lovely mare.</li>
    <li> I found this product years ago and I&#x27;ve stuck with it. I put it on at bedtime and my cuticles look great. It really helped when I was working and my cuticles took a beating. A small jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  My cuticles are looking better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have trouble keeping your cuticles in good shape. Works well on the toenails also. Hard to find in stores so this is a great place to purchase. Quick shipping and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have the worlds worst thin, breakable nails.  I haven&#x27;t used Gena for very long but I do believe that my nails are a bit stronger.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> But a lot less money. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to strengthen my nails any time soon, but it is a good bed time hand cream.  It doesn&#x27;t soak in a quickly as the Jenna Hipp Hand and Nail Cream, but it&#x27;s thick and substantial.  You&#x27;ll feel it coming off when you wash your hand in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and cannot say that my cuticles and nails are any better off.  The product smells good and does tame the dryness for the moment, but in terms of genuine improvement, there has been none.  It leaves my fingers a bit on the sticky side which is a drawback and for the money, you would probably do just as well with almost any lotion applied throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that has cured my cracked hands and strengthened my nails... LOVE  IT!!  and it&#x27;s NOT that expensive..  it lasts a long time!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product, made my nails much stronger and help my cuticles also.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 14 year old daughter.  It works great when she uses it.  I use it sometimes.  Non greasy moisture for nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> works like a charm - on me.</li>
    <li> I was so stupid to buy the 32 oz Straight Arrow Hoofmaker protein and 1 oz of this (Gena healthy hoof cream) at the same time.  I wanted to compare these two products so I did that.  But I really should have gotten a giant jar of this and a tiny jar of the other one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this cream is much thicker which I like.  It&#x27;s the consistency of a cookie dough or roux.  it&#x27;s got an unique scent which I don&#x27;t know how to describe.... definitely not a sexy scent.  I would say it&#x27;s a little like the smell of rubber cement.  But I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to order a bunch of these as gifts.</li>
    <li> My nails have never been good, and in the last few years they&#x27;ve become quite brittle and would split easily. I had to keep them as short as possible and even so they&#x27;d break. I&#x27;ve tried taking lots of biotin and other vitamins and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products. Finally I came across an article that said to look for something that contained lanolin and recommended Healthy Hoof. I bought the 1-ounce container and used it twice a day. It took a while but by two months I could tell a difference. It&#x27;s now been three months and I hardly recognize my nails. They don&#x27;t break or split if I bump them against something and for the first time in years they are longer than the ends of my fingers. I&#x27;ve just bought the 4-ounce container because I&#x27;ve also found that the cream is wonderful for my feet - took care of my \\&quot;sandal foot\\&quot; soles in no time!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the reviews. It does help somewhat, but I can not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I buy almost everything from Amazon and this is the first time I have been so enamored with a product I felt I needed to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply the best thing I have ever used on my nails.  For years my nails split, peeled and were so weak I could bend them.  I have used this cream for a week and I cannot believe how great my nails look already.  I can still see where they had peeled before but they are bonding together with the nail underneath and becoming stronger.  They are no longer flaking, and look whiter and shiner.  Not only that, but on the way to work I just noted to myself how aged my hands are looking.  I put some of the creme on my hands and the dryness and wrinkling has gone.  I am amazed!  HIGHLY worth the four dollars for this bottle.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product seems to be doing a fine job of making my cuticles soft and not dry, however it has a medicinal type scent, so I only use it at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Yes it lasted all day - heavy...but contents worried me so I used a few times and ended up recylcing container.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and love this stuff so far, using twice a day and even like the smell, read the reviews and I will order this again like it very much..</li>
    <li> I have had terrible nails forever. They split and peel so badly I sometimes have to wear a bandaid over a nail because it is painful. I tried all of the nail strengtheners nothing worked before this.    It&#x27;s been a few months, and my nails have started growing out thick and smooth. I can&#x27;t believe it. They feel like acrylic nails. I tap them on everything. My nails used to be so thin that they would cut my skin, but now they are thick. It&#x27;s awesome -- and I&#x27;ve been telling (and showing) everyone.    And this little jar for $3 seems like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner...good product, great condition.  Small jars but are as described - 1 oz.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 10 years ago, f I stop using it I can not grow nails.  It keeps my cuticles soft and my nails looking healthy!  I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> am using it at my own risk cause no instructions and on top of  it there was a tape around the jar that when you take it out takes away all the tiny letters. don&#x27;t know how many times should be use or if it could be apply to the skin..</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and I can see a real difference in my nails. They seem thicker and stronger and have a much healthier look to them.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Can&#x27;t find it in my home town.</li>
    <li> This has really made a difference in the look and feel of my nails and cuticles.  Some of the ridging is definitely less.  I previously bought this at a local store, and the cream was very thick and pasty; I think it had been on the shelf too long.  This one that I purchased on Amazon came in a well-protected box and was wrapped in foam on the inside.  The cream was just the right consistency . . . very soft and creamy.  Highly recommend Gena Healthy Hoof and the seller!</li>
    <li> This really makes your cuticles softer and it seems to be helping with nail growth. I use it every night before bed.</li>
    <li> Could tell a difference as soon as i put it on.  After a few days I could see a difference before I put it back on.</li>
    <li> Helped my nails a great deal</li>
    <li> I usually write a review after 3 weeks or so to see actual results, but I started seeing results 4 days later. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and my nails are growing really healthy and strong. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to grow my nails and when I could they would immediately break off. Now I have to file them down every 4 days to keep them the length I like. The lotion Itself has a great consistency. Absorbs great( try not washing your hands for about 15 mins or so to allow it absorb into your skinn better). Ive read that the smell is weird but I find it pleaseant. As far as the price I dont mind it at all, this little jar will last me a long time. A little goes a long way. I do have to say that I am constantly applying which means I might get through the jar faster but I dont mind paying $3 for something that actually works. I already recommended this and would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because the nail blog that I read daily listed off a few products to buy if your nails were flakey, chipped easily, and were veeerryyy thin, just like mine. Ive been using this for a little under a month and I can already see a difference. Although you do have to wait a couple weeks to see a real difference, its soooo worth it! :)</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome. My Mom is now hooked on it too. Havent found anything else that works as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nails and cuticles. Sent one to my mom and she loves it too. Great product. Always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> I had acrylic nails from 15 to 22. Now, at 23, I finally got sick of paying someone $25+ to do my nails every two weeks. I just couldn&#x27;t afford it, honestly. As a result, my real nails were damaged badly once I removed the fake ones; they were dry, brittle, hard, cracked so easily and don&#x27;t get me started on my terrible cuticles. So I looked up ways to make my nails look better and how to prevent the painful hangnails that I was getting every week. I learned that nails and cuticles need moisture and LOTS of it. I began to hunt for products that can help me. This is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the cream isn&#x27;t terrible, but it is strong and it is unusual. I used it at work once, and my coworkers asked \\&quot;Does anybody smell that?\\&quot; It isn&#x27;t bad, exactly, it&#x27;s just a wonderful smell, lol. The cream is heavy and thick, which is great because it absorbs into the skin and actually lasts throughout the day. I wash my hands all the time at work and my nails don&#x27;t feel or look dry at all. A little bit goes a VERY LONG way so use a small amount for all 10 fingers. Trust me, you will see the difference. My nails are so much healthier, I haven&#x27;t had one break or crack in days and they are slowly growing longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to apply twice a day, AFTER you do things that involve washing your hands. I apply the product when I&#x27;m done getting ready in the morning, because I know I&#x27;ll get my hands wet with my morning routine, and again at night, right before I lay down to go to bed. Just to be clear: applying this product and then washing your hands 10 minutes after won&#x27;t really get the cream into your skin. Try not to wash your hands for AT LEAST 30 minutes after you apply it and you&#x27;ll see the affects pretty soon. :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say more about this inexpensive product that has done so much to grow my nails. I use it nightly before bedtime. My nails have grown thicker, shinier and more durable. It even eliminated painful hangnails I would get during the colder months. I can go longer in between manicures. I&#x27;ve given up nail polish, just buff &#x27;em for more shine, and I&#x27;m good to go. I type all day on a computer so all this is saying something. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that i helped with cracked/dry nailbeds and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for the first week my hands looked completely rejuvinated!&lt;br /&gt;My only compliant is that it&#x27;s very oddly textured and feels weird on your hands, almost oily? But the scent is very nice. I recommend using it twice a day. I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I first discovered it at my local Long&#x27;s Drug Store and bought it there until they changed to CVS and that was the end - the product was gone.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon is carrying it now because there is nothing else out there like it.  Most cuticle creams are way more expensive and way less effective.  This is truly a great product for anyone who has dry or ragged cuticles.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; my husband has been using it on his cuticles for years.</li>
    <li> Nothing like this cream to keep winter feet smooth and feeling great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are a teacher, nurse, gardener,baker, dish washer or anything where your hands are washed all day long. The tips of my fingers &amp; cuticles will crack &amp; bleed when I don&#x27;t use this nightly, yes the smell is weird but it only lasts a few minutes &amp; your hands will look &amp; feel amazing! I am so glad Amazon sells it because I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local drug stores anymore!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother - better off with a lanolin cream, this is a waste of time. Two months of religious use nightly, and no difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of greasy but does the job. I&#x27;m a nail biter and this doesn&#x27;t keep my cuticles in shape as much as I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s ok. A little goes a very long way so this one ounce size should last for years.</li>
    <li> I have terrible cuticles. They split and tear easily. I expected too much. You really need to be diligent using it. But if you&#x27;re diligent enough to massage cream on your cuticles every day, then any cream would probably work.</li>
    <li> So I have gained a recent obsession with my nails and want to get them to grow out longer and stronger. I purchased this item about two months ago. I put it on every night and do notice more strength in my nails. However, since my nails are thin, They still tend to break at a certain length. Also, I noticed this stuff is much more effective when applied on bare nails. I still put it on when I have nail polish on but have noticed a lack of sufficiency when I do that. I do recommend this product to anyone trying to get stronger and stiffer nails.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing,  and great price. It is thick, and not greasy. Small amount is needed to rub in cuticles and massage all over hands.  Faint scent, kind of faint lavender. Id buy again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to - unless you use it daily or every other day, can&#x27;t really tell the difference. However, the smell is really unappealing and makes me not want to use it.</li>
    <li> Good item , perfect for nail care , really like</li>
    <li> Great product.. I use it on my hands and feet.. works wonders on my cuticles..</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Pure and simple.</li>
    <li> I am using this every day and I compare it to Barielle, which is also very good,  however, this takes the cake. The smell is awesome. I love it and my cuticles have literally transformed helping me to grow my nails. I use Nailtiques, Zeva Nail Bright, and then Out the Door clear every week. At night watching tv, I put on Healthy Hoof and massage into my nails. My  hands have never looked this beautiful. I literally just ordered more.</li>
    <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years and recommend it often. It&#x27;s a little greasy going on, but it really works to heal dry and sore cuticles, so I don&#x27;t really mind the initial greasiness. I&#x27;ve used many other cuticle products, but none work as well as Healthy Hoof. I use it twice a day for a week, and I notice a big improvement in my cuticles.</li>
    <li> A great help for my nails, which tend to split.</li>
    <li> Nails are growing hard and long</li>
    <li> This is the best cuticle cream that I&#x27;ve ever found.  And I like the name.</li>
    <li> After many years, found HH again. Have been using Barielle recently, they are equally excellent. HH is a fraction of the cost. My fingers and cuticles used to get cracked in the cold weather. Not anymore, I now use HH all year long, good to strengthen nails too</li>
    <li> Very greasy.  Cant use during the day as it leaves grease marks on my clothing.  Dont really see an improvement in my nails.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years. Keeps my cuticles soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Works very well and I am pleased with the product.  The winter will be the best test because my fingers have a tendency to dry out and crack at the tips.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, believe me, and nothing has worked as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for years and my nails are strong and healthy. It only takes a small amount to get results. I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
    <li> Best for cuticles. Use every night and have been for years. Nail salon recommended this to me long ago.  Never dissapoints</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this stuff. It&#x27;s like cuticle magic. It instantly makes my cuticles look better, and it keeps them moisturized. This product shipped very quickly, and it is inexpensive. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products and spent tons of money to soften my dry cuticles and nails.  This is the only product that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably 10 years, nightly at bedtime, and it really helps strengthen my nails and keep my cuticles from tearing.  It&#x27;s probably the least expensive beauty/health product it use!</li>
    <li> I have been using Healthy Hoof for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are naturally very thin and brittle, breaking easily.  Untreated, my nails are rarely more than 1/16&amp;#34; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use Healthy Hoof regularly, my nails are stronger and will grow to approx. 1/4&amp;#34; .  There is also a marked difference in my cuticles.  Without Healthy Hoof, I will get hangnails and painful breaks in the cuticle.  Healthy Hoof conditions my cuticles so that they are soft and look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tiny bit on the end of a finger is enough to do all ten fingers.  The texture is like a heavy cream, but you need to use so little that it melts into nail &amp; skin within a minute.  One small jar will last me 4-6 months, even conditioning my nails 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t always find Healthy Hoof in the store.  In the past I tried Sally Hansen cuticle cream, but it does not work nearly as well as Healthy Hoof.</li>
    <li> this was a gift and she was very pleased with it, as she has had problems in the past with fungus on feet, and this with Hoof helped prevent that.</li>
    <li> Using for years and can&#x27;t do without</li>
    <li> My nails were always breaking , they were so thin I started to use this product and it so much  helped .5star</li>
