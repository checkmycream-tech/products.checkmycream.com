### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product smells wonderful and feels amazing on my skin.</li>
      <li>While I’m impressed with how well this product works for me, I don’t see myself spending that kind of money on a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did make my skin feel very nice.</li>
      <li>(And, the fact that it smells incredible is just a huge plus!)</li>
      <li>decided to try this toner because I have had good results with some astringent toners that contain Witch Hazel.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many skin products and always happy to find one that does not irritate.</li>
      <li>I liked this product and it seems to be good quality based on the performance.</li>
      <li>I love the floral scent!</li>
      <li>I love rose water!  </li>
      <li>in all, this is good skin toner that has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s particularly nice if chilled before applying.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s followed by witch hazel flower water, rose flower water and then alcohol.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t drying and it has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>this would  probably be a nice product for you.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t see that it *</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Witch Hazel Flower Water and Rose Flower Water are listed as from organic farming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t burn and it has a nice smell, maybe because of the rose flower water.  </li>
      <li>Initially I liked this.  </li>
      <li>Suffice it to say, that if you are sensitive to alcohols, this might not be the best skin toner for you.</li>
      <li>I almost didn&#x27;t apply moisturizer after using it because my skin felt so soft and wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for what it is, and I suppose if you&#x27;re into having the full range of Ageless La Cure products, it would make sense to purchase this?</li>
      <li>The scent is refreshing.  </li>
      <li>However over time I started getting a more drying effect than I would like.  </li>
      <li>I know that most dermatologists do not advise that their patients use a toner ...</li>
      <li>Moreover, I am sensitive/allergic to SO MANY products ...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have given it a try.</li>
      <li>It did not refresh, tone, or hydrate any better.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a truly satisfying, pampering toner...</li>
      <li>the Alaffia is extremely refreshing.</li>
      <li>However, I was hoping the aroma of rose flower water would be more noticeable, which is the primary reason I selected this item.</li>
      <li>It is relatively refreshing.</li>
      <li>I like this toner a LOT better than my good-quality but alcohol-based one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to be a staple for sure.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this toner.</li>
      <li>had never heard of this brand before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
      <li>It is quite refreshing.</li>
      <li>1 week of of morning-only use, and my skin does &#x27;feel&#x27; better to the touch.</li>
      <li>you love witch-hazel, you&#x27;ll definitely love this product.</li>
      <li>The active ingredients, witch hazel and rose water, are excellent for many uses.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a natural, organic makeup remover, then this is a good one!</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, it does tone the skin and clean pores.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pretty awesome thanks to the rose water and fades quickly, a quality I like in skincare</li>
      <li>That said, I will continue to enjoy my remaining product through most of the summer</li>
      <li>I love that it is organic, and filled with ingredients that</li>
      <li>This is a great skin toner with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to add another step to my routine, but this product does feel good on the skin.</li>
      <li>It can sometimes be a challenge to hit on just the right combination of skin products (cleanser, toner &amp; moisturizer) that will effectively cleanse my skin and not create breakouts or exacerbate problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can easily make this by yourself at home with inexpensive ingredients.</li>
      <li>active ingredients are excellent.</li>
      <li>This organic toner has some really good ingredients such as rose flower water.</li>
      <li>There was no redness and just not a single sign of my skin rejecting it, so I was happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I did like this just fine, I would recommend going with $8-9 bottle of Humphrey&#x27;s Witch hazel instead.  </li>
      <li>If you like the fragrance, chances are this will quickly become your favorite toner.</li>
      <li>However, Alaffia has huge competition in Phyto.</li>
      <li>So, it is best applied with a round cotton pad.</li>
      <li>There are lots of options available.  </li>
      <li>This gentle cleanser has a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>for the performance of the toner, I think it is a great product overall.</li>
      <li>toner has a light &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; scent that is not overpowering, with just the slightest hint of witch hazel.</li>
      <li>The primary ingredient is witch hazel.</li>
      <li>If you want a good toner, you can just buy a bottle of Witch Hazel (I love Thayers) for a third of the price.</li>
      <li>Ageless La Cure Natural Organic Hydrating Toner is a nice, refreshing product for your skin.</li>
      <li>They have multiple styles, some of which do include rose water or rose essence.</li>
      <li>The special cap makes it easy to just squirt what you need on a cotton ball.  </li>
      <li>This toner is very gentle with a very light scent.  </li>
      <li>The main ingredients are water, then witch hazel, then rose flower water.</li>
      <li>This toner is cooling, does refresh my skin, and smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem particularly hydrating.</li>
      <li>However, the incredible rose water scent and the botanicals in the Phyto are like a deep conditioning treatment for the skin, again complementing the solid gold value of the Alaffia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If they were more upfront about that, it&#x27;d get a higher rating.</li>
      <li>It is most definitely gentle and has a light, clean fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It also left a pleasant scent on my skin.</li>
      <li>The witch hazel is very calming to skin and that is the ingredient that gives the cool, refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>A good toner is essential to any skincare regime.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>Anyhow, the toner has a nice flowery scent that is typical of products that contain rose water.</li>
      <li>Also, if you regularly use products with witch hazel in them, you will definitely be able to tell that this is comprised of mostly that...</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant clean smell, but certainly not greasy or sticky at all.</li>
      <li>And, between its gentle but phenomenally effective quality, I am completely sold!</li>
      <li>It was gentle and smooth, as promised, and I felt hydrated and refreshed for hours after using.</li>
      <li>those looking for natural and/or organic products, it is impressive that 99.2% of total ingredients are of &#x27;natural&#x27; origin, with 49% from &#x27;organic&#x27; gardening.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this Ageless La Cure Natural toner.</li>
      <li>This toner leaves my skin feeling fresh, not sticky or greasy.  </li>
      <li>skin got a nice dewy look after two days of use (I apply it morning and night) and it calms irritation and redness, and definitely balances skin tone.</li>
      <li>If you’re not on a strict beauty budget then it’s certainly worth a</li>
      <li>expected a toner that contains both witch hazel and alcohol to be drying, but (surprisingly) this isn’t.  </li>
      <li>think it&#x27;s worth a try for those with a fat wallet.  </li>
      <li>Prices tend to fluctuate here on Amazon, but right now this in the $50 range.  </li>
      <li>I only tried this because I did find this line&#x27;s  moisturizer to be pretty amazing.  </li>
      <li>The main difference is Humphry&#x27;s claims to be alcohol free while this has alcohol in its ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It is by far the priciest of the toners I have tried, yet it is perhaps the most refreshing - likely because of the powerful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fact, there is little I love more than returning from a grueling run, popping out of the shower and then running a cotton pad drenched with toner over my face.</li>
      <li>The toner is easy to apply, neat, and despite the presence of alcohols, has not dried my wife&#x27;s skin out.</li>
      <li>If you can buy products that do an equally good job  at half the price there doesn&#x27;t seen to be a reason to buy this one.  </li>
      <li>and I’ve been able to incorporate it right into my regular skincare routine, which includes a retinol night cream.  </li>
      <li>product has a strong, lingering scent which I actually found a bit overpowering at first, but after using it on a regular basis for several days, I came to enjoy the smell more and more.  </li>
      <li>This toner is very gentle on the skin - you can tell that as soon as you use it.</li>
      <li>For me, more cost effective toners, with similar ingredients can be readily found, even at the local drugstore.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong medicinal smell reminiscent of poison ivy medication, but that quickly fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feels gentle for a toner that contains alcohol, but it&#x27;s really nothing special.</li>
      <li>For me, this is the first toner that did not interact with my retinoid routine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great skin toner with natural ingredients. It did make my skin feel very nice. I will not be buying this again due to cost. You can easily make this by yourself at home with inexpensive ingredients. But if you like the convenience  I highly recommend this toner.</li>
    <li> While there are some beauty products that I’m willing to splurge on, toner isn’t one of them.  I’ve tried dozens of them over the years, from the inexpensive mass market brands that you find at the drugstore all the way up to the pricey boutique brands that you can only buy from an esthetician.  While I’d give a slight nudge to the pricier “professional” brands, for the most part they all seem to perform about the same.  That being said, I’m surprised at how much I like this Phyto 5 toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected a toner that contains both witch hazel and alcohol to be drying, but (surprisingly) this isn’t.  My skin type is “normal”, with a tendency to be slightly oily in the t-zone.  This toner leaves my skin feeling soft and not at all tight, with no sticky feeling whatsoever.  It doesn’t sting or cause any irritation or redness and I’ve been able to incorporate it right into my regular skincare routine, which includes a retinol night cream.  It has a strong medicinal smell reminiscent of poison ivy medication, but that quickly fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to address the elephant in the room…this is expensive!  Prices tend to fluctuate here on Amazon, but right now this in the $50 range.  While I’m impressed with how well this product works for me, I don’t see myself spending that kind of money on a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product?  I think this will work well for oily, normal, or combination skins, but dry and/or sensitive skin types might have a problem with the alcohol.  If you’re not on a strict beauty budget then it’s certainly worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*49.4% of the total ingredients are from Organic farming&lt;br /&gt;*99.2% of the total ingredients are from natural origin</li>
    <li> While I really enjoy this product as an everyday toner, I do not find it any more moisturizing than other brands of toner. I&#x27;m not a fan of alcohol in my skincare products, and this does contain it, but it is towards the end of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is pretty awesome thanks to the rose water and fades quickly, a quality I like in skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make any problem areas worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;- Contains alcohol! Not good for a moisturizing product at all.&lt;br /&gt;- The price is steep for toner. You can probably buy all the ingredients individually for less than the retail cost of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad product and I suppose if I already liked their brand I&#x27;d probably buy this, but at this price point for such basic ingredients and a mediocre product, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone not already in love with the brand.</li>
    <li> Toner is a big part of my morning and nighttime skincare regimen. My staple has been Alaffia Coconut Water Toner sold by Whole Foods. However, Alaffia has huge competition in Phyto. On second thought, I could see using both of them in a complementary fashion, especially since the instructions aren&#x27;t kidding about the Phyto toner...you have to use a tiny drop, whereas with the Alaffia I usually saturate the Shiseido cotton pad that I use for toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phyto toner is extremely luxurious...naturally, since it&#x27;s from Switzerland. Don&#x27;t misunderstand me: the Alaffia is extremely refreshing. However, the incredible rose water scent and the botanicals in the Phyto are like a deep conditioning treatment for the skin, again complementing the solid gold value of the Alaffia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Phyto morning and evening for seven consecutive days and my dry summer skin feels softer. I also had my mother test it since we have similar skin and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: after you squeeze a dime sized drop of Phyto on your cotton pad, apply to face using the pressure of one fingertip. A dab really will do you. Phyto works gently.</li>
    <li> This gentle cleanser has a nice scent.  It left my skin feeling clean and moisturized--even without applying a moisturizer after use. It is quite refreshing.</li>
    <li> My favorite part about this toner is that there&#x27;s no burn/sting even on broken skin. There&#x27;s little scent which I also appreciate. The toner never irritated my skin, but I also haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement which makes it hard to justify the price. There are cheaper toners that have worked just as well for me.</li>
    <li> The active ingredients, witch hazel and rose water, are excellent for many uses. There just isn&#x27;t enough of either, with water being the highest percentage ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy witch hazel, and it comes pure distilled (and at a far smaller price). This isn&#x27;t strong enough to fully take the itchiness out of mosquito bites without dabbing it in a few times in succession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients are excellent.</li>
    <li> This toner is cooling, does refresh my skin, and smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem particularly hydrating. Honestly, I don&#x27;t see that it *does* anything for my skin at all past those first few seconds of applying it. I don&#x27;t have dry or irritated patches for it to sooth, although I get small irritated spots on the back of my neck from food allergies--I&#x27;ve put this on those for several days and it seems to be helping a little. I think, though, I won&#x27;t be spending $44 to replace this when it&#x27;s out and I&#x27;ll just try regular witch hazel. I can see why others recommend less expensive products because the ingredients are quite basic. Maybe these are higher quality, but the price difference doesn&#x27;t really seem justifiable.</li>
    <li> This toner is very gentle with a very light scent.  It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy alcohol smell, nor does it sting my skin when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with cleanser, then I use this toner to remove any residual makeup.  The special cap makes it easy to just squirt what you need on a cotton ball.  I was able to remove the makeup that my cleanser left behind.  This toner leaves my skin feeling fresh, not sticky or greasy.  I love that it is organic, and filled with ingredients that I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a natural, organic makeup remover, then this is a good one!</li>
    <li> The product title, as of this review, said certified organic, but when you look at the actual ingredients and product label, it states: &amp;#34;49.4% of the total ingredients are from Organic Farming.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I felt a little mislead. Some of those other ingredients are water, Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, and Dehydroacetic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Witch Hazel Flower Water and Rose Flower Water are listed as from organic farming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does help leave the skin hydrated. WebMD says witch hazel water contains tannins that can help repair broken skin, fight bacteria, and reduce swelling. It also says it can tighten the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to work well at hydrating the skin, but it&#x27;s not all organic, and that seems to be a major selling point in the product description, but it&#x27;s not all organic. If they were more upfront about that, it&#x27;d get a higher rating.</li>
    <li> 1 week of of morning-only use, and my skin does &#x27;feel&#x27; better to the touch. I don&#x27;t notice any changes visually and haven&#x27;t yet gotten a unsolicited complement. But I hold out hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: This is LIQUID. It is not a creme, or thick water. It is thin and like water. Some of you might love/hate this product, based on this attribute alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love witch-hazel, you&#x27;ll definitely love this product. It has a pleasant clean smell, but certainly not greasy or sticky at all.</li>
    <li> Feels gentle for a toner that contains alcohol, but it&#x27;s really nothing special. The primary ingredient is witch hazel. It feels about the same as drugstore witch hazel based toners. It&#x27;s a little drying, you need to use it with a moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> The number one ingredient of this product is water.  That&#x27;s followed by witch hazel flower water, rose flower water and then alcohol. &amp;#34;Water, water everywhere...&amp;#34; If you note the asterisk on the label the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; claim is for the witch hazel flower water; I&#x27;m guessing that means that the flowers used in the distillation process are organically grown. I think it&#x27;s pretty bold to use the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; on the label if this is the only organic component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;ll temporarily firm your skin but I&#x27;m not sure it does it any more than using other products that include witch hazel and/or alcohol for much less money.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and feels amazing on my skin. It isn&#x27;t very a heavy product, but it&#x27;s substantial enough to moisturize beautifully. A little goes a very long way, and you get so much of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin got a nice dewy look after two days of use (I apply it morning and night) and it calms irritation and redness, and definitely balances skin tone. I absolutely love this toner. It&#x27;s going to be a staple for sure.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few skin toners in the past, and I feel that this Ageless La Cure Natural toner is on the higher end, most definitely.  It is by far the priciest of the toners I have tried, yet it is perhaps the most refreshing - likely because of the powerful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a strong, lingering scent which I actually found a bit overpowering at first, but after using it on a regular basis for several days, I came to enjoy the smell more and more.  It is a deep, woodsy scent that is difficult to describe.  It is definitely noticeable to the people I am around, even an hour or so after my shower. It is powerful enough that I have actually stopped wearing any fragrance, at least for the time being, in fear that the smells might clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the strength of this fragrance, I had absolutely no irritation with this toner. It was gentle and smooth, as promised, and I felt hydrated and refreshed for hours after using. I feel lacking in a way on days when I don&#x27;t use this.  I started out using this in the morning and again at night, but I have since switched to mornings only. I don&#x27;t feel I need to use it twice daily. So while this may be on the more expensive end, if you are interested in a skin toner, it would be worth checking this out. If you like the fragrance, chances are this will quickly become your favorite toner.</li>
    <li> I like this toner, but don&#x27;t &#x27;love&#x27; it enough to purchase again, due to the cost factor.  If this is not an issue for you, you will find that this is a quality toner.  It is mild for sensitive skin and actually leaves the face feeling soft and moisturized, instead of stripped. It&#x27;s particularly nice if chilled before applying. The scent is refreshing.  However, I was hoping the aroma of rose flower water would be more noticeable, which is the primary reason I selected this item. I love rose water!  Unfortunately, the witch hazel and alcohol dominates, which I should have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for natural and/or organic products, it is impressive that 99.2% of total ingredients are of &#x27;natural&#x27; origin, with 49% from &#x27;organic&#x27; gardening.  Product is certified &#x27;organic.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth a try for those with a fat wallet.  For me, more cost effective toners, with similar ingredients can be readily found, even at the local drugstore.  I mean, witch hazel and alcohol are common toner ingredients,  and now,  there are even some eliminating alcohol.  There are lots of options available.  That said, I will continue to enjoy my remaining product through most of the summer and I&#x27;m glad to have given it a try.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to add another step to my routine, but this product does feel good on the skin. I am allergic to many skin products and always happy to find one that does not irritate. I really can&#x27;t tell if it is working for me, but I have received several compliments on my skin lately. It is certainly easy to use--just put a little on a cottonball and apply.</li>
    <li> Ageless La Cure Natural Organic Hydrating Toner is a nice, refreshing product for your skin. This isn&#x27;t drying and it has a nice scent. My daughter is using some strong acne cream right now and this toner is soothing on her skin and hasn&#x27;t caused extra dryness or irritation. This organic toner has some really good ingredients such as rose flower water. It does contain some alcohol but alcohol is the 6th ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product, but it&#x27;s very expensive for toner. This bottle will last a long time since a little goes a long way, but it&#x27;s an expensive bottle.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like this skin toner.  She has found that it leaves her skin looking smoother without irritating or drying her skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner has a light &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; scent that is not overpowering, with just the slightest hint of witch hazel. I also smelled a touch of isopropyl alcohol - there are alcohols in the toner including benzyl alcohol. Apart from some useless information regarding the percentage of natural ingredients (including those derived from organic farming), the composition of the mixture is not clearly printed on the side of the container. So, unfortunately, the consumer does not know what relative percentage the alcohols comprise (shooting from the hip, I can&#x27;t imagine it is &amp;#62;1%).  Suffice it to say, that if you are sensitive to alcohols, this might not be the best skin toner for you. There are, in fact, alcohol-free alternatives out there that may be a bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner has the consistency of water, so the application is neat and does not stain clothing. My wife has found that she does not need to apply a lot, so this 200 milliliter (6.8 fluid ounce) container has lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is good skin toner that has a light, pleasant fragrance. The toner is easy to apply, neat, and despite the presence of alcohols, has not dried my wife&#x27;s skin out.</li>
    <li> Water, alcohol, and witch hazel... with a little rose water. That&#x27;s all this stuff is and while those ingredients make for a solid and gentle astringent, it&#x27;s unconscionable that this product would cost this much. It&#x27;s good for what it is, and I suppose if you&#x27;re into having the full range of Ageless La Cure products, it would make sense to purchase this? But honestly: it&#x27;s a very basic product that seems to be ludicrously overpriced. I want to believe that because it has a few organic ingredients, but I&#x27;m not sure even that justifies the markup for a very basic product.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin which is oily in places and dry in others.  It can sometimes be a challenge to hit on just the right combination of skin products (cleanser, toner &amp; moisturizer) that will effectively cleanse my skin and not create breakouts or exacerbate problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this toner because I have had good results with some astringent toners that contain Witch Hazel.  Initially I liked this.  It didn&#x27;t burn and it has a nice smell, maybe because of the rose flower water.  However over time I started getting a more drying effect than I would like.  That is likely because there is also alcohol and benzyl alcohol as ingredients as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have oily skin or don&#x27;t have an allergy to the the benzyl alcohol this would  probably be a nice product for you.  Unfortunately it simply didn&#x27;t work for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I know that most dermatologists do not advise that their patients use a toner ... that&#x27;s fine, I get it. With that said, I still use a toner because I just plain like the way it feels. In fact, there is little I love more than returning from a grueling run, popping out of the shower and then running a cotton pad drenched with toner over my face. It gives me that little extra burst of clean and have a nice cooling sensation (yep, it&#x27;s alcohol ... I know).  This particular toner is glorious. It has a very subtle rose fragrance and leaves my skin feeling very smooth, very soft, and very supple. I have used this nearly everyday after working out and showering ... and I have had zero negative effects. It did not strip my skin ... at all. (And, I use prescription retinoids every other day, so if it were harsh, my skin would have peeled like crazy). Moreover, I am sensitive/allergic to SO MANY products ... I had no reaction to this toner at all.   For me, this is the first toner that did not interact with my retinoid routine. And, between its gentle but phenomenally effective quality, I am completely sold! (And, the fact that it smells incredible is just a huge plus!) I will absolutely be purchasing this in the future (over and over).  Finally, try this with organic cotton pads ... rather than the traditional, bleached ones. That might make a difference for you.</li>
    <li> I only tried this because I did find this line&#x27;s  moisturizer to be pretty amazing.  Expensive, but amazing.  I did wonder how they&#x27;d turn a $8 bottle of Witch Hazel into a nearly $40 bottle.  The answer is they didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only compare it to the Humphry&#x27;s Witch Hazel Citrus, which is what I use.  The main difference is Humphry&#x27;s claims to be alcohol free while this has alcohol in its ingredients.  The Humphrey&#x27;s is around $6-10 for an 8 oz bottle depending on where you buy it while this is currently $37.72 for 6.75 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did like this just fine, I would recommend going with $8-9 bottle of Humphrey&#x27;s Witch hazel instead.  They have multiple styles, some of which do include rose water or rose essence.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Ageless La Cure Natural toner. Just to be clear, it is a toner and not a lotion. I am not sure why the bottle has the word &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; on it in large letters. Anyhow, the toner has a nice flowery scent that is typical of products that contain rose water. Unfortunately, it also has the price-tag of most products that contain rose water (or for that matter, products made in Switzerland). It also contains witch hazel which is what I normally use to tone my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is a liquid. So, it is best applied with a round cotton pad. What really makes me love this toner so much is how soft and supple it made my skin feel afterwards. I almost didn&#x27;t apply moisturizer after using it because my skin felt so soft and wonderful. It also left a pleasant scent on my skin. While I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the almost $30 that is the current asking price of this product, I would consider it. If you want a good toner, you can just buy a bottle of Witch Hazel (I love Thayers) for a third of the price. If you are looking for a truly satisfying, pampering toner...this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> A good toner is essential to any skincare regime.&lt;br /&gt;With a price point that is similar to nearly every other high end line such as Dior or Clarins, and less than La Prairie, this luxury brand consistently puts out top notch products.&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing, not only does this toner remove any last trace of grime and makeup,  it restores the natural pH of you skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to irritation due to sensitive skin, I find that this toner calms and soothes my sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;That means less redness.</li>
    <li> Extremely hydrating! I have sensitive and dry skin. Usually, I tend not to use toners as they further dry out my skin, but the Phyto 5 toner was really nice. It felt refreshing and hydrating at the same time. I love the floral scent! The bottle will last a long time as well. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this toner a LOT better than my good-quality but alcohol-based one.  It seems to work just as well in getting pore-lurking grime out.  But it isn&#x27;t anywhere as drying, or as chemical smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I will be less enamored with this toner after I have used it for a long time; after all, I have been using my Neutrogena alcohol-based toner for years, and it does the job adequately.  And it&#x27;s about 4x as expensive as my current toner.  Still, I&#x27;m optimistic.</li>
    <li> My skin is picky and will often freak out and get red, dry, irritated,  etc., when trying new products. When I find something that works and my skin doesn&#x27;t reject, I usually stick with it. This toner did not cause me any irritations. There was no dryness which is a common problem with toners. There was no redness and just not a single sign of my skin rejecting it, so I was happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance of the toner, I think it is a great product overall. It makes your skin feel cooled and refreshed as soon as you apply it. The main ingredients are water, then witch hazel, then rose flower water. The witch hazel is very calming to skin and that is the ingredient that gives the cool, refreshing feeling. This will also take the sting off of sunburn, so there&#x27;s a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and leaves my skin so soft. My face feels like baby skin after using this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain alcohol, but it is the last ingredient, so that means the content is very minimal. This toner is very gentle on the skin - you can tell that as soon as you use it. Also, if you regularly use products with witch hazel in them, you will definitely be able to tell that this is comprised of mostly that... you will know by the way your skin feels, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only a very, very slight scent to this toner. It is a natural smell. Not perfume or chemical type smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of this brand before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I typically buy my skin care products from Sephora or high end brand sites... I am a bit of a &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34; in that regard. I liked this product and it seems to be good quality based on the performance. I would try other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> This toner seems to work well.  It has a nice scent, it does tone the skin and clean pores.  It also leaves moisture in.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use lotion after applying.  I do think it costs too much for what it is.</li>
    <li> I do like the product but I do not feel the results justify the price.  It is most definitely gentle and has a light, clean fragrance.  It is relatively refreshing. I do not feel that is does a better job than lesser priced toners.  It did not refresh, tone, or hydrate any better.  If you can buy products that do an equally good job  at half the price there doesn&#x27;t seen to be a reason to buy this one.  Four stars represents &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34;  so that is why I gave it 4 but it is really a three, overall, when the price is factored in.</li>
