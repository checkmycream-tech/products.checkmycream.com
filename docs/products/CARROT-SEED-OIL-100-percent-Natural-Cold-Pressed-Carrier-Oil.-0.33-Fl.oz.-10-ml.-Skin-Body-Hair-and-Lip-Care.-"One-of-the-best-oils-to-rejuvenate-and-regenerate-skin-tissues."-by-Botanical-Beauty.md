      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to use this product as the title varied from what it originally stated 2 weeks ago.</li>
      <li>I also love that this is an American business with 100% money back guarantee with great prices!</li>
      <li>arrived quickly in it&#x27;s own little box with no leakage which is always good.</li>

      <li>didn&#x27;t think so because it smells too amazing and definitely has the color of carrot seed oil...</li>

      <li>This is good for your hair, it help it to grow give it a natural shin, and give it its Sterngth to with stand the daily hair style.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and provided some essential, natural ingredients that are good for the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> still too small for the price. however, it comes with a spout insert in the bottle and that is very helpful for me.</li>
    <li> Good buy.. Need more actually...</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for my hair oils. It doesn&#x27;t mix/blend well it,settles at the bottom. But that&#x27;s ok I figure you are saving the best for last (lol)</li>
    <li> This is good for your hair, it help it to grow give it a natural shin, and give it its Sterngth to with stand the daily hair style.</li>
    <li> So disappointed with this oil... there is hardly any scent of anything carrot. I feel pretty deceived by this product. Also mine does NOT have a dropper bottle cap, making it impossible for the stupidly thick &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil to pass through. I feel like I completely wasted my money. I&#x27;M JUST A BROKE COLLEGE KID TRYING TO HAVE NICE SKIN. I feel totally ripped off....</li>
    <li> Love it!! :-)  so far my favorite , especially after hot shower , smells yummy</li>
    <li> I use it on my face love it</li>
    <li> I used this for my sunscreen in combo with raspberry seed oil worked wonders for my family and especially my little ones sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I like this thus so far! It has jojoba oil and vitamin E in it, which I don&#x27;t mind those are veryy healthy for the hair and scalp. I can see if you are looking for 100% carrot seed oil this may not be for you then. Title does not say 100% carrot seed oil so don&#x27;t be butt hurt if you buy it and complain on reviews</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
    <li> Making my own skincare, this is a lovely product.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly but not sure how well it works.</li>
    <li> Product is as natural and useful as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product in my natural skin care! It goes on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin!</li>
    <li> Delicious facial oil!</li>
    <li> Not bad. Disappointed that I did not read ingredients clearly. I wanted a 100% carrot seed oil, not jojoba and vit E. Oh well, will pay extra attention next time.</li>
    <li> This incredible and light carrot oil comes in a glass bottle with the dropper so it is very convenient and hassle free to use on a daily basis. Now the best part that this carrot oil can be applied directly to the skin in its pure form! I use it as a main component in my facial masks and I also like to spread 1-2 drops of carrot oil through my hair. It has very refreshing carrot scent, it gives elasticity to my skin and softness to the hair. I mostly like to use carrot oil as a facial serum. It has a broader and deeper impact, purifying and moisturizing dry skin and preventing the occurrence of wrinkles. With this simple natural skincare it just seems unreasonable to me to waste all these money on expensive creams since the effect of carrot oil on my skin is greater and the risk of skin irritation is much less.</li>
    <li> I ordered the carrot seed oil to use with my moisturizer and already love the results that it is given me.</li>
    <li> Really loved this product, will order a larger size next time.</li>
    <li> Smelled fresh and I love it. I use this neat on my face and in my carrier oil skincare mix.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil.  The mixture with the jojoba oil makes my skin so smooth and soft.  I have thrown out all my old anti-aging creams.  I mix this oil also with olive oil, rose hip oil and lemon juice for my age spots.  It has worked wonders for my face and neck.  Once a day application is all I need.</li>
    <li> I have never used this oil and ordered it with the hopes of finding a lighter carrier oil for the natural serum that I make and use on my face.  I love it.  I am allergic to to tree nuts and am very limited to the oils that I can use with out having a severe reaction.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This oil is pure and natural and is cold pressed. It is a carrier oil for use in cosmetic serums and lotions that have anti aging properties. It is not greasy and provided some essential, natural ingredients that are good for the skin. Most organic stores and herbal shops that sell oils for cosmetics sell carrot seed oil at very high prices. This one works just as well for less than half the price.</li>
    <li> I make my own face oil, and love the carrot seed oil in it. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and this little bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> I use this in my face lotions and in my shampoo. My hair and skin are improving and I am very happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shiny and smoother now. My skin is softer and there are less breakouts</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. The color is nice and the quality is good. Wish the bottle was a little bigger, but over all i am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Received this oil today and well please with it! Planning on using it to its full potential happy first time customer</li>
    <li> I purchased this for general skin care and with the intention of making homemade sunscreen as carrot seed oil contains some SPF. I have used it on dry patches of skin as well as on a sunburn that I acquired prior to making my sunscreen. It helped with making the sunscreen go away sooner with no peeling.</li>
    <li> really lovely! I use it for my homemade, all natural facial oil anti-aging moisturizer mix.</li>
    <li> Using this with face creams and lotion bars. Very pleased with it, combines well. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is everything that was stated.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The plastic thing that lets the oil come out in droplets doesn&#x27;t let ANY come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product is good.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality oil with anti-aging qualities that I add to my DIY facial moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This is great mixed with other oisl , you only need a little bit and it mixes well, costly product</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful for under eyes. It smells so fresh and clean like it is straight from the garden!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff thank you</li>
    <li> Just opened my package. Am really disappointed. I was expecting Cold Pressed Carrot Seed Oil--not Carrot Seed and Jojoba Oil. Because I was getting this for a discounted price for an honest review, I read through the listing and not the reviews.  I had no idea this I wasn&#x27;t going to be getting 100% Carrot Seed Oil, only. After reading some of the reviews, some people think that it&#x27;s Carrot Seed Essential Oil in Jojoba Oil. Might make the price for 1/3 of an ounce understandable.  That is not the case. Bottle very clearly says Carrot Seed CARRIER OIL. If someone wanted to experiment to see if they liked Carrot Seed Carrier Oil, it might be worth the price for such a small amount to see if it works for you.  I happen to like, and use, both Carrot Seed and Jojoba Oil. I happen to have Carrot Seed Carrier Oil and Carrier Seed Essential Oil. I also have Jojoba Oil. My intention was to make some type of facial serum using Carrot Seed Carrier Oil. Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do about this???  I received this product for a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Due to sensitivity to commercial sunscreen I decided to make my own with all natural ingredients and it worked.  I still can&#x27;t stay out for extended periods but this did help increase the amount of time I can spend outside.  Oh, and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...arrived before schedule.</li>
    <li> Good for face.  Good for hair. Good for skin. If you don&#x27;t want to buy Retin A  this is a good alternative without the many side effects.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product &amp; the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Very good oil but the bottle is too small for the price.  Nevertheless, I will buy this again because it makes my skin so soft without that greasy look (I use it on my face).</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade face serum. A few drops is all it takes. so far it appears to be working pretty good.</li>
    <li> Added it to my hair oil of jamaican black castor oil for hair growth. I hope it works.</li>
    <li> This is not pure carrot seed oil! As the reviews below have stated the oil in the bottle is a variety of carrier oils with carrot IN the carrier oils. It is not a legitimate carrot seed oil -- which I&#x27;m super disappointed to find out because legitimate carrot seed oil is a fabulous product for sensitive skin. I think it&#x27;s a bit misleading to title a product as &amp;#34;CARROT SEED OIL 100%&amp;#34; and actually not have it be 100% carrot seed oil... The text is buried in the listing that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;carrot seed oil in a jojoba carrier oil&amp;#34; but in any case you shouldn&#x27;t market something as being 100% if it&#x27;s not. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase and am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest feedback. I receive no incentive for my thoughts one way or the other; I just hope my feedback will help people to make a better informed decision.</li>
    <li> Is not Carrot seed oil, is mixed whit jojoba oil and E vitamin.... This information was not clear, under I have this product in my hands.</li>
    <li> No more breaking hairs my carrot seed oil keep my hairs  so shine and  Make them grew up so fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this carrot seed essential oil. Upon recently coming to write a review, I had to go check my bottle to be sure it wasn&#x27;t labeled to be canola oil as other reviewers had stated. What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think so because it smells too amazing and definitely has the color of carrot seed oil... I certainly hadn&#x27;t realized I was ordering anything aside from pure essential oil and will be more careful in the future. Glad to catch it though because I&#x27;d planned on buying Jojoba oil next and now realize I have it already, lol (hopefully it is what it says it is- a mix of the 2?!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased from seller, cosmeticbeautyplace. Will likely choose another brand in the future although I&#x27;ve been loving this oil for my face and neck. Purchased it for its healing and anti-aging properties. Smells and feels wonderful! Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I feel my hair more soft and manageable. I also use this with raspberry seed oil mixed with my sunscreen. I love the texture. I feel more protected from UV rays naturally than before. I will try Innisfree sunscreen along with this essential oil. Good buy!</li>
    <li> There are quite a few posting here stating this is a pure oil, they obviously are not reading the title or ingredients. I&#x27;ve yet to use this product as the title varied from what it originally stated 2 weeks ago. Canola is not listed on my bottle, but jojoba and vit E, which I do not use for any of my oils as a carrier, ever. Very disappointed, my blog readers will be avoiding this as well. I&#x27;ll make sure my 5k plus FB followers avoid this company as well. When you plan to purchase carrot seed oil, you should receive just that. This will be useless unless gifted to someone who uses those carriers. Saddened.</li>
    <li> helps heal and protect skin</li>
    <li> Used this to help grow hair back that was missing for no reason.</li>
    <li> Got this oil to add to my DIY cosmetics for the sun screen and wrinkle factor.  This is perfect for that and a terrific price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good!  Thank you for getting to us quickly.</li>
    <li> If you happen to be considering buying this as a natural sunblock (as I did) my suggestion is: DON&#x27;T!  This is totally defective as natural sun block which is how I know they are a rip off as it is COMMON KNOWLEDGE in the health industry that these oils when pure (and enough used) are very effective as sun block. I bought this one and the Red Raspberry from them and burned way worse in a short time in the sun! My money is better spent on pure carrot oil ONLY and from a reputable company!</li>
    <li> Great for aiding as sunscreen</li>
    <li> I like it. It arrived on time and the packaging was great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> needed for a product i was making. tiny bottle. suits its purpose</li>
    <li> So excited to get my carrot oil - the quality and smell (just like carrots) are excellent! I use essential oils for everything and ordered the carrot oil specifically for a mild UV/sunscreen as well as wrinkle prevention. I use 1 part carrot oil with 1 part raspberry seed oil and 8 parts sesame seed oil. I love that its cold pressed and not denatured. I also love that this is an American business with 100% money back guarantee with great prices! I will be buying all of my oils from these guys from now on - so glad I found them!</li>
    <li> I was highly recommended this product from my friend who has been using it for a while now. After two pregnancies, my hair and nails were not the same, hair falling out and my nails were brittle and soft. After about a week after using this oil on my curly hair I noticed that frizz disappeared, and I find MUCH less hair on my brush. The nails are stronger and the skin on my hands is soft!!!! When I purchased carrot  and  grape oils, I did not read the reviews, and all the negative reviews have really surprised me. You have to know HOW to use the oils properly, too much or too little could give you  negative results. Great Christmas gift for all my female co-workers!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I used it to make a face serum and gave some to a friend. She loved it too and asked for the &#x27;recipe&#x27;. Two thumbs up way up!!</li>
    <li> great product, I use it for homemade face cream and it blends right in and is unscented, allowing me to add other scented essential oils of my choice.</li>
    <li> Ugh what a waste of money... I could get 4 ounces of jojoba oil with ten dollars instead of0.33 ounce.... THIS IS NOT 100% CARROT SEED OIL!!! DO NOT BUY... I am so disappointed</li>
    <li> This product is a complete JOKE .. Upon reading the label, I realized this is a bunch of other stuff aside from carrot oil.  If you want some weird concoction with random ingredients please enjoy this &amp;#34;carrot seed oil&amp;#34; ... Ugh.  Now I have to deal with a return -- so annoying.  0/10 Would Not Recommend.</li>
    <li> i heard this is good for marks and acne, i will update after seeing results, but i love it so far</li>
    <li> Works great for skin.  Smoothing out my face and making it so soft.  I have trouble finding things that do not make me break out and this is working good!</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected.  It was not totally pure.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and the strength of a couple of drops were very strong, especially when used with the right carrier oil..</li>
    <li> My husband used it after shave mixed with aloe gel, he&#x27;s got very sensitive skin and it worked wonderful</li>
    <li> Wish I would have learned more about TRUE Theraputic essential oils before I purchased this. I should have looked at the ingredients and researched a little more before I bought this.  It is diluted with canola oil...and jojoba oil...who knows HOW dulited it is...If you are looking for PURE carrot seed oil...this is not it.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful on face and hair it one of my daily dose of vitamin for all over body care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Peterson&lt;br /&gt; Houston, Texas</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars only because I&#x27;m not overly fond of the scent.  I realize that NO carrot seed oil is going to smell nice so it&#x27;s nothing against this particular company&#x27;s product.  I use it in my handmade facial lotions and cleansers that I sell.  When combined with other essential oils that scent is easily masked as it&#x27;s not real strong. I would never use it in a product as the only essential oil though.  It has to have at least one other essential oil in order to cover up the rather earthy smell.  I&#x27;ll buy it again though and woudl have no problem buying it from this seller.  The order went smoothly and was rec&#x27;d quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; as described</li>
    <li> I love natural products and this Carrot Oil is top notch! It is so pure and it is a convenient size. Truly enjoy it every day in my moisturizing routine. I am a bit of a health nut, so it is very exciting to find high quality natural products. I have tried some of their other oils and I am impressed!</li>
    <li> very amazing product. with skin regenerative properties, Iam very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in a facial cleanser/moisturizer for the healthy nutrients in it.  While I can&#x27;t vouch for any medical benefits, I will say that the oil was very moisturizing and smelled delicious!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, intense hydration and nourishment, absorbs quickly – 3 in 1. I use Carrot Oil for my face after the shower and so far the results are beyond my expectations. It doesn’t cause any discomfort, doesn’t cause irritation or redness, it absorbs quickly without any greasy residue, and it DOES NOT clog pores. My skin is like a baby skin!!! Carrot definitely improved my face complexion!</li>
    <li> This is not a carrot seed oil. I received this item today and on the bottle it says - carrot root extract, canola oil and Vit.E. So no oil apart from canola, do you need to pay $9 for 10ml of canola oil? perhaps it is the price of a cold pressed undiluted canola oil. The description is simply deceptive. No where on the page could I find carrot root extract mentioned. This is going back!&lt;br /&gt;3-11-13 Update: Thankfully, after a few e-mails the company is mentioning the real ingredients of the product! Let&#x27;s see if they can do the right thing and correct the main title...</li>
    <li> Great product. Came very quickly and is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I recently bought from another company (new directions) and the carrot seed oil had a fowl smell to it. I love this carrot seed oil, just wish I had purchased in a bigger quantity!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t pure carrot seed oil. It was mixed with another oil, it says so on the label. (Only I couldn&#x27;t read the label until I had already received the product)</li>
    <li> I have been using this a lot as a wrinkle reducer, Fantastic for skin, and is useful in so much more then just wrinkle cream.. Thanks All</li>
    <li> This will be used in a natural sunscreen preparation, and I am glad to have a preparation I can make.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I made a face serum with it.</li>
    <li> This is clean and a pure oil.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to those needing the product.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly in it&#x27;s own little box with no leakage which is always good.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this I immediately sent a message to the seller asking what was in the bottle because it didn&#x27;t feel nor smell like the Carrot Seed Oils I&#x27;ve used in the past. Oh how I wish I&#x27;d taken the time to read the reviews before making this purchase! I neglected to see this is not in fact Carrot Seed Oil, but a carrier oil - one review says it&#x27;s macerated wild carrot with canola oil....not at all what I was shopping for. All of this sucks for me as I don&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of returning an item that only cost $8 - lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking the time to write this review because the seller still has not gotten back to me. We&#x27;re talking over a week now - customer service oriented this seller is not, so proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> My order came quick and it doesnt smell bad like some carrot oils ive smelled.</li>
</ol>
