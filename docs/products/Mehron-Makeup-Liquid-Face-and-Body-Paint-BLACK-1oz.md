<li> I, a white person, and I used it to imitate a black skinned person for personal entertainment and it worked well.</li>
<li> Also when using the brush to paint over the white make up the colour bled a little.</li>
<li> and Im still using it a few mo ths later.</li>

<li> the only problem with it is that the simpliest scratch or small rub</li>
<li> You do need to follow the instructions and give it time to dry - I failed to do so and paid the price, but it lasted long enough that it wasn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
<li> I put some of this stuff on for a few concerts that Ive gone to since.</li>
<li> I got this for doing a Day of the Dead make-up on myself.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a make up artist, just a guy that goes overboard on Halloween.  </li>

    <li> smudges more than normal....... prefer cake</li>
    <li> Went on easy, came off easy, and stayed on pretty well!</li>
    <li> I bought one bottle of this for use at a music festival and Im still using it a few mo ths later. I put some of this stuff on for a few concerts that Ive gone to since. You will sweat it off but it works. Im actually very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great liquid for detail work.  Don&#x27;t use brush in cap though.  I cut it off the cap and use better brushes for fine line.  Dries a lot slower than cake or powder paints so be sure and let it dry thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I had fun with this! Remember that paint over paint does crack, so I had to reapply it, but not that often. It took a bit of work to get it off, soap and water and baby wipes definitely did the trick. But I love it! Can&#x27;t wait to do use it again.</li>
    <li> very good quality makeup, if you have any talent at face painting you will really get some good effects with the mehron products.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product is perfect for working with the airbrush and does not cause allergies in my skin.  THANK YOU WHAT I RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I got this for doing a Day of the Dead make-up on myself.  It worked great!  It was easy to put on, stayed on all day (and into the night) and I did only a few touch-ups because of cracking.  I got lots of compliments too!  The best part was when I washed it off.  My face was not red or irritated at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! It&#x27;s so smooth and is so easy to work with and it dries fast!! Thanks so much for the fast shipment</li>
    <li> I, a white person, and I used it to imitate a black skinned person for personal entertainment and it worked well. My first time imitating black skinned men. Non staining, washes clear with water. I wish it were lower priced for more frequent uses. .</li>
    <li> WASHES OFF VERY EASY.  1 OZ CAN COVER MANY SOCCER ZOMBIES AT THE TOURNAMENT! Mehron is the gold standard of face paint.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need and came quickly</li>
    <li> This product came as described but did not work as I expected to. I was using it to paint clown faces, and was painting over white Mehron Clown face paint. It was difficult to paint fine lines with the brush that was attached to the lid. I guess a cream application would have worked better, or even a black make up pencil, but not the liquid paint. I was not expecting it to be quite so runny. Also when using the brush to paint over the white make up the colour bled a little. It was better using my finger but then fine lines were not possible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product works like eyeliner but the only problem with it is that the simpliest scratch or small rub it comes right off.</li>
    <li> Its easy to wash off and I didn&#x27;t really feel it on my skin once it dried up. Just be careful it does rub off fairly easily. I&#x27;d recommend you get the sealer, which I forgot to get.</li>
    <li> This worked great for Superhero Masks.  You do need to follow the instructions and give it time to dry - I failed to do so and paid the price, but it lasted long enough that it wasn&#x27;t an issue.  It goes on well, and goes a long way... we did masks for 4 people and barely seemed to put a dent in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a make up artist, just a guy that goes overboard on Halloween.  I went for professional make up and it is so much better. I had some issues with cracking after many hours of wear, but that could have been my application. There is a brush inside but I recommend buying a cheap set of brushes, you&#x27;ll get cleaner lines.</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with this product! Just tested it out for my halloween costume (Martin Luther King Jr), and my blackface looks super realistic! Docked the product one star because some friends told me they were &amp;#34;disgusted&amp;#34; by the face paint.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It was used for a Halloween production. Easy to use. Covered great and will use again next year. Shipping was fast and as expected.</li>
    <li> Great pairing with the Mehron Grease foundation - easy to apply and remove, did not change or run or smear. Neutral fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not made for full body painting. I had an issue with cracking.</li>
