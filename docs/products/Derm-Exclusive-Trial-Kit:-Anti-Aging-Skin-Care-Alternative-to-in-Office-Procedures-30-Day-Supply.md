### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;The best way to know is to continue asking questions of reviewers, talking to friends</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just that good!</li>
      <li>The pen works great for me and lasts.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of citrus - and smells great.  </li>

      <li>This product is really good and has done for me what it was advertised to do.</li>
      <li>were good and lasted longer.  </li>
      <li>Loved the &amp;#34;Micro Peel Resurfacing Pads&amp;#34; they made my skin very smooth!</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s really fantastic to have people tell me how great I look.  </li>
      <li>I liked the product</li>
      <li>the face cream was nice and that&#x27;s all.  </li>
      <li>After watching this on t.v. was very impressed, however after receiving the product and using it, very disatisfied.</li>
      <li>I use them all together  and am very happy with my 50 year old skin!</li>
      <li>Goes on creamy smooth and feels good.  </li>
      <li>Glad to read ALL the reviews....before I got suckered into another pricey // doesn&#x27;t work so well deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>maybe it&#x27;s best suited to younger skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put some more on.  </li>
      <li>an outstanding 4 or 5 star reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>yes you would run out quickly-and if you have that many wrinkles then you should consider botox and not this.</li>
      <li>Go to the Drugstore and look for products w/ Glycolic acids  or even better, Retninol.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Be sure to write a review of your experiences with the product you&#x27;re using -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I cancelled my debit card after I made this purchase seeing the reviews I&#x27;m reading now saying the company kept charging their cards after claiming it was a one time purchase.</li>
      <li>aren&#x27;t any better than what you&#x27;d get from using a primer and</li>
      <li>That was better</li>
      <li>more like 3 days.</li>
      <li>I think Beachbody must not be a reputable company.</li>
      <li>I thought the Dr. Was reputable.</li>
      <li>Would love to buy the derma freeze separately if it lasted longer.</li>
      <li>I love the scrub pad and the face creams.</li>
      <li>My skin looks better.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use at this point and am hopeful that it will bring greater results.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Beware that once you call, they try to talk you into adding 3 or 4 more products and sets to your order.</li>
      <li>I got suckered into it and added a couple more.</li>
      <li>but I sure will spread the info about this product anywhere I can online.</li>
      <li>I liked the routine of it, the fragrance, the feel on my face, but I don&#x27;t see any significant changes in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to return to friendly rep at company  </li>
      <li>Basically, you had better call and cancel the minute you receive your product (or before if it takes more than 10 days to get to you) if you are just getting this for the free trial.  </li>
      <li>it was easy to apply makeup over it</li>
      <li>The fine print says you have to cancel within 10 days</li>
      <li>I decided to come to Amazon to see if the product was available...</li>
      <li>The collagen lift is amazing - and really does \\&quot;tighten.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>This product is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last 30 days.....not even 10 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Get ready to get your card charged more than what they claim.</li>
      <li>Not as good as generic Walmart creams !!</li>
      <li>I recently saw the commercial and decided to call because I thought it was a good deal and heard nothing but good things about it.</li>
      <li>This product is marketed primarily to women - but guys absolutely care about their aging faces and appearance.  </li>
      <li>I was determined to know that it made a distinct difference and the test proved that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>product works but results aren&#x27;t even worth the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this kit is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>I gave it a fair trial and saw no real difference in this time.  </li>
      <li>I am 74 years old, and that much attention to cleansing, creaming, smoothing, and touching up should have made a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>You feel pretty &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I used it exactly as they showed on TV it did not make a difference whatsoever in my skin</li>
      <li>For two weeks I used the product exactly as directed on ONE SIDE OF MY FACE.</li>
      <li>I returned the set - at my own expense - and got a partial refund (they don&#x27;t refund the shipping charges).</li>
      <li>have too many wrinkles from STRESS in my life....and would like to look younger ....</li>
      <li>I gave this 3 stars because it came in on time and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>you trust who may have used the product or finally try the product yourself making sure</li>
      <li>, you have to spend more money and order the entire kit.</li>
      <li>I am really sold on this skin care line - and men - if you care about your skin&#x27;s appearance then jump on this train and see the difference!  </li>
      <li>When I finally spoke to someone, I was told the free trial starts the day it is ordered!</li>
      <li>(and be ready to answer others follow-up questions - pro or con).</li>
      <li>I did not see much difference using the rest of the product after 3 Weeks of use.</li>
      <li>I got the extra &#x27;free&#x27; one.</li>
      <li>, goes on so much smoother including my eyeliner pencil.</li>
      <li>and I am floored by the real effectiveness of this product line.  </li>
      <li>And now it is so much easier to add my makeup</li>
      <li>The eye serum didn&#x27;t have much product in it</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel much &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>However, they leave payment information out until the very end when they tell you that you are going to be set up month to month of payments and recieve the products every month unless you call and cancel.</li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t that I used too much.</li>
      <li>If you are trying to use it on your whole face then</li>
      <li>He really should be more careful who he hooks up with.</li>
      <li>I liked most of the products but they came in very small sizes that were supposed to last a month.</li>
      <li>there are many other reasons as well....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just to try the product with the understanding that you can buy the full size if you like the results (just like the smaller trial sizes at the Department Store).  </li>
      <li>Then two weeks after that a new box arrived, then another!</li>
      <li>the fill and freeze seemed like it might be a good product, but it lasted only a few days not a month like they say it should.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Price is not worth the product, I purchased #7 at Target and it is a far better product.</li>
      <li>Tried again the next day by putting on some moisturizer first and then the AM stuff.  </li>
      <li>Not only does this product not last more than ten uses, you can&#x27;t put any makeup over the serum after it dries.</li>
      <li>First, the smell is definitely unisex - not flowery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never spent so much time prepping and creaming my face.</li>
      <li>I have spent over a  $1000.00 on what we&#x27;re to be super products.</li>
      <li>I cancelled, but they sent another complete set (of course, charging my Visa).</li>
      <li>I used it very sparingly and still it only lasted 5 or 6 days.</li>
      <li>Dr. Orden evidently has no conscious.</li>
      <li>I told them I took it directly to the post office and mailed it.  </li>
      <li>I am a professional Esthetician who knows how to use products sparingly</li>
      <li>I purchased it directly from the Infomercial.  </li>
      <li>I use it and the lines were very noticeably gone especially around my eyes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is marketed primarily to women - but guys absolutely care about their aging faces and appearance.  I&#x27;m one of them.  Who doesn&#x27;t have a desire to slow the hands of time?  I saw the Derm Exclusive product line advertised on television and did some research thinking this is just another flash in the pan.  I decided to come to Amazon to see if the product was available...and it was.  I have been using Derm Exclusive \\&quot;exclusively\\&quot; for three weeks and I am floored by the real effectiveness of this product line.  I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin and used various products but as a guy in his mid forties - it&#x27;s really fantastic to have people tell me how great I look.  The entire product line does just as promised.  First, the smell is definitely unisex - not flowery. Reminds me of citrus - and smells great.  The Intensive Repair Serum does just as promised and gives an overall appearance of balanced skin tone.  The collagen lift is amazing - and really does \\&quot;tighten.\\&quot;  The Fill &amp; Freeze is liquid gold - and still amazes me with its effectiveness.  I am really sold on this skin care line - and men - if you care about your skin&#x27;s appearance then jump on this train and see the difference!  Oh, by the way, it&#x27;s from Beach Body and that means quality in my book!  Derm Exclusive is missing the boat by not marketing this product to EVERYONE.  It&#x27;s just that good!</li>
    <li> After watching this on t.v. was very impressed, however after receiving the product and using it, very disatisfied. Price is not worth the product, I purchased #7 at Target and it is a far better product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!! Not as good as generic Walmart creams !! Save yourself some money !</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to get this product, cause I thought the Dr. Was reputable. Not! I read a lot of the reviews, they were all bad. So I am very disappointed and Not buy this. Shame on u. Your co workers should be ashamed. They should fire him. Take that commercial off, quit stealing people&#x27;s money. People like me work hard for our money, greed has got u Dr. I wouldn&#x27;t even call u Dr.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I have been using for two weeks and I do see a difference in my wrinkles and even my husband noticed. Everyone is complaining about the fill and freeze pen-yes it is small but you only apply a small amount on your wrinkles-I&#x27;ve been using the same pen for two weeks now-morning and evening and there is still some left in the pen. If you are trying to use it on your whole face then yes you would run out quickly-and if you have that many wrinkles then you should consider botox and not this.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work as promised, and didn&#x27;t last as long as promised. The eye serum didn&#x27;t have much product in it so didn&#x27;t last but about 3 days! I cancelled, but they sent another complete set (of course, charging my Visa). I returned the set - at my own expense - and got a partial refund (they don&#x27;t refund the shipping charges). Today, however, I noticed another $50+ charge on my Visa account. This is getting ridiculous! Now I have to go through all that again! I only wanted to try this because I HAD such respect for Dr. Ordon. He really should be more careful who he hooks up with. I think Beachbody must not be a reputable company.</li>
    <li> I ordered it from TV. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it...what a sucker I am! The little &amp;#34;fill and freeze&amp;#34; pen is much much smaller than what they are using on TV. It doesn&#x27;t have hardly any product inside. I got the extra &#x27;free&#x27; one. I used it very sparingly and still it only lasted 5 or 6 days. I even used the second pen and it was the same. They even made styes in my eyes. I took them up on their money beck guarantee. Haven&#x27;t seen the refund yet but I did pay with my visa so, whether or not they send me the refund, I&#x27;ll get refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run away...run away....</li>
    <li> I recently saw the commercial and decided to call because I thought it was a good deal and heard nothing but good things about it. Beware that once you call, they try to talk you into adding 3 or 4 more products and sets to your order. I got suckered into it and added a couple more. However, they leave payment information out until the very end when they tell you that you are going to be set up month to month of payments and recieve the products every month unless you call and cancel. So once I recieve my products, I will be canceling.</li>
    <li> A total ripoff. Almost nothing in the freeze &amp; fill vials and the other stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Shame on you Dr. Orden.</li>
    <li> Let me start by talking about the product.  I ordered the AM and PM.  I used exactly as directions described on my 51 year old very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM - washed my face and applied the PM cream.  Goes on creamy smooth and feels good.  You feel pretty &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34;.  After about 10 minutes it was &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; and my face felt very dry, like I hadn&#x27;t used any moisturizer.  I put some more on.  Same thing happened.  After the third application I went to bed.  Woke up dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM - I generally do not wash my face in the morning since my skin is so dry and just splash on some water so that&#x27;s what I did.  I applied the AM face firming stuff.  Oh dear.  I was so dry I could see flakes on my skin.  Added moisturizer because I couldn&#x27;t put on my makeup with that much dry skin flaking off.  Tried again the next day by putting on some moisturizer first and then the AM stuff.  That was better but I didn&#x27;t feel much &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; starts when you ORDER, not when you receive the product.  The fine print says you have to cancel within 10 days but it doesn&#x27;t say that on your confirmation email.  Basically, you had better call and cancel the minute you receive your product (or before if it takes more than 10 days to get to you) if you are just getting this for the free trial.  If you call within 10 days of RECEIVING the product, you&#x27;ll be too late and they&#x27;ll charge your credit card.  If you want to use their &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34;, you have to do that within 21 days of the ORDER, not when you receive the product.  By the time you see the charge on your credit card (and they do not send you ANYTHING to let you know they are charging you), it&#x27;s too late to do anything.  Learn from my mistake.</li>
    <li> Wow, this makes your face/eyes look weird and more wrinkles.  Thank goodness I tried it at night on the weekend and didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere!  Not recommending.</li>
    <li> The trial size isn&#x27;t meant to last 30 days...it&#x27;s just to try the product with the understanding that you can buy the full size if you like the results (just like the smaller trial sizes at the Department Store).  This also explains why the pen and tip of the fill-and-freeze are also smaller than on the commercial.</li>
    <li> This product is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last 30 days.....not even 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can only buy it in a group of products and not individual products, so if you runo ut of the eye serum, you can&#x27;t just order the serum, you have to spend more money and order the entire kit.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t believe Infomercials, most of them are scams!! product works but results aren&#x27;t even worth the price. Get ready to get your card charged more than what they claim.</li>
    <li> the stuff dries out in the tube and  have found that you cant put makeup over  it</li>
    <li> DERM EXCLUSIVE WORKS FOR ME !!!!</li>
    <li> I used it exactly as they showed on TV it did not make a difference whatsoever in my skin</li>
    <li> When a reviewer doesn&#x27;t write back to respond to questions, usually they have ulterior motives....like they are selling another competing product (like \\&quot;# 7\\&quot;) there are many other reasons as well....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same goes for the glowing reviews seen here....you might ask yourself - If you were selling a product with the potential of making huge bucks wouldn&#x27;t you give and write a glowing review, maybe even pretending you&#x27;re just an average user and give your product an outstanding 4 or 5 star reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works both ways.....but usually praising scams or put downs reviewers don&#x27;t come back to answer comments or questions asked of them - they are off trashing or praising elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware there are both kinds of people who write fake negative reviews as well as reviewers who write fake positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to know is to continue asking questions of reviewers, talking to friends you trust who may have used the product or finally try the product yourself making sure the money back guarantee is legit and use the money back guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to write a review of your experiences with the product you&#x27;re using - (and be ready to answer others follow-up questions - pro or con).</li>
    <li> The only thing active about this is the charges they put on your bank account! Beware! Don&#x27;t get suckered like I did! I ordered a &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; for the shipping price of $5.97 only to find another charge of $58 added less than two weeks later! Then two weeks after that a new box arrived, then another! Neither of them were ordered or requested but both charged at the rate of $63.97 each!!  When I called to complain and request a refund I was left on hold for about 15 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone, I was told the free trial starts the day it is ordered! How can you TRY a product you haven&#x27;t received yet?  It took 2 weeks to get here and I was charged before I could try anything. They would only agree to refund the cost of one box, but not before offering discounted pricing if I would continue buying their product. The product is not that great. Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and certainly not worth the high price tag! Stay away! Would give negative stars if I could, but guess the one star could be that you can always rely on another box in the mail, whether you ordered it or not!</li>
    <li> Not only does this product not last more than ten uses, you can&#x27;t put any makeup over the serum after it dries. You will look like the skin under the eyes it&#x27;s extremely dry and flaky! It&#x27;s terrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Instead of the Collagen Lift a cleaner was included.  There was too lillte of the other products to analyze any results. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> This product can be purchased online or over the phone for $39.95, not for over $50. I would recommend looking around for prices before you purchase the product.</li>
    <li> I am quite please with this product. I am especially seeing results around my eye area. I will continue to use at this point and am hopeful that it will bring greater results.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Derm Exclusive products (full line, including the cleaner, serum, lift, freeze n fill, nightime acid pads, lip plumper) for about 3 weeks now and my skin is in no better shape than with the hodge-podge of drugstore products I usually use. Oh, and somehow it managed to BOTH be not moisturizing enough AND make me break out. Fail!</li>
    <li> This product is really good and has done for me what it was advertised to do. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received my kit on Jan 11. &amp; started using it that evening. I followed the instructions to the letter, but by Jan 13, my Fill &amp; Freeze was EMPTY !  I used it  friday nite, sat morining, sat nite, sunday morning &amp; when I tried to use it Sunday nite it was empty.  I still have some of the other products &amp; I continue to use them, but truthfully, do not see any difference.  I think it&#x27;s disgusting that I only got 4 uses out of the fill and freeze, it makes me wonder if they sent me one that someone else had returned.  I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I notice on the TV advertisement, that this product also gets rid of small freckles, small hairs, and sweat pores... or the pictures have been retouched and blurred in areas to make the results of the product look better than it is.  I would not trust the product based upon the before/after pictures.</li>
    <li> The derma freeze pen worked great  It only lasted 3 days. I did not see much difference using the rest of the product after 3 Weeks of use. It only lasted 3 Weeks.  Would love to buy the derma freeze separately if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> For two weeks I used the product exactly as directed on ONE SIDE OF MY FACE. At the end of the two weeks, I asked people which side I&#x27;d used it on… they were not sure… I had used nothing on the other side of my face except $ Store lotion to cleanse at night. I&#x27;d never spent so much time prepping and creaming my face. My skin was soft, but not noticeable softer than my other side. I am 74 years old, and that much attention to cleansing, creaming, smoothing, and touching up should have made a noticeable difference. It didn&#x27;t. I was determined to know that it made a distinct difference and the test proved that it didn&#x27;t. I could have used Dollar Store stuff and gotten just as good results. Shame on the Doctor! He should have done side-by-side tests. I believed what I saw on the show, but I was determined to test it. Shame, shame, shame! Save your money, by $Store lotions and give your skin the same attention, you&#x27;ll have same results.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  No difference whatsoever. It definitely does not last for 30 days....more like 3 days. This is a horrible misrepresentation to the public. Dr. Orden evidently has no conscious.</li>
    <li> Since these comments Derm Exclusive has upgraded and your product will last 30 days.  This product does work.  I use it and the lines were very noticeably gone especially around my eyes.  And now it is so much easier to add my makeup, goes on so much smoother including my eyeliner pencil.</li>
    <li> Though Derm Exclusive does make my skin glow and feel soft, the amount of product you get for a 30 day supply is too little. I have been using Derm Exclusive for two weeks now and I&#x27;m almost out!! I&#x27;m not one to waste and I use it sparingly but what you get for 30 days is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money! The fill and freeze can not be used under or over fountain make-up! If you even try to apply fountain on top or under the product it looks like you&#x27;re painting over cement! The only way you can use the fill and freeze is if you don&#x27;t plan on using any fountain, base, or powder and the results you get they claim that happen instantly aren&#x27;t any better than what you&#x27;d get from using a primer and at least when you buy a prep and primer you can apply your makeup regularly without looking like someone splashed flour on your face and you went over it with a fountain.  Yuck. I&#x27;m using the remainder of mine at night or on days I don&#x27;t wanna wear make-up to avoid dealing with a return on my money from these scam artists. I&#x27;m glad I cancelled my debit card after I made this purchase seeing the reviews I&#x27;m reading now saying the company kept charging their cards after claiming it was a one time purchase. I&#x27;ll eat the mistake on this one but I sure will spread the info about this product anywhere I can online. Save your money! Run!</li>
    <li> This product is no better than other Alpa Hydoxy Acid products. It is over priced and not worth it.Go to the Drugstore and look for products w/ Glycolic acids  or even better, Retninol. The fill and freeze does nothing.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all for me. Although I wanted it to work, I saw no difference.  Very easy to return to friendly rep at company  - just hate that I wasted time and money.</li>
    <li> My experience is that it didn&#x27;t work. However, it might work for other people. It&#x27;s not that expensive, so it&#x27;s worth a shot. I gave this 3 stars because it came in on time and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I tried Derm Exclusive for 25 days.  I purchased it directly from the Infomercial.  I gave it a fair trial and saw no real difference in this time.  I then called them and told them I was returning it, got my cancellation number and mailed back the empty bottles.  While they did stop the auto ship, they did not return my money as promised.  I called them, gave them my cancellation number and they said they never received it.  I told them I took it directly to the post office and mailed it.  They said they never received it.  Well, I had a return address on the box and I never got it back.  So, this part of the promotion is a scam in my eyes.  Auto ships and money back guarantees should always be questioned.  I went back to my Retin A, Vitamin C and Neutrogena Serum.  This combination works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 28 days.  I used it sparingly and it&#x27;s just about gone.  If I had used it on my neck and chest as suggested, it wouldn&#x27;t have lasted this long.  I liked the routine of it, the fragrance, the feel on my face, but I don&#x27;t see any significant changes in my skin.  I&#x27;m 70, so maybe it&#x27;s best suited to younger skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it thru Amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t get into the automatic monthly delivery.  I just wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I liked the product okay but was disappointed with the small size of the &amp;#34;Fill &amp; Freeze&amp;#34;.  The directions say to use it day and night but it only lasted a week and a half and I was only using it in the day.  The tube is tiny and I used it sparingly.  I don&#x27;t think this kit is worth the price.  I will be buying through another source at a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did really like the rest of the kit and the size of the bottles for the other products were good and lasted longer.  Loved the &amp;#34;Micro Peel Resurfacing Pads&amp;#34; they made my skin very smooth!</li>
    <li> the fill and freeze was the worst product that i&#x27;ve ever used.  you can see it on your face like a mask where you&#x27;ve applied it and it did NOTHING else but look obvious and shinier then the rest of my skin.  the face cream was nice and that&#x27;s all.  it was easy to apply makeup over it but i didn&#x27;t see any wrinkle reduction at all.</li>
    <li> Glad to read ALL the reviews....before I got suckered into another pricey // doesn&#x27;t work so well deal.&lt;br /&gt;I have too many wrinkles from STRESS in my life....and would like to look younger ....but reviews lead me to NOT order the product.</li>
    <li> I liked most of the products but they came in very small sizes that were supposed to last a month. the fill and freeze seemed like it might be a good product, but it lasted only a few days not a month like they say it should. I am a professional Esthetician who knows how to use products sparingly so it wasn&#x27;t that I used too much. Maybe it was dreid up or they think it should be the price of gold. I don&#x27;t know but untill they offer a larger size product to last a month and not increase the price, I will not recomend this to my clients.</li>
    <li> I have just begun the use, do like the texture of my skin with Collegan Lift and moisturizer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My skin looks better. I love the scrub pad and the face creams. The pen works great for me and lasts.  You only need a litte of the product.  I does go a long way. I have spent over a  $1000.00 on what we&#x27;re to be super products. Derm works great, but you can&#x27;t  rely just on the pen. I use them all together  and am very happy with my 50 year old skin!</li>
