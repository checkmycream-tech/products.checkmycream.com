### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All arrived in perfect condition and in a timely fashion.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>So I was happy to find this newer model!</li>
      <li>She says it&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>She LOVED it!</li>
      <li>I bought 3 of these units (1 for me &amp; 2 for friends) and we are all happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>also would like to thank the Amazon rep who promply helped me resolve a password issue and make the shopping experience a pleasant one.</li>
      <li>This product was not as good as I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>Nice attractive warmer.</li>
      <li>I got a great deal and it looks nice too.</li>
      <li>The good things:  </li>
      <li>Friends and family love the gift too!  </li>
      <li>This works great for warming the lotion for a baby after a bath, and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>so it was warm when they got out of the tub.  </li>
      <li>It warms the lotion so well, and my baby slept so well after giving him a massage with warm lotion after a bath.  </li>
      <li>I even bought one for my granddaughters so they have nice warm lotion to put on after a bath.</li>
      <li>She asked for this item to warm up their lotion</li>
      <li>The lotion is warm, but cools rapidly on the skin.</li>
      <li>Shutoff is nice feature.</li>
      <li>The lotion warmed quickly, and it is a great product to have, but the lotion could be even warmer.</li>
      <li>My wife loves being able to apply warm lotion now that she has the Conair.  </li>
      <li>Its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and</li>
      <li>even when it does warm up, it isn&#x27;t super warm.</li>
      <li>I love the locking top, on/off button with an indicator light to let you know when the lotion is warm.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>This is such an awesome product.  </li>
      <li>Someone could do well if they created a lower cost and more efficient version of this item.</li>
      <li>Maybe the people below me who have said the lotion doesn&#x27;t get warm are using a thicker lotion or something (I use Vaseline Intensive Care), but my lotion is warm to the point of almost being too hot to put on my skin.  </li>
      <li>The lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm.  </li>
      <li>The handle gets slippery once you have lotion on your hands, making it easy to knock over the dispenser.</li>
      <li>Easy to use/clean.  </li>
      <li>You do have to set it all the way to hot in order for it to be warm though.</li>
      <li>Takes a little while to get warmed up but otherwise great!</li>
      <li>After expelling the water the lotion then flowed freely.</li>
      <li>I received a heated lotion dispenser for a gift and love it so much that I bought them for my daughters, my sisters, and my friends.  </li>
      <li>Good overall.</li>
      <li>The lotion gets a little warm but not quite as warm as I would like.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>Pump action is very easy.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome being able to adjust the temperature of the lotion and if your lotion is  thick, it will thin it out and make it silky warm!</li>
      <li>Needs more sensitive control for temperature setting.</li>
      <li>It heats up the lotion quite fast (I think under 2 minutes), and it&#x27;s not a bad looking unit.  </li>
      <li>I will be back to purchase more.</li>
      <li>Conair HLD31 Heated Lotion Dispenser is a good idea but the cord is to heavy</li>
      <li>The lotion is warm, but not hot.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately this is the best item to warm lotion on the market, and I am not sure it is worth $100.</li>
      <li>Great being able to apply warm lotion on your body especially during the cold weather!</li>
      <li>This heated lotion dispenser works really well.  </li>
      <li>It heats up fast and does the job.  </li>
      <li>But not from here, somewhere where it was MUCH cheaper.</li>
      <li>I quickly realized that I needed to buy a second one for myself!</li>
      <li>One pump&#x27;s worth, then you have to wait for the next pump to heat up.</li>
      <li>You will need to fill the dispenser from your normal lotion bottle and the dispenser plugs into an outlet.</li>
      <li>I have had this product for several years and use it every day, it is wonderful on feet that are cold.</li>
      <li>I was about to send it back when I tried using water first, then transferring the pump to the lotion.</li>
      <li>It warms the lotion, but the container has to be about half full to pump.  </li>
      <li>It was not what I expected but does not mean others will not like it  </li>
      <li>You have to wait a little time between pumps for the lotion to re-heat if you&#x27;re using a lot of it to cover large areas of your body.  </li>

<li> What a disappointment.  </li>
<li> The dial is also impossible to adjust once you have put any lotion on your hands.</li>
<li> The bad thing:  </li>
<li> Should have heavier base.</li>

    <li> What a disappointment.  This dispenser looks terrific but barely warms the lotion, no matter how long you leave it heating.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product for the cold winter months in the North.  I also had to put lots of lotion on to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy but dreaded putting cold lotion on.  This product I would definately recommend to anyone that likes to put lotion on but hates putting it on cold.</li>
    <li> Nice attractive warmer. Heats up quickly. Holds pleanty of lotion. Chrome accents attract finger prints.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says! It&#x27;s not too hot or cold. You do have to set it all the way to hot in order for it to be warm though.</li>

    <li> I purchased 3 of these.  2 as gifts.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful product.  I love the locking top, on/off button with an indicator light to let you know when the lotion is warm.  A gage to set the tempature of the lotion.  Easy to use/clean.  Pump action is very easy.  Friends and family love the gift too!  I will be back to purchase more.</li>

    <li> I ordered then of these heated lotion dispensers.  All arrived in perfect condition and in a timely fashion.  I received a heated lotion dispenser for a gift and love it so much that I bought them for my daughters, my sisters, and my friends.  I even bought one for my granddaughters so they have nice warm lotion to put on after a bath.</li>
    <li> This is the same lotion warmer that is used by the nail salon I go to.  The good things:  It heats up the lotion quite fast (I think under 2 minutes), and it&#x27;s not a bad looking unit.  The bad thing:  You have to wait a little time between pumps for the lotion to re-heat if you&#x27;re using a lot of it to cover large areas of your body.  All in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This works great for warming the lotion for a baby after a bath, and is easy to use.  The lotion is warm, but not hot.  You will need to fill the dispenser from your normal lotion bottle and the dispenser plugs into an outlet.</li>
    <li> Maybe the people below me who have said the lotion doesn&#x27;t get warm are using a thicker lotion or something (I use Vaseline Intensive Care), but my lotion is warm to the point of almost being too hot to put on my skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I am always cold, the lotion has to be warm otherwise my skin just turns to goosebumps and I don&#x27;t get the absorption I need. Since using this my skin has been a lot softer. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product was not as good as I hoped it would be. The lotion gets a little warm but not quite as warm as I would like. Also the reservoir for the lotion  which is actually heated is quite small and after pumping out 2-3 small portions one has to wait for the new portion which has entered the reservoir to be warmed which is impractical.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these units (1 for me &amp; 2 for friends) and we are all happy with the product.  For the money it is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome product.  I bought this before my second child was born. It warms the lotion so well, and my baby slept so well after giving him a massage with warm lotion after a bath.  I quickly realized that I needed to buy a second one for myself!</li>
    <li> I owned the other conair lotion dispenser for a couple of years and I dropped it and it broke. So I was happy to find this newer model! It&#x27;s awesome being able to adjust the temperature of the lotion and if your lotion is  thick, it will thin it out and make it silky warm! Great being able to apply warm lotion on your body especially during the cold weather! (-:</li>
    <li> My sister has 2 little boys.  She asked for this item to warm up their lotion so it was warm when they got out of the tub.  She says it&#x27;s great!  Takes a little while to get warmed up but otherwise great!</li>
    <li> The intructions don&#x27;t tell you how to prime the pump. I was about to send it back when I tried using water first, then transferring the pump to the lotion. After expelling the water the lotion then flowed freely. The biggest complaint I have for this item is that it does not heat very much lotion at a time. One pump&#x27;s worth, then you have to wait for the next pump to heat up. I hope this helps!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom a couple years ago for Christmas. But not from here, somewhere where it was MUCH cheaper. She LOVED it! She has arthritic hands, and I gave this to her for Christmas. She used it everyday, but didn&#x27;t even last a year.</li>
    <li> The lotion warmed quickly, and it is a great product to have, but the lotion could be even warmer. The handle gets slippery once you have lotion on your hands, making it easy to knock over the dispenser. The dial is also impossible to adjust once you have put any lotion on your hands. Unfortunately this is the best item to warm lotion on the market, and I am not sure it is worth $100. Someone could do well if they created a lower cost and more efficient version of this item.</li>
    <li> It warms the lotion, but the container has to be about half full to pump.  The lotion is warm, but cools rapidly on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for several years and use it every day, it is wonderful on feet that are cold.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected but does not mean others will not like it  just my opinion</li>
    <li> The lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm.  So if you want to use a lot of lotion, you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up.  I have dry skin so I put lotion all over.  Its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up, it isn&#x27;t super warm.</li>
