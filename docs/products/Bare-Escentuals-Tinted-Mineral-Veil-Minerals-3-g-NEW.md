      <li>Also, it has the old packaging design..</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals Tinted Mineral Veil!</li>
      <li>Ready the product information carefully.</li>
      <li>Would recommend it to anyone using bare mineral products</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product.  Love all of this line of makeup.  Will be buying more in the future.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bareMinerals for years.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal...not a fake product as suggested by some on here. I have the foundation but ran out of mineral veil, so I bought it here. I love this finishing powder and I use it over my other foundations for a soft, shimmery, healthy look. I love the tinted kind because it gives me some extra color when my foundation is a bit light. It looks great in photos too. Love it!</li>
    <li> My own fault though.. I should have paid attention to the size. I really needed a 6oz container! I didn&#x27;t appreciate that when I ordered it.. Also, it has the old packaging design.. I can&#x27;t help but wonder how old it is! Hmmm</li>
    <li> I was replacing some product I had bought at a store.  This package was 1/2 size I was expecting.  But I like the product.</li>
    <li> I use this all summer.  I Love it.  It is the best Powder I have ever used and does not make me break out.  I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I use this product so I knew what to expect. Great price and shipping. Would recommend it to anyone using bare mineral products</li>
    <li> I find this color nice to wear but the small 3g&lt;br /&gt;is difficult to work with. I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage without appearing chalky or clownish. I am amazed that a mineral powder could pack such a punch! True fan of Bare Escentuals!! Anything with the word &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; in the makeup description is a safe bet no matter what your coloring. It just makes you glow without appearing orange.</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Minerals since 2006 - best makeup on the market.</li>
    <li> The color was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am african american and use this after I apply BE matte finish makeup.  If the temperature is 100 degrees with 100% humidity your makeup does not move.  I love this stuff.  I am so happy Amazon has this available.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals Tinted Mineral Veil! Fortunately I don&#x27;t feel compelled to suffocate my face with a lot of goop AND I live in a very humid climate...Bare Escentuals is simply perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Although I thought I looked at the weight of my old container, I discovered this is the small size, when I wanted the larger size - so there was no bargain here.  3 stars for the confusion, no complaints for the same Bare Escentuals quality product.</li>
    <li> Ready the product information carefully. I didn&#x27;t realize that I was buying a mini product at the full size price! Never again! The product is totally overpriced&#x3D;zero stars. The product arrived quickly&#x3D;one star.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for 8 years now, prior to that I was a clinique and other expensive makeup user.  Though some think this product seems high, it lasts a long time! Looks great on your face and is good for your skin!  I reccomend buying a starter kit so you can try it out...its a 3 step deal.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this vendor. At this price it seems that you would be getting the full size product. Shocked to see I paid almost full price for a mini container. My bad I guess but can&#x27;t help but feel picture is  misleading</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for some time, the only concern I have is the container is not the type with the dials that allows you to control how much of the product to dispense.</li>
    <li> Love this product, adds just a last sheer layer of makeup.  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2009 and love it!!  Suggestion if you use the foundation and mineral veil but have shiny/oily skin, put the Mineral Veil under your foundation, then your foundation, then over the foundation.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I use this every day when finishing my makeup, whether it be to go shopping or a night out. It gives that extra glow.</li>
