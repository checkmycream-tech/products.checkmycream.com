      <li>I used in my diffuser to help with mood, mixing and alone, i love the smell and also the tranquility.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend it as an excellent relaxation oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this Sun Organic Ylang Ylang Oil for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>It does not have one on top.</li>
      <li>sure I would recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: I received this free product to perform product testing with the intent of providing an honest and educated review.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent choice for Ylang Ylang oil, especially for cosmetic</li>
      <li>I was new to this oil, I had to do some research on it to find out the great properties.</li>
      <li>they smell ok and are fine for a massage  oil</li>
      <li>It helps to relax me so that I can fall asleep easily.</li>
      <li>It is so strong, yet now overpowering.  </li>
      <li>The bottle came with a dropper for accurate use.</li>
      <li>I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
      <li>Product was sent to me to try for free.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth 5 Stars!</li>
      <li>This is pleasant, not to strong and mixes well with other oils</li>
      <li>I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>People apply Ylang Ylang oil to the skin to promote relaxation, kill bacteria, lower high blood pressure, and increase sexual desire.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to have a diffuser, but another new discovery I made is mixing this with a bit of fractionated coconut oil and raw shea butter to make my own, homemade, whipped body butter.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite oil I have purchased so far!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not Ylang Ylang Extra because it&#x27;s scent is not as strong.  </li>
      <li>I also like to add a few drops to my bath water, and I also mix it with just the coconut oil for the most amazing smelling body moisturizer on the</li>
      <li>, a nice size bottle for essential oils.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely, lightly fragrant essential oil.</li>
      <li>Used as a fragrance (mixed into a carrier oil), the oil stayed very nicely for a good amount of time on my skin, and the fragrance was not overpowering in the least.</li>
      <li>Lovely Ylang Ylang Essential Oil, Organic and at a great bargain compared to other brands.  </li>
      <li>, they actually protect the oil from light, which will break down the oil and greatly reduce the shelf life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrives in a dark glass bottle with a screw top cap and a pipette to get the precise amount of oil you require.  </li>
      <li>It is just exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>more than likely blended with a carrier oil, because it smalls almost all of almond oil.  </li>
      <li>This Ylang ylang essential oil by Sun Organics is fabulous!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite go to essential oils.  </li>
      <li>But as far as this one goes, It smells like black licorice, it has a strong overwhelming smell.</li>
      <li>Is this pure or diluted?</li>
      <li>I have been hooked on the fragrance of Ylang Ylang for many years now, but I am still fairly new to using essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied, waist of money.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know the words to describe it.</li>
      <li>Recieved for free for review, Ylang-Ylang Essential Oil can be used for helping with depression, antiseptic, aphrodisiac, hypotensive, sedative, It has tons of health benefits.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this oil!!!! i would buy this over and over the only con i have is that its cold here and by time i get it its frozen, but i just set them on the counter and let them warm up to room temp. just scary touching a frozen glass bottle.</li>
    <li> Lovely Ylang Ylang Essential Oil, Organic and at a great bargain compared to other brands.  I will definitely be purchasing this and other essential oils from Sun Organics due to the high quality of the oils.</li>
    <li> Recieved for free for review, Ylang-Ylang Essential Oil can be used for helping with depression, antiseptic, aphrodisiac, hypotensive, sedative, It has tons of health benefits. I used in my diffuser to help with mood, mixing and alone, i love the smell and also the tranquility.</li>
    <li> Very faint odor, but definitely Ylang Ylang.</li>
    <li> This does not even come close to smelling like Ylang Ylang.  It is definitely more like Ylang Ylang III.  It was an extremely diluted version of Ylang Ylang.  Was not impressed.</li>
    <li> This oil smells wonderful!  I mixed it with other essential oils in my diffuser that I keep in the bedroom for a nice relaxing scent to fall asleep to.  I like that this smaller 2 oz bottle comes with a dropper (pipette)  for dispensing by droplets.  Good quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> So wonderful.  What a great fragrance. Yummy and sexy.</li>
    <li> got this oil to review and i love it. the smell is great and strong(enough for me anyway) will for sure be trying more thank you</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Ylang Ylang. I don&#x27;t really know the words to describe it. Ylang Ylang is excellent for relaxation and stress relief. I decided to try this Sun Organic Ylang Ylang. It is just exactly what I wanted.  Its a good quality oil that is available for a great price.  I love to use Ylang Ylang in a diffuser. Its great to diffuse about an hour before bed. It helps to relax me so that I can fall asleep easily. I am very pleased with this Ylang Ylang Oil. I definitely recommend it as an excellent relaxation oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this Sun Organic Ylang Ylang Oil for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to all these essential oils, so I haven&#x27;t tryed any other brands, other then the cheap ones you buy at WalMart etc. But as far as this one goes, It smells like black licorice, it has a strong overwhelming smell. My diffuser was old and quit working on me so I haven&#x27;t tryed any of my new essential oils in one yet, also I&#x27;m just now finding out that they have a million uses, so as soon as I try all the different ways, I will update this review and give an opinion on the ways I tryed them and how they worked. It did come with a plastic dropper, as did all of the essential oils I&#x27;ve got of this brand</li>
    <li> This Ylang ylang essential oil by Sun Organics is fabulous! It smells so good. I put this in my diffuser and my house smells amazing! I love the soothing scent. This is 2 oz., a nice size bottle for essential oils. It will definitely last for a while as you only need a few drops. Love this stuff! *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> This is pleasant, not to strong and mixes well with other oils</li>
    <li> Is this pure or diluted? It&#x27;s the first essential oil in my diffuser I couldn&#x27;t even smell when standing right next to it.</li>
    <li> Decent oil for the price. I&#x27;d probably buy again even though its not the strongest ylang ylang oil i&#x27;ve ever owed.</li>
    <li> Yet another amazing smelling oil! So awesome to receive these free and then try them out. The quality of the oil is that of it&#x27;s overpriced competitor! Will continue to use the Sun Essential Oils!!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.  They claim their products to be 100% pure essential oi.  Well they are not.  I purchased the Ylang Ylang and you can tell by smelling that is is more than likely blended with a carrier oil, because it smalls almost all of almond oil.  You can also tell this by the consistency, as it is thick and syrupy, unlike most pure 100% essential oils. I will never by from this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> Nice smells oil will work well. Product was sent to me to try for free.</li>
    <li> I have been hooked on the fragrance of Ylang Ylang for many years now, but I am still fairly new to using essential oils.  I have a couple of diffusers now and several scents, but this is definitely my go-to for overall peace and tranquility.  There is something about the way it smells that lifts my spirits and enhances my mood wonderfully.  There are plenty of uses for it, too.  It&#x27;s great to have a diffuser, but another new discovery I made is mixing this with a bit of fractionated coconut oil and raw shea butter to make my own, homemade, whipped body butter.  You can&#x27;t get better than homemade, and you get something that is 100% organic.  It makes my skin feel and smell amazing.  All I did was a quick Google search and there are endless possibilities for uses for this heavenly scented oil.  I also like to add a few drops to my bath water, and I also mix it with just the coconut oil for the most amazing smelling body moisturizer on the planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives in a dark glass bottle with a screw top cap and a pipette to get the precise amount of oil you require.  I like that Sun Organic uses dark glass bottles, they actually protect the oil from light, which will break down the oil and greatly reduce the shelf life.  I am thrilled to have been able to receive this at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  It is definitely worth 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> People apply Ylang Ylang oil to the skin to promote relaxation, kill bacteria, lower high blood pressure, and increase sexual desire.  I have found that I&#x27;ve actually been able to change my mood with different essential oils in my diffuser.  Ylang Ylang is one of those fragrances that I like to mix with others.  It has its own distinguishable scent (which I think smells a lot like licorice with a floral kick), but when mixed with other oils it really changes.  This is a very high quality oil that is great to use in a diffuser or on your skin with a carrier oil or carrier stick.  This is one of my favorite go to essential oils.  It smells different in the diffuser or on your skin than it does in the bottle.  Sample received for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I was new to this oil, I had to do some research on it to find out the great properties. I&#x27;ve been diffusing it since I got my package in the mail! It&#x27;s scent is amazing. Also I&#x27;ve added a bit to my conditioner when I&#x27;m in the shower. My hair it&#x27;s looking very shiny and has a hint of floral when I towel dry. Thanks Sun Organic for making a great oil and letting me get the chance to try and review it for you. The smaller bottle is now in my travel bag!</li>
    <li> I received this oil for free to review and give my honest opinion and I love it..I Use EO&#x27;s in my soaps and lotions and I will be purchasing this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent very refreshing and earthy</li>
    <li> I love using this essential oil in my diy perfumes and other products. It is a really good quality. But be advised that you need a glass dropper to measure it properly. It does not have one on top. But for 2 oz, it is a really good deal. Plus the quality is just excellent.</li>
    <li> It smells similar to the more expensive brands but it feels as if it is cut with something. It leaves an oily film in your diffuser so I wouldn&#x27;t put it in your good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free that I may give an honest review.</li>
    <li> Great smell and price. I use this and lavender mixed with a bit of water as a mist every morning. It smells so good and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> not concentrated.  oder very faint, can smell the scent if some kind of carrier oil, though I&#x27;m not sure which one. Sad.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, lightly fragrant essential oil. Ylang ylang is used to help reduce sebum production of the skin (in case you have naturally oily skin) and is also used in aromatherapy as an aphrodisiac. Used as a fragrance (mixed into a carrier oil), the oil stayed very nicely for a good amount of time on my skin, and the fragrance was not overpowering in the least. The bottle came with a dropper for accurate use. This is an excellent choice for Ylang Ylang oil, especially for cosmetic purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER: I received this free product to perform product testing with the intent of providing an honest and educated review. I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> only used once so far !</li>
    <li> This is my fist time trying emu oil. Read all the great things it can be used for,such as, skin,hair, muscle soreness, scars, and even stretch marks. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great for use in my bath &amp; body products.</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it was. I thought it was the concentrated form.</li>
    <li> essential oil review - this essential oil seems to bring on a feeling of calmness and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I would recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great product,fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Great oil for the price.  I&#x27;ve used sun organics and they make great oils</li>
    <li> Im my opinion this product is very diluted, not pure Ylang Ylang oil. It even doesn&#x27;t  look like an oil, but rather some kind of clouded substance. Most of the content is some kind of vegetable carrier oil. The flowery sense has evaporated  in a few minutes after warming it in a diffuser leaving unpleasantly smelling grease. Very dissatisfied, waist of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This oil has a great smell to it. very calming to me. I was given this product to test with out any biased</li>
    <li> This is not pure essential oil!!! This is massage oil. What a load of crap! I bought this one and the lavender and they are both extremely diluted. Don&#x27;t get me wrong they smell ok and are fine for a massage  oil but that&#x27;s not what I paid for. Shame on seller for lying about the product. Do Not Buy!!!</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my warmer! Steamer! Soap, hands soap!! Strong fragrance! Very light oil!! I wil buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at discount price to review this but nothing to do with my review! Opinion is my own!!</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
    <li> This Ylang Ylang oil smells amazing.  It smells just as I expected.  It has a very nice floral smell.  It is in no way overpowering if you diffuse the correct amount.  It only takes a couple of drops in your diffuser and the entire room will smell fantastic.  I felt my mood improving within minutes of diffusing. . It is uplifting and helps with my well being.  It has too many benefits to list! It is also used a lot in cosmetic products and perfumes.  I am going to try and make my own soap using this oil.  This is an awesome value.  It does come packaged with a plastic dropper.  This is my favorite oil I have purchased so far!  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent!  It is so strong, yet now overpowering.  Also, I added it to my body butter recipe and it is terrific!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as invigorating as described. It doesn&#x27;t stink but it&#x27;s not what I expected. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. Would try other oils in this brand . It is not organic though.</li>
    <li> As with all essential oils, I find this one to be very beneficial.  The Sun Organic brand has been very good for me.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, although it&#x27;s a bit confusing as to whether this one is Ylang Ylang II or Ylang Ylang III.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not Ylang Ylang Extra because it&#x27;s scent is not as strong.  There are 3 types of Ylang Ylang, I believe this one may be Ylang Ylang III because the sent is very light.  It would be helpful if this was clarified, in the notes about the product, by the seller.</li>
