      <li>It is amazing</li>

      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?! :)</li>
      <li>Great product- first tried the 5 day set &amp; just had to purchase this box!  </li>
      <li>My face had a nice glow and my makeup seemed to adhere so much better.</li>
      <li>but I am suspicious of products that seem to be too good to be true.</li>
      <li>obviously, buying these on Amazon is the best deal money-wise.</li>
      <li>People constantly comment on how perfect my skin looks... and coming from an acne world, you can&#x27;t imagine what this means to me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can say is that I truly love this product.</li>
      <li>; skincare/makeup stores charge way more money for it.</li>
      <li>I love the peels.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of Witch Hazel, but so much more.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d love to add some color for summer.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I gave these a chance.  </li>
      <li>However, the most noticeable differences are that my skin is more  &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, softer and absorbs moisturizer better, and pore size reduced.</li>
      <li>I was so amazed that I immediately jumped online to order more.</li>
      <li>I have been using it, and I find I get the wonderful results, but it is definitely stronger than what I need</li>
      <li>Love.  </li>
      <li>all in all, i&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
      <li>I just love these.</li>

      <li>I love the way these packets work.  </li>
      <li>My skin gets a healthy glow about it, the sallowness, lack-luster is gone &amp; skin looks</li>
      <li>After trying many, many skin care products that claim to &amp;#34;reduce wrinkles, etc&amp;#34</li>
      <li>My friends have all tried and love them too and are now buying them.  </li>
      <li>I love this peel.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>

      <li>and my skin looks noticeably better after using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ...if only short term.  My friends have all tried and love them too and are now buying them.  really gives your face a nice glow after and a smoother feel.  Definitely worth trying</li>
    <li> I have suffered from adult acne due to PCOS for about 5 years and the toll cystic acne took on my skin was devastating. I had received these wipes innate three towelette sample box at sephora. Within threw days my skin was more radiant, smoother, and more supple and plump which for the slight depressions on my face has been life changing. I use the wipes every other day because, for me, everyday is just too often. On the off day I do a mud mask. People constantly comment on how perfect my skin looks... and coming from an acne world, you can&#x27;t imagine what this means to me. I thought I&#x27;d never be normal again.</li>
    <li> I was told this product was great but I am suspicious of products that seem to be too good to be true. I took a chance and was amazed by the transformation of my skin. I am 41 so I have fine lines, sun damage spots, etc. This product evened out my skin tone, made my pores smaller and smoothed out my fine lines. It is an impressive product that actually works. I have sensitive skin and I was happy that it did not make me break out in a rash. I was shocked the first time after I washed my face.  I used the product and saw what my regular cleaning missed. I do not have acne but this product gets deep in your pores and will pull out any impurities. I did have a few breakouts (mild) but after that my skin just keeps getting better and better. You need to try it for at least a month faithfully if you want to see what it can do to transform your skin. I highly recommended this product and i am grateful to the person who told me about Dr. Gross Peels.</li>
    <li> I use the step 1 &amp; 2, on my face and neck every night before using the moisturizer &amp; have seen a difference in my skin in just 3 days. My skin is more clear and even skin toned and have no more breakouts. The step 1 is a wonderful cleanser. Step 2 is the treatment. I usually get a little burning sensation when I apply it on my face, but it goes away in a few seconds, especially after i moisturize and my skin is eventually eventually getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few months and find that it is an excellent facial peel. It is gentle on my skin and totally non-irritating. My face feels tightened and smooth after using. I use the product every other night and plan to continue on this schedule. The price is EXCELLENT compared to retail and television shopping outlets. Very happy to have found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have ordered but not yet received the extra strength version of these Alpha Beta face peels. Having used the regular version for years, however, I anticipate I will love it. I don&#x27;t use them everyday as the instructions dictate, just whenever I feel my skin is taking on a \\&quot;tired\\&quot; look. At that point, I use them for about 3 or 4 days in a row and it transforms my face, taking years off. I highly recommend these peels for anyone who needs a pick me up. They work as well as if not better than the chemical peels I have had done at the dermatologist&#x27;s office (cheaper too!). For reference sake, I am 41 year old redhead with sensitive (rosecea), fair, freckled skin (it fades my freckles and sun damage too!!)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but I depend on reviews of other consumers to make a decision on whether or not if I want to spend my money on a product.  This will be my FIRST review. Here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have always battled with skin problems. I had major acne problems throughout highschool and onward to my adulthood.  Though not as bad as I&#x27;ve gotten older, but it&#x27;s annoying when you think once you get out of your teenage years your acne days are over. NOT. Breaking out right before my cycle starts is the norm for me. When I see a zit pop up I know it&#x27;s almost that time.  I never had smooth, nice skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, I have found a skincare product that actually WORKS for me!  I have combination oily/dry skin, mostly oily. The Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel by Dr. Dennis Gross skincare line is so amazing! My skin has NEVER been so smooth and soft. I haven&#x27;t broken out since I started using this product a couple of months ago. Yes, it is expensive but it&#x27;s better than spending countless amount of money and time at the dermo&#x27;s office and getting ZERO result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. My skin has never been better and I am a very happy consumer. I wish this stuff existed when I was in highschool. I wouldn&#x27;t have to go through the embarrassment of hiding behind all the makeup and junk I had to put on my face to help cover the acne. I love that I can wear minimal makeup and still look fresh. If there is one thing I can&#x27;t stand it&#x27;s a crap full of makeup on my face. Less is better and Dr. Dennis Gross skincare has helped me achieve the ultimate goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights:&lt;br /&gt;- smaller pores&lt;br /&gt;- reduction in blackheads&lt;br /&gt;- reduction in scars and sunspots&lt;br /&gt;- reduction in breakouts&lt;br /&gt;- tightness in skin&lt;br /&gt;- smoother skin&lt;br /&gt;- skin GLOWS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, those are the many things I have found this product has done for my skin.  Like I said, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but after 2 months of usage I stand by this product!this product!</li>
    <li> Not only is this product great for fine lines and wrinkles it&#x27;s also amazing for acne!  I use this product every other day and it keeps my breakouts down to a minimum.  It&#x27;s also helped to reduce the scar tissue on my face.  My acne scars are barely visible!  As a warning though I have very thick German skin which requires the extra strength packets.  If trying for the first time, don&#x27;t use the extra strength.  Work up to it.  It will dry your skin out to start.</li>
    <li> I was worried about using these extra strength wipes as I have sensitive skin that tends towards ruddiness.  I am so glad I gave these a chance.  The first few applications stung a little, but not enough to concern me.  My skin looked noticeably better after the very first use.  The tone was more even and my cheeks were baby soft.  Love.  I use these every other day so the box lasts two months.  Twice I have decided to try less expensive products but both times went rushing back to these wipes after about a week.  My skin isn&#x27;t the same without them.</li>
    <li> YOU cant be looking your best unless you have been using Dr Dennis Gross, Extra Strength Alpha Beta face peel.  Dont let the name fool you.  You dont actually peel but this product tightens your pours and reduces fine lines like magic.  Easy to use. If your over 40 a MUST.  Works so amazing you will be addicted.  One word of caution, stay out of the sun.  Even with sun block you get color while using the product.  Otherwise, this will be your new best friend!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reading the reviews.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month and it is slowly making my dark spots not so noticeable.  I probably have to continue using it to see more improvements.</li>
    <li> I love the way these packets work.  I bought the foiled packets to hopefully maintain their freshness.  My skin feels softer and it looks brighter.  I love this product so much I went on refills every three months because I use them every other day.  I have not suffered dry skin from the glycolics or any other ingredient.</li>
    <li> I take great care of my skin and always seek out the best products. I was skeptical when I purchased these pads (initially I got the regular, not the extra-strength) but I have found that using them makes a great difference in my skin. I use each one for two nights so they last longer. I put the pads back in the original foil pouches, fold over the tops, and then put them in a sealed plastic bag so they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
    <li> These are the best! Easy to use, don&#x27;t irritate your skin. Work really well. Do it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> this price is a bit steep but  I think you can totally get away with using it ever other day to every three days. Your face will feel extra soft after each use. It&#x27;s simply great!</li>
    <li> I RARELY write reviews for products, but often make my purchasing decisions based on other people&#x27;s reviews. This product is so amazing that I felt it would be an injustice to my beautifully smooth, soft and clear skin not to share this information with other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should use the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Face Peel! I purchased the travel foil packets based on other reviews that said the regularly packaged product dried out. I don&#x27;t use the Face Peel everyday, usually every other day b/c I tend to have dry skin. But when I went on vacation I used it daily because sun screen can be pore clogging and my face looked perfect. I really really hate skin spots on my face and this peel kept them at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Face Peel to improve the clarity of my skin. I used to have cystic acne and there were some discoloring remnants and dark spots, but they are all faded and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My make-up goes on beautifully because my skin is so SMOOTH! I was recently getting my make-up done for a wedding and the make-up artist could not believe have smooth and soft my skin was (and she works on HUNDREDS) of faces!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product. You will not be disappointed. Though give it some time to work. I didn&#x27;t see big results until after I had been using it for 2+ weeks!</li>
    <li> Was looking to buy the wipes to tan and found these.  I have used them a few times a week and don&#x27;t really see a difference.  My face feels very clean when I use them though!  I also think they might be wiping off my haircolor at my sideburn area, as I have been seeing grey hairs there more quickly than usual.  Overall I would rate 3 stars for the clean feeling!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different facial peels and by far, this is my favorite. First, it&#x27;s easy - just wipe with the first towelette, wait two minutes and then wipe with the second towelette - no rinsing - that&#x27;s it. Second, it&#x27;s quick - just a few minutes from start to finish. Third, it&#x27;s convenient - the towelettes are individually wrapped and the first and second towelette packettes are attached to one another - especially convenient for traveling. Fourth, and most important, it&#x27;s effective. I&#x27;ve been using these for about a week and my teenaged daughter (who didn&#x27;t know that I added this to my &amp;#34;beauty routine&amp;#34;) said to me after I got ready for bed, &amp;#34;Wow, Mom. Your skin is looking so good you don&#x27;t even need to wear make-up!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying this to my face, I use the towelettes on my neck, decollete, forearms and elbows. Just remember to use a good sunscreen daily! I apply my night-time moisturizer/dark spot corrector on after the peel and I think those products work better now that I&#x27;ve added the peel to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin and I have no problem using these daily but if you find it too strong for your skin type, you can alternate these with the regular strength peel packettes or just use it every other night.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product thinking it would clear up my skin. I already take good care of my skin I just wanted to clear up the little bits that weren&#x27;t going away with my other face wash. This project did not clear up my skin any more then the other things i was already using however it did make my skin smoother. I wouldn&#x27;t by this product again just because of the price and not doing what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 years.  I have seen a huge difference in my skin. I have turned many friends onto it and they love it also.  Love it.</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try the Alpha Beta Peel in hopes that it would help with my adult acne.  I used a 30 day supply and only missed a couple of applications.  It minimally helped with my acne, however, the product never claims that it will clear up blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the product did do was brighten my complexion, shrink visible poor size, and make darker spots from acne fade.  It burned very little with application.  It is highly likely that I will purchase this product again because I enjoy the way my skin glows.</li>
    <li> This product actually does what it says it will do. I usually don&#x27;t find that as a norm. I got it and used it and saw an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and small wrinkles. It is so easy and convenient to use.  I don&#x27;t think I would want to go a day without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for creating a product that actually lives up to what it is advertised to do. I also do not do reviews of products, but this one is an exception, everyone needs to know when a product works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find this product on Amazon.com.  The cost was literally half as much and I am able to receive the product every month, on a repeated cycle.  This way it is always at my door and for a lower price - another wonderful perk.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of Dr Gross extra strength peel was in the jars, and the pads were barely wet.My next purchased I switched to the individual packettes, and they are so much better. I love this peel. I see a wonderful improvement in my skin. My skin is smoother,tighter,brighter and virtually no breakouts. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this treatment. Thank You Amazon for making it more affordable!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. I am 51 years old, and I sincerely look 10 years younger because of this product. I&#x27;m not kidding. I love it. It makes my pores smaller, I have virtually no wrinkles. I will never stop using this. I have it on Auto-delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Dr Dennis, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product. I love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these wipes when I made another purchase and could not believe the difference in my skin&#x27;s texture after that initial use. My face had a nice glow and my makeup seemed to adhere so much better. It is recommended for severe wrinkles, and while I only have some lines, I still think it made a big difference and I now use it once a week. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It works very well in tightening the skin. A small change has taken place to lighten my dark spots but I will continue to use..</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me and I love it. It can be harsh for every night i recommend couple times a week at the most.</li>
    <li> I just love these. I have really seen an improvement in my skin since I started using these pads a couple of months ago. They are a little on the expensive side, but the size of the towelette is so big I just cut them in half and get two uses out of the one packette.</li>
    <li> I received the 10 day for free from an Allure prize I won.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that an at home peel would do anything at all. I tried this out and WOW it burned. I have thin sensitive skin (and also using script retinol) so it may have something to do with it. Keep a fan or waving paper nearby. I figured the neutralize step would hurt less, but no, it burned also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: Sensation above goes away after several uses. It hurts the most the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was only 2-4 minutes of pain per step(fanning helped!). My skin looked very nice after, and some portions are much smoother after only one step. Much stronger than I expected! Some of my blackheads were falling out after, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the package it did help clear out some worse acne and dry up some cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 hours later I still feel slightly sunburned (although do not look it! big plus) so I won&#x27;t be using this daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Downgraded a star because the pads are small, not enough liquid to do face and neck. Plus, the pads alone are quite abrasive.</li>
    <li> I am close to 50 with dry skin in the winter. as i have gone thru menopause, my skin has become sensitive and gets red very easily. i started out using the peel pads every night for a week and noticed an improvement in the clarity and tone of my skin. but my cheeks remained red and i could tell i needed to cut back, so i went to twice a week for a couple of weeks and now i use the pads once a week which i feel is sufficient for me. i also noticed that some of my age spots have lightened in the 6 weeks i&#x27;ve used the product. i cut the pads in half so the 30 count becomes 60. i place the remaining half pad back in the packet and fold it up. it stays moist and ready to use a week later. if my skin didn&#x27;t react so sensitively to these pads, i would use them two times per week. i also see that my skin is dry after i use these pads and so follow them up with a good moisturizer about 15 minutes later. all in all, i&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old asian male who suffers from cystic acne, very very oily skin, and large pores. I bought this product for my partner mainly because the reviews said it was great for anti-aging and to reduce pore size. I tried it as well for 3 days, and it cleared up ALL of my acne, and made all of my pores noticeably smaller in less than a week! It also dried out a lot of my acne scars (from popping pimples) and made them peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the people at work have noticed it the difference in my skin after 4 days of use. I went ahead and purchased my own box on Amazon for $68 (the first one I bought was at Sephora for $86). My partner has also noticed smoother skin and less lines around the eyes. This product is amazing AND 30 wipes will last 60 days because I cut each wipe into two.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product somewhere along the line, and had it in my bathroom for a long time before I actually decided to try it. I was so amazed that I immediately jumped online to order more. My pores were smaller, my skin looked like it was &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and after I got more and used them more often, I had fewer lines and way less break-outs. The hard closed comedones around my chin even seemed to shrink a bit!</li>
    <li> So I have been using these for about 2 weeks, almost nightly (have missed maybe 2 nights) and I am seeing a difference. My skin is clearer, not totally clear but it did greatly reduce the length of the one or two pimples that pop up monthly-ish and it seems like it may be fading some old acne hyperpigmentation, but I will update on that as we go. These things take time ;). However, the most noticeable differences are that my skin is more  &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, softer and absorbs moisturizer better, and pore size reduced. I&#x27;m looking forward to see what happens with continued use and will update in another month or so. I&#x27;m hoping to switch to every other night once I am pretty sure it&#x27;s as good as it&#x27;s going to get in order to just maintain. I also ordered Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27;s glow pads for the face to see how I like those since I liked these so much and I&#x27;d love to add some color for summer. I&#x27;m trying to be good with my sunscreen so I need another way to get the color in! :) I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, with mild to moderate acne, and combination fair-medium skin. I have semi-sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions to this product. Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of reviewers I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne (I&#x27;m in my early 30s). I&#x27;ve got oily, congested pores, and until recently benzoyl peroxide always seemed to work really well, even if it was kid of harsh on my skin. About six months ago it just seemed to not work as well, so I began searching for new skincare products to help prevent my frequent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought the five-pack because I was leery of spending a lot on something I wasn&#x27;t going to love, but luckily it worked great! My skin (especially my neck) can be pretty sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it aggravating my skin at all. It was super easy to use, and the next morning my skin definitely looked better. My skin-tone was more even and some dark spots were definitely lighter. I waited a day or two before trying it again, and my skin continued to react really well. I was even able to use it a few days in a row, which gave me the best overall results. My pores looked smaller and any breakouts were significantly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started using the packets I took a three week trip for work in a really humid climate, and these packets seriously saved my skin. They kept breakouts under control and helped my skin look good overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And obviously, buying these on Amazon is the best deal money-wise. Other &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; skincare/makeup stores charge way more money for it.</li>
    <li> The product pictured has 60 individually sealed towelettes one each for the two step process,  The product received is actually two separate round jars with 30 pads. The pads are smaller than the towelettes but they work the same.  I prefer the individual towelettes, but for the discount price it is still a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I had bought the regular strenght  peel before and it worked well, it felt good and left my skinn nice and clean. I decided to try the extra extrenght to see if it had any other more visible results, but to my desapointment it did not, i relly did not see a huge improvement on my skin when compared to the regular ones. The only difference is the price and quantity, so for that matter I am sticking to the original formula that cost about the same but has 2x the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have been fighting with acne for more than 10 years and this is the best product that works. I have spent a lot of money on lasers, light treatments and other acne products and nothing worked like this one. Now my skin is clear even though I still get a few acnes occasionally.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these for a couple of years. When she is finished with a pad, she hands it to me (her husband).. After 6 months of daily applications, the small brown spots on my forehead are gone &amp; not returned. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I see absolutely no difference in my skin.  It is not strong at all.  I was really hoping for at least a slight peel, but nope!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford the MD facials anymore so I tried this product. It is amazing I think the &#x27;extra strength&#x27; is a little too harsh and I prefer the original strength, but either, this product leaves my skin bright and clear. Be warned that the first time you try it, you may experience a terrible acne breakout for 3 days to a week. The girls at the spa said they had others complain but it will go away. Once it cleans up your skin, it will keep it clear. I am so dependent on this product now. It&#x27;s a great discovery.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see major benefits from the product.  This product does require sunscreen protection on your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 20 consecutive nights and see a difference.  At first, some pimples came out but now they are gone and my 46 year old face is more even and my sunspots are fading.  I&#x27;m going to try this for a full 60 days and see if I see much more improvement or if I may need to move to something stronger...  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product- first tried the 5 day set &amp; just had to purchase this box!  No irritation - brighter &amp; smoother skin.</li>
    <li> My husband and i are obsessed with this product! Its by far the best at home facial peel! It evens skin tone, brightens complexion, wipes away dry skin, minimizes pores and erased the tiny Crowe&#x27;s feet That were starting to develop! I can proudly say I&#x27;m a loyal user!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that if you purchase them on amazon you save About 40-50% vs going to sephora!</li>
    <li> have been using this product for a month now.... not really sure yet what I think.  Feels nice when used, but verdict still out on results.  A little pricey, so not sure if I&#x27;ll order more yet.</li>
    <li> Gentle enough to use daily, but made a huge difference in the look &amp; firmness of my skin.  Evens out texture, firms &amp; reduced pore sizes. I highly recommend to everyone.  I love it so much I have on  subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously used several boxes of the non-extra strength version of this product, and ordered this based on the favorable reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week and really rub each towelette in (until it&#x27;s dry as the instructions say to do) before bedtime. Once the second phase is fully absorbed, I apply moisturizer before bed (other skin does feel a bit tight).&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing- my acne scars seem to be rapidly fading, and my skin is overall more luminous.  As a skin care fanatic, and someone who&#x27;s tried all sorts of facials and peels at the dermatologists, I find the results to be equally good with regular use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat- try it!</li>
    <li> My skin is so sensitive and I&#x27;m allergic to everything...but MD Skincare by Dr. Gross has been amazing!  And I love the Extra Strength facial peels in packets.  I use them before bed even though I think they are supposed to be used in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using them about a month and my skin just looks and feels a lot healthier.  My pores seem a bit smaller, my tone more even, and my skin feels so soft after I apply this.  I have 2 sunspots that don&#x27;t seem to be fading, but not sure how long I would need to use this to remove sunspots. My face does seem firmer and the lines under my eyes are improving, so I think with time it will really help to correct the issues that I already have and continue to help me fight the signs of aging as I near 40.  I&#x27;m so allergic to everything, and I mean everything, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation at all from the peels, which is surprising.  And the towels in the packets are large enough that I cut them in half and each one is the perfect to cover my face and neck.  I store the extra half in a ziplock so it doesn&#x27;t dry out, and since I actually get two treatments instead of one, the price a lot more reasonable.  Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After a few weeks my face started to break out but I thought it was just purging since that sometimes happens when you start a new skincare regimen.  Unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the problem since within a week my entire face was covered with cysts, blemishes, and blackheads.  I was absolutely horrified and realized that this product is just too strong for every day use on my seriously sensitive skin.  This was so strong that it dried my face out to a point that my moisturizer couldn&#x27;t keep up so my pores became clogged.  It has taken about 2 months of humiliation to straighten my face out, but I think I will give it another try in a month or so. However I will ONLY use it once every 3-4 days instead of every day and I will use a much heavier moisturizing cream at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom has also used it and she didn&#x27;t have any of my issues, so I&#x27;m pretty sure this was such a problem for me because it is just too harsh for my sensitive skin on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that has been prone to hormonal acne for the past few years. This gentle peel actually creates a visible difference by the next morning! The redness is diminished and the bumps are smaller. Just one use was enough to show immediate results so what would regular use do? Well, I had to find out! So I bought this product and have been using it. So far, so good! Just as background, I&#x27;m a self-described skin care and makeup junkie so I have tried A LOT of stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using dennis gross alpha beta pads for years (original formula), so when I was in need of some travel packets, I decided to give these a try.  These work, but not any better than the original so I&#x27;m not sure where they are going with &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34;.  They definitely have a different mix of ingredients because pad #1 has a strong alcohol smell and pad #2 does not give your skin a tingly feeling, like in the original formula.  I do like the single serve packets for travel though, but the original comes in that form too so I&#x27;m going to stick with what I like in future orders.</li>
    <li> This is by far my most favorite Retinol product out there. First of all, I love the 2 step process. You clean your skin, and then treat the skin. Second of all, the Retinol is kept STABLE by being in individual packets. I have also tried the pads that come in a jar, and found them way less effective. This must be due to the instability of Retinol, therefore I highly recommend getting these individual packets version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 55 years old. After trying many, many skin care products that claim to &amp;#34;reduce wrinkles, etc&amp;#34;, I find that this is one of the rare finds that actually work for me. I realize everyone is different, so what works for 1 person may or may not for the next. However with that said, I notice a distinct smoothing of fine lines/wrinkles, and the deeper ones also smooth out some. My skin gets a healthy glow about it, the sallowness, lack-luster is gone &amp; skin looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finding a good routine is using the Dr. Gross packets at night, and follow up with Serious Skin Care A kits/products. Their newest products feature 4 Million IU A-Cream XR Time-Released Retinol Cream. I use the products morning, and night, following the Dr. Gross packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have also gotten very good results from Victoria Principal Reclaim with Argireline, and Signature Club A&#x27;s Vitamin C products, and their Argan oil as well as Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil. I am hoping to try Serious Skin Care&#x27;s Vitamin C products soon, and then either use those, or Sig Club A&#x27;s in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m hoping to do in the next couple months after continuous use of the Retinol, is incorporate all the above. I will try the Retinol regimen for 2 weeks, and switch to Vitamin C regimen for 2 weeks &amp; see how that works as far as maintaining the benefits. Then I will slip in the Principal Reclaim with Argirilene product into the mix.</li>
    <li> I use this daily.....like it so much I&#x27;m setup on the auto-delivery program.  I purchase the individual packets for travel purposes.</li>
    <li> I love the original Alpha Beta Face Peel so I thought I would get an even greater response from my skin with the extra strength version.  I find that these are t0o harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin looks smoother, sun spots fade, helps my rosacea (mild rosacea) i see a big difference after 2 uses. wonderful stuff, t&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> Dr. Gross&#x27;s Extra Strength Beta Face  Peel impressed me the first time I tried it.  Used for two weeks, it refreshes the skin&#x27;s look.</li>
    <li> If you are debating on whether or not to purchase this product... don&#x27;t... It is SO worth it! The price on Amazon is also much less than in the stores. I am almost 30, but still dealing with acne prone, oily, AND dry/combo skin (apparently my older sisters&#x27; reassurance that it would go away in my mid-twenties was just wishful thinking). Not fun, let me assure you. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products and always felt the need to be exfoliating due to the fact that I live at a very high mountain elevation where the dry winters seem to last forever. The dry air, combined with the drying effect of many acne products resulted in oily AND flaky skin issues. I found these Alpha Beta peel wipes by chance when I was given a free sample of the original formula (I purchased and am reviewing the extra strength formula). After using this product only ONCE, I felt such a difference in the smoothness of my skin&#x27;s texture that I immediately ordered the extra strength version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally splurge on pricy products as I have a tight budget, but this is SO worth it! I use it every single day and with each passing day my skin looks better and better. It has been about a month now of daily use. My skin&#x27;s prior dullness went away, the blemishes started to dissipate in frequency and severity, and my overall skin tone started to glow. Me? Glowing skin?! I could hardly believe it! I was so blown away by the results that I recommended it to my mom (in her mid 60&#x27;s) who now also uses it daily. She recommended it to a friend in her 80&#x27;s who wanted to look great for an upcoming event and she also loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t rave about just any product, but I truly think this is the best thing to ever happen to my skin. Yes, I still get breakouts here and there, but the reduction is noticeable and the refinement in the texture, tone, and pore size of my face is absolutely incredible! This is truly my favorite facial care product ever... and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them. A quick note: If you have extremely sensitive skin, I&#x27;d go with the original formula. If you&#x27;re looking for fast and more dramatic results, go for the extra strength. As long as you combine this with a quality moisturizer and pay attention to your skin&#x27;s reactions, I feel that the extra strength really isn&#x27;t that severe in intensity. It&#x27;s the perfect level for my combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I truly love this product. Excellent quality, outstanding results, and nearly half the normal price if purchased on Amazon. What&#x27;s not to love?! :)you have extremely sensitive skin, I&#x27;d go with the original formula.

    <li> I could not love this product more.  I am a 48 year old woman with fair skin.  In addition to wrinkles from aging I&#x27;ve never stopped getting pimples and blackheads.  This product gave me the skin I always wanted.  I have teeny tiny little pores and get 1-2 pimples a month now.  Many of my wrinkles are gone as well.  I have always looked young for my age, but now I&#x27;ve gone from folks thinking I was 40 to them guessing 30 something.  I could not love the product more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;systems&amp;#34; that were too involved to keep up with.  This is so simple it is to use.  I run my daughter to school and can wipe my face while at a traffic light.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This product delivers! I use it only once or twice a week because it IS very powerful. However, it&#x27;s not irritating at all and my skin looks noticeably better after using it. It&#x27;s a great deal on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I went to Sephora and they gave me a week sample and I really like the product. My cystic acne slowly disappear and my scars got smaller and lighter. My face glows when I used it. My pores did not get smaller at all. I wear glasses sometimes and I have a little dent on my noise which made me look older. The Alpha Beta Face peel got rid of the dent. I cut the towelette in half and save it for the next time I use it. The product is  pricey but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the peels for well over a year now, my face feels clean and renewed everytime I use them.  I had some light acne scars that have diminished (I would not say disappeared, but have gotten lighter).  When I&#x27;m without them for a few days (when I run out) I can feel a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This Face Peel is OK - better than most, I guess.  I want it to work to bring some energy to me tired old face, arghh.  I think that it did cause some cell turnover, which is good for speeding up recovery from acne scars and brightening your overall look.  But beware of reactions with other products!  I have been using the Alpha Beta Peel for about 3 months with no problem, but last night - it reacted with something on my skin and this morning I have angry red dots all over my face.  Not fun.  Should be cause for some good old office ridicule at work today.</li>
    <li> I had a three day trial pack of this product, which then led me to find and buy this 30 day version.  It is amazing and I saaw results almost immediately.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was how soft and smooth my cheeks were after using the wipes.  The first two weeks, I applied it every other day.  Now I&#x27;m down to twice a week.  I think once a day application would be too much for my skin.  I love how soft my skin is and my toddler loves touching my face.</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Alpha Beta Face Peel, and ordered this one by mistake.  I have been using it, and I find I get the wonderful results, but it is definitely stronger than what I need; I&#x27;m going back to the original.  My skin is luminescent after using this.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> -Late 20&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-Combination skin type&lt;br /&gt;-TX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Mom, model, bookkeeper and coach. Rather I am running around with my child, traveling around for photo shoots, in and out of the office or in the gym coaching my team my face is exposed to different environments and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product I felt the need to buy many moisturizers, exfoliaters and deep cleaners yet none of them seemed to do their job, and those products can add up fast. My face would still feel like it was not clean enough, too dry in some areas and I would still have some problems with minor breakouts. Overall my skin felt \\&quot;heavy/ weighed down\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a year now. I noticed a difference the first time i used it. I washed my face before using it as directed, used the product as directed... And my face felt so clean! I was surprised after washing my face well, to see the gunk that the face peel pad still took off. I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to use moisturizer after, not that i didn&#x27;t but my skin felt great, not dry or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I had very little to no minor acne, my skin looks smoother and I have been able to cut down on all the other products, saving me money. I only use a light sun screen moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go. I also use less makeup, though I&#x27;ve never been one to wear that much of it unless at a photo shoot. A little natural eye liner, a little light concealer on a few spots if needed at all and I&#x27;m good. Even my agents, friends and family have complimented me on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Use as directed!!&lt;br /&gt;If you use the second pad right after using the first, you many feel a burning or irritating sensation on your skin, more so close to the eye area. The two minute wait in between using both pads makes a difference. So again please use as directed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to purchase this product at Sephora at $80, I now order through Amazon (prime) for only $40or $50 something included shipping. Saving me a good amount of money!! I am not bashing Sephora, I still use them for some things.&lt;br /&gt;Just a hint to save some money. :)</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products before I tried this one.  I had the most wonderful facial at Nordstroms in Dallas, TX.  The lady who gave me the  facial used this product and I was blown away with the results. (Thanks Dee)</li>
    <li> I saw this on a home shopping channel and decided to shop around for it.  High reviews and better prices online.  Happy with the product and the seller.  Reminds me of Witch Hazel, but so much more.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love the peels. I has improve my pore reductions greatly. I would recommend the product to those that ask.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product as one that made some striking improvements.  I have now used it for about 2 months and added it to other fairly extensive skin care.  I saw a significant improvement in clarity and youthful appearance in a couple weeks that took me by surprise.  This was a surprise because I had already been using a retinol and exfoliation with great results.  My results were very positive.  I replaced my previous exfoliation with this.  The only negative thing I would say is that I can only use it for a few days at a time due to a burning sensation so I am alternating it with my previous retinol treatment used about every 3rd night that makes it more comfortable.  The first towelette also has a strong acidic scent which may bother some, but the second does not. I hope you have the same experience.</li>
    <li> I love this peel, I prefer the packets to the tubs, they don&#x27;t dry out. I use this every other day and have noticed a reduction in pore size, clarity and overall tone. Would recommend to a friend. If you have sensitive skin I would not use the extra strength version. Love!</li>
    <li> Gentle and very effective.  No irritation and clears up acne while helping with old acne marks.  Took off one star because I wish they used a safer preservative than phenoxyethanol in the second pad and also wish there wasn&#x27;t fragrance.  Has no odor so I don&#x27;t understand why it has fragrance and there are much safer preservatives on the market.  Take out the bad ingredients and It would be five star all the way.  But since I&#x27;ve found nothing as good and use everything else all natural I&#x27;m willing to make a tiny exception for a truly exceptional product.</li>
    <li> I like the regular pads better however for the price you can not go wrong. I just use the pads every other day instead of every day(due to the strength) and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Alpha Beta Face Peel pads for about a year.  I love the clean feel of my skin.  It also gives a firmness to the skin over time.</li>
