      <li>We found it more enjoyable to do nail art with a brush and use crystals and decals instead.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes ICE mercedes works better than konad polish.</li>
      <li>&amp; I wish I had more of them</li>
      <li>I love the images on it.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>the images on the plate need to be a bit more etched in.   </li>
      <li>Still, the other designs are great and I must also comment that customer service was awesome when the first package they delivered ended up lost.</li>
      <li>Its all well worth the money!!</li>
      <li>I love that I can have salon like nails for cheap and can change the design as many times I want.</li>
      <li>Most of the stamps work, most importantly the butterfly.</li>
      <li>Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates.</li>
      <li>It is nice to be able to get a professional manicure look with these cute designs without having to pay for one every time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a creative maniac,so I bought this to look cool for my nails.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The designs on this plate are detailed, yet general, and therefore great for beginners of nail stamping.</li>
      <li>I have only tried two types of plates, the salon express and the konad, and i honestly LOVE my konad stamps more, all the images are etched so that there is great detail and crisp images</li>
      <li>Designs are so pretty and come out very detailed on my nails.</li>
      <li>We tried the Bundle Monster first, and they are good, but we really like the size and designs on the Konad.    </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great brand but dries far too fast for this use.</li>
      <li>designs are pretty and the plate is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be cool to learn how to decorate nails.</li>
      <li>Also, it is important to use the Konad nail polish if you want a clean crisp image.</li>
      <li>It is such a cool way to do your nails and make them look great and professionally done for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>definitely recommend using Konad&#x27;s polish as opposed to using another brand as Konads is thicker and shows the design nicely.</li>
      <li>The quality of the plate is great, but it is not easy to use with the stamper.  </li>
      <li>it is taking some practice to get it right -- for me anyways.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to pick up Konad Stamping Polish to attempt with before trying the plates with regular nail polishes.</li>
      <li>I was really surprise because all the art work well,it showed the details right in my nails.</li>
      <li>I will caution that I did originally buy this plate because I really liked the swirl pattern as a full nail stamp, but the design itself is quite small and only fits on my pinky.  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves the butterfly on this image plate.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work with light regular nail polish because it won&#x27;t show on the nail.</li>
      <li>The whole nail stamp one doesn&#x27;t stamp all the way.</li>
      <li>really like the images.  </li>
      <li>think nail polishes or metallics to make your design really stand out.</li>
      <li>I recommend these to every girl who wants to add a bit of bling to her nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You have to be faster than quik, the polish dries too fast.</li>
      <li>It does take a bit to learn how to do it right, but there are several Youtube videos on how to do it; I really suggest watching those first.</li>
      <li>and I personally prefer the Konad special polish.</li>
      <li>Will probably buy a few more plates.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a reason why none of our nail salons are using these - they just aren&#x27;t guaranteed to produce a clear, quality image.</li>
      <li>My 8 year old feels so grown up when we paint her nails and put the Konad stamps on them.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to clean the plates thoroughly because the stamps won&#x27;t come out correctly if there&#x27;s older dried polish left in the grooves.</li>

<li> Just be careful that you don&#x27;t scrape too hard because it will leave scratch marks on the surface of the plate.</li>

    <li> designs are pretty and the plate is easy to clean. definitely recommend using Konad&#x27;s polish as opposed to using another brand as Konads is thicker and shows the design nicely. Definitely do NOT use China Glaze brand though, it&#x27;s a great brand but dries far too fast for this use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a creative maniac,so I bought this to look cool for my nails.I was really surprise because all the art work well,it showed the details right in my nails.It doesn&#x27;t work with light regular nail polish because it won&#x27;t show on the nail.I will totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be cool to learn how to decorate nails. You have to be faster than quik, the polish dries too fast. the images on the plate need to be a bit more etched in.   Looking for a different way to decorate nails.</li>
    <li> Cute stamps from konad. Just be careful that you don&#x27;t scrape too hard because it will leave scratch marks on the surface of the plate. I&#x27;ve been using these stamp patterns for a while and regardless of the scratch marks, they work perfectly. Don&#x27;t forget to clean the plates thoroughly because the stamps won&#x27;t come out correctly if there&#x27;s older dried polish left in the grooves.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday &amp; she loves it! &#x3D;) The images transfer onto the nails just as shown on the plate.</li>
    <li> Their plates and designs are really awesome. Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates. You will get some really great results when you use their special polish. I have tried regular polish with the plates and I personally prefer the Konad special polish. Its all well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to have mommy time with me and we do our nails.  My 8 year old feels so grown up when we paint her nails and put the Konad stamps on them.  She absolutely loves the butterfly on this image plate.  I like it too.</li>

    <li> I order 3 stamps from konad but unfortunatly it didin&#x27;t work becuse of the stamp, then I desided to order another brand stamp and it worked good. But konad is not not</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful beginner Konad Design plate. Konad laser cut quality can be mimicked quite well, but not duplicated. Therefor for designs with lots of details it is imperative to purchase Konad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs on this plate are detailed, yet general, and therefore great for beginners of nail stamping. Be sure to pick up Konad Stamping Polish to attempt with before trying the plates with regular nail polishes. Practice makes perfect.</li>

    <li> I love all the Konad products. I would recommend plate M25 to anyone who likes doing nail art and stamping.</li>
    <li> Seller good. product on time and in condition. Most of the stamps work, most importantly the butterfly. The whole nail stamp one doesn&#x27;t stamp all the way. Yes, konad polish. Sometimes ICE mercedes works better than konad polish.</li>
    <li> Very happy with all my konad stamp plates! Designs are so pretty and come out very detailed on my nails.</li>

    <li> Who ever came up with this idea is genius..I love that I can have salon like nails for cheap and can change the design as many times I want.</li>

But after a few practice runs you&#x27;ll have it down. Love these and can&#x27;t wait to collect more!</li>
    <li> These plates are really nice but are way overpriced! you can get the same plates for alot cheaper if you look at Bundle Monster and Cheeky Products.</li>
    <li> I have only tried two types of plates, the salon express and the konad, and i honestly LOVE my konad stamps more, all the images are etched so that there is great detail and crisp images,the plate is very flat as oppose to the salon express which makes for little to no residue when scraping, the full design looks a bit small for my nails though but i have not tried it just yet.</li>
