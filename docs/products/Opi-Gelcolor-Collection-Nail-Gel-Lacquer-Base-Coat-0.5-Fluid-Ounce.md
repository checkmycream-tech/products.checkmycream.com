      <li>It&#x27;s easy to take off as well.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>

      <li>I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>

      <li>*( I use with the SHANY UV Nail dryer, super affordable).</li>
      <li>I use this polish with the LED light from sephora, but this polish stays on longer and offers better protection to my paper-thin nails.</li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t really matter much because the color layers on top help with a smooth finish.</li>
      <li>Love the gel polishes that OPI offers.</li>
      <li>Very nice with little scraping if any.</li>
      <li>Dont forget this is NOT a base for normal laquer OPI just  for OPI GelColors!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t, your Gel nails will peel right off.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s an easy application process.</li>
      <li>This is my first OPI</li>
      <li>I really do love the entire gelcolor line.</li>
      <li>I am trying the OPI soak off gel top coat next.</li>
      <li>I love gelish, and have the entire product line, the 18G lamp, +/-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Buyers beware i got a used product from this seller polish was EXTREMELY tacky and unusable. you can just tell its not in new condition at all. Ive been using this product for a year i can tell this one that got sent to me is not in any way shape or form new!</li>
    <li> this is a great base coat for all gel nail polishes it protects your nails.  I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s my second order of base n top coat, I only use get on my fingernails.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, works with a UV nail light I purchased on Groupon.</li>
    <li> Peels off after 2-3 days, even with 4 coats on.</li>
    <li> Love love love OPI... And I love love love OPI GelColors! Always use a quality base for your gelcolors it helps them stay beautiful!    Dont forget this is NOT a base for normal laquer OPI just  for OPI GelColors!</li>
    <li> There was something wrong with this product....it was very dry and gooy. I also think since it is not right, that it is causing my polish to peel off long before it should. I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat OPI.</li>
    <li> It has a slight pinkish tint to it so you could use it if you didn&#x27;t want to color your nail or if you are doing French manicure.  Works great.  I do my nails at home.</li>
    <li> Way better than sensational nails kit and the light with that kit works with these. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller - I have been doing my own gel nails for about a year now - OPI is the brand that seems to last the longest in my opinion.  Will by again.</li>
    <li> This base coat is great and leads to a great finished product! Polish lasts 2-3 weeks and is easy to remove after the first week.</li>
    <li> If your doing GEL polish you need a base coat, I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too I&#x27;ve only used OPI. Not sure if this helps but I guess I picked this base coat because I purchased OPI Gel polish. I will use it with other GEL brands too, no need to buy another brand of base coat if you buy CND shellac colors unless they say otherwise. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try Essie Gel yet so with this I may buy the whole product line.</li>
    <li> Came properly sealed but was dried out upon opening. :(</li>
    <li> My nail polish usually lasts one day.  So far this new polish is 7 days old and still perfect!</li>
    <li> I love OPI very much and this product is great BUT when I received this the supplier only have me half a bottle filled which I have written to them and have not yet gotten a response.  I am very disappointed on the supplier and its not worth the money I paid to get a half bottle filled.</li>
    <li> The color wouldn&#x27;t stay on and was caky. Not sure if it&#x27;s old...</li>
    <li> This produce sadly did not last on my nails.  I swam alot this summer and it fell off in a week.</li>
    <li> I love the large bottle compared to the CVS brand.  It&#x27;s fresh and not sticky like some I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I chose the OPI because of the quality. I was so pleased to find this comes in a full size. I have tried other brands where the bottle I&#x27;d tiny and dries out way too fast. Another aspect I love about this product is that it lasts without peeling like the others I have tried in the past. I will only use OPI bell nail polish due to the quality and the longevity of the manicure.</li>
    <li> Definitely was old. And maybe got one use out of it before it was hardened</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Red Carpet Manicure, Gelish and Shellac base coats. So far, the OPI base coat has the best adherence and longevity. It&#x27;s easy to take off as well. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use the opi gel base coat and top coat. I get about 10 days wear out of my at home gel manicure; I am extremely hard on my nails. This is the only method I&#x27;ve found to keep my color chip-free for more than 24 hours</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own &amp;#34;shellaced&amp;#34; nails for over a year now. I do feel like you get more for your money when buying OPI vs CND. I think both brands equally worked well but I am used to the OPI handle so it is easier for me to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been giving myself gel manicures for over 2 years, and the weirdest thing happened with my OPI base coat. It hardened in the bottle! I know it was tightly closed and properly stored. But after about 5 months of having it and using it about one a month, it became hard and I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was usable, I found it no better than the gelish vase coat that I had been using. In fact, my manicures with the OPI base gel only lasted about 7 days, and with gelish I can get 2 weeks. I really think it has something to do with your mail chemistry. But all in all, I&#x27;ve had much better luck with other brands and won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> great product. Love Opi</li>
    <li> Always my favorite brand of gel polish. No other base coat compares to OPI.</li>
    <li> Product was as thick as cement and I couldn&#x27;t use it.  Having a terrible time trying to return or exchange.  Don&#x27;t buy from Sunshine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and I love this polish. It&#x27;s not messy, it&#x27;s an easy application process. I just recommend you invest in an awesome dryer for your nails to go with this great product.</li>
    <li> Has anyone tried keeping gel base and top coats refrigerated to last longer?  I know it works with polish.</li>
    <li> Does not work with any other light other than opi. did not know that. of course opi would do this...</li>
    <li> I only use opi polish especially base and top coat because they&#x27;re sooo great!</li>
    <li> Since I started using this base coat my gel polish stays on longer, I wish that I could get the perfect set of products that would give me two weeks of color. I am trying the OPI soak off gel top coat next.</li>
    <li> Love it! works amazing! Can never go wrong when using opi!</li>
    <li> OMG, so I started doing my nails myself and thought the base coat was optional.  Umm.... nope!  You need this.  If you don&#x27;t, your Gel nails will peel right off.  The Top Coat is just as essential.  And for good measure, use the little alcohol cleaner before you put on the base coat to make sure your nails are super clean and dry.  Now my polish looks sooo much better and actually stays on for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Works Great.  Easy to apply.  Was exactly what I wanted.  Worked great with Gel Color Shipped fast.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> karen taylor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base was runny It also tok a very long time to dry and it actually never dryed completely</li>
    <li> Perfect nail polish. I am addicted and highly recommend. Perfect price and fast shipping. No chip and beautiful glossy fresh look all the time</li>
    <li> Love the gel polishes that OPI offers. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these. I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>
    <li> OPI is always a great product</li>
    <li> When I got it and opened it it seemed old. It was super thick I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love the OPI gelcolor</li>
    <li> I love the OPI gel colors and being able to paint shellac on my finger nails at home.  This basecoat goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it.  I will never use any other product other than OPI.  When I would get a gel polish in the salon, I was allergic to whatever product they would use.  I have no problem with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice gel base coat!  Product is new.  Thanks!  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I feel like the most important part of Gels is the base coat! This is my first OPI and I absolutely love it! they look and go on so much better then some of these other colors! They also are not that thick so it looks more natural rather then thick and gloppy like some other gels I have used in the past. I would def. buy more colors in OPI</li>
    <li> Received my order within a couple of day.  I was happy to find this base coast. I was not able to find it locally.</li>
    <li> Love it only gel base that works for me. Tip put it under a heating&lt;br /&gt;Ad for a min or so before you use it makes it even thinner so easier to apply</li>
    <li> This comes with me to all my nail appointments - every two weeks.  OPI must be rated very highly because i&#x27;ve never had any problems with their products.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I was never able to use this because when I got it, it had hardened.  I&#x27;m just now writing a review because (2 1/2 years later) I&#x27;ve decided to try ordering another bottle and realized it&#x27;s always bothered me that I wasted so much money and I never said anything.</li>
    <li> The OPI base coat is a great foundation for any gel polish and it helps my manicures last approximately two weeks.  I highly recommend this base coat, as it can be used in conjunction with any gel nail polish.</li>
    <li> Great stuff doesn&#x27;t run. Easy to apply.  Not thick at all. Switching from gelish foundation to this one. So much faster not having to brush off tacky layer before applying gel color.</li>
    <li> This did not work. I ordered a LED lamp, base and top coat and returned the lamp.  The Gel Lacquer was non-refundable.  I followed the instructions to apply the GEL and curing, and two days later the polish and gel peeled right off.  What a waste of money considering I spent $27.00 for the base and top coat.</li>
    <li> GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper &amp; trustworthy-that’sImportant</li>
    <li> OPI is a thinner style of base coat to work with than Gelish.  If your nails are thin and break easily, this may not be the base coat for you.  I have been using this in conjunction with the OPI Gelcolor Nail polish and can get by, but only get a week before I will start to chip and need to refresh or redo the manicure.</li>
    <li> First time using the OPI GelColor Nail Lacquer Base Coat and I must say it works better than the other brand that I was using!!!</li>
    <li> BEST THAN SHELLAC BASE AND ITS THE DOBLE CUANTITI!!!</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered, the only downfall was that the bottle had already been opened and used. There was enough to give myself a manicure I just hope it lasts as what I paid for it to!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Enjoying it!!</li>
    <li> I am so excited to locate this it is the same product used by my nail professional and I have searched for it. I am very pleased</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think when I saw how thick this was but no problems at all-Highly recommend OPI over others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;No chipping-no pealing. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This seems to work much better than the gelish foundation - it doesn&#x27;t peel.  It&#x27;s also a bit more difficult and time consuming to remove.  I would say this is my holy grail base coat but after just a month and two or three uses, it has really started to clump and congeal inside the bottle.  Of course, I keep it closed and out of light, same treatment as the other gel polishes I own.  Never had this problem with any brand or with the OPI gelcolor shades.  Not sure how long this bottle will last at this rate.</li>
    <li> I read about this base coat on a forum and decided to try it out. It makes removal of gel polish a dream. I had been using Gelish brand gel polish base coat and that was a nightmare to remove. However, OPI gel base coat removes in about 10 minutes when I use the foil method. Very nice with little scraping if any. You will be really happy with the ease of removal.</li>
    <li> I noticed the base coat when opened had a slightly pink tinged brush, and gel itself smelled strange. Is this normal?[[ASIN:B006HKR50A OPI Gelcolor Collection Nail Gel Lacquer, Top Coat, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Not as expected, doesn&#x27;t cure well in led. Needs two cycles for proper. Unless my led light has an issue. Allthough it cures all my other polishes.</li>
    <li> I bought my own UV light so I could save money by doing my nails at home.  The OPI gel colors are so easy to do and the base coat makes the manicure last almost two weeks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Love OPI! Smooth application. Superb quality. This is the only brand I will use. Best price I can find!!</li>
    <li> The brand polish that my favorite salon uses doesn&#x27;t wear well on me.  I tried this brand and it is the ticket for my nails.  They keep it in a drawer, hidden away, waiting for me!  Sweet!</li>
    <li> I love gelish, and have the entire product line, the 18G lamp, +/- 20 colors, ph bond, and the top and base coats. No matter how thin I applied the gelish base coat, with or without the ph bond, after a couple of days the polish would start bubbling at the tips, and soon later peel start peeling. I never got more than 7 days out of a mani. What was left on my nails not peeling off by itself would be a major PITA to remove, and even after soaking with gelish remove on cotton balls under page turners for up to 45 minutes (after taking the shine off with a 180 grit file, and applying heat, I think I have most of the tricks covered), I would still end up scraping bits and pieces off and damaging my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter OPI gel color base coat. It applies more like a polish versus the scrubb in method for the gelish base coat. The brush is somewhat longer, not as short and stubby. It has a little of a glue like consistency, and I learned that if I take too long to apply it, it will pull, streak and wrinkle a bit without leveling out. But that doesn&#x27;t really matter much because the color layers on top help with a smooth finish. Also, it needs 30 seconds under the 18G lamp, other than the gelish base coat that cures in only 5 seconds (using my particular lamp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the OPI base coat, I got 12 days out of wear without a single chip, and I have my hands in the water a lot. Wow, that&#x27;s a new record, with more than 50% improvement over the 7 days I got with the old gelish base coat. And removal took less than half as long also, and is so much easier, without me having to scrape off leftovers nearly as hard! My nails now look healthy and happy after a soak off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I stick with the OPI gel color base coat from now on out. I am still using my gelish colors and the top coat, but might add a few OPI colors down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might depend on you chemistry of you nails which base coat works better for you. Many gals have excellent results with the gelish base coat, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. So glad I found the OPI product!</li>
    <li> I was using shellac, but I was not satisfied because my Nail Polish was not well fixed and  soon it peeled. I started using gelcolor and the result is much better. I get  my  nails painted for a week without peelings</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it on for a week and my nails still look brand new. I also have the Gellish top and base coat but they ate no bueno! They start to peel after a couple of days. But opi I love</li>
    <li> I know you need the base coat, and so I got the base coat for the OPI gel colors I purchased.</li>
    <li> Love it. OPI has set the bar for nail polish</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of base coat and this is the one that makes the gel stay on best.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Item arrived well pkg&#x27;d and on time.  OPI products are great.  I ordered them to take to my nail salon in NC, small town, as used by my salon in FL.</li>
    <li> Nice base coat. Good results with all of my gel colors.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, sent very promptly, good price, I would recommend to others ,I was  very impressed with service</li>
    <li> This is a base coat for gel polish about which I have no complaints.  It cures in 30 seconds with an LED light.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> I really do love the entire gelcolor line. I find that it really keeps my manicure intact for 2 + weeks. And this is coming from someone whose nail polish would chip the same day after I painted them with regular polish. I do the gel color system at home and it is super easy. So I encourage any beginners to try this out, especially if your manis don&#x27;t last with regular polish. Save your money at the salon and invest on this line to do at home!! ***( I use with the SHANY UV Nail dryer, super affordable).</li>
    <li> Great Purchase&lt;br /&gt;My wife is loving it. She boast to her friends all the time that she does her nails professionally &amp;#34;@ home&amp;#34;....lol I Will recommend to friends so that they too can purchase.</li>
    <li> Went on great hopefully will stay on great too had no problems at all love my OPI product keep up the great work...</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the sephora at-home gel polish kit, and OPI blows the sephora brand out of the water. I use this polish with the LED light from sephora, but this polish stays on longer and offers better protection to my paper-thin nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> this is not what it is suppose to be it will not stay own, and I have tried with professionals doing it.&lt;br /&gt;not a good item to buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t use it every week and let it sit for a while, it unscrews itself and dries out. This may be because the liquid is so gummy that the cap never really seals on the edge of the opening of the bottle. Maybe if I cleaned it really good after use, both the rim and the inside of the cap, it would seal, but cleaning this stuff is very messy &amp; goey, and the Gelish pigments I have don&#x27;t have this problem, so I&#x27;m buying Gelish foundation next time. I&#x27;ve lost two bottles of Opi from it opening itself and drying out.</li>
    <li> I really like OPI products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.  I read that other people needed to add time to the light to harden it, so I just went ahead and kept my nails under the LED light for 15 seconds longer.  I got a great manicure and will continue to use the product.  Oh, and it arrived promptly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great OPI product. All OPI no chip gel nail polish is the best thus far. No other brand leaves a look like you just left the nail shop.😉</li>
