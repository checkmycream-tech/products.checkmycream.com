      <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and it really works!!  </li>
      <li>I use it on my upper and lower lashes and they are stunning!</li>
      <li>It is worth it to me though.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t see the effects right away, but my MD son says his beautician wife recommends it.  </li>
      <li>This ophthalmologist-tested, hypoallergenic formula promises its users effortless, beautiful naturally longer and fuller lashes in as little as four weeks; with full results in 12 weeks.</li>
      <li>It does make my very short sparse lashes a bit longer and thicker, which I love.  </li>
      <li>I had tried everything, including prescription and expensive products but this one is just AWESOME.</li>
      <li>At first it did irritate my eyes</li>
      <li>Be patient, I bought the 2ml at first</li>
      <li>This stuff is for REAL and will make your lashes unstoppable!</li>
      <li>But on the whole it does what it promises!  </li>
      <li>In February, I finally can see long lashes that look great.  </li>
      <li>My lashes are MUCH longer!  </li>
      <li>It really worked on me!</li>
      <li>When you are satisfied with the results, continue using Babe Eyelash Serum two to three times a week to maintain long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are so long and thick, I&#x27;m so happy with this product!</li>
      <li>It works even better than expected.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes in the length but didn&#x27;t give up.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>my eye surgeon doesn&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients to cause harm, which made me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I think I was putting to much on</li>
      <li>/&gt;Excelente service, fast deliver</li>
      <li>It really works</li>
      <li>, it took me initially 2 months of daily application for them to get huge!  </li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Skin should be clean and dry before application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had tons of new growth by the 4th week.</li>
      <li>but Babe Lash has taken them to new levels.  </li>
      <li>Also, I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>but they have definitely grown and are much longer !</li>
      <li>The first I bought ar a salon, at a big markup.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an old batch or something?  </li>
      <li>I was nervous because I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I started using Babe Lash in early December.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturers state that their formula is exclusive, containing among other ingredients, hyaluronate acid—currently a very hot cosmetics ingredient; grape seed extract, ginseng root extract, yeast extract, chamomile extract, and bearberry.  </li>
      <li>so far so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;i bought the 2ml</li>
      <li>This is not mascara, but a serum intended to strengthen and lengthen naturally growing lashes.  </li>
      <li>I started using it after removing eyelash extentions that had destroyed my natural lashes.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own after she told me her secret.</li>
      <li>Apply Babe Eyelash Serum to the skin right above your upper lash line.</li>
      <li>The neighbor who told me about this product said that she saw growth after three weeks and then stopped using it, but now has to resume using it since eventually the new lashes growing in were short.  </li>
      <li>I have used babelash that I purchased from a medspa in the past with AMAZING results after just a few weeks.  </li>
      <li>It was hard to be patient, but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>I am approaching 60 years old with &amp;#34;stubby&amp;#34; eyelashes and almost no eyebrows left.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! My lashes have doubled in length and are now starting to fill in thicker. I use it on my upper and lower lashes and they are stunning! I get people asking if I have extensions. I love it and highly recommend it. I have been using it for approximately 4 weeks. *I did have a reaction with a slightly swollen eye lid and blood shot eyes in the mornings but it went away within a week or so and absolutely no problems now.*&lt;br /&gt;**Update** only use it every other day now as my lashes are definitely long enough. Just need to get them filled in a bit more. Pic is from about a month ago after using approx 6 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have used babelash that I purchased from a medspa in the past with AMAZING results after just a few weeks.  I bought this on Amazon and have been using about a month now and the results aren&#x27;t as great as last time and I don&#x27;t know why.  I&#x27;m not really seeing any results yet.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an old batch or something?  We&#x27;ll give it another month and I&#x27;m update post if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> It really worked on me! I love it&lt;br /&gt;Excelente service, fast deliver</li>
    <li> It took about 6 weeks to see a difference but my lashes are looking really good. I bought this after having ruined my lashes from 7 years (gasp) of using extensions. My lashes are nearly as long as my extensions were and I&#x27;m thrilled. Like others who have posted, I noticed red, itchy lids initially but that went away after about a week or two of daily use. I did bump my use up to twice daily around week 4 when I wasn&#x27;t seeing much change and ever since, have been happy with the growth. Would definitely recommend to others and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! This is my second tube.  The first I bought ar a salon, at a big markup.  I started using it after removing eyelash extentions that had destroyed my natural lashes.  After about three weeks applying it once to twice/day my lashes began to grow thicker and longer.  After six weeks, they are so long, people ask me if they are fake when I am wearing mascara.  I now apply it after getting out of the shower only once/day.  The tube lasts about three months, which is a great value.  It works even better than expected.  Highly, highly recommended.  Also, the seller was great -- fast shipping, and product came well protected and packaged perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works well. But be patient. It took my lashes about 5 weeks, then suddenly they were long. Can&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
    <li> It does make my very short sparse lashes a bit longer and thicker, which I love.  I stopped doing my eyelash extensions even, after 5 years !  But, I do have to stop using it occasionally as I get little bumps on my eyelid, with daily or twice daily use.  But they go away.. It is worth it to me though.</li>
    <li> Just what she wanted!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on fake-looking, expensive eyelash extensions.  This stuff is for REAL and will make your lashes unstoppable! Be patient, I bought the 2ml at first, it took me initially 2 months of daily application for them to get huge!  But since then, the 4ml has lasted me over nine months applying it 3-4 times a week at night.  That&#x27;s $7 a month for gorgeous lashes that people can&#x27;t stop looking at, I get compliments and oohs/aahs ALL the time!  People are always shocked that my lashes are my real lashes.  They are so long and thick, I&#x27;m so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months and I can tell a huge difference! People think I am wearing false eyelashes! Also, I have very sensitive eyes and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
    <li> I experience irritation while using Babe Eyelash Serum</li>
    <li> I started noticing a difference in my eyelashes at about 6 weeks and now at 8 weeks someone else noticed and asked me if I got extensions!  Made me so happy!  I used Latisse for 3 days and had to quit as it made my eyes feel like they had pressure in them.  Freaked me out.  So someone recommend this and I thought I would give it a try.  If you read the Latisse possible side effects, they are scary: eye pressure, permanent eye discoloration, etc.  Nothing like that with this product.  And it works!  can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough!  Safe and effective- its the way to go!  I had read other reviews that it takes about 6 weeks to work.  It was hard to be patient, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! everyone notices my lashes. ..my only complaint is i got the 4oz and i swear it is the same.tube by sister got me at Christmas that was.2oz....feel i paid double for same.product but ir works great!!</li>
    <li> BABE LASH EYELASH LASH CONDITIONER SERUM FOR LONGER LASHES - 4ml by BABE LASH. This ophthalmologist-tested, hypoallergenic formula promises its users effortless, beautiful naturally longer and fuller lashes in as little as four weeks; with full results in 12 weeks. The 4mL Serum, which is made in the U.S.A., should be a 6 month supply. The manufacturers state that their formula is exclusive, containing among other ingredients, hyaluronate acid—currently a very hot cosmetics ingredient; grape seed extract, ginseng root extract, yeast extract, chamomile extract, and bearberry.  And that it will enhance eyelashes from the inside out, so that there should be no need to apply layers of heavy cosmetics.  The product can be used by contact-lens wearers. Of course, users cannot expect the results given by LaTisse, the expensive, prescription-only eyelash serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturers’ instructions are: Use once daily, preferably at night. Skin should be clean and dry before application. Apply Babe Eyelash Serum to the skin right above your upper lash line. Use a single brush stroke for each eye. Avoid rubbing your eyes until the serum has dried. When you are satisfied with the results, continue using Babe Eyelash Serum two to three times a week to maintain long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a younger woman, I had a 25-year long nervous habit of pulling out my eyelashes; my lids were usually bare.  I’ve had some regrowth since then, but my eyelashes are still sparse.  So when this product was recommended to me by my beauty salon, and I saw that the cosmetologists working there had great looking lashes, I had to try it. Almost immediately I  felt what lashes I had were thicker and stronger.  I now have been using the product for four weeks or more, and see some regrowth, but, so far, the  regrowth lashes are  weak  and pale; results  do not compare to the regrowth produced by Latrisse, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> It meets my needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve had several friends try it and it&#x27;s amazing. I had one friend that stopped using it for a while because here lashes got too long. What is that possible? It is with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 months. It is fantastic . It really works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had tons of new growth by the 4th week. Will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> I used this onice before I went to bed and woke up the next day with bad blold shot eyes that actually hurt. Would not recommend. Still waiting for my refund afree returning.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy babe lash on Amazon, got it through a family member!  Love this and it really works!!  At first it did irritate my eyes but I think I was putting to much on and now I&#x27;m fine!! I have tried SO many products, extensions, other serums and by far this is the best!!!</li>
    <li> Babe Lash works!  It is nice to buy a beauty product that does what it claims to do.  It took about a month to work. And here I am with long eyelashes!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I had terrible short and thin lashes.  I have been using this about 3 months and actually started a couple of months before with another product which helped start the growth but Babe Lash has taken them to new levels.  If I open my eyes all the way, my eylashes touch my eyebrows and they have gotten so thick at the root.  Absolutely Incredible!  I was nervous because I have sensitive eyes but it doesn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
    <li> Give it at least a month and the product truly works! This is the second order I am placing after an aesthetician asked me the other day if I was wearing extensions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night for four weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the length of my eyelashes.  Perhaps it will take more time for my lashes to respond.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if things change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about six weeks of use, I finally did see lengthening of my lashes.  I still apply mascara every day and my lashes now hit my eyebrows!  Wow!  Will continue to use three to four times per week.  The neighbor who told me about this product said that she saw growth after three weeks and then stopped using it, but now has to resume using it since eventually the new lashes growing in were short.  So, we both did see dramatic growth of our lashes by using this product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome.  I am approaching 60 years old with &amp;#34;stubby&amp;#34; eyelashes and almost no eyebrows left.  I used babe lash for a month and I can see a big difference already...  my lashes are almost double the length and my eyebrows are visible again.... I love it!  I continue to use it to keep it up..</li>
    <li> so far so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;i bought the 2ml and I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 months now and i&#x27;ve noticed the difference, they&#x27;re not as full as I&#x27;d want them to be but they have definitely grown and are much longer ! I feel it takes about a good 2 months to work</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to the serum for some reason.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Lashes definitely grow with this product.</li>
    <li> I just turned 70 and as it goes my eyelashes and eyebrows were very thin...my lashes are thick and long...I feel great...bring on 80...I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months...my eye surgeon doesn&#x27;t see anything in the ingredients to cause harm, which made me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy the price fluctuates and increases considerably...will try another product...especially after I purchased and they send the incorrect item at a lower price and then try to hike the cost more than $10.</li>
    <li> I started using Babe Lash in early December.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes in the length but didn&#x27;t give up.  In January, I thought they looked longer but still was skeptical.  In February, I finally can see long lashes that look great.  I have never had length or thickness and now my lashes look amazing.  Happily, I did not have any issues like some of the reviewers did.  I love the product and will continue to use it.  Yay Babe Lash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m basing my review off of my sisters experience. She has been using this for 6 months and her lashes are SO long and thick. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own after she told me her secret. I will&lt;br /&gt;Update my review after I see results. I am josh scared of possibly being allergic to it but I am hoping for the best</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Lashes have improved and look better every day.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  It bothers my eyes occasionally.  But on the whole it does what it promises!  My lashes are MUCH longer!  You have to stay with it for several weeks before you see a change, but then it&#x27;s obvious!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT....my eye lashes have grown beyond my imagination....fantastic product. I had tried everything, including prescription and expensive products but this one is just AWESOME.</li>
    <li> This is not mascara, but a serum intended to strengthen and lengthen naturally growing lashes.  You won&#x27;t see the effects right away, but my MD son says his beautician wife recommends it.  We shall see.</li>
    <li> All my friends are teeming with jealousy and frankly that&#x27;s a five star product to me. My lashes got so long I had to cut my use of this serum.  It is a must for anyone even considering eyelash extensions and who wants to  make the most of what they&#x27;ve got. Highly recommend.</li>
