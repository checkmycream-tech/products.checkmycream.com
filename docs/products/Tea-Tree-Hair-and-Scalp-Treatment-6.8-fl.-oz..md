      <li>I ran across an article concerning tea tree oil and studies showed that is was successful in treating dandruff, improving the condition up to 40%.</li>
      <li>I had used this with the Paul Mitchell shampoo and Conditioner and it made my scalp and hair feel very clean and great!</li>
      <li>This stuff is nice and minty, tingles a lot, but doesn&#x27;t do a great job of moisturizing, so I use a leave-in conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>so good  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been tempted to eat it and see if it tastes as good.</li>
      <li>but, It feels really good.</li>
      <li>I massaged for a good three minutes after shampooing with my head bent forward to improve circulation.</li>
      <li>many of the reviews online said that they experienced a nice, tingly sensation after using this hair treatment on their scalps (because it&#x27;s peppermint and teatree oil).</li>

      <li>i love love love this stuff now!</li>
      <li>A good clean neutral smell.</li>
      <li>all in all, this could probably be good for you if you just have mild scalp irritation.</li>
      <li>As fas as I know, It&#x27;s good to stay cool in your hair scalp not to lose more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i love how it makes my scalp tingle.</li>
      <li>i love the smell.</li>
      <li>Love how it works.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>

      <li>This is great when I&#x27;ve had a very stressful day.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more once I run out.</li>
      <li>I love using this on my scalp and it has cleared up a ton of the dryness and buildup.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say, except it&#x27;s refreshing minty goodness.</li>
      <li>Love how tingly my scalp feels when using this product.  </li>
      <li>I had a baby a month ago and my hair went from being shiny and bouncy to dry and with lots of static!!!!</li>
      <li>though this may not be the best healing agent, I do enjoy the feeling as it does cut back on the itchiness, but albeit just part of the day for me.  </li>
      <li>I have bought many other Paul Mitchell products and this is another great one!</li>
      <li>but honestly it did not do much for scalp relief.</li>
      <li>I buy this and mix it with my conditioner at home, it make my hair soft, smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Received it a lot faster than what I originally thought too.</li>
      <li>definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Wow, I love this scalp treatment!</li>
      <li>Great product for dry scalp !  </li>
      <li>Instead, i felt even more intense itching after using.</li>
      <li>I believe that miracle thing makes cool.</li>
      <li>It makes my scalp cool and scent</li>
      <li>the tingly sensation on your scalp feels good and like it is actually working!</li>
      <li>Once I rinsed it out my hair and scalp felt insanely soft and the best part, no itch all day long!</li>
      <li>It does an ok job, although I personally don&#x27;t think its a huge changer for my hair/scalp.</li>
      <li>Worth a try for scalp issues.  .</li>
      <li>I have long tick hair, little over the shoulders in length, and every time I use this I have to use a large amount to be able to massage it real good on my scalp.</li>
      <li>The best explanation to the sensation you&#x27;ll feel is much like when you chew on peppermint/spearmint gum, or use certain toothpastes like Colgate, but for your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe this product helps with the itchiness, but I&#x27;m not sure how well the healing aspects are</li>
      <li>My scalp finally feels clean and looks healthy.</li>
      <li>I try to use it right after shampooing during my shower so that it can sit for the maximum time.</li>
      <li>I do not wash my hair or use the product daily, but overall I am happy with it and would recommend.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a nice tingle and with my dandruff and dry scalp</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this product, and I wish I would have known about it years ago.</li>
      <li>or more during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting this regimen my Scalp Psoriasis has cleared up.</li>
      <li>I have already purchased another one as I&#x27;ve almost finished the first.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just a simple dandruff problem - but it was more than that.</li>
      <li>It gives you that same tingly feeling like Nioxin and works great for dry and itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>but this is making a positive difference.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be sure it did anything because my scalp still felt dry.</li>
      <li>I have had this item for a few weeks now and love it!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Really helped my itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>It Works very well, relieves itching for me.</li>
      <li>Really helps keep the itching controlled for psoriasis</li>
      <li>Then my stylist introduced me to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Scalp conditioner and it really made a difference.</li>
      <li>My hair is back to bouncy and smooth again.</li>
      <li>This product really helps.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I really dislike the micro beads that are in the product.</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing like a hot shower with some tea tree scalp/hair treatment to feel like new again.</li>
      <li>I tried everything, including static guard and hair oils, with no success.  </li>
      <li>Husband has used this product in the past and really liked it.</li>
      <li>To anyone who has tried just about everything and are at the end of their rope,  I highly recommend trying this product.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I get that the brand is a high status because of the Paul Mitchell name,but will not buy this again.</li>
      <li>I did not expect much when i ordered this - but WOW.</li>
      <li>I TOTALLY recommend it - even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
      <li>I have to move it thoroughly into my hair and leave it on a few minutes which seems to work better the longer you leave it on your hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>It smelled funny and didn&#x27;t really work this same.</li>
      <li>works well, fixed my dry scalp issues with first application, definitely worth the money, i would recommend it to anyone</li>
      <li>I have super long hair that I sit on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great stuff! I recommend it in my book on surviving cancer treatment and use it all the time. I wouldn&#x27;t have hair without it!</li>
    <li> Scalp tingling!  I also like the smell of this hair product.  Some people might not like it but i like the menthol-like smell!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. I choose to use it about once a week when my scalp is itchy and I feel an eczema outbreak coming on. It removes all signs of outbreak in one use.</li>
    <li> This product works well on dandruff and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this product, leave it in for a few mins and you will feel some serious tingle. Once I rinsed it out my hair and scalp felt insanely soft and the best part, no itch all day long!</li>
    <li> I thought i was suffering from dandruff. I couldnt go a day with out my scalp itching! I tried washing every other day and stopped using my blow dryer but as winter set in and the years went on it got worse. I was about to loose my mind when I searched online for homeopathic remedies and discovered tea tree oil and this scalp treatment!!! I use it everyday to once a week depending on how much im itching. I generously rub it into my scalp and let it sit for 5 mins. I wish i discovered this years ago. Its an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years. I had a case of really dry scalp and the dandruff shampoos helped some but not enough. Then my stylist introduced me to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Scalp conditioner and it really made a difference. Especially in the winter months when the air is so dry and you always have a hat on.     I use it three or four days in a row to repair damage then once a week for maintenance purposed. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product  contained sulfates.  I should have purchased from a health store</li>
    <li> I had two problems flare up at the same time: my allergies caused intense itching and flaking, while my hair was shedding like crazy after having a baby.  I was a mess.  This product has kept all of these problems in check.  Since I started using it once a week the flaking has stopped, I have only had one flare up with itching, and the shedding slowed down a lot.  When I use the product I tend to shed quite a bit while I am massaging my scalp, but that cuts way down on the shedding that happens during the day.  Overall, I love this product, and I wish I would have known about it years ago.</li>
    <li> many of the reviews online said that they experienced a nice, tingly sensation after using this hair treatment on their scalps (because it&#x27;s peppermint and teatree oil). i felt that a little bit but honestly it did not do much for scalp relief. i have wicked dandruff and it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for that, much less provide relief as well as head and shoulders or some other dandruff oriented shampoo. also the other thing that was a little bit questionable was the disclaimer on the bottle that said: \\&quot;this product is only guaranteed if it is sold from a salon. otherwise it may be old, expired, or counterfeit.\\&quot; i don&#x27;t think there was anything wrong with the product i purchased, but that weirded me out a little bit. all in all, this could probably be good for you if you just have mild scalp irritation. if you have a lot of problems, i don&#x27;t know if this is going to cut it.</li>
    <li> I have scalp issues as well as extremely thinning hair. This treatment is used after shampooing with the coordinating tea tree shampoo from Paul Mitchell. In just two weeks I have noticed less scalp irritation and the small patch of crusting I noticed is completely gone. My scalp finally feels clean and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an asian male and I use the Tea Tree shampoo/conditioner one day and alternate with the Hair and Scalp treatment. This stuff is nice and minty, tingles a lot, but doesn&#x27;t do a great job of moisturizing, so I use a leave-in conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this scalp treatment for over 3 years now and is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have Scalp Psoriasis, I use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo and then treat with this once a week. or more during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting this regimen my Scalp Psoriasis has cleared up. my itching and peeling is all but gone. Words can&#x27;t describe the difference these Tea Tree products have made in my life. if you have Scalp Psoriasis, I encourage you to try this. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Soothing and smells great.</li>
    <li> I had been suffering from dandruff for four years. It just appeared out of no where and progressively got worse.  I tried every dandruff shampoo under the sun with no success. I had went to four different dermatologist  and used several different products prescribed by the doctors with no improvement at all!  I was frustrated and was at the point where I was seriously considering shaving my head because the dandruff became so bad.  I ran across an article concerning tea tree oil and studies showed that is was successful in treating dandruff, improving the condition up to 40%. I decided to try this product and I was amazed.  After one try, there was a noticeable improvement and I have had hardly any flaking since. To anyone who has tried just about everything and are at the end of their rope,  I highly recommend trying this product.  It has been the only product that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Husband has used this product in the past and really liked it. This particular item was old or something. It smelled funny and didn&#x27;t really work this same. Not sure what the problem was but ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep the itching controlled for psoriasis</li>
    <li> been using everyday since purchased, no improvement, had high hopes.</li>
    <li> Makes your scalp tingle! Love this stuff! I use it a couple times a week. Will be buying more again soon!</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this scalp treatment! I used to use Nioxin system 5 before they changed their formula and started manufacturing in Mexico, and I got tto tell you that this Tea tree treatment feels amazing! It gives you that same tingly feeling like Nioxin and works great for dry and itchy scalp. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have super long hair that I sit on.  But my scalp gets dry and I try not to over wash my hair... I used to wash it everyday.... ohhhh shudder....!  I only just dry dry dry it out... I was using Mane &amp; Tail.  We have a lot of iron in our water and I have yet to find a shampoo that does not make my hair greasy and my scalp a mess or it all dried out, but this amazing tea tree shampoo a couple days a week seems to help settle everything down.</li>
    <li> Love how tingly my scalp feels when using this product.  Has seemed to clear up some of my dry scalp issues.  Not completely yet but it has helped a lot!</li>
    <li> I love using this on my scalp and it has cleared up a ton of the dryness and buildup.  The smell is awesome and it leaves you feeling so great!</li>
    <li> I have had this item for a few weeks now and love it! I have the worst dry scalp ever especially during the winter months and this product has helped me out tremendously!! Received it a lot faster than what I originally thought too. I use the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo and conditioner with it as well. I will be ordering more once I run out. Definitely read directions before using it though…you just use a small amount to your scalp a lot smaller amount than if it were a shampoo.</li>
    <li> It Works very well, relieves itching for me. It has a nice scent and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Still have dry scalp after trying this for 3 weeks, used as directed. Will keep looking for something that works for me.    Update, I&#x27;m using T-Gel now and for me it works. I was so bad I had scabs from picking at my dead skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. That&#x27;s a nice tingle and with my dandruff and dry scalp it seems to be making an impact. It&#x27;s not like my conditions disappeared overnight but this is making a positive difference.</li>
    <li> works well, fixed my dry scalp issues with first application, definitely worth the money, i would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I have an awful case of dry, flaky, itchy scalp and while this feels nice and tingly it has done nothing for the itching and flaking ):</li>
    <li> I love this.  The smell is awesome and the feel on your scalp is a cooling, feeling.  I love it!  It also conditions quite well.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product.  He has a dry scalp that reacts to sulfa based conditioners and leave dry flakes and an itchy feeling.  This product is one that we found to treat that problem, and give him the moisture he needs.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> A good clean neutral smell. As soon as I started using this I noticed a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s shinier, stronger, and it tingles my scalp. This is great when I&#x27;ve had a very stressful day. There&#x27;s nothing like a hot shower with some tea tree scalp/hair treatment to feel like new again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Love how it works. Great product!</li>
    <li> My scalp felt like a 9 alarm fire had been put out on my sensitive scalp.  Allergies acquired late in life left me clueless as what to do. Regular hair care products only added to the problem, but this tea tree product gives immediate relief along with a conditioning that leaves hair manageable and shiny. (Leave in overnight for best results.)</li>
    <li> I have not used any other tea tree products. However, this product is AWESOME!!! I have a lot of gray hair and my stylist told me that repeated color treatment made my scalp really dry and flaky. I thought it was just a simple dandruff problem - but it was more than that. ANd she simply suggested any tea tree treatment.  I did not expect much when i ordered this - but WOW. THe tingly feeling everyone is talking about it from the mint - i&#x27;d liken this feeling to the feeling you get when you pop an altoid in your mouth - the effect an altoid has on your sinuses...except it&#x27;s on your head. Weird, i know. I&#x27;d not walk out in the cold w/o drying my hair completely (it&#x27;d be really cold). Hair and scalp feel very moisturized and no more flakes. After lessthan a week. I TOTALLY recommend it - even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
    <li> Works well I used it twice since I got it so far so good  am actually seeing the difference with my scalp.</li>
    <li> Really helped my itchy scalp. Made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Not a cure all but works great.  Worth a try for scalp issues.  .</li>
    <li> another on purchase, speaks for itself</li>
    <li> My scalp itches like crazy.  I was hoping this Treatment would help even a little.  This product did absolutely nothing for me.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Deep conditioner! Amazing ! You have got to use this once a week. You will feel like a new person</li>
    <li> Initially wasn&#x27;t convinced it was doing anything, but after a couple of uses, this leaves your hair feeling a lot cleaner, and looking a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner and scalp treatment. I try to use it right after shampooing during my shower so that it can sit for the maximum time. Unlike other conditioners, I really work this one into my scalp - I think it makes it not feel so itchy an dry an there is something about this tea tree version that keeps it from feeling greasy and heavy.</li>
    <li> I did not see or feel a ding dang bit of difference.I can&#x27;t be sure it did anything because my scalp still felt dry. Instead, i felt even more intense itching after using.While applying it to the hair and scalp,you do feel the tea tree effect.But after each use, hair very dry and still in need of tons of moisture.I do not like this product,but i am not gonna knock it entirely.  What might not work for me,may work for others. Just not at all what i expected.I get that the brand is a high status because of the Paul Mitchell name,but will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I buy this and mix it with my conditioner at home, it make my hair soft, smelling good and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> To start off, I have very dry skin which leads to a very dry, itchy scalp.  It&#x27;s been getting worse every year, especially in the winter months. This product has a nice peppermint smell and does leave your scalp soothed to a degree.  The feeling at first may take you aback initially, but you soon get used to it.  The best explanation to the sensation you&#x27;ll feel is much like when you chew on peppermint/spearmint gum, or use certain toothpastes like Colgate, but for your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe this product helps with the itchiness, but I&#x27;m not sure how well the healing aspects are which is why I&#x27;m taking off a star.  My hair stylist does say that my scalp looks less dry and damaged, but I&#x27;m also pairing this with an Aveda spray (both contain salicylic acid -- this is a key ingredient to healing and preventing dandruff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this may not be the best healing agent, I do enjoy the feeling as it does cut back on the itchiness, but albeit just part of the day for me.  I have already purchased another one as I&#x27;ve almost finished the first.</li>
    <li> It took over a week to get this stuff out of my hair. It made it gummy. I contacted the overstocked seller, Salon Oops, and they couldn&#x27;t have cared less. I threw it out. It was money lost. I&#x27;ll try new products in the future from a business that gives advice and accepts returns such as Cost Cutters.</li>
    <li> Works wonder for itchy scalp from dry, cold weather</li>
    <li> This stuff has worked wonders on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I used all the anti-dandruff, only this one gets rid of it. I would recommend to any one that suffer dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have tried literally EVERYTHING under the sun for dry/itchy scalp....the flakes were getting OUT of CONTROL so i picked up this product at a beauty store the other day and just tried it out this morning. FINALLY...something that works..and immediately! not ONE flake left on my head!! i love love love this stuff now! the tingly sensation on your scalp feels good and like it is actually working! highly recommend this over any other shampoo out there. definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I already use a dandruff shampoo with menthol &amp; zinc pyrithione.  This product also contains zinc pyrithione.  Both products together made my scalp too dry.</li>
    <li> My scalp gets very dry and very itchy. So I was trying to find something that would get rid of that, but this so far doesn&#x27;t work. I have long tick hair, little over the shoulders in length, and every time I use this I have to use a large amount to be able to massage it real good on my scalp. I get a bit of relief after I wash my hair but that lasts just a few hours, after that my itch is back. For the money and for what it does, I would not recommend it to someone else.</li>
    <li> After I had a bad diet, I started losing some hair. As fas as I know, It&#x27;s good to stay cool in your hair scalp not to lose more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know this one makes my hair grow. It doesn&#x27;t say that. but, It feels really good. It makes my scalp cool and scent so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel my scalp is going to be fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you try, you can see tiny blue one on cream. I believe that miracle thing makes cool.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say, except it&#x27;s refreshing minty goodness. I&#x27;ve been tempted to eat it and see if it tastes as good.</li>
    <li> I had a baby a month ago and my hair went from being shiny and bouncy to dry and with lots of static!!!! In fact my feet also became rough and dry along with decreased moisture elsewhere. I tried everything, including static guard and hair oils, with no success.  My doctor said that hormones, especially estrogen, fall low after pregnancy and cause general moisture loss and dryness. I saw this at the salon and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I massaged for a good three minutes after shampooing with my head bent forward to improve circulation. This treatment has micro beads that make the massaging experience even better.  It felt as if I was at the spa, what a rush!!! Lo and behold my static was gone!!! My hair is back to bouncy and smooth again. I wish this product would work as well on feet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59, color my hair, and have recently been having dry scalp issues.  The product makes my hair shiny and helps with the dry scalp.  I do not wash my hair or use the product daily, but overall I am happy with it and would recommend.  I did not mention, but I have short hair.</li>
    <li> This product really helps. super thick hair, itchy scalp, product build up....takes care of it fast!</li>
    <li> Comes out of the tube like thick toothpaste or an face scrub.  Does not lather, so seems like you have to use a lot unless you have soft water.  I have to move it thoroughly into my hair and leave it on a few minutes which seems to work better the longer you leave it on your hair and scalp.  Have used it now for two weeks with not much noticeable changes in my scalp acne though.  It has a tingly feel which does not have any medicinal purpose, but feels nice.</li>
    <li> it works great at stopping my scalp itch. i love the smell. i love how it makes my scalp tingle.</li>
    <li> Great product! Gets rid of flakes. I had dry scalp and have tried many products over the years and this is the only product that has actually worked. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i like the tea tree feels on my scalp. It does an ok job, although I personally don&#x27;t think its a huge changer for my hair/scalp. I really dislike the micro beads that are in the product. I don&#x27;t think they dissolve so I believe they are plastic. After my shower I can feel them littered around my scalp and I&#x27;m constantly pulling them out. Its just a little odd and its bad for the environment.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry scalp !  I have bought many other Paul Mitchell products and this is another great one!</li>
    <li> I had used this with the Paul Mitchell shampoo and Conditioner and it made my scalp and hair feel very clean and great!</li>
