      <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Feel good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily and love it!  It doesn&#x27;t mess up my skin, it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.  The fragrance of it is light and disappears quickly.  (trust me on this - I&#x27;m one of those people that picks up on smells before anyone else and I have a hatred of most perfumes).  It works well under the foundation I use and so far no sunburn!  If you need an spf for your face - try this!! I also love that it&#x27;s cruelty free :)</li>
    <li> Smells nice, however I wish it came sealed</li>
    <li> Wow! I finally found a sun screen that isn&#x27;t greasy - that clogs up my pores, making me feel too hot. It also has a pleasing smell, for a man or woman.  It quickly absorbs into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look. My dermatologist wants me wear sun screen, because of my fair skin. Sign me up for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This product only has a 40 minute water protection factor. It works well on the ski slopes, but I didn&#x27;t find it suitable for water sport activities. The same company makes an 80 minute Sport sunscreen which might be more suitable for such activities.  The product does feel good. Unfortunately, I was out for more than 40 minutes (about 2 hours plus) kayaking in the ocean, and my arms turned bright red from the sun within a few hours. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be well suited towards water based activities. It did work well on the ski slopes however.</li>
    <li> Spf 30 was ok but this one is too oily.  Breaks me out. Going back to spf 30</li>
    <li> No. Don&#x27;t purchase. This product contains lavender oil which is very harmful for the skin. I break out every single time I use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cream. I got it as a gift for Christmas and now I wear it all the time. I love the fact that it is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I use it every single day working outside for long hours. No more sunburns, and washes off in the shower without any issues. No harmful nano-particles or chemicals!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It goes on the face like a moisturizer. No heavy white goop. I spend a lot of time at the beach in the summer &amp; wear this everyday. Still get a bit of color, but never a burn.</li>
    <li> A little greasy to wear under makeup, but good sun block m</li>
    <li> I am a person who really needs a pretty strong sunscreen and have had skin cancers removed.  My biggest problem with the big brands was an almost debilitating eye stinging.  We haven&#x27;t had our most intense sun yet this year but so far it&#x27;s worked great and no eye stinging at all.  Also love the feel of it on my skin - very moisturizing.  I&#x27;m making the transition to cruelty-free products and this was a promising start.</li>
    <li> its summer time dermatologist recommended that i use this</li>
    <li> Non-irritating, Protective, and vegan!</li>
    <li> Nice sunblock without the heavy oily feeling. I have sensitive skin, and this sunblock works well for me.</li>
    <li> After wearing it for two hours at the beach on a 75 degree afternoon, it did keep me from getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t checked it out on the sunscreen scale of poisonousness, but I first purchased this product at my local herbal remedy store and they are purists, so I trust them.  It&#x27;s the only natural sunscreen I have found that really blends into the skin without making me look pale.  I love the texture.  I now use it every day as moisturizer.  I feel bad that I&#x27;m buying it on the internet instead of at my local shop.  I paid $16 for one tube there.  I only paid $10 for 3 tubes here.  That&#x27;s a crazy difference!</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen to prevent additional darkening of a patch of melasma on my forehead. Regular sunscreen flares up my allergies, and most natural sunscreens go on thick.  This sunscreen is perfect - it offers the thinner consistency of chemical-based sunscreens, but in a natural formula.  Not thick, absorbs quickly, wears nicely under makeup.  It does have a lavender scent to it, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. It works, too. I wore at the beach with no sunburn. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> amazing!  great coverage, great protection</li>
    <li> It stings my eyes will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it was received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, this contains harmful and irritant lavendar oil as well as a combination of active suncscreen ingredients that are not approved to be used together per the FDA regs.  I really wish I did my research before wasting my money on this product.  The SPF 30 is great.</li>
    <li> bought cetaphil which lots of people saying not stimulate eyes and is good moisturising sunscreen, however I found it really burns my eyes and is greasy. I am glad I moved on and chose this product. it smells nice, truly moisturizes your skin and it is really gentle and DOES NO CAUSE YOU TEARING! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I would give it a  5 but its a little greasy. I am a very big fan of the company and will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen every day, all year long for about 8 years.  I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face.  It feels great, it&#x27;s light weight and non greasy and feels similar to Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Dramatically different moisturizing lotion&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t that odd sunscreen vapor other brands have that burns my eyes.  Personally I think it has evened out my skin tone (I&#x27;m prone to acne and red spots, sensitive skin that is combination oily and dry).  And it&#x27;s SPF 50, so beat that.</li>
    <li> Too oily (stays shiny for 2 hours +) so use it on hands.</li>
    <li> This product is oily and thin. It also gave me a rash. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this out since I&#x27;ve read many good reviews about it. However, it felt very sticky when it was applied to the skin and stayed sticky for a whole day.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because of two reasons first I really did not like the smell. and the second it makes your skin look very oily. I have used some other sunscreen products but that brand did not have 50 factor so I gave this a try. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good sunscreen , but I don&#x27;t feel that this can protect me enough. It&#x27;s none comendogenic.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Goes on easily without ANY white residue. Lightweight and non-greasy. I wear it under my make up and you&#x27;d never know it. Never runs into my eyes...or if it doe,s I don&#x27;t know it because my eyes never sting like with some other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is fantastic. It absorbs instantly, does not irritate your eyes when you sweat (I layer it on when I run outside) and has a pleasant smell. Works great under make up. Has a great EWG safety rating. A winner!</li>
    <li> This has no parabens (keeps you safer because of breast cancer risk) and also doesn&#x27;t cause pimples. It&#x27;s a great daily sunscreen but is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this sunscreen for my morning routine. However, when I first squeezed the product onto my hand before applying, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that it was so greasy!!! I applied it onto my face after my moisturizer and looked like a greasy mess. I usually don&#x27;t wear makeup over or under this so this look stayed with me all day. Just be warned that this isn&#x27;t the most matte sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great product very smooth for your face didn&#x27;t break me out also the smell is great didn&#x27;t left me with a white residue</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth.  Does not seem to cause acne.  Does feel slightly greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to follow my [animal-loving] heart in my sunscreen purchases, but this is yet another cruelty-free sunscreen product that disappoints.  It goes on and stays incredibly sticky and oily.  I had to throw it away after several uses.  My skin is normally somewhat oily, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with all sunscreens -- in fact, this is probably one of the worst offenders of any I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search continues!</li>
    <li> A bit on the expensive side, tiny tube.</li>
    <li> Lightweight moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. Suitable year round for NYC weather (just vary the amount used based on the temperature that day). Can even apply over certain topical medications after they have been absorbed. Little to no shine once applied.</li>
    <li> Way too sticky and greasy at the same time.  I can barely spread it on before it gets sticky. Leaves a super shine.  I can&#x27;t even attempt to put makeup on over it.  I have super oily skin to begin with.  Great ingredients, though.  I suppose it&#x27;s good for dryer skin? I plan to use on shoulders, neck until I use it up.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Received this item yesterday. The bottle wasn&#x27;t full and there wasn&#x27;t a safety seal on it. Probably won&#x27;t use it due to these reasons</li>
    <li> light, not greasy, recommended by the Environmental Working Group.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn easily so I need a facial cream with SPF for my daily routine. This one works great and I even use it on my kids faces when they are going to be spending a lot of time outdoors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen based on the stellar reviews, but I am unable to give it a positive rating. For the past month, I have used this sunscreen as my daily moisturizer and my face is staging a full-on protest. Zits galore (and I rarely breakout). It took me some time to connect the dots (pun intended), but I came to the conclusion that this sunscreen is responsible for my wretched complexion. I double-checked the tube and I was unable to find the term &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34; amongst the descriptive words. Guess I&#x27;ll be using the rest of the tube on my feet.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen! I put it on under my daily moisturizer every day. It is not greasy and provides great protection.</li>
    <li> Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 2.5%. Kiss My Face has the best soap but forget about the sunscreens, that is a whole world by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the 2013 reports and you will find out that this did not offer protection in compare to the Target brand regardless of all their claims and all their good ingredients... I use many brands and I will not use Target&#x27;s formula but there are many other brands out there with good ingredients and great protection. Target, Hawaiian Tropic, Copper tone, etc. may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well. Bottom line, what ingredients are you looking for and how well it protects you for what you pay per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face.

Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.

    <li> I have been trying to switch to products with less chemicals in them.  I chose this one because of the reviews it received.  It goes on well and really almost vanishes into my skin.  No white residue and doesn&#x27;t smell too heavy of sunscreen.  You get a hint of that when putting it on, then it is gone.  Love it so far!</li>
    <li> The good: This blends into the skin nicely with no white residue.  The bad:  It feels a little sticky going on and if you rub your eyes even hours later it stings.  I like it enough that I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen .... It works...  It is a bit greasy but I use face powder and its fine....</li>
    <li> Greasy, greasy. Does not absorb well at all and even after putting primer over it, makeup just slid off. Won&#x27;t buy again. Best sunscreen in the world for your face you ask? Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence. Awesome. Saved this for my body where I don&#x27;t care as much about the grease factor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very dry, not very smooth on the skin but at least it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes when you sweat under the sun</li>
    <li> the only SPF 50 that goes on clear and does not make my face break out; has less harmful ingredients</li>
    <li> I live in FL and apply this sunscreen every day. It has good consistency, not thick. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I liked it  nice protection  not heavy feeling smells good  doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes either  I&#x27;m happy with this lotion</li>
    <li> Caused me to break out with really bad eczema on my face and neck, but did protect against sunburn even while sweating. A month later, I&#x27;m still trying to get the eczema break out under control. I&#x27;m tossing this product out.</li>
    <li> great facial sunblock, leaves no residue even under foundation! I&#x27;ve subscribed to it....cant go wrong, affordable and top rated for protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead so I burn very easily, I love this stuff! It&#x27;s natural so I feel good putting it on and if you reapply it when you&#x27;re supposed to it works amazingly</li>
    <li> I bought it for me and my 9 month baby boy, we went to cancun, and work nicely.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are serious cyclists and need an excellent sunscreen for our faces.  This fills the bill perfectly.  Even though the tube is small, it lasts a long time.  It goes on smooth, no white cast, no weird smell, and it works.  I am still pale in August after riding 30-60 miles nearly every day in full sunshine!  I will buy this stuff forever because it is simply the best product we&#x27;ve found out there.  Safe too!</li>
    <li> I loved this for the moisurizing properties........ However, I dont believe it is 50 spf.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight sunscreen that is perfect to use under makeup.</li>
    <li> Awesome as always!  I&#x27;ve yet to try a permutation of Kiss My Face Sunscreen (or block) that I haven&#x27;t been happy about.</li>
    <li> Family didn&#x27;t burn when using it. Used it on several vacations in the islands and Mexico, never burned when we used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen to add to my daily routine and it works well. It offers great coverage and I have yet to get a sunburn whenever I use it. My own dislike is that it feels a little greasy when I am putting it on. It takes a few minutes for that greasy feeling to go away, but once it does my face feels and looks fine. It hasn&#x27;t caused any build-ups or breakouts so I am happy!</li>
    <li> I was using the spf 30 by this company with no problems,  so bought  this one , and then I noticed I was breaking out, and I noticed this has lavender oil in it. There are a lot of issues with lavender and questions of safety, and rather not be putting it or any fragrance on my face. Will no Be using. Also when I stopped using, the acne/rash went away. Just cause something is natural doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe. Also allergic reactions can develop over time, not just after you apply the product.  I&#x27;ve learned this the hard way, as I used to use a ton of natural products that had lavender, and other essential oils  in it with no problems,  a couple of years later I&#x27;m suffering from every thing, and having to see a doctor.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. It is exactly as shown on Amazon. I have used it once now, it seems like it has the smooth feeling. But I believe I will not be disappointed after reading many info about the product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> We love this Face Sunscreen, my doctor told me to use all natural products on my skin and I found this and love it !&lt;br /&gt;We use all &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; products!&lt;br /&gt;It rubs in without that white look on your skin and protects us all day long ! Can wear under make up too !</li>
    <li> New to this product. It is not greasy. I am using it daily with or without makeup. Happy thus far.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome, look no further for a good feeling and smelling combination plus it&#x27;s all natural without chemicals!!</li>
    <li> I use this year round, sunshine and snow etc. It really works, spreads easily, doesn&#x27;t smell and I will never be without a tube in my bag, car, suitcase, backpack.....always.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a natural sunscreen and this works well for me. It comes off as a little oily but at the same time, you don&#x27;t need as much to cover you whole face. My face doesn&#x27;t burn and just as it states, it is sweat resistant so I&#x27;m pretty happy. I&#x27;m gonna come back and purchase the Kiss My Face Sunscreen for the body next.</li>
    <li> This product contains titanium dioxide, but the list of ingredients did not state that. Titanium dioxide can cause a skin reaction in those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! Rubs in non-greasy, smells great! I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Wow, wished I found this sunblock earlier. It is very easy to apply on your skin without any white residue on your face making you look like a vampire lol, smells pretty nice too imo, and not heavy or irritating; unlike some other lotions out there that are very thick and white causing your skin to look really pale, this one works for me and hopefully you folks too.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;it has a peculiar smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;hubby says it stings his eyes when he sweats &amp; runs down his face.&lt;br /&gt;but it does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s never been a problem but this one broke me out and I sent it back after approved for a refund.  I got a message back saying it was non-refundable.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and I&#x27;m still waiting on the company to return my product to me.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality sunscreen that I use as my daytime moisturizer.  Feels like a sunscreen as it is applied but absorbs well to leave my skin feeling soft and smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing! I bought it after my dermatologist recommended it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It goes on smoothly without much rubbing and the smell is delicious. It has a little bit of a lavender scent that I absolutely adore. I high recommend this. My only complaint is that the size of the bottle isn&#x27;t very big.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin break out and itches your neck.</li>
    <li> This leaves my face feeling more greasy than I would like but it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out so I deal with it.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth. No pasty white clown make-up look. Smells nice. Would have given a 5 but I wish they made larger tubes for less money.</li>
    <li> This is an effective sunscreen but I have found it to be very heavy  &amp; thick feeling especially while working out. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell either.</li>
    <li> I was paying an arm and leg on high end sun face protection.  This one is reasonably priced and works just as good, if not better.  I like that it is light weight, goes well under makeup, and does not dry out my aging skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really love this sunscreen. I&#x27;m pale with freckles, and most sunscreen gives me a distinct Casper the Friendly Ghost look. This brand goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely: no oiliness, no cakey-lotiony look. I use this every single day, rain or shine!</li>
    <li> My fav sun protecting cream for the face. Does its job very good, but be very careful with eyes and clothing. It leaves stains, which difficult to wash out.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has great safety ratings by the EWG. I was apprehensive to move away from my Asian sunscreens, but did after I found out they had ingredients like toluene. After using it for 2 months, mostly in sunny Brazil during summer, I can say it protects my skin very well. My melasma has even decreased a bit since starting it. I love that it&#x27;s healthy, and that I am supporting a safe product. It spreads evenly, absorbs well, and does not leave a residue. It absorbs more slowly than my Asian sunscreens (now in the garbage), but it more than makes up for it in safety. The feel/safety ratio is excellent. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am combination dehydrate skin this one is perfect and great under makeup too sometimes I don&#x27;t want to put moisturizer and sunscreen this one really moisturizing and sfp 50 which I need over SPF 30 in ca!</li>
    <li> For some people this will not be a problem, but for me I am allergic to lavender.  It is not visible in the ingredient lists I found online, but when I got it and read through the ingredients, there it was at the end.  I returned it and bought the Kiss my Face SPF 30 with Hydresia for face + neck and love it.  If you are not allergic to lavender you will love the sunblock.</li>
    <li> This is part of my daily routine before going out. I like it because it feels so light and not greasy. My husband, who usually got really bad sunburn after full day sailing also tried to put this on and voila! No more sunburn!</li>
    <li> I have very oily and acne prone skin, but recently stopped wearing my Smashbox BB cream that had SPF built in, so I was looking for a nice natural sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it! I love it - not sticky, my face doesn&#x27;t look shiner than usual when I use it, and it doesn&#x27;t smell strongly at all. I put it on after my toner and before my pressed powder, and I don&#x27;t experience any migration of makeup at all throughout the day. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Like the consistency and the fact that this stuff rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or white appearance. however, it does NOT protect you from the sun, I&#x27;m sorry. I live in Hawaii and every single time I have tried to use this, my face got burnt and got visible sun damage which is NOT repairable! I am so upset because I wanted to like this especially since it&#x27;s more natural. But I just can&#x27;t risk any more sun damage!!!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is a must-have for protecting your skin from sun damage.  I ran out of my regular moisturizer, so I&#x27;ve been using it day and night actually until I got more moisturizer!  It has that great of a feel and smell!  I just got my moisturizer refilled, so I&#x27;m going to save it for days only now, but I haven&#x27;t needed any as long as I used this! :)  I also have acne-prone skin and haven&#x27;t had any flare ups!</li>
    <li> works great but the bottle is so SMALL!!!!</li>
    <li> I think it makes my face greasy. I&#x27;ll go back to the spf 30 version as that worked great for my skin. I didn&#x27;t realize there were so many additions (that I&#x27;m sure are great but maybe not for my skin) in this version.</li>
    <li> opened, no seal at all</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt to find a sunscreen that has more natural ingredients as well as a high SPF that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast or make my face look like I rubbed oil on it; and I guess I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking. I really wanted to like this product but was very disappointed after the first application. I should mention that my skin type is oily, sensitive, and acne-prone. This sunscreen takes a good 10-20 minutes to be absorbed, and maybe not even then. I rubbed the product between my hands and applied to my face and neck, taking my time to massage it in. I found that even after ten minutes of rubbing the product into my skin it still would not fully sink in. So I waited ten more minutes and it looked the same. This product sat on my face and left a VERY greasy/oily film as well as a white cast. Although the white cast left by this sunscreen is not as bad as white casts that I&#x27;ve gotten from other sunscreens(such as Neutrogena), the greasy film left by the sunscreen is by FAR the worst I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a sunscreen. After a certain amount of time(I would guess two minutes) the texture of the sunscreen becomes extremely tacky and makes it pretty difficult to continue to rub the product in. The one positive thing I can say is that this sunscreen did not break me out! As I said before I have oily skin and this product only exacerbated that. But if you have dry skin this might be a decent sunscreen for you if you can look past the white cast it gives. I would also like to add that this product does not work too well with makeup. I only use a CC cream but this made the CC cream almost slide off my face. I would not recommend using this product with makeup.</li>
    <li> I had tried the spf 30 and was happy with it so I tried this one. I this the consistency is a little thicker and more oily then the 30 but I find it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out so I&#x27;m still pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen, it does not contain titanium dioxide and feels great on my skin. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Lavender scented.  Maybe artificial fragrance free.  But the description is deceptive not stating this has lavender scent or oil.  Paula B gives poor rating because lavender oil is an irritant and should not be used on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love lavender scent, but I&#x27;m not going to put on my face. Returning.  Not happy description was not true and unhappy Kiss My Face changed this formula.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this sunscreen is that it doesn&#x27;t contain any unnecessary harsh chemicals/parabens/etc. I tend to like most of the Kiss My Face product line &amp; feel reassured by the fact that they&#x27;re dedicated to making natural/organic products. My second fave aspect about this is the scent; it&#x27;s SOOOOO lovely &amp; relaxing. I&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn while using this sunscreen, it applies clear w/out any white residue &amp; feels light. (I can&#x27;t stand heavy, gloopy sunscreens!)</li>
    <li> The smell is like a rancid lavender. Awful. Just awful. I considered sending it back on that basis but decided to at least try it on my face first. It&#x27;s a great base sunscreen for everyday use because it&#x27;s thin and blends easily, even if you use a lot like we&#x27;re supposed to. The smell wears quickly and it is a great base for BB cream (what I use daily). Great product. but fragrance could be improved.</li>
    <li> This sunblock kept me from getting burned while I was vacationing in Punta Cana, DR. The sunblock has a light fresh scent and had a great feel- lightly moisturizing not greasy or shiny at all. This was great for my acne prone burn sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Took this sunscreen with me to the Mediterranean for several weeks.  It worked great.  Put it on my face in the morning and did not re-apply unless I was swimming.  Did not burn once.</li>
    <li> It made me break out :( I NEVER break out. Until now I guess. My acne cleared up about a week after I ditched this in the trash.</li>
    <li> Havent sunburned, but it does sting the eyes bad, and somehow I always get it in my eyes later after applying.</li>
    <li> face did not burn, and it usually does, so it worked well</li>
    <li> Great for under make-up. Pleasant, very light scent. No &amp;#34;Casper&amp;#34; the ghost look ;) I just ordered two more tubes :)</li>
    <li> This product is what I would like as a excellent sunscreen.Quick absorbent and not shinny at all.Good price.I will recommend to every body, I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Best ever. Doesnt make my face break out and soaks in great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The only face sunscreen we use. The only face sunscreen which doesn&#x27;t break me out and doesn&#x27;t leave white patches.</li>
    <li> It works on my oily skin! I love this!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin that breaks out at the drop of a hat and this stuff is soothing and has kept my skin moisturized and healthy looking through this winter. I used to use Cerave moisturizer and my skin was always peeling around winter time, but this year it was even colder and using this stuff has helped a great deal. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and was looking for a sunscreen with no oxybenzone, and it took me a while to find one with zinc or titanium oxide that has no white pasty look -- but this one goes on clear and stays that way! It&#x27;s my lifesaver for the summer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how smooth this lotion goes on. It&#x27;s not greasy at all (which is a huge problem with SPF products) and offers great protection.</li>
    <li> Next time, I would stick to Aveeno. This does its job, but it has a weird scent to it.</li>
    <li> Estou gostano, recomendo</li>
    <li> Love hiking and this protects my face from Californian sun, plus it&#x27;s not too oily or heavy so I don;t mind using it</li>
    <li> I have sensative skin. I can use mousturizes with spf but I haven&#x27;t found a face sunscreen that&#x27;s great yet. This one made my  eyes a lttle red  about an hour after applying until I washed my face. It works as well as Nutragena spf for faces. Cheaper brands makes my eyes water for days. This is very good at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is one of my absolute staples in my daily routine.  Cloudy, cold, rainy - doesn&#x27;t matter, I put on sunscreen.  I love this sunscreen because it has a nice, high SPF, contains a moisturizing element, and is easy to apply.  A lot of sunscreens that tout being natural tend to be thick and harder to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This melds with the skin easily, and I don&#x27;t notice any white tint to my skin afterwards - however, I am very pale.  If you have darker skin, your experience may differ.  The consistency is nice and creamy without being too thick, so it&#x27;s easy to apply.  It helps moisturize my skin, but I do use a regular moisturizer in conjunction with this.  My skin is sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues.  With some sunscreens my skin will feel like it&#x27;s burning.  This does not happen with Face Factor.  I haven&#x27;t experience any breakouts with this either.  After I apply it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s wearing anything, no heaviness or tackiness.  I use a CC cream over this most days and it doesn&#x27;t impact how the CC cream applies. I also use mineral makeup, which applies equally as well over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender scent is pretty strong with this, which is why I knocked off a star.  I&#x27;d prefer it without the added scent.  I don&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes, but right at application it is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> Works well for high protection without the bad stuff in it.</li>
    <li> Great but a bit expensive</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s a bit oily to wear under make up</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen and it&#x27;s also a perfect base for under your make up.</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face Sunscreen SPF 50 is a great facial sunscreen.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, no smell, soaks in readily and keeps me from being burned by the sun.  The only drawback for me, is that it tends to dry out my already dry skin.  I feel my skin getting slightly tighter as the day goes on.  It states on the tube it&#x27;s a moisturizer as well, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize for me.  I would still recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly greasy/oily. I broke out for the first time in 2 decades after using this! Can&#x27;t apply to my face so I&#x27;m using it on my body. It works, but its expensive for such a large surface area. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a good facial sunscreen. This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past several years but the last three I&#x27;ve ordered are extremely sticky.  Seems like the formula has changed.  Not sure what the problem is but it&#x27;s not the same.  Skin feels very sticky for hours after application and not able to use powdered makeup because of the stickeyness.</li>
    <li> The product is not greasy i can wear it under my makeup and it doesnt feel heavy</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I bought it based on a recommendation from Paulaschoice.com. I have normal/combination skin so I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t contribute to breakouts, but provided enough moisturizer, and had a decent amount of antioxidants and cell repairing agents to help with some of my freckles I have developed over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They changed the formula since Paula last reviewed it and they added a strongish lavender scent that I was not prepared for. I&#x27;ve been trying to more toward fragrant free products, but l like the smell. On the positive side, they upped the amount of Vitamin C, which should help my brown spots. I think it would be have to find a better product with these quality ingredients at such a low price. I was using Neurtrogena Healthy Defense, which was great, but didn&#x27;t have the anti-oxidants I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I found out that they sell this brand at two of my local health food stores so I don&#x27;t have to use Amazon to find it.</li>
    <li> Love!  It really moisturizes</li>
</ol>
