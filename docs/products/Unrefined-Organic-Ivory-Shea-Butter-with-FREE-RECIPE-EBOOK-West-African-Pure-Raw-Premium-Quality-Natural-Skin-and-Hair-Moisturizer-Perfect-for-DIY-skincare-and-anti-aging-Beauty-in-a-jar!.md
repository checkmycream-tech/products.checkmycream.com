<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best African Shea Butter in comparison to other Shea Butter and Lotion products works best on my dry skin.  No scent, non greasy &amp; this product absorbs into my dry skin immediately.  Easy to apply as well.  I choose to rub a small amount in my hands and then apply it to my feet, legs arms, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice user of skin products. I did like the texture and smell of this though.</li>
    <li> Oh. My. God. This stuff is absolutely amazeballs. I&#x27;ve been dealing with dry, flaky, and cracking skin all my life. Nothing has worked–lotion, petrolium jelly, caster oil, earwax–except for this Shea Butter. I mean, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve lost a layer of skin, had to pick it up off the floor, and hide it from my girlfriend. I felt like there was no hope. I saw this product come on Amazon after searching for a new treatment and thought, &amp;#34;What the heck? I&#x27;ll give it a shot.&amp;#34; And, boy am I glad I did. The skin on the back of my feet is like a new born babies butt. I don&#x27;t have to cover my body up with clothes anymore to hide my dry flaky skin. I can bare it all. No more dry, nasty skin. Hello new me!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is an all-natural moisturizer that my wife is using during pregnancy. She needed something that was built with richness and not too fragrant for her sensitive skin. She puts the pure shea butter on both her belly and her hips to prevent any stretch marks. Along with that, she coats her legs and feet to help with dry skin. We really like the shea butter and look forward to more products like this in the future! Thank you! Tony &amp; Natalina Kinnis</li>
    <li> Great Buy! This is a must have product for all mothers or expectant mothers.</li>
    <li> Melts right in your hand and unlike other butters, it does not leave your skin feeling greasy. LOVE this product! Super fast shipping and a larger container than I expected. The next day my skin was still very soft. After applying the butter I run my hands through my hair and the product wonderfully separates my natural waves, diminishing my fly aways. :)</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing this product. I thought it would be similar to a body butter, but it is totally different. This is a very thick butter that coats your skin and really moisturizes it. I recommend putting the product on before bed and letting seep in over night. I am very happy with the results and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Wow!  This feels amazing!  Jar is bigger than expected too....this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Shea butter. It is so rich, thick and silky!  I can feel how silky it is on my skin hours after I put it on.  This tub is going to last me a long time... a little bit of the Shea butter goes a long way. Well worth the price and a great product I wholeheartedly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily but very sensitive skin but I often get extremely dry patches and struggle with finding a product that isn&#x27;t greasy but is moisturizing at the same time. What is even harder is finding a natural product that doesn&#x27;t include fragrances or chemicals that would irritate my sensitive skin. This raw shea butter is wonderful and covers all those points. I love using it all over my body- particularly on my elbows and lips! AND a little bit of this stuff goes a long way! This 16oz jar is such a good deal. I highly recommend this seller and this product!</li>
    <li> Really liked this product it&#x27;s very authentic and pure, which it is hard to get pure Shea Butter over the counter.  It absorbs well and makes my skin really soft.  I will keep my shelf stocked with this product.</li>
    <li> Incredible!!! Pleasantly surprised with the effect on my skin!!!</li>
    <li> My product was shipped promptly. Good product. Silky and smooth. Enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> It is the most amazing product that I have ever used!!! It makes your skin so smooth and soft with just one application. I highly recommend this product to everyone!  I see a huge difference in my skin especially with foot care.</li>
    <li> I love the shea butter. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and heals any little  scrapes I may have.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the texture and lasting effects! Definitely recommending to friends.</li>
    <li> Coming from a person who loathes putting moisturizer on their body, before going to sleep (or anytime for that matter)... this product is amazing. I don&#x27;t feel greasy and my skin feels quenched. A little really goes a long way, after you rub it between your palms to get the product warm. (I apologized to my legs, for denying them from that which I did not know existed.) The Shea Butter even lasted all day and I had only applied the one time, before going to sleep.  It&#x27;s gentle enough, that I put it on some healing scrapes and scars and they feel great (not tight and dry, as they did before). Doesn&#x27;t hurt that this product is all natural, either.  That last  .1%? I know I missed a spot (I always do).  All in all, great product and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Last night, I used the product. I used it on my hands. The butter is very smooth and moisturizing. When I woke up this morning, I definitely felt the difference on my hands.  My hands were smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t the best and the texture is hard like wax until you warm it up in your hands however It immediately melts into a soft cream once it&#x27;s rubbed out. It is really shiny and oily on the skin at first but once you rub it out a few times it starts to go away. I put it in one hand to test out the product just in case I get any side effects. I have lupus so I have to be extra cautious. The next morning I did feel my one hand was softer than the other, so before I went to work I lathered on some more onto the same hand and I have to say my one hand stayed more moisturized than the other. I would love to know if the product helps patients with discoid or sle lupus, dealing mainly with the skin</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I invested in this cream, I have very delicate skin which makes it hard for me to buy any kind of cream. It makes my skin soft and moisturized. I even use it on my lips! I am definitely adding this Shea butter to my every day routine! Buying this again and raving it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Smells good, applies smoothly, and not greasy. My skin feels soft and I love that it is a pure product!</li>
    <li> Being so dense and thick this jar is going a long way. I have used this Shea butter on  my calluses and cracked heels and it&#x27;s reversing the years of being on my feet all day.</li>
    <li> I love this natural product, the fragrance is non-overwhelming, and I suspect will be long lasting. It has a super thick consistency, which you can rub in your hands and becomes oily and easy to spread. It soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I recommend this Shea Butter!</li>
    <li> I purchased this the other day and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The jar was bigger than it looked online and it was filled to the brim. I used the product in the morning after a shower on my skin. It went on easily and gave my skin a silky smooth finish. The product takes a few minutes to sink in to your skin however the silky smoothness lasts all day. Even that night and the next morning, my skin was softer than with normal skin lotions I use. I definitely will buy this again when I use up the jar. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product! I am a fan of butter anything as long as it&#x27;s coming some a pure source. I am thrilled with the people I am receiving it from too.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Shea Butter and have found that its really just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I used it on my legs and body, it make my skin feel very nice and smooth.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hand and I feel they look younger and they maintain moist for a much longer time than other products I have previously used before.  I would highly recomended specially is you suffer from dryness.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always very careful of the products I adopt this shea butter was a great find! I put it on my elbows, heels and hands before bed and wake up to soft, smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I tested this product for a week on my left hand and used another product on my right hand and I could notice the difference within two days!! The product does not smell like other products because it is pure, however my skin is silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this not too long ago, I like it a lot. I put it in my hair and on my skin. I lift weights so I tend to have rough palm, this helps soften them.</li>
    <li> My shea butter was shipped to me quickly and I was excited to try it right away! After showering, I lathered some onto one arm only so that I can compare it to my other arm. It goes on a little bit thick at first but leaves a very smooth, soft, supple, and non-greasy feel after less than a minute. I checked my arms a couple of hours later and the arm that had the shea butter was definitely still smooth and soft whereas the other was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test it out for yourself!!! You definitely see and feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best thing is that this was way more affordable than other body lotions and creams I have tried and its effects last much longer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. My skin just needs a lot of moisture, and a lot of the stuff I&#x27;ve tried over the years either doesn&#x27;t do the job, only does it temporarily, or leaves an unpleasant greasy feel or icky smell. The Shea Butter looked unappealing upon opening the jar, so it&#x27;s very important you don&#x27;t forget to soften it in your hands before applying... and it&#x27;s BLISS! Love it!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It leaves my skin so soft and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Best Shea Butter by far!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I think silky is the best word to describe. So many other products that I&#x27;ve tried just sit on your skin, but this absorbs quickly and feels wonderful !</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me and I am so glad she did! It makes my skin feel so soft. I&#x27;ve been putting it on before bed and when I wake up my skin feels awesome.</li>
    <li> I was desperately looking for a some relief for the skin on my neck that has been suffering from a sun rash, (any time I&#x27;m out in the sun for too long I develop a very itchy and uncomfortable rash, even with sun block on)... upon my research and the suggestion of a friend I purchased the 100% pure raw African IVORY SHEA BUTTER on Amazon a few weeks ago. I started using it both as a moisturizer on my rash and as my sun block!!!!!!  low and behold after 2x/day applications for about 10 days the itchy rash is completely gone and no new irritated skin and my skin feels so soft and amazing. :)))))&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say thank you so much to the creator of this product for it has really helped me out of an uncomfortable skin condition.  I would highly recommend this product and the best part is, it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL.  It can&#x27;t get better than this.  thank you:))))))</li>
    <li> This raw Shea butter is the real deal-  I love that it is pure, containing no perfumes or other irritating substances. I use it before bed and after a showering and it slowly melts into the skin. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days but I already see a difference. My skin feels so soft! It takes a few minutes to absorb but the wait is definitely worth it.  Update: after a couple weeks my skin is noticeably softer and more moisturized, even after a shower. Still loving it. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my pregnant wife and she absolutely loves it! Would totally recommend this to friends!</li>
    <li> I am loving this! It is really rich and creamy, not greasy at all. It has a nice nutty smell, which lets you know there are no chemicals added. Keeps my skin moisturized all day long without reapplying.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I purchased this product but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with what I received! It smells great and as soon as you put it on you feel the difference.</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly, after warming it up on my hands i spread it throughout my legs and arms i mixed a couple drops of lavender and it smelled great, kept my skin moisturized without feeling greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for the best products for my skin, and will put forth the money to do so. The amazing thing about this product is that for a reasonable price you can get a premium product. And all natural too! A lot of products advertise that there is shea butter, and there is; however much of the healing powers of the natural shea butter is lost. Goes on thick, but is a great product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I tried this Shea Butter for several days before coming to a conclusion.  What a great product, and what a great value!&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin.  This natural Shea Butter makes my skin feel smooth and silky, and my skin remains &amp;#34;nourished&amp;#34; for hours.  A small amount goes a long way.  I want to use this on a consistent basis on problem several areas (aging neck, dry legs, etc etc.)  Based on the results I have already seen in just one week, I should look pretty darn good by this summer!  Thank you for discovering this exotic product and making it so affordable and easy to purchase.  It&#x27;s always fun to find &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products that really work.</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive my shea butter order in just two days as I was anxious to try it out.  The first night I used it on my face as I use a lot of &#x27;wrinkle&#x27; products that tend to cause dry skin.  I liked how that felt, so decided to put the jar on my nightstand so I would remember to rub it into my feet and hands at bedtime, as my hands get very dry during the day and my feet, especially the heel area, tends to be very dry and cracked despite monthly pedicures. Because I wanted to see if this product would make a difference, I really examined my feet and hands under a light before applying the butter.  After warming a bit of the butter in my hands and rubbing them together, I applied it on my feet and then my hands a couple of times a night for two nights in a row.  I have to say I am very pleased with how the scaly, dry skin around my cuticles and nails has disappeared and the same thing happened around my toes and heels. This is a quality product that lives up to its claims.  A very nice product, and very reasonably priced considering the size of the jar.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal! My shipment came a day earlier than estimated and the product is authentic. Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter!  I put it on all areas of my skin that are dry and it absorbs easily and leaves my skin so smooth! It leaves no greasy residue, no odor, and I can tell it&#x27;s a natural product - high quality for sure. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Just started using my Shea Butter and already in love. Just after one day of use, I can already tell a difference - my skin looks healthier and feels smoother. I just used a little on my lips too and it feels better than chapstick. I would for sure recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a really good shea butter, beautiful color and smell. Melted well and it&#x27;s a great natural product!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Really thick which was surprising but it gets the job done. I use it on my elbows and heels and they are super duper soft! I also just warm a little bit in my hands before applying to the rest of my body, can be a bit oily but dries fine. Read on the label that it can also be used as a hair mask - haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but excited to do so. Recommended!</li>
    <li> The best out there can feel and see a difference right away</li>
    <li> This shea butter is the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Goes on strong, lasts all day long.  Leaves me feeling silky, smooth and touchable...  I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer with this one!</li>
    <li> The item was shipped to my door very quickly. I bought the Shea Butter for my mother, but after testing it out for myself, I think I&#x27;ll be keeping it in MY room. The Shea butter is very thick until you put it in your hands and it melts. Great product. I would definitely recommend to anyone out there that uses other skin products. This is much cheaper and works just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. The consistency, scent and texture of this shea butter is better than both brands I&#x27;ve tried from Whole Foods Market. I use it on my face and body daily and will be a new staple in my home. The product was shipped quickly and the customer service was wonderful.</li>
    <li> This African Shea Butter is awesome ! I am using it on my very dry skin. It just soaks right in and my skin looks and feels amazing. I also like the fact that this is an organic product with little to no scent at all. I am hyper sensitive to scents personally, so I really appreciated that. It shows that this company takes into account what their target customers are seeking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this. I have really dry skin and have struggled to find a moisturizer that lasts all day. Look no further!! This shea butter made my skin super soft for over 24 hours,was not greasy, and absorbed fast. I had never really used shea butter before and am a life-long convert now!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have eczema prone skin and have used countless products in an attempt to sooth the dryness. Most products that have worked in the past cost me upwards of $40. Upon using this product I was pleasantly surprised to see immediate results. My skin feels completely hydrated without feeling that perspiration feeling many moisturizers leave behind. And for the price - what a great deal! I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the long term results.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft! I love the texture and look forward to purchasing more.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin extremely soft, not greasy in the slightest which is really nice. And you get a lot for the price, I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Especially during the winter months, my skin just soaks it right up. It is very thick, so I suggest a tiny amount to start off with. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a product this good, my dad use to get raw Shea at the African store back home but since I&#x27;ve moved I could find anything like it... So glad I stumbled on to this!  This product is just as good if not BETTER than the African Shea my dad use to get us!  And he made us put it on everything!  LOL</li>
    <li> Received the product in two days. I was pleasantly surprised by how large the jar is and it was filled to the brim. The product makes your skin very smooth and silky when applied and it lasts on your skin all day long. Even by the next morning, my skin was softer than&lt;br /&gt;with drug store body lotions. A little bit of this shea butter goes a long way so it is a good value for the money. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it for so my skin and hair. My skin feels so healthy and smooth after using the Shea butter. It is very exciting to know that my skin and hair are getting essential vitamins with this product.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin + Keratosis Pilaris (KP), so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great skin moisturizers. I read that Coconut oil helps, so I was using that but I don&#x27;t like the smell of coconuts, and it didn&#x27;t feel too great at times. I heard about this product from a friend, and decided to give it a shot. Raw shea butter doesn&#x27;t smell all that great, but it definitely works! Feels much more like a thick and rich lotion than coconut oil does, and it does a great job of hydrating my skin. It also feels like it&#x27;s helping with my KP too. All in all, I recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a good, affordable, and natural way to treat your skin right. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> My Shea butter shipped and arrived at my house earlier than I expected it to.  I have been hooked ever since.  It is in its raw form so you have to warm it up in your hands before using it on your body. I use it almost every morning after I shower. It rubs on a little thick and quickly will dissolve on the skin and keeps you moisturized all day. I&#x27;ve will absolutely continue to use this product!!</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the excellent service. Love it for my hair.</li>
    <li> I am personally very satisfied with this brand of Shae butter and how quickly I recieved the shipment! It is silky smooth while lasting all day!! Great recommendation ! Lindsay Bowen</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  And the price is amazing .  It works wonders on my dry hands!!! I&#x27;m an Esthetician and I work with my hands all day, so they get very dry!  I have been slathering it all over my hands at night, and I wake up in the  morning with super soft hands!!!:)</li>
    <li> I have used other Shea butter products and this is by far the best! It absorbs without being overly greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I use it for my face and body and am pleased I can use something which is free of artificial ingedients! I will be sharing my love of this product with others!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My skin feels so much softer AND younger!! Great value too!</li>
    <li> I get very dry skin and I loved how thick and creamy this is. It is especially great for rough spots like elbows. The label said to use it straight or mix it so I melted it with some coconut oil and I love the combo. It&#x27;s great that they added no fragrance, this is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Smells like pure Shea butter, which means that it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty additives :) Feels like solid coconut oil that melts in your hands and rubs on to your skin, leaving it feeling soft and smooth. Love it!  p.s. the delivery was fast and smooth :)</li>
    <li> Am I have purchased raw Shea butter previously in a brick form.  I love the convenience of the bottle and it&#x27;s not messy like the block of Shea butter. I love the quality of this one, it feels smoother than the other one.  I make diaper salves with Shea butter as one of my primary ingredients.  No more diaper rash for my grandson! I also make lip salves for me with Shea butter as the primary ingredient, add a bit of mineral colour and castor oil for shine and I&#x27;ve got a dynamite mousurizing lip gloss!&lt;br /&gt;A teeny bit goes a long way and this is a very large bottle.  For most people this will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  The container is huge and a little bit goes a long way. I mixed some with my peppermint essential oil and keep it in a container in my purse for my hands. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the shea butter hydrates my skin supple smooth!</li>
