      <li>MY SON&#x27;S FAVORITE</li>

      <li>What can I say, but I love all things penguin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they were because this seller was a better bargain for me</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great price</li>
      <li>+, roguishly handsome, and established..</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colognes and I know the smell.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this cologne.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be carried by too many stores</li>
      <li>And a nice musky yet clean smell reminding you the vintage cologne style has not been abandoned.</li>
      <li>It has a unique smell to it that I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love.</li>
      <li>In the summer, I plan to give him Original Penquin Rocks which is a bit lighter and more citrus-y.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a man and a wise one at that, than get this classic cologne.</li>
      <li>It is a good fragrance and a nice alternative to add to your collection (especially if you are like me, 35</li>
      <li>I sampled Penguin cologne at Macy&#x27;s and liked it very much.</li>
      <li>Very nice scent, probably more for an older/mature man, such as myself.  </li>
      <li>Penguin EDT isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d normally buy cologne wise but around the homestead but</li>
      <li>This is more for the man who is relaxed and finds more peace taking a walk,watching the sunset,fishing and getting lost in the sound of a calm flowing river,tending to his garden.</li>

      <li>Scent is great but it wears off after only a couple of hours...</li>
      <li>As some of my colleagues below have already mentioned, Penguin is readily available at under $20 (USD) per bottle.  </li>
      <li>This cologne smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>But I came across a tester of this Penguin EDT and for a modern cologne I really liked it.</li>
      <li>it smells like a cheap knockoff. .</li>

      <li>is not an original product</li>
      <li>but this cologne does have a clean structure to it.</li>
      <li>I do note, however, that given the presence of musky notes, I think Penguin is more suited for a more mature population (35+).</li>
      <li>Sweet yet mellow apple with creamy and light sweet vanilla.</li>
      <li>Ok not really, but it smells really good.  </li>
      <li>Just right excellent for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Very overpriced though as Amazon had the appropriate price for this cologne versus dept. store mark ups.</li>
      <li>But this particular cologne by Penguin is more of a relaxed character.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells slightly different than the sample I had previously, but still good. I recommend it. Beware though, one squirt is plenty.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my imagination, because I&#x27;ve worn this several times now, but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong, or last as long, as the Penguin I tried in Dillards (a couple times).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an imposter, or perhaps was in a hot storage, or maybe even the heat from summertime shipping, but it just seems a little weaker.. Still a nice scent, but since I have&lt;br /&gt;to use twice as much for the same effect, half off really doesn&#x27;t mean half-off any more. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy it here again or not, and hope for a fresher bottle!!? ....just not sure...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances I have found.  Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Really nice smell. Smells like alcohol really bad when you first apply, but that goes away pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve had compliments every time I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
    <li> Yesterday, I wore Original Penguin for the first time in many months.  Not a special occasion, merely casual, but I had forgotten how much I liked this fragrance.  Out of the bottle, I get the blend of fruit, musk, and vanilla notes.  This blend is very pleasant and easy on the nose.  The longevity is average, lasting about 6-8 hours on me with projection/sillage at arms length during this time period.  Not too shabby.  What was unexpected was the compliments received and inquiries from my girlfriend and her teenage son (who already has the nose for fine fragrances and developing his own collection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the well balance of notes, I would suggest that Penguin can be worn any time of year and provides flexibility to be worn day or night.  I do note, however, that given the presence of musky notes, I think Penguin is more suited for a more mature population (35+). As noted earlier, I wore this for a more casual outing, but believe Penguin can easily be worn to more formal events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being a very pleasant fragrance, I think you will like the bottle and price/value.  The bottle is uniquely designed with a magnetic cap - portraying the image of a more expensive fragrance.  Nicely done.. Truly the best thing about Penguin is the price/value.  As some of my colleagues below have already mentioned, Penguin is readily available at under $20 (USD) per bottle.  A great deal for this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Original Penguin for Men is 4.1 stars out of 5 stars.  I like it a lot, but is falls just short of &amp;#34;loving it&amp;#34;.  It is a good fragrance and a nice alternative to add to your collection (especially if you are like me, 35+, roguishly handsome, and established..lol..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather than wasting time...</li>
    <li> The Women drool all over me with this fragrance.  Ok not really, but it smells really good.  It&#x27;s an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I was happy with this scent for my husband! The price was great since it was a first time purchase and you really never know whether a scent will be something you will continue to buy. The packaging was perfect and it arrived when promised!</li>
    <li> Not soapy or over bearing smell.  Great price too.  Can&#x27;t beat 25 bucks for a good smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> I had this given to me as a gift....i ordered the same product and it was exactly what i wanted....shipped on time...i was very pleased with it all together</li>
    <li> This scent makes my husband even more irresistible than he already is and that is difficult to accomplish. I would recommend this scent to every woman who wants her man to smell delicious!!!</li>
    <li> Good price great price seller got product to me quickly</li>
    <li> I love it.  It has a wonderful fragrance.  Not too overbearing.  It came on time and I have gotten compliments on the smell.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to smell nice but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. MY SON&#x27;S FAVORITE</li>
    <li> This cologne smells fantastic. It&#x27;s a little fresh, a little musky, and very classic. I LOVE the way it smells, and look forward to wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have to be very careful about applying this stuff when it&#x27;s time to wear it... One spray is far more than enough - any more than that and you&#x27;re going to have to be careful about entering a confined space with other humans. I made the mistake of spraying myself twice the day this stuff came in, and I literally had to excuse myself to the restroom during a meeting to try to wipe some of the smell off of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a single spray and a walk through the mist... Even then it&#x27;s likely that the room you spray it in will smell like Penguin for an hour or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, but moderation is key.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product! I will be buying it again. It smells wonderful and does not take much to really get the smell going! This one 3.4 oz. bottle should last me the better part of a year, and I use cologne almost ever day.</li>
    <li> This smells great!! Was looking for a new cologne to wear at Macy&#x27;s and was introduced to this product. It was $65 there. I decided to check online and the price here is great. Again, smells really nice, lasts all day and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great scent that&#x27;s not overpowering (you won&#x27;t knock people out in the elevator), yet very sexy (your woman will purr like a kitten when she gets close to you). I&#x27;m hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Semele like alcohol, not like the fragrance I smelled in the store. Really seems like a knockoff. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have all the packaging or I would be trying to return. Beware</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and so did my husband</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my fiance for Christmas, and of course before wrapping it I needed to smell it! The scent lasted on me all day and even through the night. It has a great sweet scent too it which I love, it&#x27;s a great bottle size as well. The only thing I have to say bad is the lid is magnetized, which would be great if the magnet in the lid was strong enough to keep the bottle. It&#x27;s great design and idea, but if you bump the bottle just a little the lid falls off.</li>
    <li> Zippy di do spice, ladies like the change it brings.</li>
    <li> Love it! Inexpensive and a great light scent</li>
    <li> Scent is great but it wears off after only a couple of hours... good for a date but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my dad for Christmas after he discovered a sample of it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be carried by too many stores so I bought it on here because I could get twice the size bottle for the same price as the other store I was looking at. All in all my dad liked it so hooray!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I know the smell. There is something off about the smell and it is not the same smell as the original. I went ahead and bought a bottle from the Penguin store and compared the two and it is clearly not the same smell. Beware of knock off.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the smell last a very long time.</li>
    <li> great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> This was an anniversary gift for my boyfriend who is extremely picky about cologne. I was nervous - but he absolutely loves it. It is masculine without being domineering - more of a woodsy, soapy, inviting fragrance without being cloying. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thanks it smells great I found it as a great price. Because at the mall it is higher there.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great scent, smooth not overwhelm. Just right excellent for everyday use. Fast delievery will purchase again when finish with this bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cologne. Unfortunately when I received this my bottle I ordered, it was very warm because it had been in the delivery truck for several hours. When I opened up the cologne it did not smell like the smaller bottle I currently own. It smells very different from the one I bought from the Penguin Store in Chicago. I am guessing that the chemical structure of this cologne was upset because of the heat. I do not recommend buying this product because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the cologne I bought originally.</li>
    <li> What can I say, but I love all things penguin.</li>
    <li> Not only do I like the product I love the price. There is no way that I will buy this kind of cologne in a store again. You guys make it fast and cheap. I love it. I almost spent $50 in the store.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, probably more for an older/mature man, such as myself.  Not real strong and overbearing.  It does seem to last a decent amount of time.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> is not an original product</li>
    <li> Smells great! Gave it as a gift and was immediately rewarded with a hug they were so pleased! Plus it was a fair price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne simply because I like penguins. Ok, and because everyone was raving about it. It got here on time, was packaged very well and is the best smelling scent I&#x27;ve ever worn and will be the only thing I wear for a long time. Also the bottle is quite a catch with it&#x27;s stylish look and magnetic cap. If you&#x27;re a man and a wise one at that, than get this classic cologne.</li>
    <li> I sampled Penguin cologne at Macy&#x27;s and liked it very much. I saw it on amazon for half the price so I ordered it. Bottom line ... it smells like a cheap knockoff. . Im very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my partner and this scent mixes beautifully with his body chemistry to create a very alluring, sexy scent. When I get a whiff of him I can&#x27;t help but grin and purr a little bit.</li>
    <li> I had a test sample of Original Penguin Eau De Toilette Spray for Men while traveling in China in May 2013.  I loved the smell; and the fragrance worked well with my body chemistry.  I ordered it from Amazon.com as soon as I could.  I was amazed that they carried it, and at a GREAT price.  The spray mechanism on the bottle is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t over-spray with each pump so I can add as much or as little as I wish, depending on the occasion and my mood.</li>
    <li> Good price for a great cologne! It has a unique smell to it that I&#x27;m sure the ladies will love.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why , but this smells nothing like the Penguin cologne i&#x27;ve smelled other places and the scent goes away after about 10 minutes.....the cologne color is very light ....would not reccomend this :(</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  The stores in my area were out of stock.  I&#x27;m glad they were because this seller was a better bargain for me and I didn&#x27;t have to get in the Christmas traffic. &#x27;)  My husband was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This. Cologne smells sooooooooo goodddddddddd!!! Need I say more</li>
    <li> Geat value and it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I have not experienced the &amp;#34;evaporating&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;disappearing scent&amp;#34; issue others have experienced. This product smells the same as the sample in the Penguin store. While I like the scent and bottle shape, I don&#x27;t especially like the magnetic cap. I think it should be stronger. In addition, I think this should come with a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; bottle so one can fly with the scent without checking baggage.</li>
    <li> I got to smell this as a sample in an order,couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Bought it for my 3 Grandsons.  They will have to fight the women off.</li>
    <li> The item came pretty quickly and just as described.It was completely sealed in packaging and carefully packed. Would definately reccomend. Bought for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> When I first stumbled across Penguin cologne I was in a Kohl&#x27;s patiently waiting for my wife and kids to finish up shopping.To kill time I went by the fragrance section to browse though I&#x27;ll admit firsthand I like my colognes to be leathery,woodsy,soapy,tobacco,or patchouli bombs...old-school in character.But I came across a tester of this Penguin EDT and for a modern cologne I really liked it.Very overpriced though as Amazon had the appropriate price for this cologne versus dept. store mark ups.This cologne (to me at least) doesn&#x27;t lend a sense of sharpness to formal wear or empower one&#x27;s ego,easily put...it&#x27;s a comfortable casual wear cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does Penguin Eau De Toilette smell like?&lt;br /&gt;Well the overall character of this cologne is a smooth sweet and spicy,creamy,with a slightly musky accord to it.Sweet yet mellow apple with creamy and light sweet vanilla.I don&#x27;t get any of the pepper at least to my nose.But the animalic musk note&lt;br /&gt;does throw in a little &#x27;hairy chest&#x27; vibe though it&#x27;s not as rich as the old-school scents.There is no real soapy or floral character so lavender isn&#x27;t a big player but this cologne does have a clean structure to it.I get a positive 8 hours from it and pretty decent output for a low-priced cologne so no complaints.In my opinion Penguin EDT reminds me a lot of fall.Not in the sense of woods and rustic leaf color but more of fall atmosphere and/or small town festivals in this time of season.The smell of apples traveling from the breeze carrying the scent of sliced apples being prepared to bake.Homemade vanilla candies from that rural neighbor that sells them at the fall festival.And a nice musky yet clean smell reminding you the vintage cologne style has not been abandoned.Frankly you would wear this any season-it&#x27;s not too light nor is it deep and cloying in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said there&#x27;s more sophisticated,seductive,burly,and elegant colognes out there.But this particular cologne by Penguin is more of a relaxed character.This is more for the man who is relaxed and finds more peace taking a walk,watching the sunset,fishing and getting lost in the sound of a calm flowing river,tending to his garden.The more simple and rural lifestyle and the nostalgia that comes from a small town.Penguin EDT isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d normally buy cologne wise but around the homestead but probably this and Burberry London are probably the safest modern colognes for guys who still have old-school flavor.5-stars!a relaxed character.This is more for the man who is relaxed and finds more peace taking a walk,watching the sunset,fishing and getting lost in the sound of a calm flowing river,tending to his garden.The more simple and rural lifestyle and the nostalgia that comes from a small town.Penguin EDT isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d normally buy cologne wise but around the homestead but probably this and Burberry London are probably the safest modern colognes for guys who still have old-school flavor.5-stars!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband as a gift. We seen this in stores and he loved the smell so when I found it on Amazon and at a cheaper price I grabbed it up! It has a great smell that is not too overpowering and lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I finally got my husband to change colognes, and it&#x27;s heavenly!</li>
    <li> i like it ,but the green one is a smelling better fragrance</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband. Exactly what I wanted for him and he loves it. Perfect gift we both really like!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and we both adore it!  It is a warm fragrance with a bit of citrus so it&#x27;s not too heavy.  It goes on a little sharp and then settles into a nice, masculine powdery scent that has lasting power.  Love this fragrance!  It reminds me of Geoffrey Beene&#x27;s Grey Flannel, another classic.  In the summer, I plan to give him Original Penquin Rocks which is a bit lighter and more citrus-y.</li>
