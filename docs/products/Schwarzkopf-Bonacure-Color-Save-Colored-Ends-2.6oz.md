    <li> This product is super for dry hair, use it right after shampooing and leave it in.  Leaves hair manageable and you can even use it on dry hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product by my stylist.  I have a lot of thick long hair and I have my hair colored. This product softens and tame my hair so it is more manageable and soft to the touch. The scent is great too.</li>
    <li> If your hair is color-treated and you are trying to prevent breakage, then this product is for you! I actually panic if I run out of it! A little dab does the trick!</li>
    <li> This stuff is simple and works. Split ends temporarily mended and no color fade. Fragrance is pleasant in use and does not linger in hair. Price is right too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, but this product seems to perk up my color and make my frizzy hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser, she uses it in her practice. I love the smell, and the way it smooths away the frizzes. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have ombre hair and it keeps the color on my ends longer and makes my hair sooooo soft! Will def re-purchase!</li>
    <li> Over the last several years, I have ordered from various companies for this product.  Best Beauty Finds does not send the correct product.  The packaging will look almost identical to the real packaging but it is not.  Inside they have filled it with a cheaper, pink colored sham of a product.  They should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.  They sell fake products!</li>
    <li> Best product, leaves my hair bouncy and silky!</li>
    <li> This product is great for split ends. I really liked it since I don&#x27;t get haircuts very often. Highly recommend this to anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair softly and has a pleasant smell, plus heat and protect the hair dye care, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> product came on time; wish the photo was updated on the listing as the product has changed slightly since that packaging and doesn&#x27;t have the nice moringa smell but still works well.</li>
    <li> packaging looks the same but its fake stuff inside. i can tell because i have been using the product for years.</li>
    <li> The bottle shows the package for the one that was a promo pack with extra ounces.  That is not the one that came.  I went by the photo....which obviously if you do, you spend more and don&#x27;t get it.   As for the product, it&#x27;s awesome.  I use it in my hair and my kids hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Totally detangles and smooths the hair.</li>
    <li> The product has changed. The scent and results after used are different. Still a good product. I am glad it is available once more.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Good value</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair product</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times in the past. Not sure if the ingredients have changed, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work like it used to. A little disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> i use this product religiously.  it is a great product for split ends.  like how it smells too.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!</li>
    <li> Shiny,soft hair with enhanced color after applying  small amount of product on washed wet hair. I use this product for a couple of years and very happy buying it on amazon.com. In my case I use hair dryer subsequently to applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> awesome product really protects my ends from damage due to blowdrying</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the hair.  The purchase and shipment of the product was easy and quick.</li>
    <li> I used to buy it from my hair dresser.  I thought that it&#x27;s cheaper to buy directly but with the postage, it ends up the same.  The second time, I bought more than one and it saved some postage, so it&#x27;t still worth it to buy directly.</li>
    <li> No concerns with this product--I&#x27;ve used it for years and love the way it protects the ends of my hair.  I have fine hair and damage happens way to easy.  I feel this product does an excellent job of coating the ends without looking greasy or like you have any product in it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Schwarzkopf Bonacure Color Save Colored Ends with Moringa Olifera.  What I received was Schwarzkopf Bonacure Color Save Colored Ends without Moringa Olifera.  Don&#x27;t know if the product  has changed but the ingredients are completely different.  I did not return it because it does smell good and makes my hair silky but leaves it full of static.  I really liked the one with Morina Olifera in it because it seemed to take out the static electricity in my hair.</li>
    <li> Mine was fake too! Purchased from &amp;#34;BeautyAnd&amp;#34;. Their fake is not even close to the real thing: the real one I&#x27;ve used for years is thick and white with a nice light scent. The one I received had no factory seal, was pink, had a bad perfumy scent, and was not at all rich/creamy. It didn&#x27;t feel like it would do my hair any good - in fact, it felt like it might make my hair drier, like it had a lot of alcohol or something similar.</li>
    <li> It heps mend fried ends.</li>
