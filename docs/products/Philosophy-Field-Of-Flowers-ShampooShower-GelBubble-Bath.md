      <li>you want a great product, by all means get it, but if you want a scent that lingers, this product probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>

      <li>We had tried this shampoo at friends&#x27; house while staying with them and liked it.</li>
      <li>A very generous size, and the scent is  beautiful - just like the title: A Field of Flowers!</li>
      <li>It is highly recommended and would make a wonderful gift.</li>
      <li>It has a clean , pleasant smell and luxurious texture.</li>
      <li>I saw this offered on a television shopping show, and found it cheaper with free shipping at Amazon, so I felt I got a good deal.  </li>
      <li>but I would have liked to have more smell.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is acceptable; I don&#x27;t like a lot of perfume, but I do want my bath products to smell good and leave a light fragrance on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful (like honeysuckles) and the good thing about this shower gel is that the scent stays with you long after you have showered.</li>
      <li>would give it 5 stars, but the scent is very light.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Philosophy Field of Flowers after making sure there was no ingredients that I am allergic to (ie.</li>
      <li>I gave one of these to my sisters and they love it.</li>
      <li>And I love how well it foams up.</li>
      <li>I love this shower gel.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and fell in love with the smell.  </li>
      <li>I also LOVE their formulas-</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells</li>
      <li>Philosophy field of flowers is ok.</li>
      <li>and I am sure she will also.</li>
      <li>I love Philosophy products.  </li>
      <li>Love this fragrance and it makes such beautiful suds.  </li>
      <li>Great blathering action too.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather going.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not fond of floral scents I suggest that you do not purchase this product because it smells strongly of flowers.</li>
      <li>The fine print on the bubble bath line warns of \\&quot;skin irritation and urinary tract infection\\&quot;, and they deliver on that.</li>
      <li>The smell, is just like a clean spring day when you walk outside and can smell the beautiful smells of spring lilacs and hyacinths.  </li>
      <li>This one smells really nice, and is very floral.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use it as a bubble bath, either, in light of the itching/rash reaction.  </li>
      <li>My mistake, but if you like light smells</li>
      <li>Stick to Body Shop or Kiehl&#x27;s, which make skin products that are skin friendly.</li>
      <li>and it does clean your body.</li>
      <li>It smells so clean.</li>
      <li>I would only recommend it if you like the pleasant flowery smell.</li>
      <li>That has minimized the itching, and I make sure I rinse very well.</li>
      <li>The scent is beautiful and delicate- lightly floral.</li>
      <li>This has a nice scent and of course, much more reasonable than any other place it is available.</li>
      <li>Creamy, thick texture; light fragrance, good price with free shipping</li>
      <li>Philosophy makes me skin feel super clean while not irritating it or stripping it of moisture.</li>
      <li>I had smelled the honeysuckle in a store and thought I was getting the right one when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>It is like taking a shower full of fragrant flowers, feminine, soft, and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>was looking for a new bath gel and thought this might fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t actually use the product, but it was delivered VERY fast and the company even gave me three FREE SAMPLES!</li>
      <li>Philosophy makes many different scents in their shower gel/shampoo line.  </li>
      <li>It smells exactly like philosophy - joyful heart - charity shower gel benefiting the joyful heart foundation.</li>
      <li>, this is the first review I have ever written.</li>
      <li>This product is no big deal, more just a gimmick.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve used Philosophy shower gels before, you probably know their scents are very subdued and don&#x27;t really pack a powerful punch.</li>
      <li>Also, pretty much anything sudsy can be used as a bubble bath.</li>
      <li>I would certainly buy this shower gel again.  </li>
      <li>Its very soothing in the bath.</li>
      <li>I cannot use it much as a bath gel, either, because it gave me an itchy rash.  </li>
      <li>Gentle lingering scent when done.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that can dry up pretty easily, but I like the feeling of being \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;</li>
      <li>a body wash you need to use more then the average body-wash product.</li>
      <li>I felt it stripped my hair, and quickly went back to my moisturizing shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I will definately purchase this again and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Normally if the package states it&#x27;s multi use</li>
      <li>I have been trying some of the Philosophy fragrances of late, and have liked all of them.  </li>
      <li>I picked the wrong scent on this one, but it is still pleasant.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is soft and flowery, almost too light, sorta reminds me of baby powder with a little flower thrown in.  </li>
      <li>It does make you feel soft</li>
      <li>This is a soft feminine floral scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>So light in fact, that I can&#x27;t smell it after I&#x27;m dried off and dressed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a big Philosophy fan and was really looking forward to trying Field of Flowers, based on the other reviews.</li>
      <li>Upon receiving the product and opening it, I read the back and realized - it contains ALOE along with a whole lot of other chemicals not mentioned on Amazon&#x27;s listing.  </li>

<li> For a supposedly high-end product, the Philosophy bath products are as harsh on your skin as cleaning supplies.</li>
<li> I have had both in the past</li>
<li> I bought this body wash/shower gel as a gift for a friend who is a Philosophy FANATIC.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months , or a different fragrance like it, but this one is disappointing after using the magnolia fragrance.</li>
<li> The product is thick and creamy, lathers well.  </li>
<li> then it&#x27;s not safe for use as bubble bath!</li>
<li> I think this product was out of date because the smell was very faint and didn&#x27;t lather like all of my other Philosophy products do.  </li>
<li> :  Lots of chemical ingredients, questionable use as a shampoo, gave me an itchy rash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am so disappointed with this item</li>

    <li> Love the smell and great on the hair, bought as a gift and that was the response.</li>
    <li> Philosophy field of flowers is ok. It&#x27;s just another body wash you can use on your hair. Or just another hair wash you can use on your body. There are lots of less expensive gentle body washes and shampoos you can use either way. Also, pretty much anything sudsy can be used as a bubble bath. This product is no big deal, more just a gimmick. I would only recommend it if you like the pleasant flowery smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this body wash/shower gel as a gift for a friend who is a Philosophy FANATIC. I didn&#x27;t actually use the product, but it was delivered VERY fast and the company even gave me three FREE SAMPLES!</li>
    <li> The product was well received by the gift receiver.</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel. It is like taking a shower full of fragrant flowers, feminine, soft, and clean smelling. The fragrance is neither too strong or too soft, a difficult balance to achieve, yet leaves a delicate scent on the skin. I would certainly buy this shower gel again.  It is highly recommended and would make a wonderful gift. The amazing grace lotion compliments it nicely. Philosophy makes wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Creamy, thick texture; light fragrance, good price with free shipping&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Lots of chemical ingredients, questionable use as a shampoo, gave me an itchy rash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new bath gel and thought this might fit the bill.  I have been trying some of the Philosophy fragrances of late, and have liked all of them.  I saw this offered on a television shopping show, and found it cheaper with free shipping at Amazon, so I felt I got a good deal.  After using it for a week or so, I would not buy it again.  The fragrance is acceptable; I don&#x27;t like a lot of perfume, but I do want my bath products to smell good and leave a light fragrance on my skin.  This fragrance is soft and flowery, almost too light, sorta reminds me of baby powder with a little flower thrown in.  The product is thick and creamy, lathers well.  It bills itself as a shampoo, too, but I only tried that once.  I felt it stripped my hair, and quickly went back to my moisturizing shampoo.  I cannot use it much as a bath gel, either, because it gave me an itchy rash.  I noticed the ingredient list included benzyl salicylate, a type of salicylic acid.  I wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking for an exfoliator in my bath gel. I don&#x27;t think I would use it as a bubble bath, either, in light of the itching/rash reaction.  Now the bottle sits in the shower.  I use it occasionally, and only on areas I want to exfoliate. That has minimized the itching, and I make sure I rinse very well.</li>
    <li> This shower gel/ shampoo smells great.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather going.  Also, it does work great as a shampoo as well as a shower gel.  Normally if the package states it&#x27;s multi use I don&#x27;t like it as a shampoo.  But it works great as both.  I will definately purchase this again and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It smells exactly like philosophy - joyful heart - charity shower gel benefiting the joyful heart foundation.Jasmine is the predominant flower smell.So i guess this is a cheaper version but without the charity.</li>
    <li> I gave one of these to my sisters and they love it. It has a clean , pleasant smell and luxurious texture. I was so impressed, I just ordered it for myself.</li>
    <li> Philosophy makes many different scents in their shower gel/shampoo line.  This has a nice scent and of course, much more reasonable than any other place it is available.</li>
    <li> I adore this product! I have the entire line in this scent. Philosophy&#x27;s perfumes and the lotion sets are awesome. This one makes you feel like you&#x27;re standing in a field of fragrant flowers! Heavenly!</li>
    <li> I am a big Philosophy fan and was really looking forward to trying Field of Flowers, based on the other reviews. I am so disappointed with this item, this is the first review I have ever written. The only reason this even gets one star is because it is body wash and it does clean your body. Besides that, pffft. It has no smell at all. I would rather stick with Bath and Bodyworks at $5 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I think this product was out of date because the smell was very faint and didn&#x27;t lather like all of my other Philosophy products do.  I should have sent it back and will never order this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and fell in love with the smell.  I used it all within a week or two.  Its very soothing in the bath.</li>
    <li> We had tried this shampoo at friends&#x27; house while staying with them and liked it. Shampoo is great.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! A very generous size, and the scent is  beautiful - just like the title: A Field of Flowers! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> For a supposedly high-end product, the Philosophy bath products are as harsh on your skin as cleaning supplies. The fine print on the bubble bath line warns of \\&quot;skin irritation and urinary tract infection\\&quot;, and they deliver on that. Stick to Body Shop or Kiehl&#x27;s, which make skin products that are skin friendly.</li>
    <li> Can use all over, use it for my hair then the rest of my body. I feel like I&#x27;m getting 2 for 1.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products.  This one smells really nice, and is very floral.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like combination products, but this one actually does pretty well as a shampoo/body wash.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars, but the scent is very light.  So light in fact, that I can&#x27;t smell it after I&#x27;m dried off and dressed.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great product, by all means get it, but if you want a scent that lingers, this product probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>

If you&#x27;re not fond of floral scents I suggest that you do not purchase this product because it smells strongly of flowers.</li>
    <li> Usually my experience with Philosophy is a little go&#x27;s a long way. But not with this one!&lt;br /&gt;As a body wash you need to use more then the average body-wash product.</li>
    <li> The smell, is just like a clean spring day when you walk outside and can smell the beautiful smells of spring lilacs and hyacinths.  The consistency is just right for using as shampoo or body wash, it will make you feel as delightful as it smells.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in the smell. You think of field of flowers as being very good and flowery smelling but this was lacking in smell. It does make you feel soft but I would have liked to have more smell.</li>
    <li> I picked the wrong scent on this one, but it is still pleasant. I had smelled the honeysuckle in a store and thought I was getting the right one when I ordered it. My mistake, but if you like light smells this is the  one for you.</li>
    <li> Got this for a present and it was well received.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for my granddaughter.  I love the way it smells and I am sure she will also.</li>
    <li> For Christmas I asked for a couple of bottles of Philosophy shower gel, and this is one of the ones that I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m *very* happy with it. The scent is beautiful and delicate- lightly floral. If you&#x27;ve used Philosophy shower gels before, you probably know their scents are very subdued and don&#x27;t really pack a powerful punch. I like to mix up different shower gels from different brands so I like this about Philosophy. I also LOVE their formulas- I have sensitive skin that can dry up pretty easily, but I like the feeling of being \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; so I hate using any shower gels or soaps that leave any kind of \\&quot;moisture\\&quot; foam. Philosophy makes me skin feel super clean while not irritating it or stripping it of moisture. And I love how well it foams up.</li>
    <li> If you want to pamper your skin and your senses, then this is definitely for you!  The scent s really wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a soft feminine floral scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Great blathering action too.  Definitely can&#x27;t beat the price compared to other Philosophy body washes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months , or a different fragrance like it, but this one is disappointing after using the magnolia fragrance.</li>
    <li> I finally received my order today for the Philosophy Field of Flowers Bath Gel.  However, I did not receive the Field of Flowers I ordered.  I received the \\&quot;Peony\\&quot; fragrance which is entirely different than the \\&quot;Field of Flowers\\&quot;.  I have had both in the past and there is no comparison. I am returning the 2 bottles I ordered and will continue to wait for it to be at my Sephora.  I am so very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower gel that Philosophy makes!  Great smell too.</li>
    <li> I ordered Philosophy Field of Flowers after making sure there was no ingredients that I am allergic to (ie. ALOE).  Upon receiving the product and opening it, I read the back and realized - it contains ALOE along with a whole lot of other chemicals not mentioned on Amazon&#x27;s listing.  I had to return it and am awaiting a refund.  The smell was overly fragrant and the warning on the back said not to leave it on skin too long because it can cause irritation and urinary tract infection.  If it can cause a UTI then it&#x27;s not safe for use as bubble bath!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and it makes such beautiful suds.  Also good to wash your hair .  Gentle lingering scent when done.</li>
