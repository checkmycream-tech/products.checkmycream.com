    <li> It&#x27;s very good product, even for baby!!!</li>

    <li> Very good product to use for a baby rush! In two days the rush disappeared.</li>

    <li> I did not buy this cream from Amazon. My daughter-in-law obtained it somehow and used it on my grandson who was GREATLY AGONIZED with a horribly stubborn rash. The rash was so agitated and red and painful because of lactose-intolerance and a viral infection that caused him the most terrible diarrhea. He had to be hospitalized. He&#x27;s in great health now, PRAISE BE TO ALMIGHTY GOD ! I want parents to know that this cream is AN ABSOLUTE WONDER on very bad rash situations. It also has a very pleasant scent I didn&#x27;t expect. You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased it.</li>
