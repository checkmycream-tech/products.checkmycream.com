### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT product.</li>
      <li>This is the best water-resisitant and sweat-proof sunscreen that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Consumer Reports says its very good, so I&#x27;ll rely on their research.</li>
      <li>Works great even in the water or when playing beach games and sweating.</li>
      <li>Great product that does what it says it does.  </li>
      <li>nice and tan, not burnt!</li>
      <li>It does a good job at blocking the sun, but at the expense of your clothes.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never burned and neither have my fair children when wearing it.</li>
      <li>Put it on during a triathlon before the swim (by 15+ minutes per instructions), and do not towel off, and you are good to go.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and normally burn very easily.</li>
      <li>It has nice consistency that is easy to work with.</li>
      <li>which I&#x27;m sure they will not do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used the copertone sport lotion for years at work, and been pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I play volleyball a lot and love this brand of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is my favorite sunblock lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now how many people read this fine print?  </li>
      <li>I have a 1.5 oz bottle (which once came as a bonus with an 8 oz of of Coppertone) which I keep in my purse, and I find it easy to refill from the 8 oz</li>
      <li>I keep the bottle standing on its cap and this makes it easy to get the lotion out even when it is almost gone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply</li>
      <li>My heart was racing while wearing this sunscreen but perfectly fine when not....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use it, but in my experience the spray sunscreen while it works fine</li>
      <li>and it did just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years primarily cycling in Colorado.   </li>
      <li>The spray on is nice for convenience but it goes much faster since the wind takes 1/2 of it away when you&#x27;re attempting to spray it on and it gets places</li>
      <li>Great product overall.</li>
      <li>My original 5 star review was written in June 2011.</li>
      <li>We are bright red after a day in the sun.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I use, I end up with more color than I want after an hour or two on a sunny day.</li>
      <li>From sprint to full Ironman distance.  </li>
      <li>We went through more than a bottle of the spray-on in a weekend where this normal stuff lasts a whole summer most times.  </li>
      <li>But other than that it is great protection in the sun</li>
      <li>I suggested they list it in bold print along with \\&quot; Water Resistant, Non-Greasy\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It really protects and leave a beautiful and lasting tan if you are willing to get bronce with it.</li>
      <li>I own a lake house and spend a lot of time outside in the spring, summer and fall.  </li>
      <li>So in short, good sunscreen, but avoid use exercising in high humidity.</li>
      <li>Works well except in strong tropical sun - and even then the tops of my arms were red, but not burned, and my thighs were completely fine after 2 hours in the water.</li>
      <li>As far as protecting against sunburn, I rate this only fair.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s expiration (which it wasn&#x27;t) or stored in too hot conditions, etc</li>
      <li>You must be aware that this sunscreen WILL STAIN your swimsuit, coverup, or any clothes that you wear with the sunscreen on your skin.  </li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re going to be working out in a hot, humid environment (</li>
      <li>I do get color for sure with as much time as I&#x27;m outside riding as the one reviewer mentioned, but that is par for the course with SPF30</li>
      <li>We did not go in the water and it was fairly cool today, so no heavy sweating either.</li>
      <li>While this product went on easily and was non-greasy, it stained all of my swimsuits yellow.</li>
      <li>I just purchased a large packet of this Coppertone sunscreen from Costco.  </li>
      <li>It left stains on my light clothing, I switched to another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product works very well and lasts.</li>
      <li>Amazon wants a review.  </li>
      <li>, so I got it and it allowed for light tanning without any burns (even as we were constantly in the 85* sun of LA/San Diego at that time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product leaves my face really shiny.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs very well and isn&#x27;t as slimy as a lot of sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>and of course you have to put on a decent amount.  </li>
      <li>Once it is on, I don&#x27;t know it is there even when it is very hot outside.</li>
      <li>While mowing and working in the garden, still do not burn even with this high humidity.    </li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I apply carefully around my eyes for land sports (if you just smear a huge glob around your eyes, yes it will run and sting, but if you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s fine) but it will sting for water sports.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews now I know why my friends made fun of me for having man juice stains on my white tee shirt.</li>
      <li>I now have over $200 worth of white clothes that are turned orange in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And finally, the active ingredient, avobenzone, really does stain many fabrics so heed the warnings.  </li>
      <li>Our hottest vacation July in New Mexico - no problems, no burns!&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
      <li>We applied a new bottle of this lotion liberally and waited the 15 minutes, but still ended up sun burned.</li>
      <li>new formulation stains clothes.</li>
      <li>A LOT OF MONEY IN NEW CLOTHING.</li>
      <li>, I got a bit of sweat in my eyes and it stung more than usual.</li>
      <li>WE LIVE IN TX, DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY 3 YR OLD AND</li>
      <li>The one reviewer earlier said he had some problems in humidity, so can&#x27;t comment too much there.  </li>
      <li>The sunscreen coats the sweat, which hinders evaporation in high humidity, which therefore means I can&#x27;t cool down properly.    </li>
      <li>Super pale guy here.</li>
      <li>and I burn easy usually!</li>
      <li>My entire family uses this and nobody has had any sunburns so far.</li>
      <li>New rules next year won&#x27;t allow sunscreen companies to claim they&#x27;re waterproof or sweatproof as those claims are simply untrue.  </li>
      <li>I can put a coat on my face then arms and legs, then a second on the face, and stay out all day long in high altitude sun and not reapply.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be harder to find the normal rub on stuff now that they came out with the spray on.  </li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate that regularly tops 100.</li>
      <li>I really like the upside down design.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month or so on roughly 6.5 mile runs in the middle of the day in California.  Needless to say I end up sweating a lot.  Towards the end of my run I have noticed a little bit of irritation in my eyes, but I was getting that before using sun screen as well, and think its due to the sweat.</li>
    <li> no burn and still get an olive tan!  I play volleyball a lot and love this brand of sunscreen. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> As far as protecting against sunburn, I rate this only fair.  No matter how much I use, I end up with more color than I want after an hour or two on a sunny day. This product leaves my face really shiny.  Also, ultra sweatproof or no, this stuff runs into and stings and burns my eyes during outdoor exercise.  And finally, the active ingredient, avobenzone, really does stain many fabrics so heed the warnings.  I have the clothes to prove it.  I realized too late that the two large and very ugly yellow stains on the beige leather seat of my car were from the sunscreen I smeared on my upper legs before leaving the house to play tennis.</li>
    <li> Used this for all my training for triathlons.  From sprint to full Ironman distance.  Could do a 6 hour ride in Texas sun and never burned.  Whether I was running of biking.  Would apply before a the swim even in a half ironman in Texas and would not burn at the end of the day.  I have been using the SPF30 and SPF50 for at least 6 or 7 years.    Note that I work in a factory office so I will burn in 15-30 minutes in Texas sun without the sunscreen.    So yes, it is sweatproof.  It is not rub proof.  Take a towel and wipe off, and you can wipe your protection off.  Put a shirt on and then take it off after a wearing it, and the shirt will rub off the sunscreen.  Put it on during a triathlon before the swim (by 15+ minutes per instructions), and do not towel off, and you are good to go.  Wear it at the beach and towel off afterwards, expect to get burned without reapplying.    Now that I am in Missouri, I no longer train for triathlons, but I still use this.  While mowing and working in the garden, still do not burn even with this high humidity.    This is and continues to be my sunscreen of choice.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, in that it keeps you from burning if you apply it as directed.  However, if you&#x27;re going to be working out in a hot, humid environment (upper-80&#x27;s F, 70+ degree dew point), it&#x27;s actually a little *too* sweat-proof.    I&#x27;ve worn it cycling, and have the problem that when I sweat, I wind up with this greasy, slimy mess all over my skin.  The sunscreen coats the sweat, which hinders evaporation in high humidity, which therefore means I can&#x27;t cool down properly.    So in short, good sunscreen, but avoid use exercising in high humidity.</li>
    <li> I bought this while on vacation in Florida and yes it kept me from getting sunburn but I think I&#x27;d rather burn than deal with the fact that I could not cool down because it kept my sweat from evaporating! My heart was racing while wearing this sunscreen but perfectly fine when not.... Ad that&#x27;s not it! Once me and my boyfriend got home from vacation we both realized that our bathing suits had turned yellow!! His just on the inside waist but mine was yellow on the inside and the edges on the outside where it is white... So I googled what could have caused it and learned that coppertone sport sunscreen turns bathing suits yellow once you get them wet!! So now two bathing suits are ruined because of this sunscreen! I will never buy it again and I&#x27;m throwing away what I have left!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years primarily cycling in Colorado.   The one reviewer earlier said he had some problems in humidity, so can&#x27;t comment too much there.  I can put a coat on my face then arms and legs, then a second on the face, and stay out all day long in high altitude sun and not reapply.  I do get color for sure with as much time as I&#x27;m outside riding as the one reviewer mentioned, but that is par for the course with SPF30 and of course you have to put on a decent amount.  It absorbs very well and isn&#x27;t as slimy as a lot of sunscreens.  I was just in Houston and used some other brand my mother had and got cooked in a few hours.</li>
    <li> WE LIVE IN TX, DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR MY 3 YR OLD AND MY HUSBAND BOTH GOT SUNBURNED....NOT USING IT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years.  Keeps me from getting burnt (when I remember to put it on).  Seems to be harder to find the normal rub on stuff now that they came out with the spray on.  The spray on is nice for convenience but it goes much faster since the wind takes 1/2 of it away when you&#x27;re attempting to spray it on and it gets places you don&#x27;t want it.  We went through more than a bottle of the spray-on in a weekend where this normal stuff lasts a whole summer most times.  New rules next year won&#x27;t allow sunscreen companies to claim they&#x27;re waterproof or sweatproof as those claims are simply untrue.  They will also be holding companies to stricter testing of the SPF rating so I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see those rating numbers drop a bit and can say goodbye to the crazy SPF 90s and what not.  Great product overall.</li>
    <li> I own a lake house and spend a lot of time outside in the spring, summer and fall.  One lathering of this lotion in the morning and allowing it to soak in and I can go all day in the sun without a problem.  I have tried them all and this one works for people involved in sports where sweating and water are in the mix.</li>
    <li> Used it for years, cannot find anything comparing this to other similar products. Stays on well and the body is not slippery like other brands. Protects the body relatively well. My entire family uses this and nobody has had any sunburns so far. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two white shirts and a pair of white pants ruined...they turn yellow where you sweat and the sunscreen rubs off...around collars, shirt sleeves, waist bands, shorts. It&#x27;s very difficult to get the stains completely out and I would only use this sunscreen when you are wearing darker clothes. I&#x27;m also not a fan of the greasy feeling. It does a good job at blocking the sun, but at the expense of your clothes.</li>
    <li> My original 5 star review was written in June 2011. I was a repeat customer but the product I re-purchased in 2013 appeared to have a different formula. It left stains on my light clothing, I switched to another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons why&lt;br /&gt;1) It has absolutely no scent&lt;br /&gt;2) It does not feel greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;3) It spreads on well and stays on even if you get a bit wet&lt;br /&gt;4) It does not run into your eyes if you sweat and put the lotion on your forehead&lt;br /&gt;5) Once it is on, I don&#x27;t know it is there even when it is very hot outside. Our hottest vacation July in New Mexico - no problems, no burns!&lt;br /&gt;6) It has nice consistency that is easy to work with. I have a 1.5 oz bottle (which once came as a bonus with an 8 oz of of Coppertone) which I keep in my purse, and I find it easy to refill from the 8 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;7) I really like the upside down design. I keep the bottle standing on its cap and this makes it easy to get the lotion out even when it is almost gone. I don&#x27;t have to work hard to get the very last bits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is my favorite sunblock lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I even use this on my face (I&#x27;m breakout-prone) and it&#x27;s fine. I apply carefully around my eyes for land sports (if you just smear a huge glob around your eyes, yes it will run and sting, but if you&#x27;re careful it&#x27;s fine) but it will sting for water sports. Works well except in strong tropical sun - and even then the tops of my arms were red, but not burned, and my thighs were completely fine after 2 hours in the water. I always apply 30 minutes before hitting the water to let it soak in, because otherwise it makes you slip on your board.</li>
    <li> After using this product my white shirts turn yellow in the neck area and on the sleeves. I have been using this product for years but I now will be looking for an alternative. Several other reviewers had had this problem also. I&#x27;m going to try to contact the company to see if they have an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> While this product went on easily and was non-greasy, it stained all of my swimsuits yellow. It also stained my beach towels, pool clothes and workout gear. The stains do not come out in the wash, even if you use bleach on the white clothing. If you don&#x27;t want all of your clothes ruined, then DO NOT buy this product. I&#x27;ve seen other customers complain of the same thing so clearly this isn&#x27;t an isolated incident.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews now I know why my friends made fun of me for having man juice stains on my white tee shirt. They accused me for pleasuring myself and using my T-shirt to wipe it off... when in actuality it was the sunscreen sweating off my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply and I keep coming back to this brand because during hard work-outs, it never stings my eyes!</li>
    <li> new formulation stains clothes.</li>
    <li> My wife and I took a road-trip from Seattle to San Diego at the beginning of this summer. Being naturally pale and prone to skin cancer, I can say this did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the consumer guides raved abou this, so I got it and it allowed for light tanning without any burns (even as we were constantly in the 85* sun of LA/San Diego at that time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reapplied every 3-4 hours and it did just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen in September, for my upcoming December cruise.  It was received two days ago, and has not been used yet.  Amazon wants a review.  Consumer Reports says its very good, so I&#x27;ll rely on their research.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t not receive what is pictured or described here.  I have used the copertone sport lotion for years at work, and been pleased with it.  What I received was Copertone Sport spray sunscreen.  I&#x27;ll use it, but in my experience the spray sunscreen while it works fine does not last nearly as long as the lotion.</li>
    <li> Super pale guy here. I live in a dry climate that regularly tops 100. I&#x27;ve gone on day hikes and religiously applied this stuff every hour. Still came home burnt to blisters. Arguably sweatproof in cooler climates. Absolutely not waterproof.</li>
    <li> This is the second time this sunscreen has &#x27;failed&#x27; on us. We are bright red after a day in the sun. We applied a new bottle of this lotion liberally and waited the 15 minutes, but still ended up sun burned. We did not go in the water and it was fairly cool today, so no heavy sweating either. Last summer at the lake we used it and got burned then too - thought that bottle was past it&#x27;s expiration (which it wasn&#x27;t) or stored in too hot conditions, etc..&lt;br /&gt;Today we did use the spray on Coppertone on our backs and those areas are not burned.&lt;br /&gt;My spf 15 daily moisturizer on my face kept my face and neck from getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying or using this product again as I have lost faith in it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I liberally lathered up my fat chest and back with this crap.  I spent three hours in the sun and when I returned home I looked like a damn lobster!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Beach, pool, and running at the park I use it for everything and even on the kids.  It never sweats off and there is tons in one bottle. It might be a bit shiny when on but I&#x27;ve never burned and neither have my fair children when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Took this with us to the beach! Works great even in the water or when playing beach games and sweating. I do have to say, I got a bit of sweat in my eyes and it stung more than usual. I am assuming the lotion was in it and stung my eyes. But other than that it is great protection in the sun and I burn easy usually!</li>
    <li> works for me, i havent been burnt with this on yet.  besides that....its just sunscreen.  it goes on easy and doesnt smell too bad</li>
    <li> I can evenly and heavily apply in the morning and spend the day at the beach without burning. I avoid rubbing when I towel dry and it continues working.</li>
    <li> nice and tan, not burnt!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens.  The product works very well and lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this sunscreen, and it ruined 6 t-shirts that I used during the time that i was wearing it, even black colors t-shirts have an awful yellow stain.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS SUNSCREEN. IT CAN COST YOU A LOT OF MONEY IN NEW CLOTHING.</li>
    <li> Great product that does what it says it does.  I took it with me to the Dominican Republic during a week long mission trip in which I&#x27;d be working hard all day under the sun...  I put it on every morning and it lasted all day and my sweat didn&#x27;t wash it off.  I highly recommend this product.  I have very fair skin and normally burn very easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best water-resisitant and sweat-proof sunscreen that I have tried.  I play numerous activities in the sun and I need the protection and long-lasting effects.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product. It really protects and leave a beautiful and lasting tan if you are willing to get bronce with it.</li>
    <li> I just purchased a large packet of this Coppertone sunscreen from Costco.  Our family used it on our recent trip to the Caribbean.  You must be aware that this sunscreen WILL STAIN your swimsuit, coverup, or any clothes that you wear with the sunscreen on your skin.  My family was so disappointed to have swimsuits, coverups, jackets, jerseys all turn orange.  I tried soaking in bleach and I still couldn&#x27;t get out the stains.  I now have over $200 worth of white clothes that are turned orange in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I phoned Coppertone and they told me that in small print under the directions in the section called \\&quot;Other Information\\&quot; it states \\&quot;may stain or damage some fabrics or surfaces\\&quot;.  Now how many people read this fine print?  I suggested they list it in bold print along with \\&quot; Water Resistant, Non-Greasy\\&quot; etc. which I&#x27;m sure they will not do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy another Coppertone product.</li>
