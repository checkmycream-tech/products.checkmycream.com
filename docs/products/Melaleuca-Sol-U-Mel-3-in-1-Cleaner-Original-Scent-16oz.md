    <li> My child took a permanent black marker all over the back seat of my car.  I was heart broken thinking it was ruined.  I tried Sol-u-Mel as a \\&quot;I&#x27;ll give it a shot\\&quot; thinking nothing would help, and it came out effortlessly and didn&#x27;t leave any trace of the marker.  LOVE this stuff!!</li>
    <li> My son scribbled on photos with black sharpie. I thought they were a lost cause. The entire picture was blacked in and you could not see anything. I saved the pics and looked online for anything that might work since it was his class photo and not replaceable. The pic sat in my drawer for a good month before I found this. I ordered and used it by wiping in strokes over the pic. I wiped and waited a few sec to min and redid it. It restored the pics to new. You can not tell it ever happened. I used full strength on tissue to remove the sharpie. It did not damage the pic in any way. I got two bottles since I thought I would need it, but I barely used any from the first bottle. It will also remove other stains around the house. This is really the best thing I have ever purchased. It is amazing!</li>
