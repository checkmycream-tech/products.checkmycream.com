      <li>Its great.</li>
      <li>These are my honest opinions after having tried this product!</li>
      <li>I was given this product to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think there is any product out there that can regrow lashes except Latisse and that is about $250 for a months supply.  </li>
      <li>The application is kind of like putting eyeliner on.  </li>
      <li>I do think it will take longer because my lashes are much much more scarce than others</li>
      <li>I have refrained from wearing any eye makeup to get a better gauge on how well it was working.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the product  and will continue using it.</li>
      <li>My brows and lashes are fuller, healthy looking, longer and thicker</li>

      <li>What I do like about this product is how it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I received this product at a reduced or free price for my unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bottle came all sticky and empty. I didnt have the chance to use it once. I got my money back in about 3 days.</li>
    <li> going back to RapidLash, may be more expensive but it works better</li>
    <li> I was surprised when this actually made my lashes and brows grow. My lashes have always been thin and barely there until I started using this product. After about a week my lashes were thicker and longer as well as my brows being thicker. I have very sensitive eyes and skin and this did not bother me at all. No rashes, no irritation, no puffiness, no red-watery-burning eyes, nothing. Its great.</li>
    <li> I saw results quickly. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I was using it for 1 month and I din t see any difference</li>
    <li> This did not work at all.</li>
    <li> not sure if working, but I have been using it everynight, I honestly don&#x27;t notice any huge difference..</li>
    <li> It did nothing. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I had to return it because the bottle was empty! Waste my time</li>
    <li> there was not even enough for 3 days without any result!!!!</li>
    <li> Its ok so far, but i dont think my bottle had enough in it.</li>
    <li> I will never buy this product or any product like this in the mail again.  When I recieved it there was no product in the container, it leaked inside the box.</li>
    <li> Major problem, when I opened the package and tried to use the product THE VIAL WAS EMPTY, NOTHING IN IT!&lt;br /&gt;This HAS HAPPENED to other purchasers according to comments &amp; reviews.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! After 2 weeks if using this on my extremely thin eye brows and lashes I can definitely notice a difference! My brows and lashes are fuller, healthy looking, longer and thicker hair! Can&#x27;t edit to buy more. These are my honest opinions after having tried this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing.  Used religiously for months.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed! Felt ripped off!!  There was no liquid in the bottle!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me after used 2 tubes.</li>
    <li> I recived it totally empty whats inside was all foamed outside the bottel.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really know.  All the product had leaked out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> came in empty inside the tube with sticky guck on the outside. package still sealed, just empty</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT GROWN ANY NEW EYELASHES WHERE MY LASHES ARE MISSING</li>
    <li> I seen results after two weeks!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a reduced or free price for my unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this product a little over a week ago and I am already seeing a difference with my lashes.  Was hesitant at first but after seeing a real difference in the appearance of my lashes I will continue to use this product.  The application is kind of like putting eyeliner on.  I have refrained from wearing any eye makeup to get a better gauge on how well it was working.&lt;br /&gt;A few times I got some in my eyes, I was a little worried even though it says it won&#x27;t hurt your eyes.  I washed my eyes out my but it didn&#x27;t matter there was no irritation or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that is like me, with my short fine eyelashes, that wants to have fuller and longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I will be updating father down the road to comment on whether or not the results continue.</li>
    <li> It really works! My lashes were growing toward my nose. They are almost as they should be.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have extremely small and way sparser lashes than the photo shown on the description of this product. I have been using this for a little over a week now and I am just starting to see a tiny bit of thickening towards the base of my lashes but that&#x27;s about it. I do have faith because of all the rave reviews and will continue to use this in hopes that it might just take me longer. What I do like about this product is how it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and is easy to apply. I do think it will take longer because my lashes are much much more scarce than others but I atleast am see small results.</li>
    <li> This has done nothing for me.  I use it in the morning and at night and nothing has happened.</li>
    <li> The bottle was empty and this is made in China product!&lt;br /&gt;No wonder.. I had to return</li>
    <li> sorry cheap plastic tube with nothing in it!!!</li>
    <li> I have such tiny eyelashes that mascara was just out of the question to use and always have to apply false lashes. I was given this product to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  Because I am desperate to have some real eyelashes I was very thankful to receive this, I was very skeptical as well b/c I have tried other eyelash growth serum before only for it to fail. I have religiously applied this serum for a week now and I am starting to see a difference in my lashes, the growth is slow but I am actually seeing my lashes without having to put my nose against the mirror!!! I am also seeing my lashes become thicker! I am so excited and hope the growth will keep going and I will be in a position where false lashes was a thing of the past! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have noticed some improvement on my lashes,&lt;br /&gt;More than my eyebrows, but I haven&#x27;t been using it that long. I am satisfied with the product  and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 2 weeks now and have not noticed any change at all on the appearance of my eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day on clean eyes.  Nothing!!!!  I honestly don&#x27;t think there is any product out there that can regrow lashes except Latisse and that is about $250 for a months supply.  Way out of my price range</li>
    <li> Bottle was empty..got a different brand (NULASH)..DO NOT BUY!!!NEGATIVE STARS</li>
    <li> The product was dried up the best I can tell as the package did not have any evidence of leaking. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Nothing in the bottle defective</li>
    <li> Did not work as some other eyelash growth products I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived sticky and empty. Will not buy it again</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the point in submitting a feedback, you gonna delete it anyways. Smh</li>
