      <li>It is almost like a very soft powdery vanilla scent!</li>
      <li>quick drying, smell is so addictive can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
      <li>that I had to buy an alternate present, and when I inquired about it, the vendor (who I could not contact directly as the email provided was no longer in use) suggested that I look into the situation with the post office.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t wait until the next semi-annual sale in June, and it was worth the extra few dollars to replenish my stock now.</li>

    <li> This lotion smells wonderful! It is almost like a very soft powdery vanilla scent! Very relaxing smell for sure! Highly recommend this product!</li>

    <li> This was to be a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for someone who had trouble finding it in the stores ~ It was delivered so late (about a month!) that I had to buy an alternate present, and when I inquired about it, the vendor (who I could not contact directly as the email provided was no longer in use) suggested that I look into the situation with the post office. After phone calls, follow up etc, and it finally arriving, I asked that I be credited shipping instead of them picking up the item and issuing a full credit which I thought was fair. I was offered a $3.00 credit instead. P.S., shipping was almost 80% of the cost of the item to begin with so they still made money on the shipping! I will keep it and certainly use it as the product is lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit unapologetic, but perhaps this was a fluke...We&#x27;ll see, but I will be more careful about the vendors behind Amazon...</li>
    <li> quick drying, smell is so addictive can&#x27;t get enough. The smell encourages you to use it more and more, container is glass. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted but it ended up costing me a lot more than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very soothing and works. Got a great deal on this as it was discontinued in my local store, transaction went smoothly.</li>
    <li> I use it several times a day....love the smell...really is relaxing.  Ask B&amp;B works to bring it back to the store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. It&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore, and I am glad I have a chance to buy it again!</li>
    <li> Very nice light fragrance. Makes a great lotion for my desk at work.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite lotion. It is hard to find now that Bath and Body Works aren&#x27;t making it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is none greasy!  It is smooth and smells great!  It does not stain.  It is very soothing!  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Best smell EVER! It keeps my hands nice and moist. It truly does calm me when I put it on, I love this lotion!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product good price. good and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the products that I received. I am so glad that I found exactly what I wanted and needed to replace.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Vanilla Verbena scent in the Aromatherapy Stress Relief collection from Bath &amp; Body Works. It&#x27;s calming and subtle. I use it at work constantly, and share with co-workers. When I started to run low, I checked in with my local store and the sales clerk said it was a seasonal scent that &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; be available during the semi-annual sales. My colleagues and I couldn&#x27;t believe Bath &amp; Body Works wouldn&#x27;t have such a popular scent year-round. Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t wait until the next semi-annual sale in June, and it was worth the extra few dollars to replenish my stock now. I am so very happy to have found my favorite lotion on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and had been told by a local store that it would not be available again until Christmas.  She was delighted I found it on line so we bought three containers..</li>
    <li> Husband does not like the smell.  A little goes a long way!  Very earthy smell which does heighten your mood.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, love the feel. love the product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the scent, and it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.  Too bad the company has discontinued this vanilla-verbena scent!  :(</li>

    <li> I have always enjoyed this lotion</li>
    <li> So glad I was able to find this scent on Amazon! This is my favorite and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I&#x27;m not the only one upset by this, either.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised, but the pump was broken.</li>
    <li> On time delivery and a great deal.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My local Bath &amp; Body Works told me that this scent was discontinued. As an alternate I got the &amp;#34;Sleep: Lavender Vanilla&amp;#34; product and love it. But I still wanted the &amp;#34;Stress Relief: Vanilla Verbana&amp;#34;. Thank you Amazon for having it. The scent is very delicious smelling. Like a pure Vanilla bean, which is my favorite scent.</li>
