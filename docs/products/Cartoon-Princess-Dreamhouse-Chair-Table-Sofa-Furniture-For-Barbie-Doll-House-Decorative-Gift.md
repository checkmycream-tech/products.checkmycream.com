      <li>While the design is really cute, the materials were not.</li>
      <li>I think if you want to have better causality then by something else</li>
      <li>Really cute</li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>cute, but NOT quality, and you need to either hot-glue it or super glue it.  </li>
      <li>Kelly just fit on it.</li>
      <li>Its cheap and seems like will break any day now.</li>
      <li>Super cheap.</li>
      <li>wish it came just like the picture, but hey, its super cheap</li>
      <li>I was able to glue it together and use it for a very brief time.</li>
      <li>My initial reaction when I received it in Jan 2015 was that it could be better quality.</li>
      <li>but if you don&#x27;t mind hot gluing it</li>
      <li>but if it&#x27;s for a little kid then don&#x27;t because it will break easily.</li>

      <li>Then when opened was cheaply made, very flimsy and was broken.</li>
      <li>Pure junk and is half the size of Barbie scale.  </li>

    <li> cute, but NOT quality, and you need to either hot-glue it or super glue it.  and it doesn&#x27;t arrive broken, but you need to &amp;#34;put it together&amp;#34; yourself.  wish it came just like the picture, but hey, its super cheap</li>
    <li> Very flimsy, not great</li>
    <li> I would give a zero star if possible. Arrived after Christmas, no indication when ordering I would not receive in time. Then when opened was cheaply made, very flimsy and was broken. Now I have the added trouble of returning.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here and arrived broken.</li>
    <li> A little small for Barbie.  I don&#x27;t like it because Barbie-sized it is not.</li>
    <li> so cheap and generic, complete waste of even $2. the back of the coach broke off within seconds of opening it. do not buy</li>
    <li> My initial reaction when I received it in Jan 2015 was that it could be better quality. However my kid hasn&#x27;t broke it yet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Super cheap. I think a barbie sitting on it could break it.</li>
    <li> Its cheap and seems like will break any day now. the back isnt hard and just flops down when barbies sit on it.</li>
    <li> Item was broken when I got it.</li>
    <li> Really cute but it has a lot of flaws. It comes in a bag that is not very good packaging. It is very flimsy and the back is broken. It&#x27;s to small for barbies but I think it&#x27;s fine. I think if you want to have better causality then by something else but if you don&#x27;t mind hot gluing it then it&#x27;s fine. Also if your just a toy collector and your going to put it up for display then buy it but if it&#x27;s for a little kid then don&#x27;t because it will break easily.</li>
    <li> Wish I had believed the warnings of other reviews. The back is attached at the seat by 2 small tabs and the back will not stay up; nothing to attach it to. Looks just like the pix, but very small.</li>
    <li> Granddaughters loved them</li>
    <li> Total rip off. Pure junk and is half the size of Barbie scale.  Disgusted with this seller.</li>
    <li> Falls apart. Has no durability at all.</li>
    <li> Cheap,too small for Barbie, arrived totally broken</li>
    <li> The legs were broken and I think it&#x27;s too small for Barbie dolls.</li>
    <li> Great Barbie sized furniture. Works great in the Dreamhouse. Fits  the dolls perfect. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken of course</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter a dollhouse for Christmas and was looking for some extra furniture to go with it. This was a great deal, so I snatched it up. She squealed when I pulled it out of the package!</li>
    <li> While the design is really cute, the materials were not. It is made form a very thin plastic. The plastic legs were attached very poorly and wobbled. In addition, this couch was very small and short. Kelly just fit on it. Barbie was way to large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it arrived broken. I was able to glue it together and use it for a very brief time. Unfortunately not worth the investment.</li>
