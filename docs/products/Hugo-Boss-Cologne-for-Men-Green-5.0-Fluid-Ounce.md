<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe the generosity of this company.  I reordered the other brand I meant to order  They are a very understanding company and I thank them.  I donated this one to a deserving person.  Pay it forward!</li>
    <li> Good scent for a good price</li>
    <li> Husband has been using this for years.  It continues to be my favorite cologne.  He gets compliments on this all the time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real thing! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great, my husband was very happy. thank you so much.</li>
    <li> excellent product and buy</li>
    <li> This is definitely not HUGO boss. What a rip off!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve worn Hugo for 5 years and this DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE REAL ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a damn store. It&#x27;s worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have this extra bottle of crap :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Bought this cologne for my husband and i have to say hes pleased everytime he wears it i absolutely cant resist the clean mellow attractive smell it leaves off, the smell last all day long with only needing 1 or 2 good sprays and he loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for at least 10 years and am very happy with it. It has a clean fresh scent, not overpowering and lasts all day. Normally I would give 5 stars but the bottle I received has a defective spray nozzle that occasionally shoots a stream instead of a spray.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal going. If you like the sent you will not dind a better deal. Shipping was fast and no issues what so ever</li>
    <li> I spray this on every day and the ladies just keep coming. This stuff makes me feel like the ladies man. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for almost a decade and it still lasts long smells great but not overwhelming AND it still be droppin drawers on a dime so yeah get a bottle and smell fresh. Trust me- your worth it! And your helping our world smell better.</li>
    <li> It has been over 10 years and this scent is still a big hit with people. It is a classic and must own have. I also recommend Spice  Bomb which is a warmer complement to this type of cologne.</li>
    <li> The girls say I smell good.....not only that, guys do too.  I can&#x27;t stop getting complimented on how good I smell and people always ask &amp;#34;What are you wearing??&amp;#34;...this is good cologne!  I have tried all kinds of cologne samples, most are so alcohol scented or just have a very musty odor.  Trust me, I got samples at my local Macy&#x27;s and discovered that even colognes exceeding 200 dollars a bottle do not smell as good as this.  I feel like if I can&#x27;t stand the smell of my own cologne, other people probably feel the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Hugo Boss, the one and only.  This kind of smells a little bit like a non-citrus fruit initially, followed by a deep, cool sensation.  This price is a steal for such a quality-driven cologne.  Buy it.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great Cologne I have used for some time now.  Very clean smelling and I have had a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Just right mix of fragrance, not too light for a man and not too heavy for anyone to deal with. The scent also lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Good product enjoy it recommend it to others and veryyyyyyyyyy goood it is a good deal just try it I liked it</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not too overbearing/strong. Delivered very quickly! Bought as gift for male family member with very particular taste-one of his favorite colognes.</li>
    <li> My husband lights my fire naturally. When he wears this cologne, which is daily, he drives me wild! I buy this for him two or three times a year. LOVE THIS SCENT!!!</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time and effort looking for a scent that was not overpowering, has good \\&quot;hang time\\&quot; (last a long time), and compliments my natural scent. This one does it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the morning and within minutes the scent fades and is not telegraphed (people smell you coming) or trailed (people smell you passing). In the evening, if I get hugged, I still get compliments (hang time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cologne selecting is personal since the scent has to mix with your odor and the result may not be the best it could be. For me, this cologne works.</li>
    <li> This is a great basic cologne. I ordered this purely based on the many 5 star reviews. I was slightly disappointed; It smelled great but there was nothing about it that made it stand out to me. It has a very clean, fresh smell; it would be great for work or business attire. I highly recommend that you smell this cologne in-store (Kohl&#x27;s) before you buy it. Regardless, it&#x27;s a great cologne if this is your style!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son.  He has worn this cologne for years and loves it.  I also found that your price is much less than I have paid for it at a dept. store.  So, whenever he needs it, I will order it from Amazon as your service is always great along with your prices and I love the no shipping and no tax.</li>
    <li> Excellent, i like this product</li>
    <li> This product always delivers to the fullest of expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne!!! Smells absolutely great!!! Light, crispy, not too strong. Can&#x27;t go wrong! i love that orange + green pear + lime + lemon + fresh ocean scent &#x3D; Paradise!!!  :D  I love it so much i bought 2 bottles and plan on buying more and more when i run out in the future! I&#x27;ve been using this Hugo Boss cologne (including the other one called &amp;#34;Boss Pure&amp;#34;) for several years. i like that it&#x27;s not too strong like many other men&#x27;s cologne out there where the fragrance is just overwhelming &amp; overbearing to the point where it gives me a headache. This Hugo Boss cologne &amp;#34;Green&amp;#34; &amp; the &amp;#34;Boss Pure&amp;#34; one are great! Although they don&#x27;t last very long. Maybe like 3 or 4 hours, but i still like it!</li>
    <li> A Classic.  Any men&#x27;s cologne aficionado should have a bottle of HUGO in their collection.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and the price was great and it was the size we normally buy at the department store.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment, great product!</li>
    <li> It sounds semi-crazy and maybe it is, but I have been using Hugo Boss for over 12 years at this point and I still love it.  I have never EVER had anyone say anything negative about cologne.  I love the smell and it has been fantastic to me all these years.  I will continue to keep buying it until they stop making it.  Also a great price for the 5 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> This cologne rocks....smells soooo good.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time mild smell.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I love hugo boss... my girl too.  what is better than that.  crisp cool, this is a real value too.</li>
    <li> I went all over the OC looking for this cologne I ended up at an over priced Hugo Boutique store in the South Coast Plaza. The price there was outrageous and the help, was nothing but attitude and arraogance. Save yourself some time, and road travel and just by it online. It&#x27;s quick, easy and less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bottle at a great price. My husband loved it! It is definitely worth it for the value.</li>
    <li> Thank you. Shipment is done as written. Everything is fine wtih the parfume.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Good deal</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne ever</li>
    <li> IT LAST ONLY 3-4 HOURS AFTER THAT I HAVE TO SPRY AGING I DON&#x27;T WHY&lt;br /&gt;MAYBE THERE ARE EXP.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE TO BUY MORE BUT I AM CONCERN</li>
    <li> brought me back in the day.  Nostalgic for sure and it is still a loved scent.</li>
    <li> Those Germans over at hugo boss sure crank out a nice cologne. My wife likes it that is what matters. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with my purchase. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for years.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, fast ship.</li>
    <li> Not a knockoff! Great scent</li>
    <li> Excellent footwear. Location Beach coastline and fits my needs ... thanks</li>
    <li> My husband loved his Christmas Gift. Hugo has an aroma unlike any other and this 5.1 ounce bottle is surely value for money. Pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Fully met my expectation</li>
    <li> Item was shipped and received very fast! Product was exactly what I wanted! Great smell and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice cologne that has a distinct, but subtle smell. The person who wears it interacts with people daily and it is not an overbearing smell that leaves you with a headache.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!! The reason it&#x27;s so cheap is because it&#x27;s a rejected bottle, unfit to be sold in stores.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, the packaging looked perfect and unopened. However, I took the bottle out, and there was a red marker smudge on the cap, which someone clearly tried to erase. When I sprayed it on my wrist and let it dry, it took a sniff, and it smelled nothing like how it should. The fresh pine and mint notes weren&#x27;t there, only a pungent green, mossy scent with a small hint of apple (and apple is supposed to be the main top note).&lt;br /&gt;The only clear explanation for this is that the perfumery which made this cologne gathered together all of the rejected batches, marked their caps with a red marker, and sent it to discount perfume stores and warehouses to be sold to unsuspecting customers like myself. So don&#x27;t be tempted by the incredibly low price. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on the real thing at a department store, or you&#x27;ll just end up with a Hugo Boss paperweight like I did.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this cologne.  Boss cologne for this boss.  What else can I say.</li>
    <li> Good quality, lasts a long time, great smell.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected- great pricing.</li>
    <li> This smells so good, I even spray it on my pillow just to have it!  I don&#x27;t know why I like it so much.</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome.  I have gotten so many compliments from women when wearing it about how good I smell.  From strangers that is pretty cool.  This was a great value for the amount you received.  Highly recommend to the playas out there.</li>
    <li> This is the second time we&#x27;ve received a false bottle of Hugo Boss through Amazon in the last 2 years.  I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for over 10 years, it has a very distinct fragrance &amp; its very easy to detect a bogus bottle.  I&#x27;m more disappointed that this bottle came from Amazon directly (not a 3rd party seller) and was not caught as being fraudulent.  FYI- I compared it side by side with a legit smaller store-bought bottle that I had for airline travel... not at all close.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years from various sources so to catch this on sale at this size was great.</li>
    <li> Always get comments about Hugo Boss cologne!  The same phrase all the time!  &amp;#34;Ummm, you smell good!&amp;#34;  Have worn HB for years and I never get tired of using it.</li>
    <li> This is eu de toilette - I wish they still made real Hugo cologne!!</li>
    <li> I thought it was OK but my wife gave it a thumbs down so away it went</li>
    <li> Came with the broken lid .... :(</li>
    <li> I get compliments for this cologne, used lightly.  My daughter recommended it.  How could I refuse that?  Last bottle lasted me years.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Apparently this fragrance is no longer being &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; by the company. I love this scent on my husband because it lasts quite a long time and smells fresh w/out being &amp;#34;perfume-y.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Best deal you can get, they deliver fast too</li>
</ol>
