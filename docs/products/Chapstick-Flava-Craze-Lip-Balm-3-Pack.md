<li> but I didn&#x27;t receive the exact flava craze I wanted, at least not as the image and the website says.</li>
<li> because with the fact that it is three lip balm i know its going to last me a long while.</li>
<li> Personally, some of the ChapSticks tasted bitter.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like the other 2 flavors in the pack.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I was pretty disappointed to find I didn&#x27;t receive what I thought I was purchasing.</li>
<li> I was not pleased with these item</li>
<li> I like all of them, but I was disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t very tropical</li>
<li> considering how expensive they were, too.</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the other 2 flavors in the pack. I wanted just grape and that&#x27;s what I thought I was getting</li>
    <li> Favorite chap stick in general. Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nice product, but I didn&#x27;t receive the exact flava craze I wanted, at least not as the image and the website says.</li>
    <li> My kids and I really love these things.  They are fruity and fun, and they don&#x27;t have any sunscreen in them.  For some reason, I&#x27;m sensitive to the tocopherol ingredient in lip balm sunscreen, and it&#x27;s nice to have a product without that.  Please Amazon start selling them again yourself, instead of third-party sellers.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife, she seems very satisfied with them. Product does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Fun childhood memories! Came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Gifts for sister loves recommend</li>

    <li> Chapstick is very effective  in soothing chapped lips.  I use it frequently.  I thought the variety would be more interesting.  The flavors make a nice change and the thre flavors are all pleasant.</li>
    <li> Did not get what was pictured.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip balm because of the winter and boy oh boy what a great buy because with the fact that it is three lip balm i know its going to last me a long while.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love the flavors as I thought I would, but still a good product and good value.</li>
    <li> In the pack there is cotton candy, grape, and fruit punch. I like all of them, but I was disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t very tropical</li>
    <li> These have all been gooey and not maintaining their chemical composition.  I was not pleased with these item considering how expensive they were, too.</li>
    <li> Whats to say?  I wish they had more unique flavors like some of the other brands.  Such as Root Beer, or M&amp;M etc...  It&#x27;s a staple though and the price is always right.</li>
    <li> I specially purchased this pack because of the flavors advertised, they are the newest flavors, but ended up with the old three pack with the cotton candy flavor. I was pretty disappointed to find I didn&#x27;t receive what I thought I was purchasing. If you&#x27;re not going to ship what&#x27;s pictured, perhaps a disclaimer that the variety of flavors may vary.</li>
    <li> I ordered the crazeberry which is what you showed you sent me something different I got something I didn&#x27;t want</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I though I would get what is pictured. I was wrong. The ones that were delivered to me lacked what the name of the product advertises, flavor. Personally, some of the ChapSticks tasted bitter.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item I imagined they would be full sized from the description and pictures. They are super small but still work.</li>
    <li> Wanted the one with blu raspberry. Sent one with cotton candy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Living in a desert region, my lips get dry easily. I would be lost without my Chapstickl....and love those flavor choices. An excellent product.</li>
