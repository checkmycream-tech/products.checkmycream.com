      <li>This is a great scent and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Great deal for the money.</li>
      <li>It is a great price.</li>
      <li>Great deal for the perfume.</li>
      <li>i bought this because all these reviews were saying how great it is but</li>
      <li>I love this scent and the scent in this tester is perfect.</li>
      <li>The perfume itself is just to die for, it&#x27;s not too musky and not too sweet, but just the perfect combination of floral scents.</li>
      <li>I was even more pleased when my husband came home from work and said that I smelled awesome!  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the purchase and would buy again.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I ordered from this company for this product &amp; love!</li>
      <li>the scent is lovely, the price is to die for!</li>
      <li>Overall, excellent value for a amazing perfume.</li>
      <li>so again that is great if you like strong fruity, sweet fragrances.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I found a great deal on a tester, this one would be worth the full price!</li>
      <li>After I sprayed it on I was magically inspired by the smell.  </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>Who cares about the fancy box and top?  </li>
      <li>Why pay more for the fancy packaging and lid??  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the fancy top on it but who cares?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recieved so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my friend would NOT have picked to send me this as a gift.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find a better price anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Ladies, your guys will love this one.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many perfumes give me headaches and this one does not.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re buying it for your own use, it&#x27;s a great deal, if you are buying it for a gift, you might want to fork out the high price for the original packaged item.</li>
      <li>It does not come with a fancy top, but who cares; after all it is the lovely fragrance we enjoy.</li>
      <li>Very sweet, floral smell.</li>
      <li>I found this tester bottle at such a great value, I just had to buy it.</li>
      <li>I always order the \\&quot;testers\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t want to pay full price just so I can get the \\&quot;top\\&quot; of the perfume bottle (which I already have since I saved the original lid after I knew this would be my signature scent).  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be helpful to point out that this perfume is such a good price because it&#x27;s a tester.  </li>
      <li>To make it look nice on my dresser,I put the old bottles fancy cap on it.</li>
      <li>This is a glorious fragrance--fruity and flowery without being sweet.  </li>
      <li>Other than that its great.</li>
      <li>The package arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to wearing fragrances and found this one too fruity, sweet and strong for me.  </li>
      <li>The scent is strong, but not too strong that I can&#x27;t wear it on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>Juicy Couture for women is a beautiful long lasting flowery fragrance.  </li>
      <li>thanks, amazon!</li>
      <li>I only wish it came with the top.  </li>
      <li>I still smell it even though I have washed my wrists where i first sprayed it.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little overpowering when first sprayed on, but quickly ripens into the most heavenly aura.</li>
      <li>No fancy top to the bottle or pink box as shown in the picture.  </li>
      <li>Very concentrated.</li>
      <li>I am a sucker for a good deal and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who likes a sweet lasting scent!</li>
      <li>smells pretty much the same it did when i first put it on, yesterday.</li>
      <li>It used to be Obsession but now Juicy Couture for Women is my new Obsession!   </li>
      <li>We purchased a tester at Amazon and avoided the high price at a department store.  </li>
      <li>So what if you are missing the decorative top.</li>
      <li>The perfume is exactly the same as what you would purchase in the stores with the exception of the packaging.</li>
      <li>This tester is worth the money spent.  </li>
      <li>, On the plus side it is very long lasting and stays true.  </li>
      <li>The bottle was full, it just had no cap and came in a plain brown box and had a try me sticker on the bottle.  </li>

<li> One less thing to step on on your way to the restroom!</li>
<li> One complaint: the metal sticker on the front of the bottle was coming off a little bit when I took it out, and it cut me.  </li>

    <li> I ordered from this company for this product &amp; love! It is a great price. I don&#x27;t need a fancy schmancy bottle I just want the perfume. A+++</li>
    <li> This tester is worth the money spent.  Very concentrated. Only need a very small spot spray.  Would probably last someone a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Juicy Couture for women is a beautiful long lasting flowery fragrance.  My daughter and I use it often.  We purchased a tester at Amazon and avoided the high price at a department store.  It does not come with a fancy top, but who cares; after all it is the lovely fragrance we enjoy.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  I don&#x27;t go anywhere that people don&#x27;t aske me what I am wearing !!!! I love it !!!! a great bargain here !!!!</li>
    <li> Item was just as described. Why pay more for the fancy packaging and lid??  Very satisfied with the purchase and would buy again.  Great deal for the money. Couldn&#x27;t find a better price anywhere else. In stores or on the web.</li>
    <li> I received the bottle that was never used but said \\&quot;Tester\\&quot; on it.  After I sprayed it on I was magically inspired by the smell.  What a Treat at a terrific price.  It doesn&#x27;t have the fancy top on it but who cares?  Not me!  I was even more pleased when my husband came home from work and said that I smelled awesome!  This is a must ladies and is now my staple fragrance for everyday. It used to be Obsession but now Juicy Couture for Women is my new Obsession!   Don&#x27;t hesitate.....Buy it TODAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for the price.  I only wish it came with the top.  Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> i bought this because all these reviews were saying how great it is but its really not all that.... it smells like britney spears curious....i wouldnt waste my money on this if i could do it again</li>

    <li> The fragrance is to die for and so was the price.  The package arrived quickly.  Ladies, your guys will love this one.</li>
    <li> This perfume is wonderful!!!  I&#x27;ve recieved so many compliments.  By the way, I wish I had known about purchasing testers before now.  Who cares about the fancy box and top?  The frangrance is what counts.</li>
    <li> And so do I. This is a great scent and you can&#x27;t beat the price. So what if you are missing the decorative top. One less thing to step on on your way to the restroom!</li>
    <li> Very sweet, floral smell. The bottle was full, it just had no cap and came in a plain brown box and had a try me sticker on the bottle.  Great deal for the perfume.

The perfume itself is just to die for, it&#x27;s not too musky and not too sweet, but just the perfect combination of floral scents. The scent is strong, but not too strong that I can&#x27;t wear it on a daily basis. I also like the fact that it lasts for a long time as well, I can smell it in my hair sometimes well into the evening when I have only applied it in the morning. Overall, excellent value for a amazing perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a glorious fragrance--fruity and flowery without being sweet.  It&#x27;s long lasting, and just a little different from other fragrances of the same ilk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little overpowering when first sprayed on, but quickly ripens into the most heavenly aura. Love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I found a great deal on a tester, this one would be worth the full price!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift to me.  I&#x27;m a visual person so, I like packaging.  A TESTER bottle was sent in a brown box.  No fancy top to the bottle or pink box as shown in the picture.  Just the bottle with the writing \\&quot;tester\\&quot; on it.  I&#x27;m sure my friend would NOT have picked to send me this as a gift.  Presentation was not as advertised.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells wonderful and for a great price! Would recommend this to anyone who likes a sweet lasting scent! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I always order the \\&quot;testers\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t want to pay full price just so I can get the \\&quot;top\\&quot; of the perfume bottle (which I already have since I saved the original lid after I knew this would be my signature scent).  I am a sucker for a good deal and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> 1.7 oz juicy couture at macys is $65. 3.4 oz with amazon is $45. you do the  math ...    the scent is lovely, the price is to die for! thanks, amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the scent in this tester is perfect.To make it look nice on my dresser,I put the old bottles fancy cap on it.</li>
