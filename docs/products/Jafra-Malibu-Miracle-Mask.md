      <li>Loved it and would buy more.</li>
      <li>this one is as great as it was 45 years ago when I first started using it!  </li>
      <li>I used to love this product years ago, but this smelled kind of &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>So excited the magic of the internet means I can still get this wonderful product, and right to my door instead of through a &amp;#34;party.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
      <li>I love this mask.  </li>

      <li>OUR SKIN NEEDS IT MOST.   </li>
      <li>I read most of their mega amounts of reviews and they sound like someone from the company</li>
      <li>and so far so good now LOVE</li>
      <li>This product for the face was a very cost effective price with Amazon, as was the postage.</li>
      <li>I use to use this product back in my 20&#x27;s and it worked great.</li>
      <li>Great facial mask.</li>
      <li>Same great formula that was original decades ago.</li>
      <li>After messaging the mask in, use another hot towel to activate it even more.  </li>
      <li>but this is great and just makes my face feel clean and glowing while still knowing I am only using fun ingredients.</li>
      <li>soft supple and glowing, a nice treat.</li>
      <li>Excellent to my delicate face skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unlike any other and has a great feel and smell.  </li>
      <li>and yes it did have a distinct smell not bad though)</li>
      <li>It is slightly different from years ago when I first discovered Jafra, but still seems to be a good product.  </li>
      <li>It acts as a gentle peel if you massage it lightly into the skin.</li>
      <li>Pulls up the deepest soil and makes your skin soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>I used to use this as a teenager and now as a middle aged adult, it is great to be able to use it again.</li>
      <li>HOW WHEN WE ARE YOUNGER AND MORE PRONE TO VANITY</li>
      <li>ISNT THE FIRST TIME  </li>
      <li>FUNNY</li>
      <li>and i will be ordering my next favorite from Jafara</li>
      <li>Until recently I had not been able to find them.  </li>
      <li>YOUNG OR OLD MOST LIKELY IT WILL CALM, CLEAN, AND SCRUB YOUR SKIN CLEAN</li>
      <li>I had been impressed with the product because one of my daughters ate half a jar in 1980 and I was assured by Jafra and the Poison Control Center  that all ingredients were harmless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mask is a product I find easy to use, leaves skin looking refreshed following use.  </li>
      <li>the cost is very ecomical for me.  </li>
      <li>It really works wonders.</li>
      <li>and I really wish Amazon Prime covered this product.</li>
      <li>Getting harder to find -- so glad it&#x27;s on Amazon</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S VERY HEALING.</li>
      <li>It works really well for that purpose.  </li>
      <li>MUCH MONEY WITH THEM</li>
      <li>Need a gentle, deep-cleaning mask...</li>
      <li>It really is a &amp;#34;miracle mask.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I contacted Jafra directly to make sure the Malibu mask was the same mask I used and the was assured it</li>
      <li>Hope I will be able to findit on Amazon in the near future.</li>
      <li>Nice soft mask just a little scrubbing to remove.</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly, even during the holidays, without any extra postage.</li>
      <li>I shared the product number and they wouldn&#x27;t divulge the expiration date and only said it was fresh.</li>
      <li>This product exfoliates very well and is also gentle enough for my very sensitive and reactive skin as are all Jafra products I have used over the decades.</li>
      <li>IT APPEARS TO BE THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me for helping clear up my teenager&#x27;s acne.  </li>
      <li>Keeps pores clear.</li>
      <li>Natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>thats all natural products as I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>WE MAYBE SHOULD WAIT TO USE WHEN WE MATURE AND</li>
      <li>AND IT SMELLS ROTTON N OLD</li>
      <li>IT SEEMS OLD</li>
      <li>The real Jafra is different.</li>
      <li>I only wish the postage wasn&#x27;t so high</li>
      <li>It WILL mold if left in the shower too long, so just be aware.  </li>
      <li>but I simply used an old one or end of a teaspoon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves skin soft supple and glowing, a nice treat. Will not cure problematic skin/acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;D NEVER HAD TROUBLE WITH MY SKIN IN MY YOUTH.  FUNNY HOW WHEN WE ARE YOUNGER AND MORE PRONE TO VANITY WE SPEND MONEY AND TIME ON THINGS WE MAYBE SHOULD WAIT TO USE WHEN WE MATURE AND OUR SKIN NEEDS IT MOST.   THIS IS A MASK THAT I USED YEARS AGO.  IT&#x27;S VERY HEALING. WHEN I STARTED HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY SKIN AS A MATURE WOMAN, I WENT BACK TO IT. IT APPEARS TO BE THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT.  YOU CAN WASH WITH THIS, SCRUBBING AND EXFOLIATING AFTER LEAVING IT ON AS A MASK.  THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY BASIC. IF YOU HAVE NUT ALLERGIES YOU MAY NEED TO KNOW THERE ARE ALMONDS IN IT. IT IS NOT DRYING.  IVE NEVER HAD A NEGATIVE REACTION TO IT AFTER USING IT FOR OVER 30 YEARS. YOUNG OR OLD MOST LIKELY IT WILL CALM, CLEAN, AND SCRUB YOUR SKIN CLEAN</li>
    <li> Great facial mask. Smells wonderful! Would use it again after this one is empty. Same great formula that was original decades ago.</li>
    <li> The best mask I&#x27;ve used in 35 years. But not for the nut allergic as it is made with almonds.</li>
    <li> The Malibu Miracle Mask I bought from Quincy Cosmetics had the seal intact and on the invoice was listed as \\&quot;brand new\\&quot;. However, when I opened it and tried using it once on my face but it smelled repulsive like stinky feet. I shared the product number and they wouldn&#x27;t divulge the expiration date and only said it was fresh. The company claimed they receive Jafra items daily. I read most of their mega amounts of reviews and they sound like someone from the company writes a lot of them. I&#x27;m not planning on ordering from this company again. The real Jafra is different.</li>
    <li> SEAL WAS BROKEN WHEN I RECIEVED IT AND THIS ISNT THE FIRST TIME  I OGNORED IT AND TRIED IT ANYWAY AND IT SMELLS ROTTON N OLD SO GROSS AND THEY WONT RESPOND TO ME I SPENT S MUCH MONEY WITH THEM AND THEY CANT ANSWER ME BACK!! BE CAREFUL GUYS!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 50 years and am so happy that the company still has it. I know there are others but this is great and just makes my face feel clean and glowing while still knowing I am only using fun ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this fJafra line of products for a long time...the cost is very ecomical for me.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I use to use this product back in my 20&#x27;s and it worked great. Got it for my aging skin and to help it during chemo. Loved it and would buy more. It&#x27;s a bit costly but last for a long time only needing a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> So excited the magic of the internet means I can still get this wonderful product, and right to my door instead of through a &amp;#34;party.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA. I WILL USE IT, HOWEVER I DO NOT LIKE IT. IT SEEMS OLD</li>
    <li> I started using this years ago when they use to have jafra parties all the time. I&#x27;m glad I went online and saw this. It really works wonders.</li>
    <li> This product smells terrible.  I did try it.  After being on my face for about 15 minutes, there appeared to be silver debris in the mask.  Don&#x27;t have a clue what that is, as ingredients listing is not shown.  My face did feel softer and smoother after using it, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use again.  No expiration date. no directions, no nothing.  I will not buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Malibu Miracle Mask for years &amp; has virtually no scent. This product for the face was a very cost effective price with Amazon, as was the postage. It was shipped quickly, even during the holidays, without any extra postage. The cosmetic used to come with a tiny plastic spatula to prevent using one&#x27;s finger in the product., but I simply used an old one or end of a teaspoon.</li>
    <li> I used to use this as a teenager and now as a middle aged adult, it is great to be able to use it again. I only wish the postage wasn&#x27;t so high and I really wish Amazon Prime covered this product. Oh well. The postage is about 50% of what the product costs so you end up paying 150% of the regular price - but with no Jafra &amp;#34;salespeople&amp;#34; in my area, this is  what one must do.</li>
    <li> I see on here alot of comments on the smell...ITS THE SAME STUFF...weird how some people wil remember one thing one way and another remember comletly different anyway it was awesome then (and yes it did have a distinct smell not bad though) and so far so good now LOVE thats all natural products as I have sensitive skin and i will be ordering my next favorite from Jafara next Royal Jelly Milk Balm stuff is the Bomb!</li>
    <li> If I could give this item zero stars I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Jafra products, including the mask, in the 1980s faithfully and just loved them.  Until recently I had not been able to find them.  I contacted Jafra directly to make sure the Malibu mask was the same mask I used and the was assured it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stench was horrible when I opened the jar...it smelled like dead fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask I used smelled heavenly and invigorating: almonds and peppermint.  I had been impressed with the product because one of my daughters ate half a jar in 1980 and I was assured by Jafra and the Poison Control Center  that all ingredients were harmless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT the same product - it STINKS</li>
    <li> It is slightly different from years ago when I first discovered Jafra, but still seems to be a good product.  I guess that time will tell.</li>
    <li> This the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually clears out blackheads.  I&#x27;ve used it since my teens, and it works great!  It WILL mold if left in the shower too long, so just be aware.  Maybe use little plastic spatulas instead of your fingers to apply it.</li>
    <li> To get the best treatment, steam your face and neck w/ warm to hot towels for 10 minutes before applying.  After messaging the mask in, use another hot towel to activate it even more.  For blemishes use a q-tip, dab some on and place a bandage over it then go to bed, wake up! and it&#x27;s like a Miracle! That&#x27;s how it got it&#x27;s Miracle name!  Robaire (inside joke).</li>
    <li> I used to love this product years ago, but this smelled kind of &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;  The smell was weird enough that I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me for helping clear up my teenager&#x27;s acne.  It works really well for that purpose.  In just overnight, we could see a big difference.  Our teen&#x27;s face was clearer, smoother.  We have tried lots of other OTC products and have been to a dermatologist.  This is the best topical treatment yet.  It really is a &amp;#34;miracle mask.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Need a gentle, deep-cleaning mask...this one is as great as it was 45 years ago when I first started using it!  Pulls up the deepest soil and makes your skin soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> This mask helps in every way.  I use it along with the products that my&lt;br /&gt;dermatoligist suggests that I use.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  It&#x27;s unlike any other and has a great feel and smell.  I gives great results! will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This product exfoliates very well and is also gentle enough for my very sensitive and reactive skin as are all Jafra products I have used over the decades. I use this twice a week. Keeps pores clear.</li>
    <li> Nice soft mask just a little scrubbing to remove.</li>
    <li> I used this product along time ago and loved it.  They have changed something about it, but not sure.  Definitely alot cheaper in price and is wonderful for the face.  I have only used it twice so anxious to see how it goes and if I will re-order it or not.</li>
    <li> This mask is a product I find easy to use, leaves skin looking refreshed following use.  Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great. Been using this product for at least 30 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent to my delicate face skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for years because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used where I actually see a difference in my complexion when I take it off. It acts as a gentle peel if you massage it lightly into the skin. Natural ingredients. Getting harder to find -- so glad it&#x27;s on Amazon</li>
    <li> Same as for Hydrating Night Cream.  Found it again after many years.  Hope I will be able to findit on Amazon in the near future.</li>
    <li> Sour and old.  Returned</li>
</ol>
