<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The ceramic plates don&#x27;t come close to touching. This is a dealbreaker for me.</li>
    <li> I saw the stellar reviews for this flat iron while shopping around.  I decided to give it a try since it was so cheap.  It is very lightweight and cheaply made.  It does straighten hair ok but not to the extent that some of these reviews claim.  I thought maybe I was getting a deal but it performs just like you would expect a $40 flat iron would.  If you&#x27;re looking for high quality, don&#x27;t buy this product.  Although I do like the digital display.  The flat iron I ended up sticking with was $150 but it doesn&#x27;t have that feature.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful.  The best iron so far.</li>
    <li> Flat iron looks nice and works well. A very nice and cost effective replacement for my older, more expensive one. Like the temperature indicator as it is easily read.  Getting used to the on/off switch placement. Great price, packaging, travel case and informational inserts. Pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I like a wider plate.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I was very pleased to receive the correct item this time. The sellers were great reaching out to me. This product is great getting to the roots and for bangs. My hair felt smooth and shiny...like leaving the salon.</li>
    <li> Returned this product because the plates didn&#x27;t hold my hair.  But they gave my refund with no hassle.</li>
    <li> For the price, reviews, and the fact that I&#x27;ve owned my current straightener for 10 years now... I decided to try this one out. Compared to my Paul Mitchell straightener, which is 4x as much, this one is almost as nice. My only complaint is I find I have to go over the same section of hair 2-3 times to get the same smooth results as my other flat iron. If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable flat iron or an extra one for travel... This one is probably your best option! However, the less time I can spend on my hair, the better... So if in another 10 years I&#x27;ll need another flat iron, I&#x27;ll be purchasing a Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> It works ok, it takes awhile to get my fine hair straightened with this tool.  I am leery of turning the heat up too  high since the last flat iron(other maker) burned my hair on low settings.  While using this iron my hair gets stuck between the outer covering and the plates of this iron pulling out my hair. Not the best flat iron for the money..</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. Im african american with really thick hair and this iron does a wonderful job on my hair. I also purchased the 5-1 curling iron, but I am returning because it doesnt perform as well on my hair. Im not sure if the temperature gets as hot on the 5-1 since there isnt a temperature setting like the flat iron.</li>
    <li> This straightener rips my hair out and I can smell the hair burning on it even with a very expensive heat protectant. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Very cool looking straightner, but doesnt glide down my hair like I&#x27;d like it to. Heats up very quickly! My hair tends to get caught in the plates also.</li>
    <li> i got my flat iron on time :) it does an amazing job did my hair faster then expected  :)</li>
    <li> Heats up fast pretty good built quality the heating surface could be bigger</li>
    <li> I have purchased MANY flat irons over the years and this one is by far the best!  Heats within seconds, YES seconds!  And the digital readout shows as it&#x27;s heating up just like an oven.  You can actually hold the outside and feel no heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! Amazing for frizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;. Only thing is the thermal bag was tore</li>
    <li> This is not a great flat iron. It is not horrible but hair is not silky or straight even with high temperatures.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Gets hot quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love the design! Ingenuity at it&#x27;s finest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned and used quite a few flat-irons in my day. From the big box special to the trending beauty brand I have put many a straightener to the test. Having been blessed/cursed with thick hair, it takes a certain kind to do a complete, much less efficient job. Needless to say, many irons have been given away, sold at yard sales, and I end up back to my original iron that I know I can count on. But I think it&#x27;s met it&#x27;s match. I must say I am completely honest and unbiased in this review, as I only leave feedback that is authentic to my experience. Receiving a discount or paying a higher price does not bind me to a positive or negative response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets HOT. Hot enough I can turn it down a little when I get the thickest parts straight and I am finishing up the top layer. That&#x27;s saying something. Even better, the buttons are near the bottom so I don&#x27;t accidentally change settings or slide a knob as I&#x27;m working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly professional quality. When it generally takes 5-10 minutes to wash, 15-20 minutes to blow dry and 20-30 minutes to style, a good hot iron that can slice 10 minutes or more off of your job is a big deal. I&#x27;m down to nearly half the time straightening my locks as I&#x27;ve been used to needing for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s at least 2 less times I have to answer to my husband who wants to know if I&#x27;m ready yet.</li>
    <li> Decent, not meant for African American hair.</li>
    <li> I had been using a GHD- which was well over 200.00- it gave out after 4 years- I didn&#x27;t- can&#x27;t - spend that again- so, after reading reviews- took a shot on this. I was happy at first. I have short- wedge cut hair- fine, blond high lited. - thinning- I&#x27;m 58. I have a natural curl- but I blow dry straight. I then flat iron- this issue w this iron- it does not- smooth my hair under. - for my inverted wedge cut- it doesn&#x27;t cut it! - returning- I tried my friends iron- and it worked wonders- so I know I&#x27;m not being unreasonable.</li>
    <li> Very good , hair is great no issues. The description of product is true. Easy to setup and lightweight. Was received for review.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! I especially like being able to see the heat ramp up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last curling iron was cheap Remington and the coating had begun to wear off. Before that I had a Chi. Loved it BUT when it went bad it went bad in a dangerous way and one day when I picked it up it gave me one of the most painful shocks I have ever encountered. Yes, I threw a breaker. They scare me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fast heat, light weight and does a fabulous job with your hair!</li>
    <li> The plates on the unit that I received do not fully contact making it all but useless. There is some flexibility however so if the iron is squeezed REALLY hard you can force them together but this clearly is not optimal.</li>
    <li> This product is good but if you want a very hot iron then this is not the iron. it heats to 430 degree.  sounds hot but its not that hot.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to buy a tourmaline iron considering how much I heard about it being better for your hair. (I bleach mine about once a month). And this iron did not disappoint! It&#x27;s been a few months since I started using it and I can definitely tell my hair is healthier, shinier, and better looking. I also keep it under 350 degrees with the adjustable temp buttons. Very helpful.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this product at all!!! My hair gets caught in the corners of the plates and it pulls my hair out bad!</li>
    <li> First experience with a flat iron.  Works great, easy to handle</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best flat iron I have ever used!  The first time took a bit longer than normal because I was trying to get used to it.  After I found my ideal temp (390), it was fabulous!  I could not believe how soft my hair was.  The next day, I decided to try my old one on one side and this new one on the other.  Just like I thought......the new one made my hair much softer, again.  I experienced no hair pulling like a few reviewers claimed.  It was like my hair glided through the plates. Have I mentioned how much softer my hair feels?!  I have shoulder length, very curly hair.  Not wavy.....but curly.  This did the job in less time than the old iron AND much better.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:98cf9122dada1b8880fcc864791f12b8]] The Xtava Professional Flat Iron with Tourmaline Ceramic Plates is lightweight, has dual voltage to allow it to work domestically as well as internationally, and comes with a heat resistant storage bag, making this the perfect tool to take along when traveling. This sleek looking flat iron has 1\\&quot; fixed ceramic plates, and offers adjustable temperatures up to 430 degrees, and utilizes infrared heat to seal in moisture, prevent hair follicle damage, protect color, and deliver results 60% faster than the average flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a 9&#x27; cord which allows for plenty of range to get close to a mirror, and the unit swivels 360 degrees which is really convenient when using it. Power and temperature adjustment controls are on the inside of the handle which I found a bit more awkward to work with than the side buttons I&#x27;m accustomed to with other brands. It comes set for 350 degrees and took about 1 12 minute to get to that temperature, but when I adjusted the setting it reached the higher temperature very quickly.  It has an easy to read digital temperature display on the handle, and it&#x27;s indented, so I found the indention a convenient thumb notch to enhance my control as I worked with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paddles are 1\\&quot; so it took a bit of time to get through all of her hair, but they connected well and made good contact with her hair with each pass.  I did have to go over some places more than once, but I think I can improve that as I work with the temperature setting to learn what works best for think curly hair. The outside of the iron stayed cool to the touch, and I like the 1 hour automatic shut-off safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heat resistant storage bag comes with this flat iron which is really handy to have if you plan to take it with you when traveling because you don&#x27;t have to wait until the iron is completely cool before packing it. Basically I think this is a versatile and very useful flat iron, especially at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail sample provided for consumer product evaluation, testing, and review purposes.lly at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail sample provided for consumer product evaluation, testing, and review purposes.</li>
    <li> Its good. Its not as heavy as a chi, which could be better for you if you&#x27;d prefer a lighter iron. I personally like a heavier iron. I would not put it in the same class as a chi, but its much cheaper in price. I will use this until it stops working and probably purchase another chi.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have Xtava because it works fast and give you the best results in seconds. I can get the results I am looking for in matter for seconds and done quicker with my hair than ever before.</li>
    <li> It worked in Italy. It heats up quick and gets the job done. Not as hot as the one I use at home in the U.S. but this was the hottest one I found at a decent price. You only need an adaptor to use.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best flat iron that I have ever used. I was not familiarr with this brand but glad that I took the chance!!! The product really does exactly what it is suppose to. Heat up time is like instant!!!! You will not be dissapointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love to flat iron are hair and are always looking for a good flat iron that won&#x27;t damage our hair and will hold up longer than a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Xtava professional flat iron and I was so impressed with the packaging job. It is so nice looking and not cheap like the ones we have had in the past. This one has a 360 degree swivel and a 9 foot cord so it will reach every where I want it to go and I won&#x27;t have to worry about bending over and trying to reach all of my hair. I have very long hair and it isn&#x27;t the thickest it has always been,but it is still hard to reach since it is almost touching my rump. I love how long it is. I love the swivel that it gives you so it&#x27;s easy to move around. I loved how straight my hair got after one run through,yes one. Not a million times.&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a LCD display so it is easy to see and you can see how hot it gets . I don&#x27;t crank it up. I leave it at it&#x27;s normal temp setting because I don&#x27;t like it that warm. With that said,my daughter loves it just as much as I do,so we have to take turns on who uses it and who has to wait lol.&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased feedback and that is exactly what I have done. Do I think this is a good price?  I really do because you are getting a good quality Flat Iron,not one from a store that is cheaply made:)</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample. I love how this flat iron works, I do have a long hair. It heats fast, straightens my hair easily... I am now loving this product and discontinued using my other brand of flat iron! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This curling and straightening wand did not work that well on my hair. I had to keep running it over and over the stands of hair to try and straighten them.</li>
    <li> Not that great at all. A much lesser quality than depicted.</li>
    <li> Love how fast it heats up, but the rubber guards near the irons snags my hair all the time. Not very well designed for that.</li>
    <li> It did okay, but I had to run it over the hair a few times. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I have thin, blonde hair and it just didn&#x27;t do anything. I see a lot of people love it, but it didn&#x27;t work on my hair very well.</li>
    <li> First of all I have to mention the packaging.I have never seen a product so well packed.It was in a pouch and then placed in a hard box. I own flatiron twice as expensive as this one but still it looks more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;  It literary took less than 2 minutes to get heated.There is a display on the top of iron that shows the temperature.There are 3 buttons for power, increase temperature  and decrease temperature.I didn&#x27;t like the placement for button as it&#x27;s not easily assessable while  using the product.Power cord is very long and thick.It give enough room to move around.&lt;br /&gt;  My hair are waist length and have wavy texture.It hardly took me 15 minutes to straighten it. The iron slide easily through hair leaving them perfectly straight.I am attaching a pic of my straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I am truly impressed with the quality of product.Except for button placement every functionality is amazing. Definitely worthy of 5 stars.I got this product free of charge as part of promotional sample  for testing and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Awesome item!!!!! Took this flat iron to France and Brazil. Worked beautifully. Its looks is high quality. It allows you to control the temperature in many different levels and it slides through the hair like butter!!!!! no tugging or breakage. Love it as much as my every day Sedu.</li>
    <li> I have heavy, thick, frizzy and coarse hair. Being a mom of a toddler I do not get time to straight my hair often but whenever I do straighten my hair I want my hair to look beautiful and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I usually straighten my hair on special ocassions, birthday parties etc.&lt;br /&gt;I love Xtava prodessional Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;1st of all it is very stylish, sleek, decent and durable. It comes in an awesome packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the flat iron is perfect. It requires like effort and time as compare to other flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;It has power, heat increase and heat decrease buttons. It has a digital LCD display which shows the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;It has pretty ling cord (9 ft ) which makes is easy to use. Even though the outlet is not close by you can still use this flat iron due to its long cord.&lt;br /&gt;It has another great feature which is automatic shut off after 60 minutes. It saves your hair tool and also good for your home safety.&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron has great grip. It keeps your hand safe from burning.&lt;br /&gt;Xtava products are great and this flat iron is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I reveived this product in exchange of an unbiased opinion. However it did not effect my thoughts about it.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast. Great flat iron, less damaging to my hair than my old cheap flat iron.</li>
    <li> I received my Xtava Professional Flat Iron With Tourmaline Ceramic Plates today and instantly fell in love wit it!! It came packaged very well and was impressed with the nice carrying case I found the hair straightener in.  Turning on the straightener and heating it up to the desired temp of 430 degrees,  took only a minute (if that.) It straightened my wavy, thick hair very quickly compared to other irons I&#x27;ve used in the past. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. I am very pleased with this product and will be recommending Xtava products to friends and family!</li>
    <li> From my very first impression after opening the package, I was head over heels for this flat iron.  First off it is very sleek looking.  It comes with a thermal heat resistant pouch.  This may not seem like a big deal, however,  it only takes one time of having a still too hot flat iron melt your expensive lipsticks all over your expensive luggage to realize that a heat resistant pouch is a necessity.  It has a very long cord which really comes in handy. I was totally amazed at how fast this flat iron heated up.  I&#x27;m used to plugging in my old flat iron, going to do other things, and coming back to it ready for use.  Not so with XTAVA professional flat iron.  It seemed like before I could make it to the other end of the bathroom it was fully heated to 350 (its factory setting). You can literally watch on the digital display climb as the irons temperature heats up.  As I used it I noticed that it is very lightweight.  And the icing on the cake was how well it straightened my daughters thick curly hair.  Not only did it straighten it well, but with ease and quickly!  I absolutely love this flat iron!  I&#x27;d give this flat iron many more than 5 stars if given the opportunity.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing in exchange for my opinion and review. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other way.</li>
    <li> WOW! As soon as I opened the box I knew this flat iron would put all others to shame. It is very impressive. It comes in a lavish thermal heat insulation bag. I was very excited about using this iron because it has a digital LCD temperature display with variable temperature setting from 250F to 430F so I can adjust the heat according to how I want to style my hair. I really liked the extra long cord. It&#x27;s nice to be able to move around and have that flexibility with a 360 degree swivel base and 9 foot long cord. Also it has ceramic tourmaline plates for silky smooth straight hair every time you use it, no matter how kinky you hair may be. I would have to say this is one amazing styling tool. What I feel is the best feature of all is a 60 minutes sleep mode for safety. Now I never have to worry once I&#x27;ve left the house, &amp;#34;oh no, did I remember to unplug the flat iron&amp;#34;. I was chosen to test and review this complimentary flat iron and I must say I am very impressed. It has everything you want in a styling tool. Definitely high quality, top of line product and I would highly recommend this flat iron to any one who wants the best.</li>
    <li> I really loved this straightener❤️ money that is definitely used wisely if you ask me👌</li>
    <li> Just ordered this a couple days ago; as soon as I received it in the mail, I plugged it in and it would not even turn on! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST Flat Iron I have ever used! Xtava Professional Flat Iron heats up fast and stays cool to the touch so I am sure to get maximum straight! There are multiple heat levels for all different textures of hair. Not only is the flat iron made well, but the thermo bag it comes in and even the storage box rock my socks! I did receive this product for an honest unbias review... And I Highly recommend Xtava Professional Flat Iron to anyone who is trying to rock the straighter than straight look! I just cut my daughters hair and my fat flat iron was just making the whole thing uncomfortable. But Xtava came at the right time because now I can do my daughters hair with a breeze. It is a company for women by women and I totally appreciate that! Thanks Xtava! Dont miss out on this awesome flat iron... you will surely regret it if you do!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need... I have thick hair and it can handle a lot at once!</li>
    <li> I used others reviews to decide which straightner to purchase.  I am so impressed with this straightner, because I have thick, curly hair.  With my previous flat iron, it would straighten the hair but would catch my hair in the plates.  And if I braided my hair or twisted it up, it would be wavy again.  This flat iron takes care of both problems.  I like the power button being on the inside of the iron, so I don&#x27;t accidently turn it off when I am using it.  So the other reviewer were correct.  This is a great flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very nice iron for the price. Heats up really fast. I&#x27;ve never used expensive ones but a friend that borrowed this one from me said asked where I got it bc she likes it better than her Chi. Only wish is that it had a memory so when you turned it on it would go the setting you use. It defaults to 350 whenever you turn it on and I use 300 on my fine hair so it&#x27;s kind of annoying to have to turn it down each time. I had a cheaper one than this that had a memory so I figured this one would, too.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this hair straightener! It is a fraction of the cost of higher end  hair straighteners that some of her friends have used. My daughter has medium body hair, with a slight wave. It is long , down to her mid back. She is terrified of curling irons because she&#x27;s afraid of burning her head. She was very hesitant to try this product, however when she noticed how cool the outside was , it eased her fears. She also liked that she could adjust the temperature to her liking. It actually has an LCD lit panel with a temperature gauge. There are buttons on the inside of the product to lower or raise the temperature to your liking. Based on the detailed instructions provided, my daughter chose 300° for her hair. The XTAVA hair straightener worked flawlessly. It heated up to 350° in less than two minutes. We lowered The temperature, and my daughter went to work. We noticed an immediate difference and her hair was definitely straightened. This is a great product to have around for days when she would like to straighten her hair, or use it with friends. The XTAVA hair straightener comes beautifully packaged in a box, and inside the box it comes in its own carrying case. This would be perfect for a gift for any tween age or are young lady looking for a hair straightener. We were given the opportunity to test and try this product in our home, and we are completely satisfied with this purchase. We  recommend this product to anyone looking for a hair straightener that works, with quality construction.  March 2015: Still love the straightener and my daughter gets a lot of compliments on her hair. We have decided that 350 degrees is best for her.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron that comes in a very handy lined bag.  It heats almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t scorch hair.  The price is excellent--this a a professional quality flat iron at an affordable consumer price.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this flat iron. It smoothed away my frizz wonderfully and leaves my hair nice and soft. The packaging is also a huge plus. Very nice presentation</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair that is naturally wavy and I was very disappointed with this straighter. I bought it based off of the reviews and the price because i wasn&#x27;t trying to spend a ton of money on another straighter but i wish i would have just splurged because now i wasted money. I had my other straighter for 5 years and it finally pooped out on me which is the only reason i was looking for a new one (that particular one costs about $130). This straighter leaves waves in my hair even with going over the same section more than once, and pulls hair out as well.  Save yourself the money/disappointment and buy a different straighter.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly,doesn&#x27;t pull at the hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the money but the reviews were correct about the plates not closing all the way together except for at the end. This causes it to pull my hair and it&#x27;s obviously a bit uncomfortable. It does heat up quick and straightens hair well if done in bigger chunks.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b7815e3bdf7a933e6b455a60dec3bb71]]Very easy to hold in my hand without fear of burning myself. The flat iron heats up quickly and keeps a consistent temperature. The flat iron has a display that shows the exact temperature also, and it is very easy to read. I have never burned myself using this to straighten my hair, which most flat irons give me problems and plenty of burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is perfect, very sleek and the buttons are hidden on the inside of the professional flat iron. The reason I love the button placement is because I don&#x27;t have to worry about my fingers accidentally touching the button and increasing or decreasing the temperature. GREAT design in my opinion, I have never found a flat iron as perfect as this one! My hair is shiny and straight in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is also very long and I am able to move around my bathroom without having to stand as close to an outlet as possible. The flat iron comes with a heat resistant bag, which also has a wrist strap or could even be used to hang from a hook in the bathroom. Perfect for travel! I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with it. I don&#x27;t have thick or coarse hair and I still have to use highest setting for it to straighten. It also pulls on my hair. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I&#x27;m thinking of returning it.  Susana from texss</li>
    <li> Coming from 150-200$ straighteners I love this! I have thick curly hair and this makes it straight like my old chi did. Perfect!</li>
    <li> *******ADDENDUM- I JUST DISCOVERED THAT ALL 3 BUTTONS DO NOT WORK- ONLY THE FIRST ONE WHICH ONLY HEATS TO 350 DEGREES. ATTEMPTED TO RETURN AND OF COURSE I AM 3 DAYS TOO LATE TO RETURN THIS - THIS IS JUNK- BEWARE</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron shipped fast</li>
