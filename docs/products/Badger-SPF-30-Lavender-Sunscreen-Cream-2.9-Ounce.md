      <li>Great EWG rating and smells great!</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen</li>
      <li>Great fragrance.</li>
      <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>
      <li>This was for sure the best.</li>
      <li>but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Good protection.</li>
      <li>Works well, nice smell</li>
      <li>This product kept me from getting any kind tan or burn so it worked as advertised.</li>
      <li>The lavender kind smoothies on more easily than the original kind.</li>
      <li>so many sunscreens contain harmful and toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff for my kids.</li>
      <li>The iron in our well water reacts with the avobenzone in most sunscreens and leaves horrid orange stains on our clothes after they are washed.</li>
      <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love the lavender smell.</li>
      <li>However my husband doesn&#x27;t like it because he has a lot of hair on his arms and legs and it doesn&#x27;t rub in easily for him.</li>
      <li>It seems effective and causes no reaction except at first with me.</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t go on smooth like a lotion.</li>
      <li>Smells good, all natural and keeps me from getting burned.  </li>
      <li>since our skin is our largest organ whatever we put on it affects us tremendously.</li>
      <li>Am sure it&#x27;ll be as good as my previous purchase as they are a high quality mfg!</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Have used Badger in the past and found it the most effective sunscreen for my Scottish heritage fair skin; this was purchased for inventory as I live in Oregon where just haven&#x27;t needed to open it yet this year.</li>
      <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
      <li>Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
      <li>Shipment was extremely fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s high ranking by the Enviromental working Group.</li>
      <li>What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>
      <li>Same white film on my daughter&#x27;s clothes but easily washes out.</li>
      <li>Nothing like a brand new summer white shirt going into the laundry stainless and coming out orange!</li>
      <li>Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
      <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
      <li>Great idea but bad product.</li>
      <li>So far, I have only used this on my face (before applying makeup) and neck</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is all natural.  </li>

    <li> My husband and I both use it.  It seems effective and causes no reaction except at first with me.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen I am a car salesman who spends a lot of time on lot. This product kept me from getting any kind tan or burn so it worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell, it is rather thick. So far, I have only used this on my face (before applying makeup) and neck and I mix it was a LITTLE bit of organic unrefined coconut oil and it thins it just enough.</li>
    <li> Have used Badger in the past and found it the most effective sunscreen for my Scottish heritage fair skin; this was purchased for inventory as I live in Oregon where just haven&#x27;t needed to open it yet this year.

    <li> Thick and rich&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect under the sunny weather</li>
    <li> I went to a local store and tried about 10 different types of sunblock. This was for sure the best. I love the lavender smell.</li>
    <li> I ranked this high due to it&#x27;s high ranking by the Enviromental working Group. since our skin is our largest organ whatever we put on it affects us tremendously. so many sunscreens contain harmful and toxic chemicals. This one does not and has the added plus of a wonderful lavender smell.  Goes on white due to the zinc oxide but that rubs in.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my kids. It&#x27;s non toxic so I trust it on their skin. I even bought a bottle for my Dad after he had done cancer spots removed. A little bit of this goes a long way. Don&#x27;t be scared off by the price. You only need a small amount because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
    <li> Freshness is a priority in any mix with oil so insure to check the expiration date. The new mix containers come with tag on top left corner when the old ones do not.

What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time.

If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes.

    <li> Pros: Great EWG rating and smells great! Cons: VERY thick and greasy. I needed to wash my hands after applying. Left a white film on our stroller.  Same white film on my daughter&#x27;s clothes but easily washes out.</li>
    <li> I work outside and felt like the Badger Balm gave me the sun protection I needed. It&#x27;s a thick cream with a light lavender fragrance. I bought one for my husband; one for myself; and one to share.</li>
    <li> Smells good, all natural and keeps me from getting burned.  Do wash it off as soon as you come inside, as it will clog your pores since it is a barrier/mineral sunscreen.</li>
    <li> A little thick to apply. Good protection.</li>
    <li> Horribly greasy and thick sunscreen.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is all natural.  I will not be using this product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen leaves an annoying white tint that is hard to rub out and the lovely scent attracts flies.</li>
    <li> Turned my family ghost face. It won&#x27;t rub in and won&#x27;t wash off. Great idea but bad product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. The lavender kind smoothies on more easily than the original kind. I use this type exclusively. However my husband doesn&#x27;t like it because he has a lot of hair on his arms and legs and it doesn&#x27;t rub in easily for him.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Shipment was extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. No harmful chemicals.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works well, nice smell</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen because I have a well. The iron in our well water reacts with the avobenzone in most sunscreens and leaves horrid orange stains on our clothes after they are washed. Nothing like a brand new summer white shirt going into the laundry stainless and coming out orange! This did not stain, so I am very happy with it. It is rather difficult to apply. It I doesn&#x27;t go on smooth like a lotion. It&#x27;s difficult to rub in and you look a bit pale before it gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> Very thick but I&#x27;m not convinced it works well as we all got burnt on a 40-minute snorkel excursion.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen with a great lavender scent!</li>
