### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think in a Medium it might be perfect.</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>It fits great, maintaining your posture and it is not bulky so it hides well underneath clothing.</li>
      <li>Plus gives me great cleavage.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Lol The shaper is comfortable</li>
      <li>I am a 34B ( before) and a 34DD now, this fits fine around but my cup size after surgery is just too large, if I were still a 34B it would have been perfect.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s helping me for better posture</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>I can wear anything cute top for the summer.</li>
      <li>The bra / shaper is very well made, I think its a good product I wrote this review to give others an idea of the size.</li>
      <li>This is comfortable for me and is a reminder to correct my posture.</li>
      <li>I think this would work great if you&#x27;re tiny busted.</li>
      <li>Both are effective but a smaller size would be more comfortable.</li>
      <li>It is NOT The Original Bustline Shaper, as advertised.</li>
      <li>It has support and width in all the right places.</li>
      <li>The price was right.</li>
      <li>Love the extra support and boost it gives.  </li>
      <li>It works well and is not uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a DD and overflow to the point of looking funny shaped.</li>
      <li>This product arrived in plastic packaging, had a really cheesy model on the front that looked like a porn star, and was dollar store quality at best.</li>
      <li>The straps can be moved to create a better posture but it does hurt to wear it when you change the strap position but that discomfort keeps you aware to maintain your back straight.  </li>
      <li>I think I might try it again in the winter with large sweaters.</li>
      <li>This was a cheap version of the actual &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; Product.</li>
      <li>This shaper is very well constructed.</li>
      <li>Increases bust size and makes you look much perkier.  </li>
      <li>but it sure did give me a big time lift only thing</li>

    <li> i bought it to help with posture , but was not very helpfull for that.</li>
    <li> Cut off circulation​ and I ended up with sore shoulder and breasts.</li>
    <li> Shipped within 24 hours and made it all the way to the West coast within a few days!  It was a little loose on me, but  does not pinch and is not uncomfortable at at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s whatever find something else not really good</li>
    <li> I do not understand why it states that helps to posture support, BIG LIE, It just pushes up your breast</li>
    <li> It fits great, maintaining your posture and it is not bulky so it hides well underneath clothing. The straps can be moved to create a better posture but it does hurt to wear it when you change the strap position but that discomfort keeps you aware to maintain your back straight.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Does the job but really uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Purchase this because I thought it would help with improving my posture.  It is pretty uncomfortable!</li>
    <li> I think this would work great if you&#x27;re tiny busted. I&#x27;m a DD and overflow to the point of looking funny shaped. Lol The shaper is comfortable I think I might try it again in the winter with large sweaters.</li>
    <li> This is comfortable for me and is a reminder to correct my posture. The price was right. So glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> Great product but wish it was made a little smaller for smaller thinner sizes.</li>
    <li> Definately lifts you up and helps with the support.  Increases bust size and makes you look much perkier.  Good product.</li>
    <li> it didnt help at all didnt make any difference. We wasted money on this bad product. You shouldnt be selling it.</li>
    <li> I am a 34B ( before) and a 34DD now, this fits fine around but my cup size after surgery is just too large, if I were still a 34B it would have been perfect. I found it tight on the biggest setting. I wear (3/5) S Walmart T-shirt from Jrs / misses so I am small around, size 4 pants, but the small, was what I would have expected an XS to fit. I think in a Medium it might be perfect. The bra / shaper is very well made, I think its a good product I wrote this review to give others an idea of the size. I am too lazy to send things back so I just might gift it to a pal, or take it to the 2nd hand shop.</li>
    <li> This shaper is very well constructed. It has support and width in all the right places. It&#x27;s invisible under my shirt. It increased the size of my breasts. I&#x27;m ~30GG and bought both medium and small sizes. Both are effective but a smaller size would be more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use as a posture correcter. It works well and is not uncomfortable. Plus gives me great cleavage. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was a cheap version of the actual &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; Product. It is NOT The Original Bustline Shaper, as advertised. I&#x27;ve seen the actual one, as a friend of mine just recently bought one. It&#x27;s in a different box and packaging than this. This product arrived in plastic packaging, had a really cheesy model on the front that looked like a porn star, and was dollar store quality at best. It was also too small and VERY uncomfortable, creating lines and creases where the wiring dug into my skin.</li>
    <li> Not as well made as I had hoped  &amp; it runs smaller than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> I like it! But I wish it don&#x27;t show the back that way I can wear anything cute top for the summer.</li>
    <li> Love the extra support and boost it gives.  Will need to buy one in black now.  Little tight under the arms so won&#x27;t wear everyday but i do like it alot.</li>
    <li> It fits well I don&#x27;t wear it every day but it sure did give me a big time lift only thing it hurts a little under the arms but it works well</li>
    <li> Way too small!!! There is no larger sizes :(</li>
    <li> I like it. I wear it Mon to fri. I think it&#x27;s helping me for better posture</li>
    <li> Item verses Size chart seems off. I ordered a small and unless your a negative 0 it might fit.</li>
