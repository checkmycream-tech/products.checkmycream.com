    <li> Love this stuff! Works great with my scalp.</li>
    <li> AWAKEN TREATMENT IS SO EXCELLENT FOR CANCER PATIENTS LIKE MYSELF TO HELP HAIR GROW EASILY.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS EASY TO USE, NOT GREASY  AND KEEPS HAIR SOFT. MUST USE TWICE A DAY !!!</li>
    <li> Works! And, makes my hair have more body and look fuller and better. I actually get compliments all the time after I use this product. I apply it after I dry my hair, and on days when I don&#x27;t wash. Love the way it makes my hair look and feel and the growth it generates.</li>
    <li> Hopefully it did some good</li>
    <li> I have used it and don&#x27;t notice any difference.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The product needs more time to work than the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve tried it!</li>
    <li> I bought this, along with the shampoo and conditioner, from the salon I work at, as a Father&#x27;s Day present. My dad has psoriasis of the scalp. Now, the reason I&#x27;m reviewing, is that I was advised to use the treatment on a bleach burn I received from using bathroom cleaners. It festered for over a week, until I used the treatment. After 2 uses, only a small mark remains.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing these products from my hair salon.  I have very fine hair and have areas of very thin hair.  This product has been very effective in treating these problems.  The shampoo &amp; conditioner is wonderful .  It smells nice and keeps you hair light and healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down like some products.  I was very happy when I found these products on-line at 1/2 the price I was paying .</li>

    <li> Bee using this product for two/three years and it works but not on everyone.</li>
    <li> Have used this several times and always see consistent growth of hair.  This is an excellent product and it always arrives promptly after I order.</li>

    <li> Love all the Surface Awaken products! Definitely works for thin hair! I have a gluten sensitivity &amp; I love that their products are gluten free/organic.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few months to help correct a bald spot in my hair due to a prescription drug I was using to correct a dry patch in my scalp.  Have been very pleased with the result.  It&#x27;s a slow process but hair is definitely growing back.  The price on Amazon is about $6.00 cheaper than what I was paying at my salon.</li>
    <li> i am thrilled to see new hair growth. i use this with surface awaken shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Shampoo / Cond. I&#x27;ve used it for almost two months now . It&#x27;s seemed to have made my shedding worse . Don&#x27;t buy these products!</li>
    <li> It really does work! I have new hair growth, but be prepared, it took about 6 weeks. Dues not mess up your style.</li>

    <li> Recommended by stylist for my hereditary thinning hair and hair loss.  She said use it for at least a month and you will see new hair growth. Surprisingly, because it sounded too good to be true, about 30 days in I have extensive new hair growth in the bald spots AND all over my crown where my hair was visibly thinning. I used it twice daily along with the shampoo and conditioner set that goes with it. Nice fragrance, no weighting down of hair and no oily or sticky scalp or hair residue after applying the daily treatment serum. I have extreme skin sensitivity and thus far no negative reaction, and that&#x27;s amazing!! Best cosmetic investment I have made.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. My hair is thining and I did not experience re growth. Maybe it would work better for a man.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any new hair growth and used it regularly as they directed.</li>
    <li> Very nice feels great th have hair solution growing my hair</li>
