      <li>You do however have to make sure you rub it everywhere because I notice if I miss a spot on his leg</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s should work for most anyone else too.</li>
      <li>did absolutely nothing for the bugs and wasn&#x27;t all that great for the sun either.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Another advantage is being able to carry just one bottle instead of two or three on your outdoor excursions.</li>
      <li>ok.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing it now for fleas although I&#x27;m not 100% sure it is what&#x27;s keeping them off my lower body</li>
      <li>and we intend to buy more.</li>
      <li>This product keeps mosquitoes away but doesn&#x27;t have the smell of so many repellents.</li>
      <li>Love it going to order more soon</li>
      <li>It has a very nice scent and it protects very well.</li>

      <li>Kind of pricey , but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Smells very good and rubs on easily, but I don&#x27;t think it protects like regular SPF 30.</li>
      <li>The lotion was easy to carry and did not come unopened when tossed about.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn when applied to my face and the smell isn&#x27;t toooo strong</li>

      <li>Avon Bug Guard Plus lets you enjoy the outdoors without getting a sunburn or being tormented by mosquitoes.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the Avon SSS Bug Guard Plus IR3535 SPF 30 Cool &#x27;n Fabulous Disappearing Color...</li>
      <li>The pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies, and their scientists seem helpless against these tiny, cute monsters!  :)</li>
      <li>this is great for adults and kids and isn&#x27;t chemical harsh the way many others are.</li>

      <li>In these areas they are full of insects.</li>
      <li>You do need to remember to apply it to your torso and arms as well for full protection.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one less thing to put on me and my son and works great.</li>
      <li>The little no see ums and mosquitoes just love to bite me, but by using this product and Amazon&#x27;s Bug Bands, I am safe!  </li>
      <li>Maybe, it is only 40% effective on no-see-ums..</li>
      <li>overall I liked this product for its multi-purpose-ness.</li>
      <li>glad I can use it on my young kid as well...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> best product on the market</li>
    <li> that s what we need, great product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful mosquito repellent</li>
    <li> Avon Bug Guard Plus lets you enjoy the outdoors without getting a sunburn or being tormented by mosquitoes.  The price was outstanding for a relatively hard to find product.  It was delivered so soon I thought it was something else that I had ordered earlier.</li>
    <li> Mosquitos weren&#x27;t deterred</li>
    <li> Last year I had gone on a fishing trip with my husband to Wisconsin. Around the rivers there are thick woods. In these areas they are full of insects. We went in the summertime, and there were millions of these tiny gnat like bugs that bit me all over. I was practically eaten alive and miserable. I was sitting next to the river and a guy who owned a summer home nearby couldn&#x27;t help but see me in all my frustrations and misery, came to my rescue with Avon&#x27;s SSS Bug Guard. I had never tried it before and he came like an angel and let me put some on. I couldn&#x27;t believe that as soon as I had it on, not a single insect came near me! Not just the biting gnats but no other insect either! I was completely in peace and bug free for about 2-4 hours. You have to re-apply it. It is great stuff, and that&#x27;s why now if I go back to those woods in Wisconsin I never will go without this product. It is very necessary for me. That&#x27;s why I ordered this on Amazon, but I ordered two bottles because it is a smaller bottle than I expected. It only comes in a 4 oz. bottle, so 2 bottles would add up to 8 oz. Maybe they make them small, so you can travel easily with it. Then I understand. For travel the size is perfect. Anyway, this product is guarenteed to work. Even I would use it at my own home in the summer evenings when the mosquitoes come out to party on people! I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product and I ordered it over a week ago and paying a fortune for the expedited shipping and I didn&#x27;t get it on time so I went on my trip without it.</li>
    <li> great dual use cream!</li>
    <li> Overly priced for such a small product.</li>
    <li> We are in the midst of a sunny and hot holiday weekend (4th of July) in hot and VERY BUGGY Minnesota. We participated in numerous outdoor activities with our friends, from kayaking the chain of beautiful lakes inside Minneapolis, to spending a day on a pontoon on a private lake with other groups. We used this lotion at the onset of each day&#x27;s activities and it seemed to work well for very many hours without a need to re-apply, even though we were playing on or in water all day, every day. I neglected to apply it to my shins for the kayaking event, and I was sunburned below the knees (my bad planning, as I was expecting a different kayak design than we rented and the opening exposed my lower legs to the sun). I did not have sunburn anywhere that I applied the lotion. The next day and night, when playing at a private lake outside the Twin Cities, the bugs were more plentiful than I have (almost) ever seen, probably due to an excessively wet season here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Bug deterrant is a #1 conversation here, where the mosquitoes can strip you of at least 10 pounds of unwanted (along with your essential) flesh per hour if you are not slathered in DEET and gasping for breath and dying along with the bugs you hope to deter. Anyway, after several days and evening in the great outdoors, after using this Avon lotion, I came away with only TWO bug bites, and I think my partner (who also used this Avon lotion), had none.  Our friends and companions, who did not use this lotion, were ravaged by bugs early and had to run, screaming and swatting, to the house in retreat as soon as the sun set. The lotion was easy to carry and did not come unopened when tossed about. A smaller &#x27;hole&#x27; design in the bottle that could be clipped on with a small caribeaner (spelling??) would have been nice.  You have to shake the bottle to mix the ingredients before applying. It rubs on smoothly and seems to absorb and stay on without a mess, although you will be able to feel it on yourskin until you shower it off. We were not aware of any side effects of using it, although we are both somewhat have a sensitivity to strong odors or scents, and we would give this a 5 if it had much less odor. That said, the smell of this lotion is much less offensive than other bug sprays that have made me sick in my lifetime. Another advantage is being able to carry just one bottle instead of two or three on your outdoor excursions. THAT is probably why we made it through the weekend with less sunburn and bug bites than our friends. They were applying lotions, one or the other, throughout the day. I am thinking that this might be a good gift to buy for our friends. Most importantly, combining lotion functions into fewer lotions uses less planetary resources and creates less pollution than producing only one-function lotions.  If the packaging was made from renewable resources and used renewable energy for manufacturing, plus if the bottle was 100% bio-degradable, I would rate the product a 10 and would buy stock in the company. Is anybody listening?</li>
    <li> i have lived in the humid , hot and bug infested south my whole life. This stuff is excellent, especially for kids going to summer camp and the beach/vacation. Essentially it is two products in one and it works. It is mostly water resistant and you should reapply it if you or your child goes swimming but it really repels bugs, and knats and keeps you from getting sunburnt. As far as I know, Avon is the only cosmetic company with such a product. Kind of pricey , but worth every penny. A southern mainstay , helps the nasty summer be a little less nasty....</li>
    <li> I like that it makes your skin soft while at the same time repelling gnats and mosquitos. It’s a good product.</li>
    <li> no. this is suntan lotion with bug repellent. not really what i was looking for. have not used it so product may be fine</li>
    <li> I bought this Bug Guard Plus to protect my daughter from Mosquito Bites in the Rockaways. needless to say she had bites all over her body after a day out. I prefer the Avon SSS Bug Guard Plus IR3535 SPF 30 Cool &#x27;n Fabulous Disappearing Color...It even helped with Nigerian mosquitos.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time and as described though</li>
    <li> Mosquitos love my daughter, and she is a scratcher and was getting scars.  Now, we put this on every other day or so and, if she isn&#x27;t in the water, it works.  The scent is rather strong, but that&#x27;s the price of no deet.  We reapply before she goes swimming.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is okay as a sunscreen but it didn&#x27;t deter any bugs from me. I was still all bit up and had bugs flying around me. If you need bug spray then just do off/deet.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought two of these since it has both sunscreen and bug repellent.  It smells much better than Off! too.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our 4-year old granddaughter to use when going outside during the summer months.  We didn&#x27;t want to use anything with \\&quot;deet\\&quot; in it.  The Avon Bug Guard and Sunscreen worked great.  No chigger bites.  No ticks.  No sunburns.  Smells ok.  Great purchase and we intend to buy more.</li>
    <li> This product keeps mosquitoes away but doesn&#x27;t have the smell of so many repellents. So far, it has worked well.</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful that this would work for me, but sadly it does not. Feels good, smells nice, but the mosquitos still came and bit.</li>
    <li> Stuff works great. You dont need much to go a long way</li>
    <li> overall I liked this product for its multi-purpose-ness. so much easier to have repellent and sunscreen in one, than to carry multiple products around in your beach bag.</li>
    <li> Love this product for every one in my family . I put on myself and my kids every day I love bug repellent it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and lives up to what it says. works</li>
    <li> In Bangkok with no problems. Great sun screen, I haven&#x27;t had to swat one bug and the smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> My kids were constantly getting bitten by mosquitos.  Once I used the lotion they have not gotten bitten once. In addition, the smell of the lotion is nice.  It is also a benefit that the lotion has and SPF of 30.  Great product!!!  And the price was great too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s greasless and protects against the sun and bugs.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> We took this stuff to Africa &amp; never got bitten once! Amazing!</li>
    <li> This lotion really works.  At sunset the bugs are out and the little bites are worse the next day, so I use this lotion and it truly keeps the ticks off and the flying insects away.</li>
    <li> when I need a more natural approach to bug protection and a little spf, this is what I choose. I feel good about using it on my kids in the GA summers. Keeps the tiny tiger mosquitos away but protects them from the sun too.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time when needed when we play golf. Really works and keeps the bugs away, Highly recommened it.</li>
    <li> Love it going to order more soon</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The smell is nice and not overpowering, but best of all it really works. It works better than Off and Cutter.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. I have on occasion ran out and tried other products. I keep coming back to skin so soft. It does what you want and doesn&#x27;t have an oder.</li>
    <li> This bug repellent is the best and I use it on our 3-year-old and our 10-month-old. It has a very nice scent and it protects very well. It also has 30 SPF, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about using repellent and another spf. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love the combined sunscreen and bug repellent.  It&#x27;s one less thing to put on me and my son and works great.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and smells great</li>
    <li> Combination of bug guard and sun protection was just what I needed</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago when my kids went to boy scout camp. They are over 30 now, so you know it has to be great if I&#x27;m still using it. I love the concept of sunscreen and bug repellant. It&#x27;s one less thing you need to pack. I now carry a bottle in my car, so if I go to a baseball game I have protection from sun and the bugs. I have very sensitive skin, so if I can use it it&#x27;s should work for most anyone else too. Huge plus is that you don&#x27;t stink like normal bug spray.</li>
    <li> Seems to work but as soon as I put it on I wanted to go wash it off! Might be better when the weather is less muggy.</li>
    <li> Works great.was skeptical about Avon lotion, but this product has saved me from one nasty bites.....glad I can use it on my young kid as well...even husband trusts it</li>
    <li> It usually takes me about 5 minutes outside before I&#x27;m burned to a crisp by the sun and eaten alive by bugs.  I&#x27;m hypersensitive to bug bites and tend to swell up quite a bit, so when I had to attend a birthday party in July in a state park in Florida, I went out and bought this.  I didn&#x27;t have one single bug bite!  Nor did I get a sunburn.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really bad reaction to big bites and she was getting so many bites during the week didn&#x27;t know what to do.  This product has been great because it has both the SPF and bug repellent in it!</li>
    <li> fast shipping. I works like a charm in FL!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;m wearing it now for fleas although I&#x27;m not 100% sure it is what&#x27;s keeping them off my lower body but I know I&#x27;m no longer getting attacked on my legs but my poor wrist and back!! Best purchase ever though cause it has sunscreen in it! Too bad it&#x27;s tiny but I will get more! I need this when I travel to the southeast to keep the Mosquitos away they are horrible there! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Peels off after application.</li>
    <li> Deet doesn&#x27;t keep the bugs away from&lt;br /&gt;My 1.5 year old son but this does!! It&#x27;s a miracle. You do however have to make sure you rub it everywhere because I notice if I miss a spot on his leg the Mosquitos will get him there. Smells great tol</li>
    <li> Summers in mosquito ridden sun shining areas can not be without this product. It works great!</li>
    <li> I went out this weekend not one bug bite. Will use this all the time when i am outside no deet</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and sent it to him on work assignment. He was complaining about the mosquitoes eating him alive even though he had been religiously applying OFF. I said, well DUH, everyone know that Avon makes the best bug repellent. He thought I was nuts so I sent it to him to prove otherwise. He LOVED it. He said he applied it first thing in the morning and it lasted all day. He saw mosquitoes, but they never landed on him.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product . We live in Dominican Republic where there are a lot of mosquitoes. My 3 year old daughter needs to be protected always.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t say enough about it, worked on mosquitoes and flies for me when I applied it to my skin, has a nice smell also :-)</li>
    <li> This product works for me as I seem to get bit by everything that flies in the summer...when the sun is the strongest. It doesn&#x27;t burn when applied to my face and the smell isn&#x27;t toooo strong</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you can&#x27;t put this one too thick but it does give me sun protection and bug protection</li>
    <li> I used it when fishing yesterday, no-see-ums still bit me. Thanks god, not all of them!  :)  It does not work really! Maybe, it is only 40% effective on no-see-ums.. At least, not on the Floridian ones!  The pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies, and their scientists seem helpless against these tiny, cute monsters!  :)</li>
    <li> I still need a insect repellant.</li>
    <li> Works great, but adult son says it stinks; what can I say?</li>
    <li> Works great here in Florida in the summer time.</li>
    <li> I am a long term fan of the Avon bug guard...it does the job and smells great also</li>
    <li> I love the  way this product  serves three purposes: bug guard, SPF 30 sun protection, and moisturizer  My main purpose in purchasing it was as a bug repentant for when we go to the Berkshires mountains. I do not like using bug repellent sprays because I feel the poison can be easily inhaled. This product is perfect since it&#x27;s a lotion; no spraying required. Love it  and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I used to get eaten alive by mosquitos and bugs while camping until this summer when I started using this Avon product.  I was skeptical at first.  But after spending four days in Sequoia National Park in July and leaving with only a couple of bites, I am now convinced that this product actually works.  Being a sunscreen is also a big plus.  Great product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this is a very easy way to get avon products.</li>
    <li> This works great to repel mosquito bites. This one is not greasy, like some others might be when you put it on.</li>
    <li> We bought this for travel to Honduras where the biting &amp;#34;no-see-ums&amp;#34; are vicious.  This worked well at repelling them and the smell was much more pleasant than DEET spray.  You do need to remember to apply it to your torso and arms as well for full protection.  I think I will buy a spray version next time to make it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> After research bought this item to use with my at the time 6 month old baby. We were going to the Caribbean and needed something to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;br /&gt;I researched the ingredients to help determine the effects it would have on my baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to say it worked well. Did not even need to apply every 2 hours as it&#x27;s suggested recommended use. I applied more like every 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using in the USA and it has been working great.&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to apply to ALL areas. I forgot to apply to her neck and behind her ear one evening when we were going for a walk and needless to say she got bitten in those areas. Thank God though it wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has a similar need.</li>
    <li> Good stuff to use here in north Texas, the West Nile Virus capital of the world.  Protects against both the sun and the mosquitos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and was very satisfied.  I ordered this sunblock and another Avon sunblock from another seller.  When this product arrived, the expiration date listed is January (01) 2014.  I contacted this seller who said \\&quot;all products came new from Avon.\\&quot;  The seller then sent a second email stating the product \\&quot;has an expiration date of June (06) 2014.\\&quot;  I wrote back informing the seller the other Avon product I purchased from another seller has an expiration date of February (02) 2015.  I&#x27;ve asked the seller to replace this product with one that has an expiration date of longer than one year and to provide a label so I can send the current product back.  Will update with seller reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller who \\&quot;wanted to make this right\\&quot;  has replied per below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It is brand new if you not happy just return it bak than I will refund the money, also please can you also remove the feedback because it not thing wrong with your order , thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, it is not worth the money to return this to the seller at my expense.  I will not order from this seller again.  The review will remain so that others know my experience with this seller.</li>
    <li> I was looking for sunscreen + bug repellent solutions for a trip to central america.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did absolutely nothing for the bugs and wasn&#x27;t all that great for the sun either.</li>
    <li> Smells very good and rubs on easily, but I don&#x27;t think it protects like regular SPF 30. I found myself burning so I quickly switched to my regular sunscreen when I didn&#x27;t need bug protection</li>
    <li> Nice bug repellent and sunscreen in one lotion. Used when traveling in Thailand and had no bites to report or itch.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  My daughter got zero mosquito bites and i could actually see the bugs flying near her but never landing on her.  I actually used this on my face and arms and got no bites versus the OFF spray i used on my legs where i got eaten alive. It also smells so much better than regular bug spray and it has SPF which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my inlaws in FL because of biting flies they were complaining about.  Regular Off was not working.  My inlaws love this stuff and have purchased it again.  They said it worked great, even on biting flies,  and even smells good.</li>
    <li> I used this product on a trip to Haiti. I was not bothered by any biting insects the entire trip.  It is a great product to keep the bugs away.  It has a pleasant smell.  I would recommend this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> WORKED AS A REPELLANT BUT I CAN&#x27;T STAND THE SCENT</li>
    <li> This is the most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t contain DEET.  The lotion has no strong smell, does not irritate my skin and is not sticky.  I have found one application to last all day.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good product but far too expensive for a small bottle.</li>
    <li> Super product; works great but only a subtle scent!</li>
    <li> I like a bug guard that has a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The little no see ums and mosquitoes just love to bite me, but by using this product and Amazon&#x27;s Bug Bands, I am safe!  If I don&#x27;t wear these two products I feel the itchy, painful results. The Avon Bug Guard is not oily and smells pleasant. It is very effective!</li>
    <li> This is fake or diluted. The product works well but buy it directly from Avon  or you will get eaten alive.</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I was building logging roads in Washington state.  I was being eatten alive by no-see-ums and \\&quot;skeeters\\&quot;.  One of the flagger turned me on to this product and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  I used it while commercial fishing in Alaska and hiking and camping all over the U.S.. It smells nice.  It keeps your skin soft (hence the name), and best of all...no bugs!  This is always my first line of defense.</li>
    <li> Always a great product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen &amp; Bug Guard works great and has a very light scent. The tube size is quite small, so although convenient for 1 or 2 days out, for a longer trip or for multiple people you will need more than one tube. Make sure you purchase extra tubes.</li>
    <li> Works very well for mosquitos, sand flies and gnats.  Also a great sun screen. Not very oily.  I have used it for several years.</li>
    <li> this is great for adults and kids and isn&#x27;t chemical harsh the way many others are. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s so reasonable--even the one with the 30 SFP. Gentle Breeze is the scent I like. Highly recommend..</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Keeps skin soft and not oily as other repellant/sunscreen products. Most importantly I didn&#x27;t get any bites from mosquitoes.</li>
    <li> Great product have it on hand all the time!</li>
