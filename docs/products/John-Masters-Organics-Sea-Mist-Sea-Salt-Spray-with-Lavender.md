      <li>it gives me much more volume and beach-iness the day after I showered, not the day of.</li>
      <li>This product has a great smell but really dries my hair out with liberal application.</li>
      <li>It sure does get curly though.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s probably going to be an better product for people with thicker hair, maybe with a bit of waviness in it already.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and no chemicals.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>As you know, if you use a sea salt spray, they can be drying, so I was glad to see that this had lavender.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better for my hair.</li>
      <li>it seems to work better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have a enjoyable to using this one from now.</li>
      <li>I love this spray.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great keeping my hair dry,and really helpful</li>
      <li>It also stops your hair from getting greasy as quickly because of the drying salt--very nice.</li>
      <li>Love that it gives my hair beach waves, but found it drying and flakey with even a light application.</li>
      <li>and it is great for defining my soft waves whether it is summer or winter.</li>
      <li>I use it when my hair is wet because it works best for me like that</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong smell, it&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t like the scent.. but seemed fine to me.</li>
      <li>however, if you do this in the morning it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Hair is fine and curly.</li>
      <li>This gives me awesome beach waves with little fuss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update if I find it better than I think right now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s organic, lasted a long time, works well, smells great.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this product</li>
      <li>It has no chemicals, gives my fine hair texture, and has really helped with eliminating static.</li>
      <li>Product is lightweight , not sticky no overpowering fragrance and washes out clean</li>
      <li>Smell is light and disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>I was super excited about getting this product.  </li>
      <li>it smells amazing and does give you nice beach waves but only if you really work with your hair a lot to get your desired results so you do need some time to get it wavy.</li>
      <li>However, I will try one more time and see if I used too much, etc.  </li>
      <li>This product is a wonderful way to achieve beach wave hair with very little effort!</li>
      <li>I have never had my hair dry so perfectly, in even, soft, nice-smelling</li>
      <li>Love the light natural lavender scent!  </li>
      <li>Overall I am glad I purchased it, but don&#x27;t expect magical transformation of your hair (which I didn&#x27;t).  </li>
      <li>It enhances my already wavy hair to a mild or mild/medium extent.  </li>
      <li>Very refreshing and emotionally lifting.  </li>
      <li>I have a full head of finely textured hair with a gentle wave.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite product for my hair.</li>
      <li>With that said John Masters is okay, but just didn&#x27;t quite live up.</li>
      <li>I use 4-5 times a week in super straight fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it with gentle waves.  </li>
      <li>Granted, now that I know that this product does a decent job within my new regimen, I will probably try to concoct my own blend because the product is a bit pricy</li>
      <li>Amazing that salt water can make such a difference.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me any waves since I don&#x27;t naturally have them, but it amps up the volume on my hair like a magic potion.  </li>
      <li>Not much hold or definition, but is a good product for &#x27;beach hair&#x27;.</li>
      <li>This spray does a good job of making my hair look like I spent time at the beach, I just wish the lavender scent stuck around!</li>
      <li>I spray it before I blow-dry, and it makes my short hair very easy to style.</li>
      <li>Very large size -</li>
      <li>Has more oil than other sea salt sprays but overall good product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work, but it smells great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tad pricy, but it works well and smells amazing! It isn&#x27;t a strong smell, it&#x27;s light and refreshing. Gives just the right amount of texture to thin, fine hair. Don&#x27;t use too much and not on wet hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it puts body into my hair without any adding chemicals; affordable and with a mild scent.</li>
    <li> Love.... adds volume and body to my ultra thin, fine hair.  Leaves a bit frizzy, but I&#x27;ll take that over flat.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as the grocery store sea salt spray. This product is too expensive to not work better than &#x27;not your mothers sea salt spray&#x27; from the grocery store.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this again.</li>
    <li> it smells amazing ! Feels natural! Leaves your hair wavy and soft like u just air dried the natural ocean water from it! Definitely gives u the &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; look</li>
    <li> Ive used this product several time, just to make sure. Every time I have used it has felt sticky. On wet or dry hair. The smell is terrible too. I have use Bumble and Bumble surf-spray usually it cost $29. Very expensive but worth the extra $15.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after a search returned the following review of this product - &amp;#34;After using John Masters Sea Salt Spray I was asked if a beach angel came down and styled my hair&amp;#34;.  SOLD!  This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and it leaves the most delicate hint of lavender on your hair.  Best product I have used to date for the beachy look.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like it to for my wavy, thick hair.  It leaves my hair frizzy and it has a bit of a sticky texture.  I will be looking for a different product to give my hair beach waves.</li>
    <li> Used it ones, just arrived, love it, smells good</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair besides make it smell nice.</li>
    <li> Love in my hair! I use 4-5 times a week in super straight fine hair. It takes away that slippery soft greasy looking hair. As an added bonus I use it as my deodorant too and it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
    <li> This product has met my expectations. I have shoulder length fine hair with little bit of waves that are enhanced by this product. My hair now looks naturally wavy without much effort. It creates the youthful hippy look that I wanted. Separation, texture and waves! I use this with the pomade for bangs, which I love too. I will buy this again and recommend it to others with my type of hair.</li>
    <li> Love this. It has no chemicals, gives my fine hair texture, and has really helped with eliminating static.</li>
    <li> It smells great and helps with styling but I&#x27;ve found that it leaves a shiny, silver coating on my hair. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s. I think it&#x27;s a little too early for silver-grey hair.</li>
    <li> I already have natural slightly wavy Asian hair, and I use this product on both dry and wet hair.  It enhances my already wavy hair to a mild or mild/medium extent.  Overall I am glad I purchased it, but don&#x27;t expect magical transformation of your hair (which I didn&#x27;t).  It is a bit pricey ($30) for the amount of waves I get.  I haven&#x27;t tried the cheaper products to tell the difference.  I&#x27;ve also only used this product during this summer when I&#x27;ve air dried, so I haven&#x27;t tried it in the winter yet when I have to blow dry.</li>
    <li> When I spray this on my hair dry, it adds volume, which is nice but I bought this product for the waves. I found that, if I spray my hair with water first then spray this on, and scrunch it with my hands/fingers while it dries, I get some waves instead of volume..I also think this product works better on clean than dirty hair.</li>
    <li> Really want to like this product. Love that it gives my hair beach waves, but found it drying and flakey with even a light application. Best when I spray it on my hands and then apply it to the ends, but it&#x27;s still too drying. Will try to add it to a leave in conditioner to hopefully cure that.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it advertises. I have thick, relatively straight hair. The key to getting the waves you want is to only finger comb your hair after washing and waiting until hair is nearly dry to apply product. Then scrunch it a few times and then stop touching your hair. If you continue to mess with your hair then it will not gather in lovely waves, but look dry and stringy. It is, after all, a salt water based product. Resist the temptation! This product is a wonderful way to achieve beach wave hair with very little effort!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never tried a sea mist/salt spray before and never thought it would do anything for my naturally oily, straight hair.  I tried this based on recommendations from beauty mags and blogs and I&#x27;m in love!  It doesn&#x27;t give me any waves since I don&#x27;t naturally have them, but it amps up the volume on my hair like a magic potion.  I sprayed it sparingly on damp hair and blow dried, the result was 30% fuller head of hair.  It would probably give me lasting waves if I sprayed it on just-dried hair and twisted it up in a bun for a while.  I also use it in place of dry shampoo.  It makes my oily hair look like I&#x27;d just washed it.  I can skip a shampoo and not look greasy.  It&#x27;s so much better than dry shampoo powders that over-dry hair and leave it stiff and lifeless.  The lavender oil offsets any stiffness that the salt creates leaving my hair very natural looking and soft.  And I love the subtle lavender scent and that it is 100% natural and organic.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, but the bottle is pretty big and a little goes a long way.  I want to buy cases of this stuff in case they ever stop making it.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My daughter didn&#x27;t like the scent.. but seemed fine to me.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair beach waves with all natural ingredients! I love the smell and it does a good job creating body. I combine it with Shea Curl &amp; Style Milk for extra softness and shine. Very happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for that messy, beachy hair we all crave, provided you scrunch your hair enough after towel drying. Just a side note: I have long naturally blonde hair and I noticed that this product would lighten my hair in the sun whenever I would use it for a few days in a row.... which is awesome for me, but other people might not like that effect.&lt;br /&gt;I also realized after using my bottle up that I could remake it for SO much less money! I just refill it with 1 tsp- 2tsp of sea salt, distilled water, and a few drops of lavender essential oil. Totally understand if DIY is not your thing, but also wanted to share in case it was! (:</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product for my hair. I spray it on dry or wet hair, fluff it up a bit, and out I go. Makes my thin wavy hair look thicker with zero frizz.</li>
    <li> This dose not work well at all ended up buying Redken Fashion waves 07 texturizing sea spray</li>
    <li> This gives me awesome beach waves with little fuss. Just spray, scrunch and go (I have wavy hair already though but helps it go more wavy than frizzy). Smell is light and disappears quickly. Not as heavy as other curl cr&amp;egrave;mes; no crunchy feel later. And great for the price. Very large size - I spray quite a bit on and its still going to take me a long time to go through the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is just the thing to give a little body to my fine, slightly wavy hair.  I put about 15 spritzes in my damp hair before blow drying it and it seems to make round-brush styling stay in.  Love the light natural lavender scent!  Amazing that salt water can make such a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from an article I read concerning straight, limp hair like mine, and I hoped it would help solve one of the problems I&#x27;ve had with my hair - that it had no life, no body.  It was rather expensive, considering that the ingredients are water, sea salt, and lavender oil, but I was surprised that - with other changes I made, such as adding conditioner only to the ends of my hair - it has helped make my hair look and and feel a little more alive.  Granted, now that I know that this product does a decent job within my new regimen, I will probably try to concoct my own blend because the product is a bit pricy and I live on a fixed income.  All in all, I would recommend this product if it is not too pricy for your budget.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good, but drying.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE everything about this mist;o)</li>
    <li> I thought I would try the John Masters because it is significantly less than Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray - well, there is a reason it is a lot cheaper (at least for my hair).  I have fine hair but a lot of it with gentle waves.  Bumble &amp; Bumble does a great job of giving me that ocean water look that I love.  This does not.  At all.  As I mentioned, it just left my hair frizzy.  It was soft though - not sticky or anything.  Also, no returns on this product pursuant to Amazon policy.  Wish I just would have bought B&amp;B.</li>
    <li> I was super excited about getting this product.  I really tried to make this work for me - tried multiple times.  The result was hair that felt dead, dry and crunchy.  I started to feel that it was drying out my hair so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This gives volume and shine to my hair.  It seems to hold well.</li>
    <li> Really like the product, but the spray pump broke after one use. I&#x27;ve been using a pump from a different product (didn&#x27;t seem worth the effort to return given the price point), and the spray works really well for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on several reviews I had seen on different sites.  I love this spray.  I have long hair (below my shoulder blades) and this spray works.  It smells wonderful and leaves the hair soft with beach waves.  I have used several salt sprays but this one by far our performs any others that I have used in the past. One of the tricks I have found is to make sure to tie your hair up in a top knot (or several smaller ones)  to ensure maximum waves are created.  I will be keeping this on hand from now on and will give it as a gift too.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product is not for my kind of curly. The salt makes it dry and the result is sticky hair. I  will not be usung it.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Can&#x27;t tell that it is really doing anything for my hair...once I curl my hair...it seems to work better.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the top of my hair where the part is is flat - I think that is normal, so I use another product to give it a boost.  As you know, if you use a sea salt spray, they can be drying, so I was glad to see that this had lavender.  Plus, the scent is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for giving my hair the beach effect unless I use a massive a mount of the product, and in that case, it leaves a white residue.</li>
    <li> I can see how this would work for certain hair types and colors, but it isn&#x27;t for me.  I don&#x27;t enjoy feeling like my hair is dry and crusty.</li>
    <li> My naturally way hair always needs a little definition, and sea salt spray has always done it wonders! However on purchasing this, my hair has never been frizzier! It sure does get curly though. I have to mix this with a smoothing serum and mousse and hairspray, and still have frizz. All in all, it&#x27;s probably not worth the price. I had some decent Not Your Mother&#x27;s beach spray that didn&#x27;t work quite as well but kept the frizz at bay. I would prefer to use that again. This product has a great smell but really dries my hair out with liberal application.</li>
    <li> Gives Texas-like volume to my usually flat hair.  Truly amazing.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t get the exact effect i was looking for, maybe i was using it wrong. you cannot put it in the hair while the hair is wet because it wont do anything. i felt my hair got stiff and hard.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this all the time, as I am wary of salt drying out my hair, but I wish I could! If you use this after you have towel dried your hair and just let it air dry--wow. I have never had my hair dry so perfectly, in even, soft, nice-smelling waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you co-wash your hair, beware--you need to really use shampoo to get this product out (as I found out, because I co-wash), and if you apply it too many days in a row without washing it out, your hair will get a bit hard. Wash your hair every other day or every three days and this product will amaze you. It also stops your hair from getting greasy as quickly because of the drying salt--very nice.</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to Kevin Murphy Hair Resort, as it was about half the price. After using it for a few weeks, I can easily say that it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. You need to use MUCH more in order to achieve the same type of effect. In addition, the John Masters leaves your hair feeling really gross. Won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Used this twice and had to throw it out.  It made my hair very dry and brittle.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything to refresh curls or waves--just dried it out.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! I have naturally wavy hair and this gives you perfect soft beach waves. Spray it on wet and scruch dry with a tshirt to eliminate frizz. I finish it off with a wand curler.  Highly recommend and smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s my second bottle and it is great for defining my soft waves whether it is summer or winter.</li>
    <li> I really like the manageability that this gives my hair. I spray it before I blow-dry, and it makes my short hair very easy to style.</li>
    <li> I have a full head of finely textured hair with a gentle wave. Sea Mist works very well for me at defining my hair into soft waves that are touchable and not frizzy. For a casual day look I use only three sprays on wet air then finger style. I don&#x27;t know if it would work the same on coarse or very curly hair, but I love the look on my hair, and I especially like that there is no sticky, gummy hairspray residue.</li>
    <li> Product is lightweight , not sticky no overpowering fragrance and washes out clean</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. However; I am not a big fan of how dry it makes my hair feel. My recommendation would be to not use it everyday, only for special occasions if you want a nice beachy, natural wave. I have thick, long, frizzy hair and it looked good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great keeping my hair dry,and really helpful</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Left my hair feeling fried.</li>
    <li> This product does do as intended to provide that beach hair look, but I feel it could perform better, and it is also a little heavy due to the lavender oil. I did think this was a risk I was willing to take because I love lavender so much, and it was as expected to be a little heavy on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make my hair look oily, though because my hair is naturally frizzy with wavy curls as it is so doesn&#x27;t show the oil as much, but I would think if you have straight and/or fine hair this might not work for you. I would probably try a product without any added oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a John masters organics fan.&lt;br /&gt;I want to try this product. I&#x27;ll have a enjoyable to using this one from now.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product and I think its an overall okay product. it smells amazing and does give you nice beach waves but only if you really work with your hair a lot to get your desired results so you do need some time to get it wavy. Also, if you plan on using this at night and then sleeping on it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I tried that, and it just came out like a big mess. however, if you do this in the morning it works just fine. I use it when my hair is wet because it works best for me like that but you can also spray it in when its dry.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair dull and dry.  It did not perform as described.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Should have read the ingredients, this is literally salt and water. Make it yourself at home.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and very straight. I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to give me beachy waves or anything, because for that you need to have a little waviness in your hair in the first place. But I did like the idea of hair that felt like I spent the day at the beach, and maybe getting a bit of volume in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it does have that effect, but with my kind of hair, it works best with &amp;#34;day-old hair&amp;#34; - it gives me much more volume and beach-iness the day after I showered, not the day of. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from the volume it gives me on those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair ON the day I shampoo my hair, and I&#x27;m not sure why - I guess my hair is really, really smooth and straight and thin, and doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well unless I use a really hot, really good curling iron. So it&#x27;s probably going to be an better product for people with thicker hair, maybe with a bit of waviness in it already. I still like it… just not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase it, but it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault, I just don&#x27;t have the best hair for it haha. I do like that it&#x27;s a really pure product with no chemicals.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this.  It&#x27;s organic, lasted a long time, works well, smells great.  All the other sea sprays have parabens or things that I wouldn&#x27;t want on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I decant a little in a travel bottle, bring it on the road.  It really does work like you spent a day at the beach.</li>
    <li> This spray does a good job of making my hair look like I spent time at the beach, I just wish the lavender scent stuck around!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used a product like this- I tried this one based on the reviews. It left my hair sticky &amp; stiff. I had to wash it out because I can&#x27;t believe how bad this product is.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Lasts all day and gives my hair texture and the beachy messy look without making it look like a mess. Great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s scent is like you just came in from the beach.  Very refreshing and emotionally lifting.  Great to wear anytime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bumble &amp; bumble surf spray and wanted an organic/gluten-free version. I think this is as good as it gets. Doesn&#x27;t feel/act like bumble &amp; bumble but it&#x27;s better for my hair.</li>
    <li> I previously used a salt spray that i LOVED. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t realize it contained wheat and I&#x27;m allergic to wheat so whenever I used it I had a bad reaction. With that said John Masters is okay, but just didn&#x27;t quite live up. It doesn&#x27;t seem to add much waviness to my hair like my previous spray did. So it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not kidding about the &#x27;sea salt&#x27; in here. I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t use it properly, but I sprayed it on my hair(my hair was dry at the time) and when it dried it was really crunchy and kind of dry.  Though, my hair did get some extra body.  Made the mistake of thinking it&#x27;d be nice to splash some on my face, ha!  I was in sea salt city, crystallized all over my face.  Don&#x27;t recommend it on face and body.  Use conservatively for hair.....&lt;br /&gt;Long time fan of John Master&#x27;s products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> This spray makes my hair greasy because of the lavender oil, I thought it would only be just a little bit to cancel out the dryness of the sea salt but it made my hair really greasy and look gross.</li>
    <li> Not very good, can&#x27;t stand the smell. Check out Davines Sea Salt spray for a good one</li>
    <li> Has more oil than other sea salt sprays but overall good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It gives my hair texture while leaving it soft and clean.</li>
    <li> It left my hair so frizzy and dry - would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Hair is fine and curly. Not much hold or definition, but is a good product for &#x27;beach hair&#x27;. Maybe better for thick hair?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I have stick straight fine hair. I sprayed it to give my hair some volume, but my husband asked me why I had so many white flakes in my hair! Yikes. I love that it&#x27;s organic and no chemicals. I will try again to use it on my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works magic on my hair to keep it in place without being stiff.  If I&#x27;ve used other products in my hair (like on the day before) spraying with Sea Mist revitalizes it all and makes styling a breeze.</li>
    <li> I didn’t realize when I purchased this how drying to hair it would be.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the hold like other sea salt sprays, and doesn&#x27;t provide the texture.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this sea salt spray is Perfect for giving body &amp; volume. I love it!</li>
    <li> Directions don&#x27;t say how much to use or anything specific. I&#x27;m still testing it out</li>
    <li> This really works. It makes my hair look full and with lots of body, like it was all natural and I had just had a great day on the beach.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gives my hair the beachy, windswept texture without making me smell like beached kelp.</li>
    <li> This product is the best out there of it&#x27;s kind.  It really works and makes my hair look twice as thick.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Two stars because I have only used it once but found it drying.  I have curly hair and it felt like I had put a lot of hairspray on it.  However, I will try one more time and see if I used too much, etc.  I had tried my sister&#x27;s B&amp;b salt spray and liked it - not at all sticky or drying, but saw this and decided to try it.  So far, not for me.  I&#x27;ll update if I find it better than I think right now.</li>
