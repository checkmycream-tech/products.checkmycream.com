### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are so perfect.</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful!</li>
      <li>So I figured that a tinted lip balm would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  </li>
      <li>This was a great price for Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  </li>
      <li>This is very nice and moist.  </li>
      <li>Fair price.</li>
      <li>The price was fair, too.</li>
      <li>I have found this to be the perfect product for both the health, and cuteness of my lips--both of which are very important to me.  &#x3D;]  </li>
      <li>I love that I can get a pack of four so inexpensively, and the color is barely-there, which is great.</li>
      <li>I love the lip shimmer!  </li>
      <li>So when I discovered the watermelon Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Perfect shopped fast.</li>
      <li>Plum and caramel I need to sort of dab on lightly, but I think would be gorgeous on someone with a darker complexion.  </li>
      <li>They have a very nice color to them, which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Makes lips very smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the toffee, too, but it seems they&#x27;ve stopped making it.  </li>
      <li>Totally satisfied with purchase.  </li>
      <li>Love the tingle, love the shimmer, love the hint of color.  </li>
      <li>I love the color, taste, scent and the price.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I use this every day! :)</li>
      <li>Love the color and the pepperminty taste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has more color and goes on thicker than a balm, seeming more like a true lipstick than a balm or gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Watermelon shade is the one that I like the best because I like the cool pink</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t taste like chemicals.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s become my second favorite lip color/moisturizer but the one I use most often these days!</li>
      <li>Way better than store prices and really pretty color, I would recommend.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip gloss is Really Rosy by Origins.</li>
      <li>They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot.</li>
      <li>The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized.</li>
      <li>Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer</li>
      <li>Thanks :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>Not too bright, not too dark, perfect for everyday and goes with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s $15 a tube, and I use it up really quickly.</li>
      <li>My new favorite lipstick.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product and can be worn alone for a totally natural but sweet look.</li>
      <li>Feels very light and natural.</li>
      <li>I love this color its the perfect shade of pink for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>This by far my favorite lip product.</li>
      <li>, lip glosses are too sticky, lip stains are too drying and lip balms don&#x27;t give a healthy color to my naturally un-pigmented lips.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of color, too.</li>
      <li>This lip shimmer is my first product from Burt Bees.</li>
      <li>Guava--while I love the color--is a bit frosty for my taste, and since I&#x27;ve heard the same said about the strawberry, I have not added that to my collection.  </li>
      <li>I did get it promptly and is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Since I recently turned celiac didn&#x27;t think I really like the adjustment to gluten free lip products.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>and i find a lot of times that lipsticks are too much</li>
      <li>I really like this lip shimmer.  </li>
      <li>My other favorite is peony.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It provides a slight amount of cover with the same great lip balm as regular burts bees.</li>
      <li>I would like if Burt&#x27;s Bees would come out with a light pink that is not frosty, so</li>
      <li>Keeps your lips from being dry and I like the minty cool feeling.</li>
      <li>A lovely and good-for-your lips way to add a little color and shine for a polished look!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty pink on my lips, and on my sister&#x27;s lips, too.</li>
      <li>I think it is a bit overpriced, being a small tube for over 5 dollars, but it gives such a nice color to my lips, lasts long, AND moisturizes!</li>
      <li>I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter.</li>
      <li>Champagne is the one I use most often, as its very subtle, and almost a non-color, for when you want a natural look.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this Lip Shimmer for several years - I wear it instead of lipstick as the color is more sheer and subtle.  </li>

<li> I always buy it for myself and other family members.</li>
<li> Just enough color to make a difference but sheer enough to apply without a mirror and not end up looking scary.</li>
<li> The secret is a little bit of mint that gives chapped lips that cool feeling of being rescued from cold or windy weather in the winter or too much sun in the summer.</li>
<li> It is not as dark as the cap makes it look.  </li>
<li> Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  </li>
<li> Hoping the other shades won&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
<li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  </li>

    <li> I must have gone through a dozen of these lip shimmers over the past few years because they do such a good job of making my lips feel moist, even in the winter. The secret is a little bit of mint that gives chapped lips that cool feeling of being rescued from cold or windy weather in the winter or too much sun in the summer. They come in different shades from just a hint of color, in a shade like Champagne, to a fair amount in shades like Merlot. The Watermelon shade is the one that I like the best because I like the cool pink colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients they list are: helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, beeswax, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) wax, lanolin, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil. May contain: iron oxide, mica, carmine, titanium dioxide. The peppermint oil is the thing that gives it the cool feeling that makes your lips feel so moisturized. Because there are a lot of oils in it, I find that I have to reapply it fairly often, but the color is sheer so you don&#x27;t have a build up like you might with regular lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve turned so many of my friends on to this product, because once they try it, they find that they like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I always buy it for myself and other family members. All are big fan of it and using since a long time.</li>
    <li> Literally. It goes on pink, not red or magenta. When seen in the store and anywhere online, no matter what type of color monitor is used, it looks reddish--and the description of it calls it magenta or red, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in the tube, but it&#x27;s not on your lips. It&#x27;s a very pretty pink on my lips, and on my sister&#x27;s lips, too. Just the right amount of color, too. Not too bright, not too dark, perfect for everyday and goes with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more color and goes on thicker than a balm, seeming more like a true lipstick than a balm or gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, this product in the Fig color looks brownish on lips, while the Rhubarb color appears purplish in tone.</li>
    <li> i am a teen and i find a lot of times that lipsticks are too much, lip glosses are too sticky, lip stains are too drying and lip balms don&#x27;t give a healthy color to my naturally un-pigmented lips. So I figured that a tinted lip balm would be perfect. And it is. I think it is a bit overpriced, being a small tube for over 5 dollars, but it gives such a nice color to my lips, lasts long, AND moisturizes! This is such a great product and can be worn alone for a totally natural but sweet look. I use this every day! :)</li>

    <li> I love this. I did get it promptly and is exactly what I was expecting. The price was fair, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Lip Shimmer for several years - I wear it instead of lipstick as the color is more sheer and subtle.  I never ever have chapped lips, even in the harshest of winter weather</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> This by far my favorite lip product. Just enough color to make a difference but sheer enough to apply without a mirror and not end up looking scary. Keeps your lips from being dry and I like the minty cool feeling. I have one in my purse, and one in each bathroom at home. I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip gloss is Really Rosy by Origins. Love the color and the pepperminty taste. But it&#x27;s $15 a tube, and I use it up really quickly. So when I discovered the watermelon Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, I was thrilled. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t taste like chemicals.

My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  It has no taste (no strawberry, for example).  I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt&#x27;s Bees, but now I am a believer!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Quality product. Works as described. Fair price. Fast shipment. Totally satisfied with purchase.  Would purchase again. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> This lip shimmer is my first product from Burt Bees. When buying I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it. Boy was I wrong! Been using lipsticks for years. Since I recently turned celiac didn&#x27;t think I really like the adjustment to gluten free lip products. This is a affordable option for Celiac ones who have gluten problems. Wish I known of this product sooner. I love this color its the perfect shade of pink for everyday wear. Feels very light and natural. Makes lips very smooth and healthy. Hoping the other shades won&#x27;t disappointed. Thank you Burt Bees!</li>
    <li> I have found this to be the perfect product for both the health, and cuteness of my lips--both of which are very important to me.  &#x3D;]  Love the tingle, love the shimmer, love the hint of color.  I was afraid the watermelon would be too dark for me, but no, it is really gorgeous.  if you want something with a mauve tone, but without frost, this is the one.  It is not as dark as the cap makes it look.  Champagne is the one I use most often, as its very subtle, and almost a non-color, for when you want a natural look.  My other favorite is peony.  Love the toffee, too, but it seems they&#x27;ve stopped making it.  Plum and caramel I need to sort of dab on lightly, but I think would be gorgeous on someone with a darker complexion.  Guava--while I love the color--is a bit frosty for my taste, and since I&#x27;ve heard the same said about the strawberry, I have not added that to my collection.  I would like if Burt&#x27;s Bees would come out with a light pink that is not frosty, so I hope that they are reading this.  &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> This is very nice and moist.  I love the color, taste, scent and the price.  Afordable enough to have in every purse and drawer.</li>
    <li> These are so perfect. They have a very nice color to them, which is exactly what I wanted.  No longer need to wear lipstick!</li>
    <li> This was a great price for Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s. Way better than store prices and really pretty color, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the lip shimmer!  I can&#x27;t keep lipstick on, but this product keeps lips moisturized and looks like lipstick.</li>
    <li> My new favorite lipstick.</li>
