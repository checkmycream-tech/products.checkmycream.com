      <li>A MUST BUY, GREAT BUY!</li>
      <li>Smell is great though it disappears once you get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing!</li>
      <li>However, $15 for a 25.3oz bottle of shower gel is a great deal, and it does smell good.</li>
      <li>All my friends love using my bathroom because the hand wash smells delicious</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells great and my girl loved it.</li>
      <li>Smells good.  </li>

      <li>The smell is so refreshing!</li>
      <li>Love that the size is jumbo, saves me from always running out to purchase some more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>love the smell, I just will it lasted longer.</li>
      <li>and I love this scent, but</li>
      <li>But I do love the smell.</li>
      <li>Smells more like honey than strawberries.</li>
      <li>I also love that it has coconut sulfates instead of chemical sulfates.</li>
      <li>Leaves a nice light scent on your skin for hours.</li>
      <li>so I find I am having to pump so MANY times to get plenty on a washcloth or pouf.</li>
      <li>Love the size and the smell.</li>
      <li>Strawberry is my daughters favorite scent.</li>
      <li>I love that this product is fair-trade and cruelty-free.</li>
      <li>If this hadn&#x27;t arrived damaged, I&#x27;d have given it a better review.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH GLORIOUS LATHER, I LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>WHICH IS A FABULOUS MOISTURIZING FRAGRANT LOTION</li>
      <li>Although I do not hate it, I wont be buying it again.</li>
      <li>The shower gel is good and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>First off, I love this brand</li>
      <li>I took the top off and was able to use a straw to get the major dent out, but it&#x27;s still deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love the Body Shop&#x27;s lotions and body butters, but found this gel very runny and the scent was not all that I hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>I love the pump bottle because it keeps her from pouring too much out at once.</li>
      <li>The scent does dissipate quickly after the shower, which may be a \\&quot;con\\&quot; to some people.</li>
      <li>MADE MY BODY FEEL SUPER ENERGIZED WITH VITAMINS A,E &amp; C.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely, fresh smelling body wash that leaves the skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
      <li>I GOT RIGHT IN THE SHOWER WITH IT.</li>
      <li>It goes a long way and lathers nicely.</li>
      <li>I would certainly purchase it again!</li>
      <li>They are much more powerful and last longer on the skin, although they currently cost more on Amazon than this Strawberry scent.</li>
      <li>this is a great body wash, the scent is seriously out of this world; I dont know what they did to get the scent of this</li>
      <li>BUT I&#x27;D RATHER USE REAL VS SYNTHETIC FRAGRANCES</li>
      <li>Cleans me up really well too.</li>
      <li>Also the pump barely dispenses any product</li>

<li> I dont know how much I can say about if it moisterizes well, because we have hard water where we live and my skin gets dry anyway.</li>
<li> The scent is somewhat weak, &amp; the push top is not wide enough for the container, making it difficult to use.</li>
<li> This only include the big one and not the meduim and small sized one shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Spout could be a little larger.  </li>
<li> have this brand of Body Shop shower gel in both the Satsuma and the Pink Grapefruit, and can say I prefer those scents.</li>
<li> I use other body shop shower gels but don&#x27;t know why this one drys my skin out.</li>
<li> IT SMELLS LIKE YOUR IN A STRAWBERRY PATCH, REAL FRAGRANCE AND NOT THAT FAKE STUFF</li>
<li> Possbily sometime down the line I&#x27;ll probably end up trying the lotion as well.</li>
<li> DAMN it is expensive, definitely an item I only buy once it runs out</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t have an issue with there body gels.</li>
<li> JUST 2 SMALL PUMPS GAVE ME</li>
<li> When you press the plunger, it is hard to get it on your hand and not the bottle, because the bottle is wider than the spout.</li>
<li> Nothing really wrong with it, but it&#x27;s not a good buy.</li>
<li> So, I was a little disappointed with the scent.</li>
<li> THAT MAKES YOU SICK.</li>

    <li> The scent is somewhat weak, &amp; the push top is not wide enough for the container, making it difficult to use. I am neutral about this product &amp; probably will not purchase it again. Nothing really wrong with it, but it&#x27;s not a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is fair-trade and cruelty-free. I also love that it has coconut sulfates instead of chemical sulfates. No parabens or petroleum products. And did I mention it smells heavenly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I had hoped. The scent does dissipate quickly after the shower, which may be a \\&quot;con\\&quot; to some people. But layering with the body butter takes care of both of these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase this product again.</li>
    <li> First off, I love this brand and I love this scent, but DAMN it is expensive, definitely an item I only buy once it runs out and ONLY if I feel like spoiling myself a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that. this is a great body wash, the scent is seriously out of this world; I dont know what they did to get the scent of this but I cant rave about it enough. Cleans me up really well too. I dont know how much I can say about if it moisterizes well, because we have hard water where we live and my skin gets dry anyway. BUT that wont keep me from buying this anyway. Possbily sometime down the line I&#x27;ll probably end up trying the lotion as well.</li>
    <li> Love that the size is jumbo, saves me from always running out to purchase some more.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, I just will it lasted longer. It evaporates once I step out of the shower.</li>
    <li> The JUMBO size is a bonus... Purchase this for my fiancee and she loves it.. wish i could purchase this same size in Australia.</li>
    <li> Always loved Body Shop&#x27;s shower gel. The smell is so refreshing!</li>
    <li> PKG ARRIVED TODAY AND WAS PKG&#x27;D WELL. I GOT RIGHT IN THE SHOWER WITH IT. JUST 2 SMALL PUMPS GAVE ME SO MUCH GLORIOUS LATHER, I LOVED IT. IT SMELLS LIKE YOUR IN A STRAWBERRY PATCH, REAL FRAGRANCE AND NOT THAT FAKE STUFF THAT MAKES YOU SICK. MADE MY BODY FEEL SUPER ENERGIZED WITH VITAMINS A,E &amp; C. I ESPECIALLY LOVE VITAMIN C FOR MY BODY AS IT HELPS WITH AGING SKIN BUT I&#x27;M ONLY 40 SO I&#x27;M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT QUITE YET BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SHOWER GEL I USE FROM NOW ON!! A MUST BUY, GREAT BUY! NO THE FRAGRANCE DOESN&#x27;T STAY SO IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR THAT, LAYER IT WITH THE LOTION OR USE OLAY IN SHOWER LOTION WHICH IS A FABULOUS MOISTURIZING FRAGRANT LOTION BUT I&#x27;D RATHER USE REAL VS SYNTHETIC FRAGRANCES LIKE THIS STUFF. YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET THIS BUY!</li>
    <li> I use other body shop shower gels but don&#x27;t know why this one drys my skin out. I usually don&#x27;t have an issue with there body gels. But I do love the smell.</li>

    <li> Love the Body Shop&#x27;s lotions and body butters, but found this gel very runny and the scent was not all that I hoped it would be. Although I do not hate it, I wont be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with multiple dents along the bottom of the bottle. What is up with that? It&#x27;s supposed to be a gift, so that&#x27;s out now. I took the top off and was able to use a straw to get the major dent out, but it&#x27;s still deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this brand of Body Shop shower gel in both the Satsuma and the Pink Grapefruit, and can say I prefer those scents. They are much more powerful and last longer on the skin, although they currently cost more on Amazon than this Strawberry scent. However, $15 for a 25.3oz bottle of shower gel is a great deal, and it does smell good. The others just smell better! If this hadn&#x27;t arrived damaged, I&#x27;d have given it a better review.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, fresh smelling body wash that leaves the skin feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
    <li> Love the size and the smell. It goes a long way and lathers nicely. I would certainly purchase it again!</li>

    <li> Smell is great though it disappears once you get out of the shower.  Also the pump barely dispenses any product so I find I am having to pump so MANY times to get plenty on a washcloth or pouf. It does lather well and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
