      <li>The tingling sensation is definitely a great way to wake up!</li>
      <li>Also a great price from Amazon!</li>
      <li>Awesome service from Amazon.</li>
      <li>It felt great -</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for years, and it does a great job in making my hair &amp;#34;Squeaky Clean&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>It is a great price.  </li>
      <li>Great conditioner.</li>
      <li>Smells good too.</li>
      <li>but it sure does feel good!</li>
      <li>She has the most beautiful hair I have ever seen.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing.</li>
      <li>This is a good conditioner that gives you an interesting tingling sensation in your scalp when you use it (because of the menthol in it).</li>
      <li>The cool tingly feeling is a great way to get the day started.  </li>
      <li>The 33.8 oz (1 liter) bottles ship with a piece of tape over the top they don&#x27;t leak while shipping - easy and effective.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most fancy conditioner out there, but it works well, and the price for a 2-pack from Amazon.com cannot be beat.  </li>
      <li>If you think you&#x27;ll like this stuff, do the Subscribe and Save option - you will save even more money.    </li>
      <li>No complaints, and get it through the subscription on Amazon which is even better.</li>
      <li>Really enjoyable, makes my hair feel much much better.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my scalp tingle.</li>
      <li>love the smells...better than store bought stuff....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using both for about 5 months now and was worried that I might go through the conditioner more than the shampoo, or vice versa.  </li>
      <li>I love using this conditioner in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>Sale prices aren&#x27;t bad...would be interested to hear what are good alternatives.</li>
      <li>This conditioner strikes a nice balance - it makes my hair feel nice and soft but not overly greasy after using it.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has a strong methol tingle of curative power for an irritated scalp.  </li>
      <li>The tape is a huge lifesaver for putting it in my checked luggage.    </li>
      <li>American Crew makes a nice product - this conditioner is invigorating and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>sure you are aware of the amount you are getting here.</li>
      <li>Overall good bang-for-the buck.</li>
      <li>This has a good sensation to it when it is being used and afterwards it is just trouble free, well balanced hair.</li>
      <li>Use some soap first and get the oils from the conditioner out of your hands or you&#x27;ll get a funny tingly sensation in your eyes too!)</li>
      <li>I have short hair and only need to use a small amount to make my hair feel great and look great.</li>
      <li>so I emailed Amazon and they overnighted a new one for free.</li>
      <li>The Amazon.com price for the 2-pack is pretty much unbeatable unless you work in the beauty industry and can get wholesale discounts.  </li>
      <li>I really like it and use it every once in awhile and can kind of tell when I haven&#x27;t used it for awhile since my hair seems to be less</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner and the shampoo...</li>
      <li>I love that feeling of the wind blowing through my hair, giving my scalp a little tingle, after I get a new hair cut!  </li>
      <li>And since I live abroad, I only buy this when I travel to the US -</li>
      <li>Been using American Crew Stimulating Conditioner for at least a dozen years or more.</li>
      <li>However, I checked recently and the bottle of shampoo vs. the conditioner are almost dead even, so I&#x27;m clearly using just the right amount.    </li>

    <li> This conditioner has a strong methol tingle of curative power for an irritated scalp.  Rinse it with cold water and your hair will shine!</li>
    <li> This conditioner strikes a nice balance - it makes my hair feel nice and soft but not overly greasy after using it. Has a sort of tingly feeling when you use it too (I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s from the menthol). Very refreshing. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I can tell when I haven&#x27;t been using it for a while (like when I am on a trip).  Then it takes several uses before my hair becomes manageable again.  I started using it 15 years ago.  I haven&#x27;t looked back since.  I get compliments when using it because it keeps my hair manageable.  Before I using it, I would get dandruff and my hair would be all of the place and way too oily. This has a good sensation to it when it is being used and afterwards it is just trouble free, well balanced hair.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used to always wash my hair with some conditioner that would make my head tingle after I used it.  It felt great - I love that feeling of the wind blowing through my hair, giving my scalp a little tingle, after I get a new hair cut!  I finally asked her what she used and she said it was the American Crew Daily Conditioner.    After shopping around a little, I decided to buy two bottles of the American Crew Daily Conditioner from Amazon.com. The Amazon.com price for the 2-pack is pretty much unbeatable unless you work in the beauty industry and can get wholesale discounts.  The 33.8 oz (1 liter) bottles ship with a piece of tape over the top they don&#x27;t leak while shipping - easy and effective.  And since I live abroad, I only buy this when I travel to the US - The tape is a huge lifesaver for putting it in my checked luggage.    I pair this conditioner with the American Crew Daily Shampoo and use them every morning. The tingling sensation is definitely a great way to wake up! Let the conditioner sit in your hair for about 3 minutes and you&#x27;ll feel it tingle.  I have fairly short hair so one pump is enough for me.  I&#x27;ve been using both for about 5 months now and was worried that I might go through the conditioner more than the shampoo, or vice versa.  However, I checked recently and the bottle of shampoo vs. the conditioner are almost dead even, so I&#x27;m clearly using just the right amount.    It&#x27;s not the most fancy conditioner out there, but it works well, and the price for a 2-pack from Amazon.com cannot be beat.  If you think you&#x27;ll like this stuff, do the Subscribe and Save option - you will save even more money.    (One point of caution - do NOT rub your eyes in the shower immediately after you put the conditioner in your hair, even after you wash the conditioner off your hands.  Use some soap first and get the oils from the conditioner out of your hands or you&#x27;ll get a funny tingly sensation in your eyes too!)</li>
    <li> Been using American Crew Stimulating Conditioner for at least a dozen years or more. It&#x27;s my conditioner of choice. And I heartily recommend it to others too.</li>
    <li> American Crew makes a nice product - this conditioner is invigorating and smells nice.  Not the fanciest hair product but not the cheapest either.  Overall good bang-for-the buck.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner that gives you an interesting tingling sensation in your scalp when you use it (because of the menthol in it). I really like it and use it every once in awhile and can kind of tell when I haven&#x27;t used it for awhile since my hair seems to be less manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Make sure you are aware of the amount you are getting here. The stuff I ordered cam in two 33.8 ounce bottles which is a lot of conditioner. For me this is odd because I don&#x27;t use conditioner every time I wash my hair. The shampoo comes in the same size bottles so if you buy them both you end up with extra conditioner if your usage habits are the same as mine.)</li>
    <li> I love using this conditioner in the mornings.  The cool tingly feeling is a great way to get the day started.  Also a great price from Amazon!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I love the way it makes my scalp tingle. I don&#x27;t know if the tingling feeling means that it is helping my scalp or not but it sure does feel good! I have short hair and only need to use a small amount to make my hair feel great and look great. Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. Awesome service from Amazon. The conditioner was leaking so I emailed Amazon and they overnighted a new one for free.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years, and it does a great job in making my hair &amp;#34;Squeaky Clean&amp;#34;. I also saved money buying through Amazon. I also don&#x27;t have to drive to a store to get it</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my head tingle and helps keep my hair in place.  The fact that it was so inexpensive is a big help too..  It is a great price.  My wife uses the conditioner too.  She has the most beautiful hair I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> Started using this with the shampoo a few years ago.  Really enjoyable, makes my hair feel much much better.  No complaints, and get it through the subscription on Amazon which is even better.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner and the shampoo...love the smells...better than store bought stuff....just a little pricey..  Sale prices aren&#x27;t bad...would be interested to hear what are good alternatives.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting.</li>
