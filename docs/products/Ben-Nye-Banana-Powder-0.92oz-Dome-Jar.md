      <li>I love the dome!  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as amazing as everyone told me it would be</li>
      <li>I had seen reviews and its amazing.</li>
      <li>This product was packaged nicely to ensure it was not damaged.</li>
      <li>Packaging looks nice but the quality of the product isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I loved it, but i think Ben Nye needs to look for a more functional bottle or case to easily use the product.</li>
      <li>The yellow tone is a perfect highlight for my warm, medium, olive skin color.  </li>
      <li>Nice finely milled powder, will probably not repurchase</li>
      <li>I love this powder.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will be ordering it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color seems like it adapts to your skin tone, so it works well with many shades of lighter skin.</li>
      <li>its okay.</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic on top of under eye concealer concealer.</li>
      <li>To Work :)</li>
      <li>However, when I read a beauty blog that stated the Banana Powder had become a cult beauty favorite...</li>
      <li>I would expect more from a &amp;#34;luxury powder&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Love this product came on time</li>
      <li>and this did not break me out. :)</li>
      <li>I love this powder been wanting it for&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
      <li>purchased the banana powder on amazon and although the packaging looked authentic.</li>
      <li>Brought it for my daughter and she love it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the powder (I use it to &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my makeup) gave my skin a beautiful air-brush finish.</li>
      <li>The texture is fine to very fine which is great for my 50 (easily passes for 40) year old face.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try this as it&#x27;s a yellow toned powder, but after reading so many great reviews, I decided to try it anyway.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong, i don&#x27;t know because i don´t know another one.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure to blend these products very well, but they do a really nice job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much it covers!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with Tarte Smooth Operator or Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder.  </li>
      <li>Best power Ever to cover under eye darkness without looking too heavy.</li>
      <li>You have to know how to apply it overall great</li>
      <li>Sound like a miracle</li>
      <li>color skin..not light, nor olive colored.</li>
      <li>I have heard great things about this product, but this one falls short.</li>
      <li>A light dusting sets foundation.  </li>
      <li>It works OK for my fair medium skin better than average</li>
      <li>Using a Dual Finish brush, I lightly swirl it in the powder that&#x27;s sitting on the plastic screen on top of the full container and gently tap off the excess.  </li>
      <li>On you tube videos it looks like a bright yellow??</li>
      <li>I love the domed container shape, this will last me forever :)</li>
      <li>It is silky smooth, flattering, color-correcting and provides a lovely soft, diffused finish.</li>
      <li>Product is lovely but the price is to high.</li>
      <li>the Ben Nye says the are the only dealer, but bought here and love it!</li>
      <li>This powder is exactly as described!</li>
      <li>great product for concealing dark circles !</li>
      <li>Super super soft!</li>
      <li>I am attempting to return this powder after comparing it to the real product; however, for the first time ever I am having difficulties trying to return this !</li>
      <li>I am fair blue eyed blonde.</li>
      <li>While I do love the loose powder and the coverage it gives you, there is no &amp;#34;stopper&amp;#34; or cover inside that keeps the powder in the bottom of the container.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
      <li>Well anyway I have a JLO complexion and this is very neutral...</li>
      <li>particularly since the cult status seems to have been largely motivated by a Kardashian</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>It was a lot more yellow, easier to apply, and did not make my skin look so dry.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Non-irritating on my face (my skin is very sensitive).  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Face was itching and cheeks were really red and hot.</li>
      <li>Anyway...I was influenced by the sheer number of positive reviews and ordered the product.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion...</li>
      <li>The powder from camera ready looked very different!</li>
      <li>not a bad product, but not worth the price.</li>
      <li>Sometimes if I over do my blush or my bronzer I will dust a little of this on and it tones it down nicely.</li>
      <li>It Works Exactly How I Expected It</li>
      <li>this may be too yellow for you; I recommend that you try before you buy (natural lighting).  </li>

<li> I anticipate this lasting an extremely long time.  </li>
<li> really well!I feel like my eyes do get a little irritated after a while only after an extreme work-out....</li>
<li> My first purchase ever for this banana powder , I don&#x27;t know what color its supposed to be like, its not a bright yellow.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to try it.</li>
<li> I hate to go with the crowd, but I am going to have to swallow my pride and admit that this is every bit as good as the beauty blogs say it is.</li>
<li> It settled into every pore an made my skin look terribly dry and powdery.</li>
<li> So, if you put it on your makeup bag like I do, be prepared for a mess when you open the container to apply.</li>
<li> I also noticed that the container is different from what I have seen Ben Nye products in before, which is a little suspicious.</li>
<li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL</li>
<li> I have olive skin to begin with, so it can usually take pigmented products, but this powder looked too cakey and yellow.  </li>
<li> However, gotta say, it was chalky, clung to dry patches, and a tad bit messy.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t cover dark circles completely like a luxury powder should, it is too yellow, and  sometimes looks a bit fake.</li>
<li> Helps alot with dark circles under eye.</li>
<li> BE VERY CAREFUL !</li>

    <li> I like this powder. Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it every day as a finishing powder just before my blush. Sometimes if I over do my blush or my bronzer I will dust a little of this on and it tones it down nicely. I love this product and will be ordering it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-N</li>
    <li> My first purchase ever for this banana powder , I don&#x27;t know what color its supposed to be like, its not a bright yellow. On you tube videos it looks like a bright yellow?? Well anyway I have a JLO complexion and this is very neutral... I apply it after I apply my concealer and it helps set it very nice and brightens up the area really well!I feel like my eyes do get a little irritated after a while only after an extreme work-out.... I love the domed container shape, this will last me forever :)</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this as it&#x27;s a yellow toned powder, but after reading so many great reviews, I decided to try it anyway. Wow!! It&#x27;s so perfect for setting undereye concealer, it makes my skin look flawless and stays that way all day long. I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to try it. I got the compact size with the sifter and it will probably last me over a year.</li>
    <li> It works OK for my fair medium skin better than average</li>
    <li> I always set my under-eye concealer with a powder and had heard great things about this one.  Sadly, the color is just to yellow.  I have olive skin to begin with, so it can usually take pigmented products, but this powder looked too cakey and yellow.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with Tarte Smooth Operator or Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder.  You have to make sure to blend these products very well, but they do a really nice job.</li>
    <li> I loved it, but i think Ben Nye needs to look for a more functional bottle or case to easily use the product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the formulation but goes on well over moisturizer.  I have oily skin and tends to make it look dirty.</li>
    <li> Definitely a MUST HAVE</li>
    <li> This powder is exactly as described! It&#x27;s amazing how much it covers! I have med. color skin..not light, nor olive colored. There are video&#x27;s on how to apply it, as there  aren&#x27;t any directions that come with it..</li>
    <li> I use this to set the highlight part of contouring makeup.  The texture is fine to very fine which is great for my 50 (easily passes for 40) year old face.  The yellow tone is a perfect highlight for my warm, medium, olive skin color.  If you&#x27;re coloring is neutral this may be too yellow for you; I recommend that you try before you buy (natural lighting).  Using a Dual Finish brush, I lightly swirl it in the powder that&#x27;s sitting on the plastic screen on top of the full container and gently tap off the excess.  I anticipate this lasting an extremely long time.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and haven&#x27;t made any visible dent in the amount of product.  Pros:  Texture.  Warm/brightening effect.  A light dusting sets foundation.  Doesn&#x27;t settle into facial lines/creases.  Non-irritating on my face (my skin is very sensitive).  Long lasting. Odorless.  Cons:  Eyes water if product is too close to them.  Not for all skin tones.  Not for the heavy handed.  Initial cost which is outweighed by the number of applications.</li>
    <li> Love this powder!!! What a great price too!</li>
    <li> This product was packaged nicely to ensure it was not damaged. I love the dome!  It is so convenient and not as messy to use. The product was like silk on my skin!  I would definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> It Works Exactly How I Expected It To Work :)&lt;br /&gt;Works Great</li>
    <li> great product for concealing dark circles ! love it !</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this did not break me out. :)</li>
    <li> I love this powder been wanting it for&lt;br /&gt;Long time but never got around to ordering&lt;br /&gt;It. Luv luv luv it.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as amazing as everyone told me it would be but it does help set the makeup.</li>
    <li> Best power Ever to cover under eye darkness without looking too heavy.</li>
    <li> I am fair blue eyed blonde. I tend to have under eye circles because of allergies. This stuff is magic on top of under eye concealer concealer. Check out videos on YouTube for how-to (I like Samii Ryan&#x27;s) I hesitated to buy as the Ben Nye says the are the only dealer, but bought here and love it! I recommend Tarte&#x27;s brush/sponge applicator you can find at Sephora-the sponge end applicator works perfect for applying the power, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a brush for the best application of this product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting some sort of inner glow from this powder. I guess it&#x27;s been hyped in the media as such. However, gotta say, it was chalky, clung to dry patches, and a tad bit messy. Not going to re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice finely milled powder, will probably not repurchase</li>
    <li> Helps alot with dark circles under eye.</li>
    <li> Product is lovely but the price is to high. You can get it from CRC makeup web for $11.</li>
    <li> great correction powder, I use it for contouring (baking)</li>
    <li> BE VERY CAREFUL !&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL IF YOU PURCHASE THIS ITEM ON AMAZON/EBAY!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the banana powder on amazon and although the packaging looked authentic. After a hour of wear the product began to look blotchy, spotty, and scaley. It settled into every pore an made my skin look terribly dry and powdery. I ended up purchasing the 3oz banana powder from camerareadycomestics for the same price to compare the powder. The powder from camera ready looked very different! It was a lot more yellow, easier to apply, and did not make my skin look so dry. I am attempting to return this powder after comparing it to the real product; however, for the first time ever I am having difficulties trying to return this ! I need my money back from this purchase</li>
    <li> its okay. noting great about it.</li>
    <li> You have to know how to apply it overall great</li>
    <li> Im not sure if is a real product or a fake one. The smell is strong, i don&#x27;t know because i don´t know another one. In All case if is original i´m not so impressive.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. I had seen reviews and its amazing. It keeps me from getting oily and gives me this radiant glow. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best translucent powders I have ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product came on time</li>
    <li> Beautiful as a under eye powder to set makeup and work as a highlighter! Super super soft!</li>
    <li> Learning how to use this powder. I use a powder brush to apply for a flawless look.</li>
    <li> was recommended by a makeup artist to help with face glow without giving a white face in photos.</li>
    <li> This product is fake. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Brought it for my daughter and she love it. Not my color.</li>
    <li> not a bad product, but not worth the price. I have heard great things about this product, but this one falls short. It doesn&#x27;t cover dark circles completely like a luxury powder should, it is too yellow, and  sometimes looks a bit fake. I also noticed that the container is different from what I have seen Ben Nye products in before, which is a little suspicious. I will still buy BN powder, but not from this seller because I am convinced this is a knock off.</li>
    <li> Good product arrived as stated and works as described.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have used Ben Nye in theatre makeup settings previously. However, when I read a beauty blog that stated the Banana Powder had become a cult beauty favorite...I was skeptical....particularly since the cult status seems to have been largely motivated by a Kardashian and I am no fan. Additionally, I was skeptical of the yellow hue of this product. My skin has peachy/pink tones and I look like an onion in yellow colors. Anyway...I was influenced by the sheer number of positive reviews and ordered the product.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion...it is EVERY BIT as good as the claims! I was surprised that the powder (I use it to &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; my makeup) gave my skin a beautiful air-brush finish. It is silky smooth, flattering, color-correcting and provides a lovely soft, diffused finish. Sound like a miracle product?&lt;br /&gt;It is. I hate to go with the crowd, but I am going to have to swallow my pride and admit that this is every bit as good as the beauty blogs say it is. TRY IT! I do not think you will regret it. I surely do not.</li>
    <li> Love the powder - the coverage is great and there is a lot of product! The color seems like it adapts to your skin tone, so it works well with many shades of lighter skin. The only downside is the container. While I do love the loose powder and the coverage it gives you, there is no &amp;#34;stopper&amp;#34; or cover inside that keeps the powder in the bottom of the container. So, if you put it on your makeup bag like I do, be prepared for a mess when you open the container to apply. I would still buy it again, I love the way it makes my skin look!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. Packaging looks nice but the quality of the product isn&#x27;t. I would expect more from a &amp;#34;luxury powder&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this for highlighting after watching a video and im happy with results..blends well, eliminates shine and does not pronounce my wrinkles or lines..have not tried it as setting powder but looks it would be great as well</li>
    <li> After first use discovered I&#x27;m allergic to this powder and not sure why. Face was itching and cheeks were really red and hot. Immediately washed my face and the reaction continued for awhile.</li>
