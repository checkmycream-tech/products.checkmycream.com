<li> its a little small and short, but its really cute</li>
<li> If I&#x27;d paid $16, I&#x27;d give it four stars, only because there were several loose strings I had to cut off by hand, but after that it was perfect.&lt;br</li>
<li> poor quality and hardly worth the price.</li>
<li> but they are not very noticeable.  </li>
<li> The edging is lovey as it hangs down.</li>
<li> Just what I wanted to put at the neckline of a black turtleneck to soften the stark black of it.  </li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have the little sparkly things in it--which I would prefer not to have--</li>
<li> The fabric is a thin white lace with a little bit of sparkle.</li>
<li> When we opened the package, we discovered that it is very tiny (don&#x27;t believe the image) and poorly made.</li>
<li> It is simply a piece of fabric with edging cut and sewn (sloppily) onto the fabric.</li>
<li> So sorry i ordered it.</li>
<li> We were unable to use it for prom as intended.</li>

    <li> I wear this just like in the picture. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This took a very long time to arrive but was great for the price, my family members use these as church veils and it has other church members asking us where we got them.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments</li>
    <li> This item took nearly 6 weeks to arrive. When we opened the package, we discovered that it is very tiny (don&#x27;t believe the image) and poorly made. It is simply a piece of fabric with edging cut and sewn (sloppily) onto the fabric. The edges are unfinished and it arrived already unraveling when we removed it from the envelope it arrived in. We were unable to use it for prom as intended. It is pretty, but unusable.</li>
    <li> This scarf reflects its price. It looks nice from afar but from up close the finishings are sloppy. Still, the price can&#x27;t be beaten.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted to put at the neckline of a black turtleneck to soften the stark black of it.  Not to big, just right!</li>

If I&#x27;d paid $16, I&#x27;d give it four stars, only because there were several loose strings I had to cut off by hand, but after that it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came a week earlier than promised, also.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking forin something with lace. Nice detail and delicate. Goes well with dress it was meant to go with.</li>
    <li> Extremely thin, looks much better on the photo...</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s first holy communion because she isn&#x27;t really a crown and tulle kind of girl.  It was so pretty and couldn&#x27;t be beat for the price.  We received a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and light. It has a lacey-ness to it I just love. The edging is lovey as it hangs down.</li>
    <li> FEELS LIKE SILK...NICE AND LIGHT FOR SUMMER</li>
