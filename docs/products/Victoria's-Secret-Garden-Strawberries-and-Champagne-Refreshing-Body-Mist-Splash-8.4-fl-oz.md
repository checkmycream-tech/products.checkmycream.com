<li> ONE THINK OF GLASS OF PINK CHAMPAGNE</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m really not).</li>
<li> but, when it arrived it was leaking through the book and was almost half way through!It had been poorly wrapped, this the first time it happens to me.</li>
<li> This was actually cheaper online than at the store as usual</li>
<li> I watched my hard earned money flushed down the toilet in the form of the liquid perfume.</li>
<li> This perfume is a little too heavy for me.</li>
<li> This stuff is a waste of money.</li>
<li> I want the lotion to this and the entire Victoria secret line wish I can give it a ma million stars.</li>
<li> HAS A VERY DELICATE SMELL NOT OVER WHELMING</li>
<li> I have nothing wrong to say.</li>
<li> what else can be said about vickies secret body sprays!</li>
<li> But this one failed in the feminine smell department.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m crazy but it doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberries and champagne.</li>
<li> You can never go wrong with any of these bath and body products!</li>
<li> Hate it doesnt smell anything like strawberries or champagne. .</li>
<li> Very disappointed &#x3D;(</li>
<li> No, I&#x27;m not that cruel.</li>
<li> It smells nasty.</li>

    <li> I love Victoria&#x27;s Secret Garden body sprays! They are so light and floral-y and I always get complimented on my scent. Especially from my bf. But this one failed in the feminine smell department. It actually has a sort of alcoholic, hand-sanitizer type of smell that really didn&#x27;t sit well with me. To make my opinion more credible and less relative: my friends(male &amp;female) actually agreed with me, they weren&#x27;t too fond of the scent. So you might be wondering what I did with the almost brand new bottle after buying and not using it. Regift? No, I&#x27;m not that cruel. Trash? Yes,sort of. I watched my hard earned money flushed down the toilet in the form of the liquid perfume. I still have the container though, it&#x27;s great for filling with water or some other product to spray things with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I direct all those reading this to the Pure Seduction or Love Spell Body Mists instead? I promise you&#x27;ll love those or...I&#x27;m a liar (I&#x27;m really not).</li>
    <li> It talking forever for it to get here&lt;br /&gt;So I give it a 3 but I&#x27;m hopeing it come soon</li>
