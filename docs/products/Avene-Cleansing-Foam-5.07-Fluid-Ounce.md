      <li>Always a favorite product of mine.  </li>
      <li>It does make my face feel nice and clean, and as a cleanser</li>
      <li>This is the most effective but gentle product I have ever encounter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for oily to normal skin.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s been using thermal water based products for years (lived in Europe for a long time) and I&#x27;m glad these are becoming more and more popular in the US.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this cleansing foam: it rinses thoroughly and quickly.</li>
      <li>Good cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am convinced it helps prevent my face from becoming oily and shiny as quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall, this was a nice cleanser though!</li>
      <li>For dry and normal skin would be perfect.</li>
      <li>I apply it full strength than massage in with some water and rinse.  </li>
      <li>Love that this foam style dispenser delivers unto the very end of the contents.  </li>
      <li>I am a full makeup wearer, and still get some blemishes despite being in my mid-40&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than most any other products I&#x27;ve tried yet super effective!</li>
      <li>&#x27;s got sensitive skin with a T zone problem and this product works great on keeping her face oil free in the T zone without drying the skin outside of that.</li>
      <li>Mild but effective, can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
      <li>Amazing cleanser that dries my oily areas, takes off all and any makeup including eye makeup, and seems to make my pores smaller!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin while cleansing it well.</li>
      <li>I bought this with the Avene body oil that I have used for years, this was my first time purchasing the cleanser.  </li>
      <li>smells gentle and fresh.</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser used with the line&#x27;s Mattifying Fluid.</li>
      <li>Very sleek, and just the right amount of product came out each time.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin clean and soft</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, I have dry skin and need product for my face.</li>
      <li>My skin feels thoroughly clean which is a must for me, I have to have a lather on my face in order to feel clean, no creamy no foaming cleansers for me, but I can&#x27;t use soap anymore due to dryness and age.  </li>
      <li>I have really oily skin</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t really think a cleanser would make that much of a difference anyways.</li>
      <li>but after rinsing you notice a very brighter skin.</li>
      <li>I use the Cleansing Foam only in the morning; I tried using it at night but didn&#x27;t find that it got my makeup off very well, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, and after using this cleanser for several weeks, I believe that this cleanser is safe for sensitive skin types as well.</li>
      <li>This product, as well as Avene&#x27;s Mattifying Fluid, is supposed to help suppress oil production, and since I started using them both, my skin does not get very oily by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin either.</li>
      <li>The foam is somewhat thin, and when you rub it into your skin, it kind of disappears.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft &amp; not tight.  </li>
      <li>(I highly recommend Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser).</li>
      <li>Seems very economical to get what you want all the way down to the bottom of the bottle!!</li>
      <li>The first bottle lasted a long time, a couple of months, with twice daily use.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this product has made my (very) oily skin any less oily, but to be honest</li>
      <li>The cleanser comes out foamy due to the type of dispenser, I like this because it applies more evenly with less drag on the skin as would a  gel</li>
      <li>Still gentle, still cleans but leaves it less oily feeling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice product! I just love this brand and it works well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I have dry skin and need product for my face. This is the most effective but gentle product I have ever encounter.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing what it claims to reduce oily T-Zone. I have noticed less shine around my nose, chin and forehead. Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cleanser. I used a glycolic foaming cleansing in the past and it was too harsh and dried face, which is not good for hyper-sensitive skin. But this is the total opposite, it removes make up and leaves your face feeling relaxed and rejuvenated, alone with the Aveene moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using this foam over a month ago! Heaven sent!!!</li>
    <li> Always a favorite product of mine.  Love that this foam style dispenser delivers unto the very end of the contents.  hardly any to pour out and use at the end.  Seems very economical to get what you want all the way down to the bottom of the bottle!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got oily skin, this is an excellent cleanser. I also use the fluide mattifant after my moisturizer.  The combination is unbeatable for controlling oil.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser used with the line&#x27;s Mattifying Fluid. Curtails oil production yet doesn&#x27;t scorch my skin like other oil reducing products I&#x27;ve tried. Amazing cleanser that dries my oily areas, takes off all and any makeup including eye makeup, and seems to make my pores smaller! Great price .... Much cheaper than most any other products I&#x27;ve tried yet super effective!</li>
    <li> I am using this brand for almost 4 years, i have oily acne prone and very delicate skin. this lovely foam cleans my skin without dehydrating or drying out the skin, you dont feel anything but after rinsing you notice a very brighter skin. smells gentle and fresh. very good price on amazon. love u amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff. The first bottle lasted a long time, a couple of months, with twice daily use. I am convinced it helps prevent my face from becoming oily and shiny as quickly. I have really oily skin and I still do get oily midday.</li>
    <li> I had been using the soap-free gel cleanser but it was leaving my skin a bit oily. I have rosacea but also have oily skin on my t-zone. I tried the foam wash and this is a bit better. Still gentle, still cleans but leaves it less oily feeling. My make-up doesn&#x27;t slide off either. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing foam: it rinses thoroughly and quickly. It may seem a bit drying therefore it is good for oily skin. My skin is very sensitive, and after using this cleanser for several weeks, I believe that this cleanser is safe for sensitive skin types as well.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s been using thermal water based products for years (lived in Europe for a long time) and I&#x27;m glad these are becoming more and more popular in the US.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s got sensitive skin with a T zone problem and this product works great on keeping her face oil free in the T zone without drying the skin outside of that. I also use it (I have very oily skin) and it works great. Highly recommended alternative to synthetic products and the usual plant based washers that can sometime create allergies.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser for sensitive skin.  A little drying</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Avene body oil that I have used for years, this was my first time purchasing the cleanser.  I am a full makeup wearer, and still get some blemishes despite being in my mid-40&#x27;s.  The cleanser comes out foamy due to the type of dispenser, I like this because it applies more evenly with less drag on the skin as would a  gel, I also think you use less product.  I apply it full strength than massage in with some water and rinse.  I takes off mascara that isn&#x27;t water proof.  My skin feels thoroughly clean which is a must for me, I have to have a lather on my face in order to feel clean, no creamy no foaming cleansers for me, but I can&#x27;t use soap anymore due to dryness and age.  This does the job, without the harness.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for am cleansing!  Leaves my skin soft &amp; not tight.  Wish I could find this line at local stores instead of buying online.</li>
    <li> I have combination, acne-prone skin.  This product, as well as Avene&#x27;s Mattifying Fluid, is supposed to help suppress oil production, and since I started using them both, my skin does not get very oily by the end of the day.  I use the Cleansing Foam only in the morning; I tried using it at night but didn&#x27;t find that it got my makeup off very well, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean (I highly recommend Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser).</li>
    <li> The best! Always had problem skin, switched to this and it&#x27;s made such a big difference. Mild but effective, can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin clean and soft</li>
    <li> Works perfect with my Mia brush:)</li>
    <li> This cleanser smells divine! And it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin while cleansing it well. It&#x27;s good for oily to normal skin.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for all skin types but especially sensitive. Won&#x27;t strip and dry your face. A must-have in my routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two other Avene facial cleansing products and prefer the foam by far!  I prefer a sudsy cleanser and this delivers without leaving my skin feel dry.</li>
    <li> I loved the packaging of this product. Very sleek, and just the right amount of product came out each time. The foam is somewhat thin, and when you rub it into your skin, it kind of disappears. It does make my face feel nice and clean, and as a cleanser a like it quite a bit. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this product has made my (very) oily skin any less oily, but to be honest, I didn&#x27;t really think a cleanser would make that much of a difference anyways. Overall, this was a nice cleanser though!</li>
    <li> It is great but not for my oily and acne prone skin with pores. For dry and normal skin would be perfect.</li>
