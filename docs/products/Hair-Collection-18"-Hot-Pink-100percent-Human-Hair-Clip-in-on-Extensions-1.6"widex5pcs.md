      <li>The extensions come in a set of 5 - each with its own clip.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love the color!</li>
      <li>Ordering more in more colors, love these!</li>
      <li>Perfect for that extra pop of color to brighten up your look!</li>
      <li>I was able to curl with my hair and add a pop of color.  </li>
      <li>Good purchase, worth the money.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem as long as 18\\&quot;, but for my purposes, they are awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted some pink and decided to give these a try, look great!</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply, and stay in well.</li>
      <li>but I trimmed them to fit in..</li>
      <li>The pink is bright and the quality is great, very soft.</li>
      <li>I wear them pretty much everyday and they are wonderful.</li>
      <li>but they looked spectacular and feel so soft.</li>
      <li>Besides that the color also faded quickly from the sun I&#x27;m assuming because I haven&#x27;t washed them</li>
      <li>They were a great length, I was able to trim them less than 1/2in to get a bit better of a blend as they were about the same length as my hair</li>
      <li>I was able to make it work in the end, so no hard feelings.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the color of the hot pink.  </li>
      <li>They are bright pink as shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>but, they&#x27;re not the bright neon pink in the picture.</li>
      <li>I clipped these into a wig to add some fun</li>
      <li>I loved so much I ordered the blue.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, I would suggest these to others.</li>
      <li>I thought these were so fun.  </li>
      <li>I have hair halfway down my back and these blended in perfectly.  </li>
      <li>At first I was excited because they were supposed to be real hair</li>
      <li>These were easy to use and the long size allowed me to trim to fit.</li>
      <li>The hair itself is high quality, and I&#x27;ve experienced little to no shedding.  </li>
      <li>Would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Color however was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Lots of compliments and people ask if it is real color or not!</li>
      <li>I love that these clip in extensions are human hair.</li>
      <li>Great color too, different from other hot pinks.</li>
      <li>Super soft!</li>
      <li>But some cheap ones you&#x27;ll get the same result</li>
      <li>These hot pink hair extensions look great in dark hair!</li>
      <li>They also aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
      <li>and I would advise everyone to not waste their money on it!</li>
      <li>At any rate, the first thing I did was just stick them in 5 different places on my head and squeal like a 3-year-old.</li>
      <li>the clips are just a little bit more bulky than I would have liked which sometimes makes them difficult to hide in my hair.  </li>
      <li>They are soft.</li>
      <li>and it is true that they felt real however the hair chunks are very small.</li>
      <li>They are more of a red color, not hot pink.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The are not a solid pink and do have some blone undertones so they look natural (as you would bleach first and then apply pink).</li>
      <li>I have black hair and these complemented me very well with highlights.</li>

<li> but they also don&#x27;t send you a receipt with your package which is dumb.</li>
<li> They begin chunky and thin out at the bottom to about 3-4 hairs.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product</li>
<li> They were horrible to attach and did not stay at all.  </li>

    <li> I have hair halfway down my back and these blended in perfectly.  Everyone thought it was my hair.  Ordering more in more colors, love these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the color of the hot pink.  It looks awesome on and so easy to put in.</li>
    <li> I love that these clip in extensions are human hair. That is a hard product to find. I am very, very satisfied with the product. Great color too, different from other hot pinks.</li>
    <li> I Bought Pink,Blue and red i lovee all these colors and the best part is the clips are already sewed in. i will buy more hair from hair collection!</li>
    <li> Really nice quality, easy to wash and came stored great.  the clips are just a little bit more bulky than I would have liked which sometimes makes them difficult to hide in my hair.  They were a great length, I was able to trim them less than 1/2in to get a bit better of a blend as they were about the same length as my hair but the ends will blend great if your hair is longer.  Good purchase, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I thought these were so fun.  I was able to curl with my hair and add a pop of color.  I loved so much I ordered the blue.</li>
    <li> Did not like these at all.  They were horrible to attach and did not stay at all.  Would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Color however was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Very cute. I bought these to wear to the P!nk concert. I ended up not wearing them because they are too long for my hair and I was afraid to cut them, but I will save them for the next concert and hopefully my hair will be longer!!</li>
    <li> These clips were perfect!  They snap into place well, and work perfectly with hot hair styling appliances. I clipped these into a wig to add some fun and they worked in perfectly with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The are not a solid pink and do have some blone undertones so they look natural (as you would bleach first and then apply pink).</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my daughter to wear for a P!nk concert.  Got them on Monday (they were to be delivered Friday).  They are more of a red color, not hot pink.  Sending them back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product and I would advise everyone to not waste their money on it! DO NOT BUY THESE EXTENSIONS! At first I was excited because they were supposed to be real hair and it is true that they felt real however the hair chunks are very small. They begin chunky and thin out at the bottom to about 3-4 hairs. Besides that the color also faded quickly from the sun I&#x27;m assuming because I haven&#x27;t washed them and I only used them about 5 times. I&#x27;m so upset that I spent all this money on this just to throw them away. I wish I could get a refund but they also don&#x27;t send you a receipt with your package which is dumb. But some cheap ones you&#x27;ll get the same result</li>
    <li> Again I ordered and everything was perfect. These extensions I wear every day for over 8 months and they still are perfection. And I put through alot.</li>
    <li> I like the length and the clips on these extensions but, they&#x27;re not the bright neon pink in the picture. They look darker than they should be. They also aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
    <li> These hot pink hair extensions look great in dark hair! (Check out the pic I uploaded to the customer gallery).  The extensions come in a set of 5 - each with its own clip.  The extensions are made from human hair, so you can wash/style them just as you would your own hair.  The hair itself is high quality, and I&#x27;ve experienced little to no shedding.  Perfect for that extra pop of color to brighten up your look!</li>
    <li> They are a little long for my hair but I trimmed them to fit in.. Love, love, love the color! Super soft! We will see how they hold up over time!</li>
    <li> I bought these because my work does not allow &amp;#34;fun hair&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve always wanted some pink and decided to give these a try, look great! Lots of compliments and people ask if it is real color or not!</li>
    <li> These were easy to use and the long size allowed me to trim to fit. Everyone thought I had dyed my hair. One of the clasps was glued upside down, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I was able to make it work in the end, so no hard feelings.</li>
    <li> I love these extensions! I only wore them once for Halloween but they looked spectacular and feel so soft. I can&#x27;t wait to wear them again. The color is not as bright as shown in the picture, which worked in my favor. Definitely buy if you want something edgy but don&#x27;t wanna make commitment.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I bought these because I am not allowed \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; hair color at work, so this was just something \\&quot;fun\\&quot; to do. It took me about 7 minutes to realize how to \\&quot;unclip\\&quot; these things. I swear I have a brain. At any rate, the first thing I did was just stick them in 5 different places on my head and squeal like a 3-year-old. They are beautiful. They are soft. They don&#x27;t seem as long as 18\\&quot;, but for my purposes, they are awesome.</li>
    <li> The extensions arrived in a timely manner, and the quality is great. They are bright pink as shown in the picture. They are easy to apply, and stay in well. You can brush them and they won&#x27;t fall out. I have black hair and these complemented me very well with highlights. You can straighten, curl, and wash. Worth the money, I would suggest these to others. :) Also, no one suspects that they are extensions! Very happy with them!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, easy to put in.</li>
    <li> Love these extensions! I wear them pretty much everyday and they are wonderful. The pink is bright and the quality is great, very soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I am enjoying it!</li>
