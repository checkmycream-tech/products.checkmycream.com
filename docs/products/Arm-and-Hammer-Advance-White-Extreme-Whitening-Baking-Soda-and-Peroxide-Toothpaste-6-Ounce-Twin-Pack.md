      <li>I love Arm and Hammer toothpaste, and I love the two pack convenience offered.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure not everyone will like the flavor, but I like it and thankfully my husband likes it too, so we&#x27;ve been using this for years with no plans to stop anytime soon.</li>
      <li>I get that that is what baking soda tastes like, but they could have tried to cover it up a bit more or something.</li>
      <li>Love arm and hammer.</li>
      <li>I like the mint flavor much better.</li>
      <li>I love my dental hygienist but not the scraping twice yearly for stains.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand of tooth paste....</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Teeth are very clean feeling after.</li>
      <li>I prefer this brand of toothpaste over others, as this feels more *clean</li>
      <li>My teeth have never seemed so clean -- I love this stuff</li>
      <li>It has good whitening action and is pleasant to use (although some people say it stings too much).</li>
      <li>It does a great job of scrubbing the moss and debris from my dental surfaces, leaving them smooth and white, and penetrating the enamel to provide the desired protection.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and I forget to pack my toothpaste, I dread having to use anything else that is available.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my personal use, this is great toothpaste, when included with a purchase of $25.00 the shipping is zero dollars.</li>
      <li>I genuinely feel clean after I use this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used this clean toothpaste.</li>
      <li>With this and the sonic toothbrush, my teeth stay clean.  </li>
      <li>You need toothpaste, might as well use something that makes you feel clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Always leaves your teeth just out of the dentist clean.</li>
      <li>Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White toothpaste has a pleasant taste and adds to my oral health regimen.</li>
      <li>then this doesn&#x27;t contain it and is way cheaper than some of the special brands that boast about not having it in that</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended using a baking soda toothpaste as I have plaque that builds up rather quickly between cleanings.</li>
      <li>However, I do love the baking soda aspect in this toothpaste because I feel like I am giving my teeth a deep clean each time!</li>
      <li>Overall, the smell is nice, it foams up quickly and it seems to help plaque.</li>
      <li>My teeth genuinely feel cleaner and healthier than they ever have, and it is thanks to this stuff...</li>
      <li>This stuff is so powerful, I don&#x27;t have to floss as often...</li>
      <li>Powerful stuff here.  </li>
      <li>Not traditional taste, a little sweet, a bit salty, paste is exquisite,</li>
      <li>I use it regularly to keep my teeth nice and white :)</li>
      <li>The taste from baking soda takes time to get used to, and the texture is noticeably less smooth than most other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpastes, but it truly does its job and, amazingly, does whiten teeth over time.</li>
      <li>This seems strange to type/say, but this is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Great stuff use sparingly or it is pretty tough on teeth.</li>
      <li>This one tastes like pure baking soda.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This stuff makes my teeth really shine.</li>
      <li>If Arm and Hammer made a fluoride free toothpaste that was similar to this one, I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
      <li>Made my teeth hurt on a real level.</li>
      <li>I use this all the time and really like it.</li>
      <li>For myself, don&#x27;t see much change....</li>
      <li>The tube was smaller than what I buy in stores, but its still worth it!</li>
      <li>better than other brands</li>
      <li>Teeth are clean and white.</li>
      <li>Leaves your mouth clean &amp; teeth white</li>
      <li>Of course, my teeth (which are already pretty white) look even whiter, and it freshens breath.</li>
      <li>At night when brushing my teeth, my gums do become somewhat sensitive, but the sensitivity always goes away after I&#x27;m done brushing - no issues with the toothpaste otherwise.</li>
      <li>Fills the local gap in decent toothpastes that does not feel like candy floss being smeared all over the mouth.</li>
      <li>I always buy large amounts of items so I am not ordering the same item in short spans.</li>
      <li>Toothpaste is an individual selection product and most people are reluctant to change brands just to be doing so, but as an &amp;#34;add-on product&amp;#34; you can get two tubes for less than $6 which I like because I use several different brands depending upon how I feel and what I expect from or wish my mouth and teeth to feel like.</li>
      <li>The foaming action leaves my mouth feeling MUCH cleaner than any other toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It refreshes &amp; removes most of the worse stains (coffee &amp; tea).</li>
      <li>My teeth feel cleaner for a much longer time from this Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste than from any other brand.</li>
      <li>After years and years of using other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes to no avail, I was amazed that this one has actually been making a difference in less time, without any extra special treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<ol>
    <li> best for me and very mild taste.</li>
    <li> Seems to work on my brother who always smoking.... For myself, don&#x27;t see much change....</li>
    <li> It may of work well if you can get pass the taste, had to switch back to my Crest.</li>
    <li> Not traditional taste, a little sweet, a bit salty, paste is exquisite, the expected effect</li>
    <li> I always buy large amounts of items so I am not ordering the same item in short spans.</li>
    <li> Just like the store brand.</li>
    <li> Oh now what can I say, it&#x27;s toothpaste folks.  Though for those that have a reaction to Sorbitol like myself etc then this doesn&#x27;t contain it and is way cheaper than some of the special brands that boast about not having it in that are $12-13 for a small tube.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel cleaner for a much longer time from this Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste than from any other brand. Not going back!</li>
    <li> Want whiter teeth? Try this!!!</li>
    <li> good deal on these, saved some money over what they are in the store</li>
    <li> I keep buying this product because it makes my teeth so white! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of commercial toothpaste because of the fluoride content. However, I do love the baking soda aspect in this toothpaste because I feel like I am giving my teeth a deep clean each time! If Arm and Hammer made a fluoride free toothpaste that was similar to this one, I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
    <li> Have not had a noticeable whitening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Arm and Hammer. I love this toothpaste better than the two C name brands out. It is smoother and not so pasty.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth, brighter smile, awesome toothpaste!!! The tube was smaller than what I buy in stores, but its still worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes like you are brushing with salt water. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that kind of taste and it was awful. I also didn&#x27;t realize this came with two tubes of toothpaste, so I&#x27;ve forced myself to get used to it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;m kind of used to the saltiness, but I still don&#x27;t like it at all. I find myself almost gagging afterwards with the aftertaste sometimes. I realize however this stuff is supposed to be really good for your teeth. I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences as of yet, though.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and really like it.</li>
    <li> You need toothpaste, might as well use something that makes you feel clean.</li>
    <li> It has good whitening action and is pleasant to use (although some people say it stings too much).</li>

    <li> What can I say, great tooth paste at a good value. I will never use anything other then a&amp;h toothpaste. Always leaves your teeth just out of the dentist clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended using a baking soda toothpaste as I have plaque that builds up rather quickly between cleanings. I have noticed a difference in the build on my lower teeth since using this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in whitening though. Overall, the smell is nice, it foams up quickly and it seems to help plaque. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I like the mint flavor much better. This one tastes like pure baking soda.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, highly effective and very good tasting Advance white toothpaste. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I buy!  Leaves your mouth clean &amp; teeth white</li>
    <li> I love Arm and Hammer toothpaste, and I love the two pack convenience offered.</li>

    <li> Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White toothpaste has a pleasant taste and adds to my oral health regimen. This is a serious fluoride toothpaste that also aids in the teeth whitening process that is part of that daily regimen. It does this with peroxide and baking soda and I have noted that it leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than usual. Toothpaste is an individual selection product and most people are reluctant to change brands just to be doing so, but as an &amp;#34;add-on product&amp;#34; you can get two tubes for less than $6 which I like because I use several different brands depending upon how I feel and what I expect from or wish my mouth and teeth to feel like.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any other tooth paste. It just works too well! Seriously, when I&#x27;m on vacation or whatever and I forget to pack my toothpaste, I dread having to use anything else that is available. It just doesn&#x27;t work as well. I genuinely feel clean after I use this product.</li>
    <li> Teeth are very clean feeling after.</li>
    <li> Fills the local gap in decent toothpastes that does not feel like candy floss being smeared all over the mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this clean toothpaste. Baking soda is the best! Good deal on this package.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of scrubbing the moss and debris from my dental surfaces, leaving them smooth and white, and penetrating the enamel to provide the desired protection.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth hurt on a real level. Like drooling all over myself because of the pain level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it tasted like ass. I get that that is what baking soda tastes like, but they could have tried to cover it up a bit more or something.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I use it regularly to keep my teeth nice and white :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of tooth paste....</li>
    <li> I love my dental hygienist but not the scraping twice yearly for stains.  With this and the sonic toothbrush, my teeth stay clean.  She urged me to keep using both as it saves her time as well!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for great, whitening toothpaste, and this is one of the best. I feel like it cleans really deep - it leaves my teeth feeling refreshed and deep cleaned. Of course, my teeth (which are already pretty white) look even whiter, and it freshens breath. At night when brushing my teeth, my gums do become somewhat sensitive, but the sensitivity always goes away after I&#x27;m done brushing - no issues with the toothpaste otherwise.</li>
    <li> I just like Arm &amp; Hammer products. This toothpaste works great with my activated charcoal.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, feels good and get teeth and dentures clean.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste out there. The foaming action leaves my mouth feeling MUCH cleaner than any other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Teeth are clean and white. What.</li>
    <li> Powerful stuff here.  I am a firm believer in baking soda in my toothpaste now.  Nothing comes close to how effective this is!  I&#x27;ve always used Crest or Colgate.  Never gave a thought to try arm and hammer.  This stuff is so powerful, I don&#x27;t have to floss as often... how crazy is that?  My teeth genuinely feel cleaner and healthier than they ever have, and it is thanks to this stuff... After trying this... I decided to buy the arm and hammer laundry detergent as well... and I was blown away with that too!  I don&#x27;t use bleach (call it a lazy habit I picked up from my high school boarding school days...) so when I saw my whites come out actually white, which I had not witnessed in several years, I was shocked.  Love arm and hammer.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my teeth really shine. You can just tell it blasts away plaque and polishes teeth.</li>
    <li> I prefer this brand of toothpaste over others, as this feels more *clean*</li>
</ol>
