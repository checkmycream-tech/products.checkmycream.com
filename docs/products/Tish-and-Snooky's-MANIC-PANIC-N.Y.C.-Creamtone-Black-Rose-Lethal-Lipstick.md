<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lipstick, It looks great on me. A most have for fall.</li>
    <li> I I love how creamy it and it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out  it great I will by again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. Although I usually prefer matte lipsticks, the color in this one is absolutely to die for. I wear it often and get lots of compliments on it</li>
    <li> Ever since seeing a shade of dark red on an actress&#x27; lips years ago, I became determined to find the perfect match to it. Many a year and dollar have I spent trying to find this red, and this was one of the many tubes that became part of my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, like other reviewers have mentioned, the title \\&quot;black rose\\&quot; is slightly misleading, but not in the sense they seem to have been misled. I was aware that this would have a \\&quot;rose\\&quot; hue in it (the magenta everyone seems to be commenting on); I was not looking for a red so dark it was nearly black, but merely a very dark red. It&#x27;s more of a berry than a red or burgundy, a few shades off from an Alice In Wonderland lipstick Hot Topic sold back in 2010. It is a beautiful dark berry that I highly recommend, but if you&#x27;re looking for a very dark, pinup red or a red so dark it&#x27;s nearly black, this is neither.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick, it&#x27;s long lasting and matte. The color is so vibrant I only had to apply once.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is my all time favorite! It goes on smooth, and is the color pictured.</li>
    <li> So, a lot of other people seem to be having the same reaction here. The color in this picture looks so dark that it&#x27;s almost black, and that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. However, even looking at the actual product, it is much more red than the picture and upon application is a red-magenta color. It -is- nice lipstick, but it is not what the picture shows and not what I wanted. I was pretty disappointed. No complaints about the seller though.</li>
    <li> The lipstick color is true and exactly what I was looking for at the time. It does not adhere or withstand normal wear and needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
    <li> This lip stick is by far amazing it&#x27;s way better then the lipstick I purchased at sephora. In love with it!</li>
    <li> Great coverage, great colour.  This is a good product that I haven&#x27;t had trouble with it bleeding.  I don&#x27;t get to wear it as often as I like, but it&#x27;s shown me the product won&#x27;t dry out over extended periods.</li>
    <li> The color of this lipstick is absolutely beautiful in my opinion. I bought it knowing that it was lighter than it looked. There really isn&#x27;t any black in it. It&#x27;s more of a very deep berry red I guess you could say.</li>
    <li> This is a little lighter than I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s still a really beautiful color.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have very light ivory skin and this is a very deep burgundy color on me.  It is also a very stay true long lasting lipstick that never runs or bleeds.  Manic Panic is now my favorite lipstick, and I have tried them all over the years.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the name.  Black Rose Burgundy.  I had been looking for a deep burgundy as I used to wear it in the 90&#x27;s.  I LOVE this color.  It is a bit on the plum side but when I line with a BROWN lip liner the burgundy shines through.  I am a Latina Woman of medium skin tone(kind of the shade of Eva Mendez) and this is a great shade for me.  The lipstick itself wears well.  It goes through the morning and into the afternoon.  I do have to retouch around 3 or so.  But to me that is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and quick response</li>
    <li> This product came out very pink / magenta when applied. I have a fair complexion and have difficulty finding colors that are true to their description.This one included. Save your money and don&#x27;t purchase unless you can see the results first. No complaints with the seller, arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Good product and will buy again</li>
    <li> The product is really great, except for the fact that the lipstick is much more red than shown in the picture. I was expecting a really dark red, almost black. I already have colors that look similar to this so thats a bit of a bummer. All in all, the product is really good quality. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great color and pigmentation! Stays on all night!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice lipstick...the color is very rich perfect for fall/winter month&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wife swears by it. I have purchased this several times from Amazon for her. She does look really nice with this lipstick on.</li>
    <li> Expected a darker tint. It&#x27;s actually more of a bright red than a dark reddish purple. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Lovely shade of lipstick in an aesthetically pleasing tube.</li>
    <li> As soon as i got the Manic Panic the lipstick wouldnt slide up. Very cheaply made and now i cannot even try the lipstick on.</li>
    <li> This is the best lipstick I have ever purchased. I get plenty of compliments on the color, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviews on here say this isn&#x27;t true to the color of the picture but it is exactly as the picture shows.. Maybe some people need to fix the color of their monitors or something. Very happy with this lipstick, love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE it! Dark to be sexy,  not scary nor gothic like.  I get compliments left and right.  To make it darker keep adding layers . 2work great for me</li>
    <li> The color was very pretty however, there is nothing matte about this lipstick...it bleeds alot! will not purchase again...I&#x27;m very dissapointed</li>
    <li> Dark, gothy, and beautiful. It certainly looks dramatic, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going for usually. Another great product from Manic Panic.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if reviews come up from other products or what, but I was scared when I read the reviews for this product saying that either it was too purple or too red and people being disappointed saying it was too bright. I worried that this would be a problem, but I bought it anyways, because I love and trust Manic Panic for my hair colors, so why not for my lips? I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. In fact, I was very pleased.The color I received in the mail is EXACTLY as depicted, that deep burgundy red, and it looks gorgeous on me. The texture was perfect and striking. I had previously asked as to whether it stains teeth, and while it does indeed do so, it can be avoided when following the advice other buyers gave me. I LOVE this product and I will be buying much more in the future. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m becoming a loyal customer to Manic Panic.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color, very pigmented, stays on all day and night. This is my new every day lipstick!</li>
    <li> By the picture, one assumes that this is a nice dark red almost black. It&#x27;s not. It was more of a pinky red, which was very disappointing for me. The service was great. Arrived in a timely manner and was sealed and packaged well. The picture is just misleading.</li>
    <li> Amazing, dark, vibrant color, but it is so hard to apply. You need about 5 coats for the full color to pop out.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought this and to make sure it was dark enough for what I wanted, I also bought a black lipstick to wear under it. On its own, it is a beautiful shade, much like Avon&#x27;s discontinued Burgundy Brew. With the black lipstick underneath, it is perfect for a goth princess or vampire seductress and that was what I had been wanting for Halloween. I&#x27;m really glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Looks like a dark berry red on my lips. No complaints!</li>
    <li> When you go to sephora you pay 20+ dollars for Vegan lipstick, Who needs to pay that much for lipstick. I get so many compliments on this lipstick. it is&lt;br /&gt;Vegan, cruelty free, and AWESOME COLOR!! What else could i possibly ask for?? the choices of lipsticks that manic panic provide are beyond amazing. Black Rose is awesome!!. You do have to line your lips and i use a primer but It was a fun and pigmented color.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick. Like other reviews say if you want something that is almost black then this is not the lipstick. This has a nice deep wine color that in my opinion looks stunning. I also love that if I dab on just a little it give my lips a nice stained look. The color has been long lasting in my experience</li>
    <li> Omg...I&#x27;ve been looking  for a deep red...this is it and it stays on pretty good..I love  this lipstick!</li>
    <li> This color looks great on. I have a caramel skin tone and this dark red complimented it! it went on smooth and lasted all night! def a better deal than MAC</li>
    <li> Loved this for fall or Gothic girls, love this deep rich shade . Creamy application and stunning pigment! I would recommend this lipstick.</li>
    <li> Love the texture. I was expecting a darker color  so i was very disapointed also the lipstick it self was damaged. I love the tub it self.</li>
    <li> i am very satisfied with this lipstick</li>
    <li> this is not like the color shown.  On the photo here, it looks blackish / brown.  Its really a dark , deep burgundy red.  Nice shade, which is what I wanted (I read all the other reviews)... I can never find a red in stores that I like, they are all fire engine, or orange.. I need more dark, burgundy purple color in my red..  this is nice.. kind of dries my lips, but I don&#x27;t use it often, and i use a gloss when I do, to prevent the dryness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dark red lipstick for a long time and this is it! It does look best when you put on about two layers of it. I&#x27;ve noticed that it does smear a little if you touch it but it&#x27;s not too bad and you can eat and do your daily activities just fine, you just have to reapply it later. It glides on smoothly and does not leave my lips chapped, which is a major plus because a lot of the lipsticks that I&#x27;ve tried make my lips peel. It is not so dark that it looks almost black but a very nice deep red and if you want it to look even darker then I suggest using a darker lip liner with this lipstick. All in all I recommend it, it looks lovely!</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews.  This is blood red on me... I was hoping for a deep red/burgundy... Its thrown away cause I will never wear it...</li>
    <li> The first time I wore lipstick, I was 35 years old and I&#x27;ve been very skeptical about using them honestly because I thought my lips were too thick. So when I felt daring enough to buy this I followed through because it was a special occasion. I was pleasantly surprised at the coverage, longevity, true-ness and the ease to apply. I absolutely made me look and feel grown!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is really nice and the color is a lot redder in person than what the photo shows but it actually looks nice that way. I got the email saying it shipped yesterday and I got the order today by FedEx before noon! Very satisfied with how quick it came. The only cons with this lip color is that it dries quickly so if you like your lips a little moist, pair with a clear chapstick or gloss. It kind of clots together after a while but the color stays very rich! After drinking a whole water bottle, I still didn&#x27;t even need to reapply. Didn&#x27;t come off on my glass cups either. Very good buy!</li>
    <li> A little difficult to spread on but the shade is exactly right and lasts a while. I love it. It&#x27;s my new go to.</li>
    <li> I liked it, it&#x27;s a pretty color not to dark, but its a little to purple for me. I thought it would be a little more reddish in it, but has more purple. I&#x27;m not disappointed in it I do like it and I would recommend this product to other people. As for me I&#x27;m looking for something more dark red in it.</li>
    <li> Manic panic is my people love them this lipstick is wicked I love it so much I will be seeing u soon thanks a bunch</li>
    <li> I was afraid that this wasn&#x27;t going to be dark enough, but it turned out perfect. Ready to bring to bring the vamp look back!</li>
    <li> way too expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> Not as dark. False advertisement</li>
    <li> I just love this product!  I usually can&#x27;t stand lipstick, because of how weird and heavy it feels on my lips.  This is the first lipstick I&#x27;ve used where I liked the color AND couldn&#x27;t feel it while wearing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative:  It -does- wear off occasionally, but no worse than any other lipstick.  :)  If wearing out for a day, I suggest taking it along, just in case.</li>
    <li> I like the color. It&#x27;s a great candidate to use for ombre lips - dark to bright red.</li>
    <li> This lipstick gives me life!! The color is so demure and sexy.. It stays forever on my lips and it&#x27;s easy to apply, I would defiantly order this again...yessss</li>
    <li> This lipstick is amazing. It&#x27;s so pretty. Deep red, I wear it with NYX Deep Purple lip liner. Its creamy and blends well.</li>
    <li> So pretty. Dark lined eyes and this colour make a statement</li>
    <li> a pretty case &amp; good color, better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Met more then my expectations!!&#x27; Quick delivery!!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. I used it with the Manic Black and it worked really well together to give me some interesting dark ombre dracula lips for Halloween. This Rose Burgundy has very deep pigment - very satisfying.</li>
    <li> The lipstick was damaged when I got it. The top of the lipstick case ruined the actual lipstick and it got stuck. I figured the damage wasn&#x27;t too bad but when I reopened the lipstick top the entire lipstick came out. I was so bummed.</li>
