      <li>Very  good item.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with this purchase and after a year, I still recommend this item.</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT</li>
      <li>This is a great trimmer.</li>
      <li>and the light was excellent.</li>
      <li>It is a good value for the money.</li>
      <li>I find the build quality rather good with this one.</li>
      <li>I AM VERY PLEASED</li>
      <li>This latest model is great.</li>
      <li>Nice, but doesn&#x27;t get too close</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still loving this trimmer.</li>
      <li>The light is a good addition.</li>
      <li>Light weight, agile, light at the head comes in very handy ....</li>
      <li>The light is also a great help to get the job done quickly.</li>
      <li>There are probably better products out there.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>more than you might think.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion Conair seems to make a slightly better product which is why I went with the Conair brand.</li>
      <li>I have tried several trimmers and the Conair&#x27;s brand suits me the best.</li>
      <li>My house does not have sufficient lighting, so the LED light lit up my hairs nicely.</li>
      <li>I no longer have to tell my husband, &amp;#34;Move more into the light, so I can see what I am doing, without van Goghing your ear.&amp;#34;  You can even detach the head for cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the older model and even more with this newer model.</li>
      <li>I then purchased Conair clippers and they are still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Plowed through my hair just fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>Works fine, just what my husband wanted/needed</li>
      <li>This will get fine hairs, eventually.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t fit into nostrils.</li>
      <li>One unit didn&#x27;t work except for the light coming on.</li>
      <li>Some brainchild came up with the idea of attaching a light to this trimmer.  </li>
      <li>IT EVEN HAS A LIGHT</li>
      <li>After 1 day of use, so far so good.</li>
      <li>The light is also very very helpful!</li>
      <li>I liked the single head better but this works.</li>
      <li>As I got older the hairs  got more noticeable.</li>
      <li>This is why I come to Amazon first every time!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Arrived not long after ordering and returning the item was very easy.</li>
      <li>The light is a nice feature, and so far it&#x27;s worked well for several uses and hasn&#x27;t needed the battery changed.</li>
      <li>And, that is exactly what I bought it for</li>
      <li>One worked very well, my husband loves it!</li>
      <li>Single blade is much better.</li>
      <li>The head of the unit is too large-</li>
      <li>I am very please with this nose and ear trimmer.  </li>
      <li>the light make it a bit bigger but does help you see.</li>
      <li>All I want it to do is to trim my nose hairs not give me a shave nor trim my eyebrows and that is what it does very well.</li>
      <li>SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHAT YOU ARE TRIMMING...</li>
      <li>My old one was a single blade and worked better.</li>
      <li>I went with the Conair because I had previously purchased Whal clippers and worked OK but did not hold up.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was kind of silly to include the light</li>
      <li>These nose trimmers are not usually made very well</li>
      <li>This is ok, but it has not turned on at various times for no apparent reason (has not been dropped and is fairly new).  </li>
      <li>Good basic all around small trimmer, which comes with built in mini light - that I did not expect, to bad it is not rechargeable, other than that it is a good quality mini trimmer that I recommend!</li>
      <li>Works great for nose, for ears a little small, it takes a while but does work.</li>
      <li>Overall, the trimmer does feel cheaply made and who knows how long it will last.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Give only 2 stars because it was made to trim hair much denser than mine.</li>
      <li>It took me about a minutes to cut both nostrils and it was done 100% complete.</li>
      <li>has double openings for shearing and this prevents cutting edge from becoming as effective as it could be if it had only one edge to initiate contact with hairs</li>
      <li>The flat head on this unit, instead of the round tips on other brands, is so much easier to maneuver and be precise and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; as much.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t overall impressed, but at least it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
      <li>Two days later a new one was on the doorstep.</li>
      <li>not like my old of similar designed that died.  </li>
      <li>but it really makes it easy to see what you are cutting.</li>

<li> Works well, but be aware of the design: I bought this to replace a rotary trimmer, and that devices round head made for pretty simple cutting.</li>
<li> I see some mixed reviews but maybe these people never used other models.</li>
<li> The only complaints are the trimmer head could be a little bit larger, and it did not come with a plastic cover for the blade.</li>

<li> I HAD TROUBLE WITH TRIMMERS THAT WERE TOO WIDE.</li>
<li> I have owned one previously but somewhere between moving and divorce</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent plenty of money on others that were over priced and complicated to use with various attachments.  </li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> This thing, having a flat cutting blade, might have to be rotated several times to make the needed trims.</li>
<li> but i will go back to the other cutting head for nose and ears</li>
<li> This one barely cuts anything..a disappointment.</li>
<li> not like the one i had this one its hard to get close to the hair</li>
<li> They cut but is hard to work</li>
<li> The type of blade setup on the Conair is the proper setup for cutting nose hair.</li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m not going slow enough.&lt;br /&gt;Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this trimmer is not nearly as good as my husband&#x27;s previous Conair.</li>
<li> I have the Norelco and it is not only expensive but sucks at cutting.</li>
<li> Sucks!</li>
<li> Upon arrival which took forever it was broken.</li>
<li> sorry I bought it.</li>
<li> and nothing is wrong.</li>
<li> Works well but awkward to use.</li>
<li> Piece of crap.</li>

    <li> I liked the single head better but this works.</li>
    <li> Works well, but be aware of the design: I bought this to replace a rotary trimmer, and that devices round head made for pretty simple cutting. This thing, having a flat cutting blade, might have to be rotated several times to make the needed trims.

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> We ordered 2. One worked very well, my husband loves it! The flat head on this unit, instead of the round tips on other brands, is so much easier to maneuver and be precise and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; as much. The light is also a great help to get the job done quickly. One unit didn&#x27;t work except for the light coming on. Instant replacement from Amazon!!! Two days later a new one was on the doorstep. Even before the non-functioning one arrived back. This is why I come to Amazon first every time!</li>
    <li> This will get fine hairs, eventually. It takes a lot of swiping and turning to finally cut some, however. I wasn&#x27;t overall impressed, but at least it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
    <li> As I got older the hairs  got more noticeable. I have tried several trimmers and the Conair&#x27;s brand suits me the best. They are affordable and they last a long time. This latest model is great. The light is a good addition. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this did not trim that well in the nose!</li>
    <li> As advertised. Does the job it is supposed to do. Recommended buy.</li>
    <li> Good basic all around small trimmer, which comes with built in mini light - that I did not expect, to bad it is not rechargeable, other than that it is a good quality mini trimmer that I recommend!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this trimmer is not nearly as good as my husband&#x27;s previous Conair. This one barely cuts anything..a disappointment. We&#x27;re looking for something else.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I see some mixed reviews but maybe these people never used other models. I have the Norelco and it is not only expensive but sucks at cutting. It takes me almost 10 minutes to get things cut and then they are not even trimmed well. The type of blade setup on the Conair is the proper setup for cutting nose hair. It is a similar to the blades on hair clippers. It took me about a minutes to cut both nostrils and it was done 100% complete. No missed hairs. The light is also very very helpful! I thought it was kind of silly to include the light but it really makes it easy to see what you are cutting. These nose trimmers are not usually made very well so don&#x27;t expect it to last 20 years. I find the build quality rather good with this one.</li>
    <li> I am very please with this nose and ear trimmer.  It is a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival which took forever it was broken. Piece of crap.</li>
    <li> tried this unit as it had a different cutting head ,works ok but i will go back to the other cutting head for nose and ears</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine.  I just need to get use to it.</li>
    <li> This works well. the light make it a bit bigger but does help you see.</li>
    <li> Do not like the double blades. My old one was a single blade and worked better.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!!</li>
    <li> Some brainchild came up with the idea of attaching a light to this trimmer.  I no longer have to tell my husband, &amp;#34;Move more into the light, so I can see what I am doing, without van Goghing your ear.&amp;#34;  You can even detach the head for cleaning.  Now, how kewl is that?  The only complaints are the trimmer head could be a little bit larger, and it did not come with a plastic cover for the blade.</li>
    <li> Very  good item. I am happy with this purchase and after a year, I still recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Just like the product description says this is a nose and ear trimmer.  That is all it does.  And, that is exactly what I bought it for and I love it.  Works great.  I went with the Conair because I had previously purchased Whal clippers and worked OK but did not hold up.  I then purchased Conair clippers and they are still going strong.  In my opinion Conair seems to make a slightly better product which is why I went with the Conair brand.</li>
    <li> Works fine, just what my husband wanted/needed</li>
    <li> Just gets the job done.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR....PERFECT....PERFECT....IT EVEN HAS A LIGHT SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHAT YOU ARE TRIMMING...</li>
    <li> Give only 2 stars because it was made to trim hair much denser than mine. I think it would probably do well with a lot of hair.  Seems to be sturdy made. Arrived not long after ordering and returning the item was very easy. I would recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to cut longer hair. Maybe I&#x27;m not going slow enough.&lt;br /&gt;Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have owned one previously but somewhere between moving and divorce I managed to loose it too. I was very pleased with the older model and even more with this newer model. All I want it to do is to trim my nose hairs not give me a shave nor trim my eyebrows and that is what it does very well. If I ever loose this one (not due to divorce this time) I will definitely order another Conair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I HAD TROUBLE WITH TRIMMERS THAT WERE TOO WIDE. THE CONAIR TWIM TRIM WAS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR  I AM VERY PLEASED THE TRIMMER</li>
    <li> Nice, but doesn&#x27;t get too close</li>
    <li> Does not trim close and freezes up all the time.  Waste of money and I ordered a different one to replace it.</li>
    <li> This is ok, but it has not turned on at various times for no apparent reason (has not been dropped and is fairly new).  The double blade and angle you have to apply it is not the greatest.  There are probably better products out there.</li>
    <li> They cut but is hard to work</li>
    <li> has double openings for shearing and this prevents cutting edge from becoming as effective as it could be if it had only one edge to initiate contact with hairs</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim all that well....not like my old of similar designed that died.  It will do, I guess.</li>
    <li> After 1 day of use, so far so good. Plowed through my hair just fine and the light was excellent. My house does not have sufficient lighting, so the LED light lit up my hairs nicely. Overall, the trimmer does feel cheaply made and who knows how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 years later now and nothing is wrong. I&#x27;m still loving this trimmer.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim as I had hoped it would</li>
    <li> Sucks! Doesn&#x27;t trim well at all! Single blade is much better.</li>
    <li> Thought it would get all the nose hairs,.  Don&#x27;t like it and sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is great for ears!  Light weight, agile, light at the head comes in very handy ....more than you might think.  I&#x27;ve spent plenty of money on others that were over priced and complicated to use with various attachments.  This is simple and works well.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> not like the one i had this one its hard to get close to the hair</li>
    <li> The head of the unit is too large- doesn&#x27;t fit into nostrils. Also no blades on the side of the head. Probably works for ears.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Works great for nose, for ears a little small, it takes a while but does work.</li>
    <li> Works well but awkward to use.</li>
    <li> motor burnt out after two weeks</li>
