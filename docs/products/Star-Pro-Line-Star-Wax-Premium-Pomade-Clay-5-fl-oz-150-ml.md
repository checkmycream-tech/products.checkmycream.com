      <li>It also smells great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t review many products, but this is the best hair gel/pomade/etc I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things over the years.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is great pomade at a very reasonable value!!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>The Star Pro Premium Pomade, Clay parabens aside, is quite a nice hair product.</li>
      <li>And might even be good for those who want more body in their hair.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice amount of hold without looking greasy or unnatural.</li>

      <li>Smells nice and even though the scent is initially strong it does fade which is good.</li>
      <li>But, for it to really work magic you need to have your hair at the perfect</li>
      <li>product, regardless of how well it does or does not work, smells very strong.</li>
      <li>This was is pretty good!</li>
      <li>I have been using Crew Fiber for years and really liked it, but this product in my opinion is better.</li>
      <li>This Star Wax Clay smells great, has a strong but still workable hold, won&#x27;t sweat out during the day, and leaves my hair feeling strong and healthy between uses (something about the sea salt and jojoba oil).</li>
      <li>It smells great, works well, and rinses out pretty well.</li>
      <li>First of all, the hold is great.</li>
      <li>It smells great, works well, and rinses out pretty well.</li>
      <li>Pretty great stuff.</li>
      <li>The nice thing about the Star Pro Clay is you get a 5 ounce jar of the stuff; most hair products are 2.5 or so ounces which is fine</li>
      <li>I need to buy some more</li>
      <li>but this should be considered as one of the top brands.</li>
      <li>Better yet, it&#x27;s an almost identical product.</li>
      <li>B000142NMI Murray&#x27;s Superior Hair Dressing Pomade]] and [[ASIN:B00GMPEAJO Soft Sheen Sportin Waves Gel Pomade with Wavitrol - 3.5 Ounce (3 Pack)]] had good all-</li>
      <li>so glad I tried this.</li>
      <li>Better yet, it&#x27;s an almost identical product.</li>
      <li>It has semi shine but more of a matte look.</li>
      <li>It seems better to me that way,</li>
      <li>for more of an old-school gloss.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be aware that all clay pomades, in exchange for superior hold, need this extra effort to be their best.</li>
      <li>I find that it works best on dry hair.</li>
      <li>It is quite strong and not all that appealing.</li>
      <li>Apparently, it smells good to the people i tell to sniff my hair!</li>
      <li>The complexity of removing it from hair is what makes me love this stuff: easy to put on, easy to take off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an incredible product especially for it being a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; type product.</li>
      <li>This clay was easy to work with and didn&#x27;t pull or tug on my hair.</li>
      <li>All natural, applies nicely, rinses off hands easily, holds hair in place all day, and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It easily washes off your hair and hands.</li>
      <li>, this is strong stuff.  </li>
      <li>Some have said it&#x27;s not too strong</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say the Redken was a strong hold, and the Star Pro Line Clay is a medium hold or thereabouts.</li>
      <li>Way to strong a scent.</li>
      <li>For those of you who don&#x27;t like strongly scented hair products look elsewhere because the Star Pro Clay has a strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>It promises strong hold and a matte finish, and that&#x27;s what you get.</li>
      <li>It gives great hold, allows you to shape your hair and best of all let&#x27;s your hair look dry unlike most other products.</li>
      <li>The Story:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used plenty of cheap pomades, looking for an easy way out when it comes to hair styling.</li>
      <li>StarWax is a fantastic and premium product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the top 2 pomades which if you use pomades know what I&#x27;m talking about, and this seems much better in terms of being a more complete product.</li>
      <li>The recommended brands I tried just didn&#x27;t have what it took, the cheap water-based pomades like [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Provides great control for longer hair, put some in the middle of your palm, rub hands together and work through your hair.  </li>
      <li>i found the smell to be overpowering and like a cheap cologne.</li>
      <li>According to Star Pro&#x27;s website, the newest version claims to be paraben free, and it is indeed paraben free according to the ingredients.</li>
      <li>as I used it it seemed like a much better pomade with a nice thick consistency that spread evenly throughout the hair and kept a great hold throughout the day.</li>
      <li>B002VA4FUS AXE Shine Pomade, Smooth Look, 2.64 Ounce (</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s nice and masculine with a bit of woodsy smell that many women have noticed.</li>
      <li>I was extremely impressed with the performance and the fact that even in 90 degree heat, it still remained strong enough to hold a nice loose pompadour that I could hand comb all day.</li>
      <li>For shine, I use a light hair cream under the pomade like [[ASIN:B000GG16QA Brylcreem Hair Cream Original - 5.5 Oz.]]</li>
      <li>I moved to NYC a couple of months ago and the guy at the barbershop on my block tried to sell me the Original formula.</li>
      <li>Star Wax | Premium Pomade, Original, by Star Pro Line - 5 fl.</li>
      <li>There are many other products out there, but I&#x27;ve found this one to be perfect for managing my thick hair as well as being a great value.</li>
      <li>There are many great clays/waxes out there, and I haven&#x27;t tried but a few of them, so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Meh. It doesn&#x27;t have any holding power at all and it has that greasy feel without the gloss. If you are rocking the undercut look and you want something that makes your hair &#x27;moldable&#x27;, go with Gatsby Air Rise.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheapo perfume.  There are much better products out there:  American Crew, Gatsby, etc</li>
    <li> StarWax is a fantastic and premium product. All natural, applies nicely, rinses off hands easily, holds hair in place all day, and smells amazing. I was using BedHead&#x27;s Matte Wax before this, and in all fairness to BedHead, it does a similarly great job - but it doesn&#x27;t have the extra niceties that StarWax has, like the all-natural composition and the great smell (to be clear: BedHead has a neutral smell, not a bad one). There are many great clays/waxes out there, and I haven&#x27;t tried but a few of them, so I won&#x27;t pretend like this review is a result of exhaustive analysis. I can say that StarWax leaves me wanting for nothing as far as a hair product goes and I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Is is my favorite product in the line by far! This works so well in my hair. I highly recommend getting this guy&#x27;s it is 5 oz and goes a long way try it out!</li>
    <li> I love this pomade clay from Star Wax! It leaves your hair in place, matte finish with a great scent. It easily washes off your hair and hands. My hair is short on the sides and about 5 inches on top. I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments from the ladies!</li>
    <li> When I found Redken&#x27;s Rough Clay 20, it was a match made in heaven. I bought it every time I got a haircut from the salon I use and I never needed anything else. Then, as it often happens, my beloved product was discontinued and Redken didn&#x27;t replace it with anything similar. I&#x27;ve spent the last five years looking for a product that could duplicate the properties of Rough Clay to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At long last, I&#x27;ve found something that&#x27;s incredibly similar in this Star Wax Premium Clay. When you open the jar—which is quite large, more than double the amount you&#x27;ll get with most other products—you notice that the consistency of the product is almost identical to that of the Redken Rough Clay 20. It&#x27;s very thick, almost looking like actual clay, and matte. There&#x27;s absolutely zero shine to it, which was something I always look for in a product as many of them tend to make my hair look greasy and unclean. My hair is currently cut into something derivative of a pompadour—longer on top and buzzed on the back and sides with a very minimal amount of fading in between—so the amount that I used was roughly the size of my thumbnail. I put it into my hands, rubbed them together to warm it up a little bit, then combed it into my hair using my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold isn&#x27;t quite as strong as the Redken Rough Clay 20, but it&#x27;s close. I&#x27;d say the Redken was a strong hold, and the Star Pro Line Clay is a medium hold or thereabouts. Aside from the difference in the strength of the hold, styling my hair with the clay was like stepping into a time machine. It felt so much like Rough Clay 20 that I was so relieved for my search to be over. Yes, I&#x27;m aware this sounds dramatic, but we all have those products we love and become heartbroken when they&#x27;re taken away. Using this Star Wax Premium Clay ended a search that lasted several years for me, so I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is that I wish the hold were a bit stronger, but considering this is the closest I&#x27;ve ever come to Redken Rough Clay 20 and it&#x27;s almost an identical product otherwise, I&#x27;m not going to deduct a star for that. The hold is still adequate, especially with a light spritz of hairspray. It&#x27;s great for sculptural styles in which you would normally have trouble getting your hair to go or do what you want. Once the product &amp;#34;sets,&amp;#34; it looks much like you would expect a pomade-type product to look, giving your hair great texture and definition, but without that shininess that can quickly make your hair look dirty. What&#x27;s more, the Star Wax Premium Clay washes off your hands and out of your hair extremely easily, which I always appreciate; I&#x27;ve been frustrated at having to use half a bottle of shampoo before to get a product out of my hair, but this Star Wax Premium Clay washes out like conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product has fragrance in it. It smells like a men&#x27;s cologne. And it&#x27;s not a smell that will remind you of cologne vaguely, but rather it smells like it was made with some men&#x27;s cologne added to the mixture. I don&#x27;t personally have an issue with that and I find that it smells pretty good, especially compared to the awful smell that some products out there have, but other reviewers have disliked the smell, calling it overpowering or saying that it makes the product smell like a cheap body spray. Again, I really don&#x27;t mind it and find that of all the smells that could be radiating ever-so-slightly from my head, I certainly don&#x27;t mind this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: Price. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other products out there, but I&#x27;m a big believe in the old adage, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; And with this Star Wax Premium Clay, you&#x27;re also getting more than 2x&#x27;s the amount that you get from most other lines, so I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s even more value to be had here with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you were a fan of the Redken Rough Clay 20 or the Stephen Knoll New York matte clay that was also discontinued not long ago, this is going to be the best replacement that you&#x27;ll find. Better yet, it&#x27;s an almost identical product. It&#x27;s got plenty of hold—though the hold can easily be supplemented with hairspray—and is a joy to work with as you style your hair. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering and it washes out easily. Also, it has great longevity, lasting me throughout the day and even in very humid conditions. I even sweat a little bit in 90-degree heat today and my hair still looked just as it did when I put the product in this morning. If this sounds good to you, look no further. This Star Pro Line Premium Clay is now my go-to styling product and is the only clay/pomade/sculpting wax that I&#x27;ll ever buy.... until it inevitably gets discontinued, too.ng ago, this is going to be the best replacement that you&#x27;ll find.

    <li> This was is pretty good! My wife loves the smell and it works with my hair well. I have medium to thick hair and I spike my hair up and it holds my hair in place. I would say it could be a little more firm as it does not hold the front of my hair (right above the forehead) as well together as my other product. Overall, I would recommend this product and I reordered this product a second time as it does work well and the smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> Works really well, especially for messy, wild styles. Good amount of product. Smells nice and even though the scent is initially strong it does fade which is good. I have really stubborn, coarse hair especially the shorter it is but this product does an excellent job taming it and styling it how I like.  If you apply it to wet hair it will maintain a bit of shine for that &#x27;wet&#x27; look.</li>
    <li> consistency is thick.. better than american crew fiber. smell is bad tho, good matte finish. i have thick hair, i usually style the top in a faux hawk, the sides are short, works well, but need to (like with all the products) keep the moisture or dampness good.  It washes out easy with no problem, and the container is huge too should last a while, but i&#x27;d be lying if i said this was the only thing i used.</li>
    <li> NOTE: Before you continue to read this review, I received the old version of this product. According to Star Pro&#x27;s website, the newest version claims to be paraben free, and it is indeed paraben free according to the ingredients. However, the old version contains propylparaben which for those who don&#x27;t know is the nasty paraben. So why the five stars then? I&#x27;m pretty young, healthy and not particularly worried about a single tub of hair product giving me cancer. For those of you who are very, very health conscious and want to avoid parabens like the plague, you may wish to steer clear until Igius gets this resolved. I will be contacting Amazon/Igius shortly after this review. I am hoping they could get the stock issue fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product itself. The Star Pro Premium Pomade, Clay parabens aside, is quite a nice hair product. It&#x27;s packaged pretty minimally, brown and tan color scheme; nothing you can&#x27;t see in the photo. Who buys a hair product for its packaging though right? You care about what&#x27;s inside. The nice thing about the Star Pro Clay is you get a 5 ounce jar of the stuff; most hair products are 2.5 or so ounces which is fine but they can run out fast. Yeah it&#x27;s twice the price so it&#x27;s really just the price of two products for the amount of two products but in one container. I don&#x27;t know. It seems better to me that way, just my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed upon opening this product is the scent. Some have said it&#x27;s not too strong but I disagree the scent karate kicks you in the nostrils when opening it and I can smell it through the whole day; the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to fade easily. Despite this, I like it because this stuff smells GOOD. It has a very masculine, clean cologne like smell. Heck if this was a cologne I would buy it. For those of you who don&#x27;t like strongly scented hair products look elsewhere because the Star Pro Clay has a strong fragrance. A good fragrance, but strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay is a pretty tough consistency; you&#x27;ll get a bit of an arms workout getting this stuff in your hair. I feel it&#x27;s a very dry product; it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy in any way. For those of you who have used American Crew Fiber, it feels drier than that which feels odd when in your hands and getting it in your hair, and you might think \\&quot;How is this going to hold?\\&quot; but it does, and it does well. Once in the hair, it appears slightly white but this goes away upon styling. I use a comb to pull the front of my hair back similar to a pompadour but shorter and this has been more of a struggle with the Star Pro Line yet, somehow, it always ends up in the right place. I don&#x27;t know how this phenomena occurs but it does. Despite being strong and a little tough to work with, the product does what you want it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, step in the shower, rinse and shampoo and it comes off relatively nicely. I will admit, it&#x27;s not the cleanest rinsing one I&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s no Murrays Pomade or classic product that won&#x27;t come out of your hair short of a flamethrower. If I had to put a scale to it, 10 being comes off completely and a 1 being \\&quot;Oh my god what is this gorilla glue?!\\&quot; it&#x27;s about an 8. I think a clarifying shampoo (Suave sells a daily one cheap as dirt) would really assist with product removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Star Pro Clay hs a lot going for it. It smells great, works well, and rinses out pretty well. The issue is the paraben thing which at this point doesn&#x27;t bug me, but if I keep getting old stock when I re-order then it will become a problem but I am going to try to resolve this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6/26/2014: I have discovered that this product works WAY better when your hair is slightly damp. I&#x27;ve battled with it&#x27;s tough consistency dry but every so slightly damp hair helps to comb it a lot if you prefer to style it as such. This also does not cause the product to harden, it will dry exactly the same.consistency; you&#x27;ll get a bit of an arms workout getting this stuff in your hair.

    <li> I have a review of this product on my YouTube channel. It&#x27;s an incredible product especially for it being a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; type product. I was extremely impressed with the performance and the fact that even in 90 degree heat, it still remained strong enough to hold a nice loose pompadour that I could hand comb all day. My names roger gillespie. Find my YouTube channel!</li>
    <li> Way to strong a scent. Great hold. But, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve used the top 2 pomades which if you use pomades know what I&#x27;m talking about, and this seems much better in terms of being a more complete product. It was the main selling point that brought me to this product which is that it is paraben-free and formaldehyde-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I used it it seemed like a much better pomade with a nice thick consistency that spread evenly throughout the hair and kept a great hold throughout the day. The smell where some reviews said they don&#x27;t like, I loved it, it&#x27;s nice and masculine with a bit of woodsy smell that many women have noticed. Not overpowering or dull instead it&#x27;s a fresh smell. Another plus is how well it washes off even with just water and little bit of rough rubbing. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down afterwards either and you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;ve had product in your hair except the occasional whiff of the nice fragrance you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a nice big 5oz container which is also a plus because it seems to last 2x longer than most 3oz pomades even though it is only 67% more. You need less of this product to be effective. Less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great item from a nice company who stands behind their products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crew Fiber for years and really liked it, but this product in my opinion is better. Goes on well with good shine free hold that lasts and also I think because of the actual clay in it really makes your hair look even thicker (which is appreciated when you are 40 years old!). Like some other reviewers I agree the smell is a little bit strong when you first get it, but either it dissipates as you use it or I have gotten use to it, because I don&#x27;t really notice it now. Regardless, a very good product that has replaced Crew Fiber on my bathroom counter. Also, the container is definitely bigger than most as others have pointed out, so it is reasonable for the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Use it when your hair is dry if you want a matte finish.  It traps the existing moisture of damp hair and retains that shine all day if you use when your hair is wet</li>
    <li> Great scent and good texture for my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I used Hanz de fuko, american crew and other products before. But no product like STAR PRO LINE STAR WAX PREMIUM POMADE , CLAY.  this is the best product ever. Its exactly what i needed. I love it !!!!</li>
    <li> I have flat Asian hair and this works GREAT! My hair is about 3 inches and I can put it up and keep it holding all day long. Plus it smells good like cologne. The amount you get for the price you pay cannot be beaten. There are other good brands out there but this should be considered as one of the top brands. I find that it works best on dry hair. The hold is stronger since dry hair is not heavy like wet or damp hair. My hair used to be 6 inches long and it worked great then also. It has semi shine but more of a matte look. I recommend this product because I definitely will purchase it again once I run out.</li>
    <li> This product works exceptionally well! At first, I was a little hesitant to try this product out, but I am glad I did. This clay was easy to work with and didn&#x27;t pull or tug on my hair. The scent is a light cologne smell, but it wasn&#x27;t over powering or too masculine. I would definitely suggest this product if you are looking for a good hold for that messy quiff or pompadour without the shine. The matte finish looked awesome as it didn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most other products I have used. Yes, its 25 bucks, but you get 5 oz!!! most high quality hair products go for the same price, but half the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Use a blow dryer to create the shape of your hair then apply a small amount. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> first of all I don&#x27;t review items normally so take it or leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product, regardless of how well it does or does not work, smells very strong. i found the smell to be overpowering and like a cheap cologne. as for the effectiveness of the product itself, it is matte like they say but as for the hold, it left my hair flat and lifeless. i used this product on completely dry hair, some say it is better on damp hair. i am trying to find a replacement for gatby technical clay, which i love, but does not wash out very well.</li>
    <li> Great product if a little bit on the expensive side.  You only need to us a bit so the canister goes a long way. Since it&#x27;s clay based it washes out easily which is great. It  needs to be used sparingly or it will leave your hair looking dull.</li>
    <li> This product has great hold and does a great job of keeping my style throughout the day. The only small drawback of the product in my opinion is the smell. It&#x27;s very pungent which is why I reccomend using small amounts of the product. Overall it gets the job done for me and my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Feels great in my hair and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for a few days. The Best! It&#x27;s everything they claim it to be. I need to buy some more it&#x27;s so good.</li>
    <li> Both this and the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; star wax are easy to wash out and holds the style the entire time. Def would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I checked out reviews of other products I&#x27;ve used and were looking to order, otherwise I would not have ventured to try Star Wax Pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used Bed Head hair wax, which is still a great product in itself, but this stuff is just so much cleaner.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering (Bed Head&#x27;s is pretty potent, but not a bad fragrance) and this also cleans off your hands in record timing compared to basically any other hair product I&#x27;ve used, plus your hands actually feel clean when you&#x27;re done with no residue remaining.  I&#x27;ve also noticed it does not take me as long to style my hair and I don&#x27;t need as much product.  Both of those are huge pluses in my book, especially being in a rush in the morning during the work week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already using something in the price range of $10-$15 for 2.5/3oz of product that is in the same pomade/wax category, take the chance and pick Star Wax up.</li>
    <li> Great hold and washes out with ease</li>
    <li> I moved to NYC a couple of months ago and the guy at the barbershop on my block tried to sell me the Original formula. He was super-enthusiastic about it, but since I’m new to pomades/waxes and hair styling products in general (used to use a bit of hairspray several years back, and nothing since) I was a bit weary about trying out something as thick as a wax, especially because I have relatively fine hair. So I google’d it and after reading the reviews and the information on their website, I decided to give it a try... I went back to my barber and opted for the Clay because I definitely did NOT want my hair glistening. I must admit I’m so glad I tried this. The name “wax” is almost misleading here because it’s so gentle on your hair and pretty much as easy to wash off as hairspray, yet the holding power is just a different class. So thankful for my barber, the people who took their time to review the other Star Waxes here on Amazon (super helpful!), and of course the Star Pro Line team for finally making my hair look as good as it should.</li>
    <li> Great product! Provides great control for longer hair, put some in the middle of your palm, rub hands together and work through your hair.  For thicker hair it allows for managability that you don&#x27;t get from a lot of products.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice amount of hold without looking greasy or unnatural. A little bit goes a long way so this may very well last me a lifetime. :)</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair looking good all day without making it shine or look oily.  It just looks natural, like there&#x27;s nothing in it.  I can&#x27;t speak to the other clay pomades out there because this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried, but this one is worth it.  I don&#x27;t review many products, but this is the best hair gel/pomade/etc I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things over the years.</li>
    <li> Could not really work this product in and would pull hair. Not for me. 3 stars for smell, quantity/packaging, and customer service.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair greasy after washing it. I&#x27;d have to shampoo my hair two or three times to get all the product out. More of a waxy residue left in hair which is hard to get out</li>
    <li> Pretty great stuff. The complexity of removing it from hair is what makes me love this stuff: easy to put on, easy to take off.</li>
    <li> This particular product from Star Pro Line is the best I&#x27;ve used. My hair is very thick and very straight, so finding a product that can style my hair into something presentable has always  been a hassle. This Star Wax Clay smells great, has a strong but still workable hold, won&#x27;t sweat out during the day, and leaves my hair feeling strong and healthy between uses (something about the sea salt and jojoba oil). Do not be intimidated by the price. You get FIVE whole ounces of the stuff. That&#x27;s TWICE as much as the measly 2-3oz you get with other products. One container lasts me roughly 3 months, and 25 bucks divided by 12 weeks equals a little over 2 bucks a week to spend on yourself. That&#x27;s cheaper than Starbucks once a week. There are many other products out there, but I&#x27;ve found this one to be perfect for managing my thick hair as well as being a great value.</li>
    <li> The Story:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used plenty of cheap pomades, looking for an easy way out when it comes to hair styling. The recommended brands I tried just didn&#x27;t have what it took, the cheap water-based pomades like [[ASIN:B002VA4FUS AXE Shine Pomade, Smooth Look, 2.64 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] had only moderate hold that couldn&#x27;t tame hair longer than a few inches, and old-school products like [[ASIN:B000142NMI Murray&#x27;s Superior Hair Dressing Pomade]] and [[ASIN:B00GMPEAJO Soft Sheen Sportin Waves Gel Pomade with Wavitrol - 3.5 Ounce (3 Pack)]] had good all- day hold, but would NOT wash out, even after several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Price:&lt;br /&gt;This is why I ordered this clay pomade from Star Wax. The price is high compared to the really cheap stuff, but trust me, those brands, while fine (I was happy with them for a long time), do not perform anywhere close to this pomade. Between the size (more than double its competitors in the same price range) and its effectiveness (you&#x27;ll have to use maybe half as much per use), this price gap comes very close to closing, or even making this product relatively less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Performance:&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that works, this is it. It promises strong hold and a matte finish, and that&#x27;s what you get. It&#x27;s not a gel, so it doesn&#x27;t harden to a crunchy helmet, but it will keep short/medium length hair in place all day without constant re-combings (or with them, unlike gels and sprays). The finish won&#x27;t give the \\&quot;shellac shine\\&quot; of Mad Men, but it will hold hair as well or better. For shine, I use a light hair cream under the pomade like [[ASIN:B000GG16QA Brylcreem Hair Cream Original - 5.5 Oz.]] for a more natural look, and mix in some [[ASIN:B003XFSVWS Star Wax | Premium Pomade, Original, by Star Pro Line - 5 fl. oz. Jar]] for more of an old-school gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is pretty thick, requiring a some work to make it pliable (just rub it vigorously between your hands for ~30-60 seconds), and being clay based, requires similar fortitude to spread through your hair thoroughly without any visible clumps. Be aware that all clay pomades, in exchange for superior hold, need this extra effort to be their best. You can also \\&quot;cut\\&quot; the product down with a few drops of water to make it spread easier and/or dial down the hold you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;For making promises of strong hold and actually keeping them, providing a strong base for a wide range of styles, and being easy to wash out (forgot to mention that) with just one washing, I&#x27;m giving this product my full recommendation, try it!</li>
    <li> Smells good, keeps your hair in place without making it look plastic, keeps the barber away longer.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this stuff. First of all, the hold is great. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for. However, the &amp;#34;rich scent&amp;#34; is less than desirable. It is quite strong and not all that appealing. It does fade after a bit, but they seemed to go overboard with the scents on this one.</li>
    <li> The product works well.  But, for it to really work magic you need to have your hair at the perfect dampness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, at first I didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell.  However, over time, that has changed.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the rave is all about. Are these reviews fake? This definitely is NOT comparable in terms of strength to TIGI Bedhead Wax. In addition, i can&#x27;t get over the smell of this wax. It&#x27;s very very musky and reminds me of cheap cologne they sell on the street. Im sorry, but it&#x27;s too overwhelming and overpowers my regular $89 dollar cologne. Not sure if I&#x27;ll trash it and waste 30 bucks or keep it. I guess when I head out for a dates ill put it on and see the reaction on the women&#x27;s faces.  Overall, I honestly can&#x27;t say that I would buy this product again. I could get over the hold being a bit less than TIGI Bedhead Wax, but the smell of Star Wax just impedes me from clicking Add To Cart.  :( ........   UPDATE: Apparently, it smells good to the people i tell to sniff my hair! I guess the smell isnt all that bad....... Not bad Star Wax, Not bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just great,as thick as my hair is it&#x27;s well worth it for the smell alone,highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have medium length wavy hair that is on the thick side. The clay leaves it natural looking with medium hold. It also smells great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Good and very strong for people who need it</li>
    <li> Holds well with no shine. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> First of all, I was really impressed by the size of this container.  Note that 5 fl oz is a bigger container than most.  As I compared this to my others, it seems this is 5oz and others are around 3-3.5 oz.  So, right off the bat this is a lot of value for your dollar.  Which is only worth it if the product is good - and this product is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, this is strong stuff.  It has a lot of hold and keeps your hair in place.  The closest thing I can compare it to is the Baxter Hair Clay product.  This one is slightly different because this has a certain hold that truly locks your hair into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is great pomade at a very reasonable value!!</li>
    <li> I use Gatsby and american crew fiber. there all matt finish and i use it everyday, but they don&#x27;t really have hold in my opinion unless you put a lot in your hair. But this product gives u actual hold with a nickel size scoop. i love it!!!!! HOLD!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and have to put something in it to calm it down and make it look right.  So, about the product...it&#x27;s alright. TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax is what I was using, but after reading the reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s parabene-free, I decided to give Star Wax a try. Straight to the point, the smell is a little bit stronger than I&#x27;d like, not bad, but stronger than I&#x27;d like. The hold isn&#x27;t as good as TIGI&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ll have to use twice the amount of product that I used with the TIGI wax to get the same result. So, I guess that&#x27;s the trade off. Will I buy again? Probably not.    Don&#x27;t be discouraged to try it, it may be the stuff for you.</li>
    <li> I have used the [[ASIN:B006O2YAVI Star Wax Crystal by Star Pro Line | 5 fl. oz. Jar]] and liked the hold it put on my hair. I decided to try the clay because I didn&#x27;t like the shine the Crystal left. The clay does provide hold but it also adds some body to the hair which I didn&#x27;t really want. It works just as advertised though: good hold, without the shine. And might even be good for those who want more body in their hair.</li>
    <li> Only had this for a couple of days but I can already tell this stuff is awsome! And the container is really big so it should last a while which is fantastic because I initially thought $25 was a little steep. I&#x27;ve been letting my hair grow longer for the past several months and this product has answered my prayers. It gives great hold, allows you to shape your hair and best of all let&#x27;s your hair look dry unlike most other products. I just put a small amount in my towel dried hair, blow dry, then finish it off with a little more. I can get rid of all my other products now.</li>
