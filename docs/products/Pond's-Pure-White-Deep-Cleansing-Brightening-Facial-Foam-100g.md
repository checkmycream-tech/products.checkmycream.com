      <li>It foams up under water and it works up into a great lather.</li>
      <li>Really good product for the price.</li>
      <li>I tried it and loved it.</li>
      <li>Honestly though, I didn&#x27;t look that</li>
      <li>Nice foaming lather.</li>
      <li>i liked it.</li>
      <li>Honestly, before this, I basically didn&#x27;t use face wash at all.</li>

      <li>When the face cleared up, tried more Olay.</li>
      <li>I love this cleansing foam.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>okay, but just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>okay, but just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had acne most of my life and no matter what I did</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>ok la~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ this product works fine</li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t even put on any makeup the day after because she loved the feel of it so much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Definitely does a great job of cleansing.</li>
      <li>it was a free sample.</li>
      <li>rinses off really clean</li>
      <li>almost TOO clean.)</li>
      <li>and she used it and said while her cleanser gave her a mild rash, this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone who has oily skin. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like foaming hand soap that actually feels kind of &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; or watery to me.</li>
      <li>worth the wait</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any brightening or lightening action, but then again, I&#x27;ve been spending more time in the sun since it&#x27;s summer.</li>
      <li>But if I want an occasional deep clean or surprisingly even hair coloring stain removal, then this works for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when this runs out</li>
      <li>If you want something that really works the way it says Buy this stuff!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when this runs out</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what i want, and it smells like mint.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin is especially sensitive, but simple bar soap or body soap seemed better than the face soaps.</li>
      <li>The shipment came right on time with a nice little note and postcard from Chiang Mai.</li>
      <li>The shipment came right on time with a nice little note and postcard from Chiang Mai.</li>
      <li>, you most moisturize immediately after washing though because you can dry out a bit, but my complexion is even out</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think too much about it...</li>
      <li>, it lathers very well</li>
      <li>and it foams very pleasantly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It honestly does lighten your complexion but as of yet I have yet to see my actual skin color begin to lighten back to how I used to be.</li>
      <li>Product is good but delivery was late</li>
      <li>After I washed my face with this facial foam, I felt clean and soothing.</li>
      <li>clean deeply as described</li>
      <li>and I love how it clears the dark spots.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle but does a fantastic job of taking off all my makeup, including the BB cream that I wear which is usually super hard to get</li>
      <li>This is marketed to teens and young women with very oily faces.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Until I got to the US and saw that one of the boxes I shipped had been opened and more than half the contents stolen!</li>
      <li>does make my face feel clean but VERY dry afterwards.</li>
      <li>Pond&#x27;s Pure White cleanser that doesn&#x27;t have the charcoal in it, and</li>
      <li>For a couple years now I&#x27;ve been using Ponds Pure White</li>
      <li>it took one complete month to reach me....</li>
      <li>In fact, it lathers so much, that I discovered that tiny sample lasted for MONTHS.</li>
      <li>The brand itself is not found in the States as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>My friend has sensitive skin</li>
      <li>so the whole tube should last like 4-6 months considering you wash your face twice a day.</li>
      <li>Who knew that&#x27;s how deep cleansing it really is.</li>
      <li>Might want to wait about 2-7 days before using another cleanser because your skin can get dark if you use another cleanser right away.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a long way, which is nice.</li>
      <li>When I bought it from the other place it was way too much to keep buying it from them</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and it hasn&#x27;t broke me out nor given me dry spots around my nose which is saying something.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For a couple years now I&#x27;ve been using Ponds Pure White and I love it, it lathers very well rinses off really clean, you most moisturize immediately after washing though because you can dry out a bit, but my complexion is even out and I love how it clears the dark spots. One thing though if you have to switch to another cleansing product. Might want to wait about 2-7 days before using another cleanser because your skin can get dark if you use another cleanser right away.</li>
    <li> If you color or touch up your grey roots/hair like I do regularly then you know that hair coloring stains your forehead. I found this cleanser removes those stubborn stain marks when a shampoo doesn&#x27;t get all of it. It doesn&#x27;t do it in one go, but using it a few times eventually does. Who knew that&#x27;s how deep cleansing it really is. Being in my 40&#x27;s I don&#x27;t use this regularly as it can be drying. This is marketed to teens and young women with very oily faces. A very common complaint in our humid, hot Manila weather. But if I want an occasional deep clean or surprisingly even hair coloring stain removal, then this works for me.</li>
    <li> ok la~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ this product works fine and sometimes it is not suitable for too dry skin. clean deeply as described</li>
    <li> Fake item, Showing different item in picture and sending different. screwed my skin in just two washes. FAKE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne most of my life and no matter what I did I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. Not even using 91% rubbing alcohol made a dent in it! So while I was on online I came across this product and thought \\&quot;Why not ?\\&quot; So I bought a tube of it. OMG!!! This actually worked for me! I used it once in the morning and once at night and my skin finally cleared up! When I bought it from the other place it was way too much to keep buying it from them so I looked on Amazon and I found it! So I bought myself 5 tubes so I wouldn&#x27;t run out! If you want something that really works the way it says Buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> No difference in my complexion yet (No breakouts though) and it foams very pleasantly.&lt;br /&gt;It does make my face feel clean but VERY dry afterwards. (I&#x27;ve never had to use facial moisturizer before so I apply coconut oil after i use this because my face feels so dry and gross. almost TOO clean.)</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing foam. After I washed my face with this facial foam, I felt clean and soothing. I would love to recommend POND&#x27;s to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  I use heavy moisturizers and sunblock daily.  This cleanser definitely removes every trace of it, including excess oils and dirt at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this facial foam because I have oily skin and this product does help in controlling oil. You just need a pea-sized amount and it works like wonder. Highly recommend to anyone who has oily skin. :)</li>
    <li> It honestly does lighten your complexion but as of yet I have yet to see my actual skin color begin to lighten back to how I used to be.</li>
    <li> Really good product for the price. Shipping takes a little over 2 weeks but its understandable since it comes form India. My mom and I both use it. I am not necessarily trying to lighter but I do want to fix dark spots around my mouth. I have been using it for 2 weeks today and notices a difference. My skin is extremely sensitive and it hasn&#x27;t broke me out nor given me dry spots around my nose which is saying something. A tiny bit of it creates lots of foam so the whole tube should last like 4-6 months considering you wash your face twice a day. Will continue buying for as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> does wat it says...did pull out all the impurities....it took one complete month to reach me....i had to wait forever...it is shipped from asia..worth the wait</li>
    <li> Concentrated so a little goes a long way. Nice foaming lather. Not drying.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what i want, and it smells like mint. After washing your face with it, you won&#x27;t feel greasy anymore.</li>
    <li> I discovered this face wash while living in Asia... it was a free sample. I tried it and loved it. Honestly, before this, I basically didn&#x27;t use face wash at all. The few times I had tried, I think I was using acne cleanser or something equally harsh and my skin was left dry. I don&#x27;t think my skin is especially sensitive, but simple bar soap or body soap seemed better than the face soaps. Honestly though, I didn&#x27;t look that hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this sample. I discovered it foamed up incredibly. It&#x27;s not like foaming hand soap that actually feels kind of &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; or watery to me. No, this is a thick creamy lather.... but not too thick. We&#x27;re not talking shaving cream here. In fact, it lathers so much, that I discovered that tiny sample lasted for MONTHS. You really only need a pea sized amount.... in fact, maybe even less! I basically use the smallest amount I can squeeze onto my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I bought and used it for the next 5 years. And when I decided to move back to the US, I had an unopened tube, so I shipped it. I figured I could buy it in the US, after all, Pond&#x27;s is sold here as well. I didn&#x27;t think too much about it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I got to the US and saw that one of the boxes I shipped had been opened and more than half the contents stolen! Goodbye hand-woven tapestry from Thailand. Goodbye $200 dollar heels that my friend insisted on getting me! Goodbye Settlers of Catan that had traveled around the world for 10 years! And goodbye Pond&#x27;s Facial Foam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine. Hazards of travel. Simply replace what I can. Except this face wash isn&#x27;t sold anywhere in the US! Nope, even this Amazon vendor is shipping from Thailand (even from the same city I left just a few months ago - where I could have stocked up if I&#x27;d known!). So, I tried Olay. Broke out for a week. Stopped it, sparingly used my tiny travel-sized Pond&#x27;s. When the face cleared up, tried more Olay. Nope. One wash and my face breaks out. Tried another Pond&#x27;s, one sold here in the US.... okay, but just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally caved and bought this. It&#x27;s the medium size, but I know it&#x27;ll last 6-12 mos. The shipment came right on time with a nice little note and postcard from Chiang Mai. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when this runs out (only did 1 this time in case there were shipping problems). And I can promise you, next time I&#x27;m in Thailand or Korea or Malaysia, I&#x27;m stocking up!!!the US.... okay, but just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally caved and bought this. It&#x27;s the medium size, but I know it&#x27;ll last 6-12 mos. The shipment came right on time with a nice little note and postcard from Chiang Mai. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more when this runs out (only did 1 this time in case there were shipping problems).

    <li> I love this cleanser. I have tried the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; Pond&#x27;s Pure White cleanser that doesn&#x27;t have the charcoal in it, and I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference. The brand itself is not found in the States as far as I can tell. It&#x27;s gentle but does a fantastic job of taking off all my makeup, including the BB cream that I wear which is usually super hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do only need a pea (literally) sized amount. It foams up under water and it works up into a great lather. No complaints. Would purchase again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, oily spots, dry spots. Works well with me. My friend has sensitive skin and she used it and said while her cleanser gave her a mild rash, this one didn&#x27;t. She didn&#x27;t even put on any makeup the day after because she loved the feel of it so much.</li>
    <li> i liked it. works well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any brightening or lightening action, but then again, I&#x27;ve been spending more time in the sun since it&#x27;s summer. Definitely does a great job of cleansing. As other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a long way, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Definitely cleanses and brightens. You see results immediately.</li>
    <li> Product is good but delivery was late</li>
