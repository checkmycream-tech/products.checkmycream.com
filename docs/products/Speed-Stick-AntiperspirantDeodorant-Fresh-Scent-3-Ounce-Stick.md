### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smelled and worked amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>this is your way of trying to make us feel better.</li>
      <li>You can do better than that.  </li>
      <li>I tell everyone who asks, (after I apologize for how strong it smells) that its your product.</li>
      <li>Used a gift card given to me to buy this fine product which I have used for years and years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Speed Stick Fresh Scent for many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Mennen Speed Stick FRESH Anti-perspirant for many years because of its effectiveness and it&#x27;s light, clean scent.</li>
      <li>I bet if you brought back original Fresh Scent formula you would greatly benefit.</li>
      <li>Why mess with a good thing!</li>
      <li>I called Mennen, and they are phasing out the original Fresh Scent and replacing it with the Power line.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many deodorants and this is the only one I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>Have been using Fresh Scent since the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I have learned that Colgate is discontinuing the FRESH scent.</li>
      <li>It does not have the same fresh powdery smell I liked for years.</li>
      <li>I ordered this from an amazon marketplace seller and received Speed Stick POWER Fresh Scent deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I was specifically looking for \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; and received one from the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; line.</li>
      <li>Why would you stop making the Fresh Scent?????</li>
      <li>The new scent is overwhelmingly strong...</li>
      <li>My adorable husband has been wearing the same antiperspirant for the 21 years of our relationship (and then some), and I like how he smells.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The old green cap fresh scent was great.  </li>
      <li>I wonder how much market share Pepsi gained during the New Coke replacement of the original formula.  </li>
      <li>so i went to the old spice line now and am so far satisfied.</li>
      <li>It has the same barcode as the original fresh scent, and therefore may be shipped to you in place of what is pictured here.  </li>
      <li>as it&#x27;s a fresh clean scent, what am I going to do now as all the others smell toxic and aggressive if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
      <li>the grey cap fresh scent is ny far the loudest and most offensive.</li>
      <li>Please, I and many other men want the original Fresh Scent back!!</li>
      <li>then i went to their regular unscented which worked fine</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the scent too much.  </li>
      <li>I used the original for about 20 years and now it have been trying all different brands and scents to replace it.</li>
      <li>The Power Fresh Scent apparently has replaced the traditional Fresh Scent, as I have been to every large store imaginable</li>
      <li>This deodorant worked decently on sweat, but it made me smell like a car freshioner.</li>
      <li>I had used the original Mennen (green cap) Fresh Scent antiperspirant for over 20 years.  </li>
      <li>and I can no longer find the traditional Fresh Scent, i.e. the one that has been around since I started using it in 1984.</li>
      <li>Recently ran out and bought the Power Fresh Scent Anti/Deo.</li>
      <li>Colgate should read the business case history of New Coke.  </li>
      <li>I am moving on to a new brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like any of their new flavors.</li>
      <li>My nose can&#x27;t stand the new aroma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was a long-time user of the light green version and I am really upset if Menen discontinued this product.  </li>
      <li>This is not the same product I used to love, despite having the same universal product code number.</li>
      <li>In fact, my eyes were irritated and I sneezed several times the first day I put it on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would have given it zero stars, if I was sure it would be computed into overall reviewers&#x27; average.</li>
      <li>I have finally finished my last little bit of the original fresh scent speed stick and everyday I am wishing I had more.</li>
      <li>The Power Fresh Scent irritates my skin and has a gel or oily texture, less of a powder texture like the traditional Fresh Scent had.</li>
      <li>it has a far stronger scent.  </li>
      <li>I noticed that the stores were no longer carrying the light green cap version and went to order online.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
      <li>i will completely stop using the Mennen product.</li>
      <li>Recently, I ordered this product, but got Speed Stick POWER FRESH (Silver lid, same UPC label).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update on May 18, 2014: see Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant Solid, Unscented, 2.6-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6) if you want something similar to the traditional Fresh Scent.</li>
      <li>I can only guess that Mennen replaced some ingredients with a new cheaper ingredient and branded it as \\&quot;Power\\&quot; to give the impression it is improved in some way.</li>
      <li>It not only smells like a gold-chain wearing gigolo on ladies night at the Regal Beagle, but my armpits started to burn sometime around hour six after applying this new \\&quot;power\\&quot; formula.  </li>
      <li>I beg of your company, bring back Green Cap Fresh Scent!</li>
      <li>I used the Green Cap, Fresh Scent Anti/Deo.</li>
      <li>The grey cap version is both very loud smelling and a skin irritant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not the same product I used to love, despite having the same universal product code number. It does not have the same fresh powdery smell I liked for years. This new product has a harsh smell of metabolized gin body odor.</li>
    <li> 3 problems:  1. Mennen changed the formulation!  My nose can&#x27;t stand the new aroma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Mennen kept the SAME barcode!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Now, months later, I have yet to receive my refund check!  (I complied with the return requirements!)</li>
    <li> This deodorant worked decently on sweat, but it made me smell like a car freshioner. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was specifically looking for \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; and received one from the \\&quot;Power\\&quot; line. I don&#x27;t like it, and was trying to receive something different.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from an amazon marketplace seller and received Speed Stick POWER Fresh Scent deodorant.  It is very different than the green-lidded product currently pictured in the product description-- it has a far stronger scent.  It has the same barcode as the original fresh scent, and therefore may be shipped to you in place of what is pictured here.  I called Mennen, and they are phasing out the original Fresh Scent and replacing it with the Power line.  Very disappointing, as I am a long time user, and the new product is not nearly as subtle.</li>
    <li> Can I select a &amp;#34;negative star&amp;#34; somehow?  Shame on you, Mennen.  Your &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; Fresh Scent sucks!  You can do better than that.  Have been using Fresh Scent since the 80&#x27;s.  Why mess with a good thing!</li>
    <li> I have finally finished my last little bit of the original fresh scent speed stick and everyday I am wishing I had more. I used the original for about 20 years and now it have been trying all different brands and scents to replace it. I tried this new one and the scent (more like stench) almost made me sick. They should have never changed this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; fragrance for as long as I can remember. I am *very* disappointed that is has been discontinued. The new scent is overwhelmingly strong...it almost makes my eyes tear.</li>
    <li> The one star reviews here are all spot on. The Power Fresh Scent apparently has replaced the traditional Fresh Scent, as I have been to every large store imaginable and I can no longer find the traditional Fresh Scent, i.e. the one that has been around since I started using it in 1984. The Power Fresh Scent irritates my skin and has a gel or oily texture, less of a powder texture like the traditional Fresh Scent had. And it does not have a fresh scent but rather a nasty sharp offensive odor, like that of a dirty old man who reaks of a sharp sweat. I can only guess that Mennen replaced some ingredients with a new cheaper ingredient and branded it as \\&quot;Power\\&quot; to give the impression it is improved in some way. To the contrary, Power Fresh Scent is nasty, very nasty. In fact, my eyes were irritated and I sneezed several times the first day I put it on. This is simply a terrible product. Mennen, you ought to re-think this very seriously. I am moving on to a new brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on May 18, 2014: see Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant Solid, Unscented, 2.6-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6) if you want something similar to the traditional Fresh Scent.</li>
    <li> I used the Green Cap, Fresh Scent Anti/Deo. for 20 years. Recently ran out and bought the Power Fresh Scent Anti/Deo. and to the point, IT STINKS!!!!! Why would you stop making the Fresh Scent????? It smelled and worked amazing. Men do not want to smell like they bathed in cologne. I tell everyone who asks, (after I apologize for how strong it smells) that its your product. Please, I and many other men want the original Fresh Scent back!! Read Amazon reviews for this product!!! Rated terrible! I beg of your company, bring back Green Cap Fresh Scent! Also DO NOT send me coupons as I read from other negative reviewers this is your way of trying to make us feel better. Do not waste your time. I am on a mission to rid men of this stench!!! Again read reviews. I bet if you brought back original Fresh Scent formula you would greatly benefit. I would by a case now!!!</li>
    <li> complete disappointment in this product line now.i was a lifetime user of the speed stick sport talk until they changed their formula then i went to their regular unscented which worked fine and i used it for years..then they went again and changed the formula to this power stick crap and the product no longer works for me at all. so i went to the old spice line now and am so far satisfied. i will completely stop using the Mennen product.</li>
    <li> Hmmm..  I didn&#x27;t mind the scent too much.  But it didn&#x27;t matter because the product crumbled into pieces on the floor of the gym locker room.</li>
    <li> This one gives me sinus pain.. not the same at all!  No good.. chemical pollutant for me..  Bring back &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;.. Axe &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Speed Stick Fresh Scent for many years. I am allergic to many deodorants and this is the only one I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t break me out. Now I can no longer get it! What a disaster! The new stuff smells like crap. They just lost a customer!</li>
    <li> The product pictured with a green lid is NOT what is being shipped. I&#x27;ve used Mennen Speed Stick FRESH Anti-perspirant for many years because of its effectiveness and it&#x27;s light, clean scent. Recently, I ordered this product, but got Speed Stick POWER FRESH (Silver lid, same UPC label). It is SO different, with a heavy, gaudy scent. I have learned that Colgate is discontinuing the FRESH scent. SO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> The old green cap fresh scent was great.  I used it from 1982 until it was taken off the market.  The grey cap version is both very loud smelling and a skin irritant.  I think this will be the end of the entire speedstick line.  In all the antiperspirant brands on the shelf that went through looking for a replacement the grey cap fresh scent is ny far the loudest and most offensive.</li>
    <li> No, no, no, no, no! I have been using this for years, shipped to the UK, as it&#x27;s a fresh clean scent, what am I going to do now as all the others smell toxic and aggressive if that&#x27;s possible. Come on Colgate, what&#x27;s up with you?</li>
    <li> I had used the original Mennen (green cap) Fresh Scent antiperspirant for over 20 years.  Then the Mennen marketing department decided to pinch off this lousy replacement product.  This new version smells as terrible as any of the Axe body wash/spray/deodorants.  It not only smells like a gold-chain wearing gigolo on ladies night at the Regal Beagle, but my armpits started to burn sometime around hour six after applying this new \\&quot;power\\&quot; formula.  As a bonus that coincided with the burning sensation, my pits began to sweat, even though I work in an air-conditioned office.  I had to jump in the shower to get this nasty stuff off as soon as I got home from work.  Nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it zero stars, if I was sure it would be computed into overall reviewers&#x27; average.</li>
    <li> Been using this since the 80s, but now it stinks and makes my pits itch something fierce. I don&#x27;t like any of their new flavors. Bye Mennen...</li>
    <li> Used a gift card given to me to buy this fine product which I have used for years and years</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered Speed Stick \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot; scent, with the green lid as pictured, but instead I received a silver lid \\&quot;POWER\\&quot; Speed Stick which smells way too unmanly.  My adorable husband has been wearing the same antiperspirant for the 21 years of our relationship (and then some), and I like how he smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why mess with success?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Lid, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning my product and will go on a stock-up spree at local retailers.</li>
    <li> I too ordered this from Amazon and received the Power version of the product.  I noticed that the stores were no longer carrying the light green cap version and went to order online. I was a long-time user of the light green version and I am really upset if Menen discontinued this product.  What a horrible marketing decision on their part.  Now all the loyal users will look to other brands becuase the Power version is terrible.  Colgate should read the business case history of New Coke.  What a marketing disaster that was.  I wonder how much market share Pepsi gained during the New Coke replacement of the original formula.  The same could happen to Colgate.</li>
