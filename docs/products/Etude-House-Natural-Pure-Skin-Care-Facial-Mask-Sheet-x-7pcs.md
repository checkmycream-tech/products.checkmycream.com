      <li>They were as good or better than masks I&#x27;ve used in the past and the price was great.  </li>

      <li>Overall happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Their face masks are very moist!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to scare people while wearing them though!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth to buy!</li>
      <li>these are no longer the original items, these are counterfiets, I bought the original etude house masks a while ago and repurchased this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>these products were all super fun and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>the sheet mask are good, i don&#x27;t see any big difference</li>
      <li>I purchased these masks while on a business trip to Singapore, and I agree that they feel great when on, but there is not a huge difference in skin</li>
      <li>So fun, smell yummy</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance is also a big plus!</li>
      <li>They feel refreshing on my face, don&#x27;t cause me to break out, and they leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Good product, I tried before and it is really make mi skin relaxed and brighter for entire day.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price and very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Etude House Natural Beige (W13) is too light for me, even in the winter months.  </li>
      <li>It really does what it says and it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Made my skin improve a lot with first use.</li>
      <li>Better to not order a mixture packet next time.</li>
      <li>These facial mask sheets by Etude House are fabulous!</li>
      <li>I thought this was worth mentioning, particularly if samples in the color you want are not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A nice little pampering thing, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any skin improvements after using them.</li>
      <li>I have found a huge difference in items such as BB/CC creams and primers.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, Etude House has other products that are fabulous!  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I love them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend their Moistfull Collagen cream special kit - http://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Moistfull-Collagen-Special/dp/B009SD0HMQ (especially in drier weather) and</li>
      <li>I love the masks, but one of the seven masks expired a few months ago.</li>
      <li>The mask is made of a nice thick material and doesn&#x27;t fall apart or rip when you are unfolding it.</li>
      <li>These are the first facial sheet mask I have ever used</li>
      <li>Please be aware that the dates on Asian beauty products are the date of manufacture, not expiration dates.  </li>
      <li>You can frequently find samples on that well-known auction site that starts with &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; so you can try the products first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They make my skin look refreshed and moisturized and are so much nicer to use than the traditional paste that you apply and then peel or wash off your face.</li>
      <li>Made my skin so refreshed and soft.</li>
      <li>but they all make my skin soft and clear.  </li>
      <li>My &amp;#34;royal jelly&amp;#34; mask was past expiration and caused my skin to dry out a bit more than it should have, but this is a lovely little variety pack for testing out Korean facemasks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Asian-made products generally make skin care ingredients top priority, with coloring/pigments secondary.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;One final tip:  Asian facial makeup is significantly lighter in pigment than American, regardless of the color name.  </li>
      <li>In American makeup, I am generally a natural beige.  </li>
      <li>By far the easiest home facial.</li>
      <li>I was a bit disappointed that the 7 masks I relieved were not the exact ones advertised, it would be nice to know in the description that they can differ from what you receive.</li>

    <li> the sheet mask are good, i don&#x27;t see any big difference but hope gets better with the use.&lt;br /&gt;good delivery and good seller  as well</li>
    <li> the paper does not stay on your face properly in 20 mint. Especially on jaw area. Some of the product in the packet does not fit with my skin type and I had break out. Better to not order a mixture packet next time.</li>
    <li> these are no longer the original items, these are counterfiets, I bought the original etude house masks a while ago and repurchased this.&lt;br /&gt;These are NOT original etude house products!!!</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;royal jelly&amp;#34; mask was past expiration and caused my skin to dry out a bit more than it should have, but this is a lovely little variety pack for testing out Korean facemasks. (Be warned: these are not really fragranced! they smell like SKIN CARE PRODUCTS, not perfume.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are in english. Do please read them as they are different on each one.</li>
    <li> . My sister loves it.</li>
    <li> They feel so good. I would recommend anything from Etude House, they are the bom and they are affordable</li>
    <li> By far the easiest home facial. I&#x27;m in love with these! I use them about once a week and they have dramatically changed the clarity of my completion.</li>
    <li> These are nice, and feel especially refreshing during the summer time as they feel quite cool when you put them on. A nice little pampering thing, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any skin improvements after using them.</li>
    <li> These products are amazing and very effective! Reasonable price and very fast shipping! I also like the variety of masks, each one targets a different skin problem and has made a difference in my skin. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I love the masks, but one of the seven masks expired a few months ago. so there goes two bucks.</li>
    <li> Made my skin so refreshed and soft. Love them all.</li>
    <li> Korean product experation dates are for the day the are made and not when they expire in the future.  Before you toss what you think is outdated, ask the vendor where it was produced.  Chances are it came from Korea and is fine.  I feel bad for those who threw out their product.  This vendor should note this difference it would save people from confusion.</li>
    <li> I love this mask so much and it feels really good and moist after using it. Definitely worth to buy!</li>

    <li> I have been using face masks for a long time, and I just started with Etude House since May 2013. Their face masks are very moist!!! Fits well also with my face.
