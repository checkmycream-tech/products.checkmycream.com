      <li>And as a bonus, it smells really good too.</li>
      <li>and it just feels good),</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get a good lather, and as a matter of habit, I always rinse and repeat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are two things about this shampoo that make it really good.</li>
      <li>, this is a really good product</li>
      <li>This is a very good product, ~~~This product is the most effective one that i have used, Can see the results after once using..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was in a nice plastic bottle that looked good in the shower rack</li>
      <li>It does have QUITE a strong perfume, but I think it smells great.  </li>
      <li>still works amazingly for my hair and scalp, even without using conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I want to note here that this is really an amazing shampoo.</li>
      <li>, it lathers well and the scent is nice.</li>
      <li>(Just seems like you need a lot more of it before you start getting good results?</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s so nice about it</li>
      <li>After using this for a week my hair looks nice, smells nice, and there isn&#x27;t a flake to be seen.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, and it seems to work well.</li>
      <li>but I liked the name of this</li>
      <li>The ingredients work nicely in concert to create an almost \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling that I like in herb-based shampoos.  </li>
      <li>I like my hair to look very nice and full.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo has a mild, muted pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I got it for my son and his dandruff seems better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
      <li>This is a good quality shampoo that lathers well and makes my hair look clean.</li>
      <li>First of all it has twice the Pyrithione Zinc as many Anti-Dandruff shampoos which makes it very effective.</li>
      <li>Had a nice fragance and my hair was fine after using it.  </li>
      <li>so I am pleased with that.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I had tried many shampoos and some home remedies.  </li>
      <li>His favorite is the minty one, but he likes all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is it any better in controlling dandruff?</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job for the most part at least\\&quot;</li>
      <li>My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
      <li>I do love the smell though -</li>
      <li>and I would like more tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>It looks noticeably better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll still buy more of this stuff when I run out.</li>
      <li>Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite of the product line</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will do the job removing the dirt and road salt</li>
      <li>Although this is supposedly a men&#x27;s shampoo, I think many females will also like the shampoo and its fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a thinner consistency than most shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve should have known better.  </li>
      <li>I have to wash my hair more often when using this product</li>
      <li>However I think that I like this shampoo slightly better.</li>
      <li>It does work at keeping dandruff in check, but there are a couple of brands out there that I feel do better, even though they&#x27;re 2-in-1 shampoo plus conditioners.</li>
      <li>Some shampoo products helped sort of (mostly with 2% zinc).</li>
      <li>I am looking to replace my store brand dandruff shampoo and my coal tar shampoo with something that will work better and be cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>In any case, this Strong &amp; Full version is excellent and highly recommended, but so are the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In any case, this Strong &amp; Full version is excellent and highly recommended, but so are the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this product very much and will stop using H&amp;S and switch to this for good.</li>
      <li>and it also leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>The perfume like smell in many shampoos which I don&#x27;t like is not as strong as I thought it would be</li>
      <li>I really love the scent--it&#x27;s unusual but in a good way.</li>
      <li>things/play advertiser unless it&#x27;s something that I really love and works really well rather than \\&quot;Eh good enough\\&quot; or \\&quot;Well</li>
      <li>It smells good, but is also very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo - it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, washes out easy, and keeps me dandruff free for days.</li>
      <li>The smell is very mild, and doesn&#x27;t even have a strong smell of tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>Still, this is easy to recommend.</li>
      <li>Only healthy scalp and great looking hair</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want that strong, medicine smell, this is a no brainer.</li>
      <li>I do use the others on occasion, but this particular one seems to be the most effective.  </li>
      <li>I also think it is a good value, since you will not be using much to get your hair clean (even twice).</li>
      <li>but he said he worked fine for him too.</li>
      <li>but both are fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dirt cheap</li>
      <li>I have used countless shampoos over the years and this one is great.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent and lathers very well.</li>
      <li>where does this one fit in?</li>
      <li>This is a great product for those with occasional dandruff.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not a cologne type smell, more herbal and clean, and does fade fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>first received the Cool Sport Mint version as a Vine selection, tried it and liked it, so I moved on to try the others.</li>
      <li>They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
      <li>first received the Cool Sport Mint version as a Vine selection, tried it and liked it, so I moved on to try the others.</li>
      <li>..lets see so far so good..</li>
      <li>Yet...overall I&#x27;d get this first because of the teatree!!</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s just a good natural clean smell.</li>
      <li>This Strong &amp; Full version states that \\&quot;for best results use at least twice a week or as directed by</li>
      <li>hair feels clean, but not squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo]]</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo]]</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells nice and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>, you know how good that extra tingle can feel on the scalp.</li>
      <li>So, many washings from this bottle means an economic deal.</li>
      <li>Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is an effective dandruff shampoo that packs the power of Pyrithione Zinc and a \\&quot;Bio-Nutrium 10\\&quot; cocktail of nutrients, ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins, almond &amp; coconut oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s apparently a women&#x27;s Clear, but I&#x27;m honestly a bit iffy with trying it since most the time my experience has been a lot better with using men&#x27;s products than women&#x27;s</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a woman, but saw this shampoo and thought I would give it a shot.  I have fine, oily  hair and typically use H&amp;S Extra Volume in addition to a quality non-dandruff shampoo.  I rotate them.  I like my hair to look very nice and full.  This shampoo has a mild, muted pleasant scent.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it was manly or feminine.  Just basic clean without being strong.  I did get a slight tingly feeling, but almost not noticeable.  I noticed a difference in the feel of my hair after I used it as well.  The hairs themselves felt thicker and when I brushed my hair, it was manageable and full.  I like this product very much and will stop using H&amp;S and switch to this for good.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST DANDRUFF SHAMPOO ON THE MARKET.&lt;br /&gt;Sad that I can&#x27;t find it on the shelves any longer and have had to order online.  I have a feeling this excellent product is being discontinued :(</li>
    <li> I am very selective about what type of shampoo that I use because many do not agree with my hair and scalp. If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. A lot of the time shampoo will make my hair feel very oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use an Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. I have been using Pantene Anti-Dandruff shampoo recently and it has been my recent favorite. However I think that I like this shampoo slightly better. It has a nice scent and lathers very well. It&#x27;s also a thinner consistency than most shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things about this shampoo that make it really good. First of all it has twice the Pyrithione Zinc as many Anti-Dandruff shampoos which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product. I got it for my son and his dandruff seems better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders (same active ingredient). My son is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo been using it for a couple of weeks now even stoped hair from falling out in a great level&lt;br /&gt;works alot beter than the so claimed hairloss shampoos..lets see so far so good..</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t take much kinda has a goopy feel but smells good and seems to make my hair appear thicker if not really feel thicker however I&#x27;ve only been using one week and am aware hair products can take several months before you honestly see effects.</li>
    <li> Husband does not like this, he said it flakes his hair even worse then it was. Not a good dandruff shampoo</li>
    <li> My husband was using a different brand of anti-dandruff shampoo exclusively until I got him a few bottles of Clear to try. He says he&#x27;s not picky about shampoos, but that&#x27;s not true. There a lot of anti-dandruff brands he just stopped using after 2 shampoos and switched back to his old brand. The Clear has been different. He does use this shampoo regularly, and likes it enough that&#x27;s it&#x27;s become his regular brand. His favorite is the minty one, but he likes all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all have pyrithione zinc as the active ingredient, so if Head and Shoulders has worked better for you than Selsun Blue, this is a good choice. It also has tea tree oil, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s enough to really make a difference on dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes how it smells, it&#x27;s not a cologne type smell, more herbal and clean, and does fade fairly quickly. It does make his hair appear slightly fuller, but not so much that unmanageable. He has very thick hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No flakes at all, and it conditions just the right amount. Not so much that his hair gets limp, but it&#x27;s still soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I want to note here that this is really an amazing shampoo. I get the red one, partly because I have really fine hair too so I try to go for shampoos that also help with body (Not that it matters anymore since I cut it super short, partly in reason to try to help with dandruff, but I ended up really liking it too), but if the other ones are as good as this one I seriously recommend getting it. I had really bad dandruff through my life, sometimes being bad enough I get little dandruff blizzards just from running my hand through my hair, and I tend to also be one of those people who rub their scalp when stressed/thinking (Also in part with the dandruff and itching and it just feels good), and along with the sores it was really frustrating that stuff like t-gel and other heavy duty things with the tar didn&#x27;t work well (Head and shoulders seemed to make it worse most the time). It worked somewhat, but still had dandruff and if I skipped a day or two then the dandruff would be horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I mean even with the other shampoos I&#x27;d have to wash my hair and let it dry, check to see if there&#x27;d be dandruff, and usually have to wash it again one or two more times before it was at least a \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried this for the hell of it and have had absolutely no issues with dandruff or sores since. I havn&#x27;t even needed to use conditioner most the time unless I had to use a harsh stripper to get grease out of my hair (and which by the way I use the Aussie 3-5 minute miracle stuff for quick repair, or just about a week or two of using this and it&#x27;s back to normal.) or decided to try a new type of hair dye to try a color I couldn&#x27;t find in other brands but it ended up frying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a foundry and I have to clean things in areas that have heavy duty grease/oil, sand, silica, aluminum powder, and dust/dirt in general, along with being in areas that are really frickin&#x27; hot (Damn melting furnaces/atl cookers) and I see the condition of the hair for the other women who are cleaning shit too (it&#x27;s pretty bad) and I&#x27;m trying to get them to use this and the Aussie stuff because of how well it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah. Harsh conditions for my hair along with a history of really bad dandruff/sores (dermatitis or something? never got it checked with a doctor. Well I think I kinda did once but just recommended I use tgel, which didn&#x27;t help much) and using this still works amazingly for my hair and scalp, even without using conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that I have to wash my hair daily because of the foundry shit that gets in it, and anyone who pays attention to hair care advice knows that washing/shampooing your hair daily can be hard on your hair/scalp, but my hair and head are honestly doing amazingly and I keep playing with my hair because of how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s apparently a women&#x27;s Clear, but I&#x27;m honestly a bit iffy with trying it since most the time my experience has been a lot better with using men&#x27;s products than women&#x27;s (Just seems like you need a lot more of it before you start getting good results? Men&#x27;s seem to be stronger and I don&#x27;t like having to mess with the weaker stuff that needs to be applied more often in combination with other products to make sure it works. I know a lot of guys don&#x27;t have the patience for a lot of hygiene work too so my theory anyways of why they seem to be more effective with less shit).&lt;br /&gt;Point is, this is a really good product and I don&#x27;t tend to gush about things/play advertiser unless it&#x27;s something that I really love and works really well rather than \\&quot;Eh good enough\\&quot; or \\&quot;Well it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job for the most part at least\\&quot;</li>
    <li> this shampoo helps keep my scalp moisturized, and keeps dandruff and psoriasis at bay. I have used countless shampoos over the years and this one is great.</li>
    <li> This lightly scented clear shampoo is highly concentrated. It does not look, feel, or smell like a dandruff shampoo! The clean crisp odor that lingers just smells like clean hair. When compared to Head &amp; Shoulders, there is little in common. Dandruff doesn&#x27;t not exist. Only healthy scalp and great looking hair remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bang for your buck? Costs more than some but a little bit goes a long way. Smart purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, washes out easy, and keeps me dandruff free for days. I&#x27;ve tried other types of this same brand and they&#x27;re all good, but this one works the best for my scalp. Also - the bottle is really simple to use in the shower -, just pop one side of the lid down and you&#x27;re good to go, nothing complicated or fancy.</li>
    <li> A great shampoo.  What&#x27;s so nice about it is it how it feels like a scalp \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; (which, in essence it is).  The ingredients work nicely in concert to create an almost \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling that I like in herb-based shampoos.  Tea tree oil (seemingly the panacea for the 21st century) ginseng and spearmint give it an almost \\&quot;drinkable\\&quot; quality (don&#x27;t!) and my hair and scalp smell and feel great!</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t fault this shampoo for it&#x27;s effectiveness on dandruff, it accomplishes that goal somewhat harshly with regard to my hair. It leaves it very dry and makes my scalp itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other versions of this brand that have a conditioner built-in, and it seems that&#x27;s a necessity to both get rid of the dandruff without causing problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it lathers well and the scent is nice. It would probably be fine if you followed it with a conditioner, but on its own it&#x27;s a bit to harsh for my needs.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo since I have a persistent dandruff problem.  Like any other dandruff shampoo, it is a temporary relief and you need to keep applying this about once a week to keep dandruff away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo completely clears dandruff and left my hair light and fluffy.</li>
    <li> This shampoo out of the selection is only missing one ingredient: menthol. This ingredient gives the cooling sensation in the rest of the products (complete care, sport mint, clean and refresh, and the rest). Literally every product has the same type of ingredients except this one. I didn&#x27;t try one out yet, but just putting it out there. I am assuming that the amounts of the ingredients in each of the types are varied.</li>
    <li> After using this for a week my hair looks nice, smells nice, and there isn&#x27;t a flake to be seen.  What else could one ask for?</li>
    <li> really great scent and a wonderful temporary scalp cleanser.  Washes out thoroughly.  Does not get rid of ALL dandruff, but can see noticeable results.  I have to wash my hair more often when using this product--normally I wash my hair twice a week, and when using this product, I wash my hair three times a week.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality shampoo that lathers well and makes my hair look clean. I really love the scent--it&#x27;s unusual but in a good way. Although this is supposedly a men&#x27;s shampoo, I think many females will also like the shampoo and its fragrance.</li>
    <li> I think TeaTree oil is a miracle product and I could give this five stars just for having it as an ingredient!!! It&#x27;s great for dandruff, itchy scalp....skin rashes, etc etc. Look into it!! But it has a powerful scent. This shampoo smells great with a whisp of teatree oil. It does control dandruff but in my opinion generic Head and Soulders at Walmart does a little better, for cheaper. Yet...overall I&#x27;d get this first because of the teatree!!</li>
    <li> The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Strong &amp; Full), with a price between the two extremes, also has a fragrance somewhere in the middle. It smells good, but is also very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review nailed the texture as \\&quot;melted ice cream.\\&quot; More importantly, it lathers well enough, though it is a bit hard to spread through long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean, but not squeaky clean.  It is similar to other creamy dandruff shampoos in this aspect.  Conditioner is not included, and if you normally use it, you will want to use it with this product as well.  My hair felt pretty dry after this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Strong &amp; Full shampoo is a very standard shampoo, seeming to excel at being middle-of-the-road in every aspect.  It will probably neither excite or disappoint you.</li>
    <li> Clearing your dandruff is one of those things that you do it and you&#x27;re like, &amp;#34;why the hell didn&#x27;t I do that before?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a mild flake problem. I wasn&#x27;t a snow globe, but I had an itchy scalp sometimes and if I wore something black I might collect a couple small white specks of debris on my shoulders. Now I don&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s a strange, satisfying feeling pulling back my hair and actually seeing my SCALP, not a thin layer of flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is awesome. I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo actually affect the look of my hair so much before. It looks noticeably better. I have thin hair and I think it looks a little fuller, but I don&#x27;t have a before and after pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this shampoo. It&#x27;s dirt cheap but it works crazily well.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this smells.  It has tea tree oil in it, but it&#x27;s not strong smelling.  I like tea tree oil in my shampoo because it really helps repel any lice and sometimes I am around kids that get it.  I&#x27;ve been putting a few drops in my shampoo for a long time and have never had a problem so far.  This shampoo has rich lather, and it feels very luxurious.  It cleans well.  It really only have problems with dandruff after I color my hair, and it has kept this from happening so I am pleased with that.  I would continue to use it the week after I color.  I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any difference in fullness though, and it seemed to be a tad drying, so I probably would not use it every day on my long hair.  I do love the smell though - it&#x27;s not sex specific - it doesn&#x27;t smell &#x27;like a man&#x27; or &#x27;like a woman&#x27; - it&#x27;s just a good natural clean smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It has a nice consistency...not too thin, as so many shampoos are. It has a nice scent, and it seems to work well. I don&#x27;t really have much trouble with dandruff, just a little dry scalp from time to time, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues since using this shampoo. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I used it and I&#x27;m not a man. It was OK but seemed it was Head&amp;Shoulders just a different color. Had a nice fragance and my hair was fine after using it.  It had a little more conditioner I think but it did work for the scaly scalp though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was in a nice plastic bottle that looked good in the shower rack and it&#x27;s a large too. Can&#x27;t say it was much different that what the dh was using but he said he worked fine for him too. I didn&#x27;t do a price comparison but after seeing it at the store I think it might have been a little less than H&amp;S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a chance if you find it on sale is my recommendation.</li>
    <li> I bought this but I&#x27;ve should have known better.  SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE and other toxic ingredients are found in this product.  I stopped using it and recently purchased JASON dandruff with conditioner containing zinc which has none of the Love Canal samples. found in Clear Scalp.  Since I cannot return it I&#x27;m going to use Clear Scalp on my storage unit&#x27;s floor when I give it it&#x27;s annual hosing.  I&#x27;m sure it will do the job removing the dirt and road salt but I would not use it on my head.</li>
    <li> I see less dandruff thanks to tree oil (inside Clear). Only beef is I think my scalp is a bit itchier. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but that&#x27;s the takeaway. I&#x27;ll still buy more of this stuff when I run out.</li>
    <li> We all know that washing hair with shampoo removes excess dirt, sweat, pool chlorine and oil, as well as other unwanted products from the hair and scalp. But removing dandruff and skin particles that build up in hair takes something a bit stronger and that where products like [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong &amp; Full]] come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key active ingredient in this shampoo appears to be pyrithione zinc (1.0%), which is a formulation known to reduce shedding, and according to some sources, moderately promotes hair growth. I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint]] before with very successful results, and earlier this year, that formulation became my daily shampoo. I also have a closely trimmed beard, and when dandruff occasionally shows up there, it&#x27;s irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So where does this one fit in? Is it any better in controlling dandruff? Both of these shampoos appear to have the same general list of ingredients, but the key difference seems to be that the directions for the Cool Sport Mint version say; \\&quot;for best results use daily.\\&quot; This Strong &amp; Full version states that \\&quot;for best results use at least twice a week or as directed by doctor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I&#x27;ve settled into using the Cool Sport Mint variety as a regular daily shampoo, but supplement it with their [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration]] a couple times a week, as it has the conditioner built in. This Strong &amp; Full version is the one that I use for mostly afternoon and evening use when my hair has gotten wet from strenuous exercise or after cycling. Hair can really get wet and nasty after being out on a mountain bike for a couple of hours in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have different hair and different needs, but if you do get occasional (or frequent) dandruff, all of these products will do the job, and their descriptive titles are pretty accurate. I&#x27;ll list all three here so that you don&#x27;t have to go digging or searching if you want to try them out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint]] - daily use&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong &amp; Full]] - occasional use&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration]] - has conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaints at all it would be that there isn&#x27;t enough of the tea tree ingredient in any of these. For anyone who has used a good shampoo with a decent concentration of tea tree, such as the [[ASIN:B003U4F6FC Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo]], you know how good that extra tingle can feel on the scalp. It also aids in dandruff control, but it&#x27;s far more costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first received the Cool Sport Mint version as a Vine selection, tried it and liked it, so I moved on to try the others. Since then I&#x27;ve re-ordered the first one to replace my older daily shampoo, and as the other versions run out, will do the same with them. Can&#x27;t recommend one over the other, as we all have different heads of hair, and what would work for one may not be as good for another. Again, none of these have enough tea tree for my liking, but that&#x27;s a personal thing, and I guess it&#x27;s what works best for each persons hair. In any case, this Strong &amp; Full version is excellent and highly recommended, but so are the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/6/2012tles are pretty accurate. I&#x27;ll list all three here so that you don&#x27;t have to go digging or searching if you want to try them out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint]] - daily use&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B007K449CE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong &amp; Full]] - occasional use&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B007JT7AIA CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Dry Scalp Hydration]] - has conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any complaints at all it would be that there isn&#x27;t enough of the tea tree ingredient in any of these.

    <li> A very pleasant and not at all overpowering smell. It really cleans well and makes my scalp feel fantastic. So it works and I&#x27;ll definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> My son really loved this shampoo and says that it works! :)  We&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding something that works, too.</li>
    <li> I was at my wits end trying to deal with my dandruff and flaking scalp.  I had tried many shampoos and some home remedies.  I saw CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY on Amazon at a reasonable price.  I decided to give it a try.  It works.  If you have this problem, I recommend you give it a try, too.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a week and started to notice improvements. It smells great and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 3 stars is the price. For a bottle this size it seems to me that I could be at least a few dollars cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product has done an admirable job of controlling a teenage son&#x27;s dandruff and is very reasonably priced--quoted at $5 a bottle today.  None of the medicinal smell that anti-dandruffs sometimes have and a little dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Have had a flaky and itchy scalp all my life.  Scrubbing down with this stuff every other day banished it completely.  It does have QUITE a strong perfume, but I think it smells great.  Fruity and Invigorating.</li>
    <li> This shampoo actually works. After years and years of purchasing anti-dandruff shampoos for my husband I finally found one that works. And as a bonus, it smells really good too. Could not be happier with the product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells nice and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. As for the anti-dandruff claim, it seems to work. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, but, for me price is the real determining factor and this isn&#x27;t cheap. So, if a customer does want to try it out, I think it is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This Clear \\&quot;Strong &amp; Full\\&quot; anti-dandruff shampoo does work well to control dandruff and it also leaves my hair feeling very clean. I am a long time Head &amp; Shoulders user and generally default back to it when shopping, but will consider this specific type from Clear if it is comparably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is normally very oily so I like that this is a little \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; than most other dandruff shampoos, without having an overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear. Overall, this is a good anti-dandruff shampoo and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the product line and I use it regularly.  I do use the others on occasion, but this particular one seems to be the most effective.  All of these products are highly recommended though.</li>
    <li> The phrase \\&quot;strong and full\\&quot; is a big deceiving because the odor of this shampoo is quite mild, which I prefer. A little bit lathers into many suds so this bottle should last a long time. So, many washings from this bottle means an economic deal. It really cleans your hair well and even 24 hours later, after sleeping, my hair still feels quite clean and not greasy at all. For me (and this is a personal gripe), this shampoo does indeed give you full hair. Since I don&#x27;t need my hair to stand up taller than it already does, I probably won&#x27;t be using this shampoo much. If you have thinner hair and want your hair to appear bigger and fuller, this shampoo should do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, ~~~This product is the most effective one that i have used, Can see the results after once using..</li>
    <li> I tried this through the Amazon Vine program. It works equally well with Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue, and smells slightly better than both. I was a little disappointed, as I had pretty high expectations of some fabulous new product. But it works, feels pretty good and has a very faint slightly pleasant aroma. If you use two of the traditional products, give it a try.</li>
    <li> Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is an effective dandruff shampoo that packs the power of Pyrithione Zinc and a \\&quot;Bio-Nutrium 10\\&quot; cocktail of nutrients, ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins, almond &amp; coconut oil. It is effective from the standpoint of control of my dandruff, but not a cure and may take a few rinses to get it all out during each treatment, and it leaves a tingle with a neutral fragrance. Definitely Recommended. Three and a half EFFECTIVE Stars! (12.9 fl oz plastic bottle.)</li>
    <li> It does work at keeping dandruff in check, but there are a couple of brands out there that I feel do better, even though they&#x27;re 2-in-1 shampoo plus conditioners. But if you don&#x27;t like 2-in-1s, like I didn&#x27;t use to, this is a decent shampoo without too strong a scent that doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair or scalp too bad.</li>
    <li> This Clear AntiDandruff shampoo works well &amp; has a light, non-offensive scent.  The bottle says that it should be used at least 2x/wk, but my family members use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the men in my family like this shampoo.  One member prefers the 2/1 product because it is just \\&quot;easier in the shower\\&quot; &amp; the other one prefers [[ASIN:B007JT7AGC CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, fragrance &amp; shampoo/conditioner combos are a matter of preference, so if you are mainly looking for an antidandruff &amp; like the idea of the bio nutrium 10 products, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results of this Clear blend.</li>
    <li> i gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it works very well and i would recommend this product to anyone who has dandruff and a dry scalp</li>
    <li> I have tried everything. I was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff everywhere, flaky skin around my nose and eyebrows, and was told it was a life sentence. Winters in the arid West made things worse. Some shampoo products helped sort of (mostly with 2% zinc). This is the first product I have used that cleared up my dandruff and the dermatitis around my nose. In the shower I lather it on to hair, face and ears and let it soak in while I shower the rest of me. I then shave in the shower using the Clear as shaving cream. Then I rinse off. A week of this and I was cured and a new convert. Hope it works for you, too.</li>
    <li> I am looking to replace my store brand dandruff shampoo and my coal tar shampoo with something that will work better and be cheaper.  I am looking for a basic dandruff shampoo without a lot of extras. I tried the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration version of this brand which I like but I liked the name of this so I figured I&lt;br /&gt;would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased so far. This seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product. The perfume like smell in many shampoos which I don&#x27;t like is not as strong as I thought it would be and after I am done washing my hair I don&#x27;t notice any lingering smell. A little of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, both this and the  2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration version of this this brand use the same active ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), to treat the dandruff. I have not looked at the other ingredients but the the 2 in 1 shampoo is also a conditioner while this one says it is just a  dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web page on Amazon says under directions that this product should be used twice a week but the bottle says to use it daily. I have used it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased with this. If I can use this instead of my two other shampoos I will save money as well.  I like it a bit better than the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration version of this brand but both are fine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine. The smell is very mild, and doesn&#x27;t even have a strong smell of tea tree oil. It does clean well and my hair does not feel overly dry. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get a good lather, and as a matter of habit, I always rinse and repeat. My hair is quite short and thin and my scalp does not react badly or get dried out by it. This is a great product for those with occasional dandruff. I cannot comment for someone who has severe dandruff issues, because that is not me. I also think it is a good value, since you will not be using much to get your hair clean (even twice). I do find it funny that the description adds to follow your doctors directions. I can&#x27;t imagine my doctor recommending this over any other over-the-counter brand, especially with some of the other brands being fairly strong. If you don&#x27;t want that strong, medicine smell, this is a no brainer. I would note that the opening is a pain and does not open very much and it is a little hard to squeeze. I have used several other products within the brand, and this is the first time I have experienced this, so it may be this particular bottle. 4.5 stars, but gets the nod to 5 instead of down to 4. The only negative is the bottle and I would like more tea tree oil. Still, this is easy to recommend.</li>
