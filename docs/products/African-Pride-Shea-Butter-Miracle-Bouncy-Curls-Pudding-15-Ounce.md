      <li>Good for a setting lotion for  your hair to.</li>
      <li>It is great for the hair, but i&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s because I used it (twice) with another product called cantu shea butter</li>
      <li>First if all it smells soooo good!!</li>
      <li>so creamy and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I just going to be completely honest.</li>
      <li>Kind of moist.</li>
      <li>But try this product at your own risk.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this if you need a cheap styling product that gives good results.</li>

      <li>Love shopping from you</li>
      <li>and I love the way it works but couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart anymore, so</li>
      <li>Not that my hair doesn&#x27;t love water, its just that it loves water in its &#x27;purest&#x27; form.</li>
      <li>But the consistency of this product is like a pudding that turns into more of a liquid when it&#x27;s rubbed in.</li>
      <li>Bought this at my local beauty supply store and i absolutely LOVE it!!!</li>
      <li>However, it does leave your hair really moist and it feels good</li>
      <li>my curls are good as new!</li>
      <li>Just make sure to start on clean hair to get your desired hair style because you can achieve the hair style you want to get.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are listed in a manner that i assumed it would be very beneficial, good quantity of the good stuff with less fillers, and good quality.</li>
      <li>My hair felt fine.</li>
      <li>This would be a great product if it didnt leave white deposits on hair</li>
      <li>This product and the cheap texturizer</li>
      <li>It works just like Olive Oil Smooth and Hold Pudding.  </li>
      <li>it was a cheap moisturizer</li>
      <li>The African Pride Shea Butter Miracle Bouncy Curls Pudding is one of the best natural hair products I have used.  </li>
      <li>Keep up the good work African Pride!!!</li>
      <li>As a 2b mom it&#x27;s been an adventure trying to figure out how to manage my son&#x27;s hair which covers the full range of type 3 hair.</li>
      <li>Luckily I had</li>
      <li>I have mainly 4c hair and in my opinion I get better twists than with Shea Moisture.</li>
      <li>Im buying three more jars,  its a matter of time before this product is on high demands,  which means the price will go up.</li>
      <li>My curls did look more natural and shiny and held all day.</li>
      <li>My 4a hair is very undefined and after a wash and application of this product, my curls looked salon fresh!</li>
      <li>It really sucked in a wash and go and only gives my hair good curl definition when it&#x27;s first applied.</li>
      <li>Luckily im nursing it back to a better state with Wen Fig shampoo, jojoba oil from dessert essence, and coconut oil from Nature&#x27;s Way.</li>
      <li>but, I would rather pay the extra on here than use the gas to search for a store that carries it :)</li>
      <li>first it seemed moisturizing</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>It smells good but by the end of the day my hair is thirsty and dried out.</li>
      <li>this is nice but the smell is strong and the product is thick.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I was putting too much</li>
      <li>I have been using Beautiful textures for the last few months</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find something in a decent price range that I could use AND that worked, this does!</li>
      <li>very pretty.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, this makes my hair a bit frizzy and doesn&#x27;t really define my curls.</li>
      <li>it really &amp;#34;locs&amp;#34; my hair stays moist for about a week.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very watery compared to the puddings I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t really like it, I had to get used to the scent.</li>
      <li>By all means, if your hair doesn&#x27;t need much moisture, then this product may be a winner for you...not for me</li>
      <li>I have a decent braid out.</li>
      <li>it still looked decent.</li>
      <li>I used this in my hair with HIGH HOPES.</li>
      <li>As far as setting styles go it doesn&#x27;t have much shine, definition, or hold.</li>
      <li>I apply it to his wet hair and gently tug on his cheeks and just watch them spring back and coil up the more I do so.</li>
      <li>Has a lovely smell, but it left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>My are is very soft after using this and managable.</li>
      <li>It made it very soft but it wasnt that curly.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft, moisturized and manageable!.</li>
      <li>Makes my curls soft and defined.</li>
      <li>and it was still soft.</li>
      <li>I naturally have curly hair, yet this product made my hair frizz.</li>
      <li>Im natural and</li>
      <li>It makes your hair so curly and soft.</li>
      <li>I used this product on my natural hair and while I transitioned.</li>
      <li>My hair is natural and wavy.  </li>
      <li>This pudding works well in moisturizing my hair and making it soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It was immediately moisturizing and made my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>I usually just rinse out the white stuff when it is dried and flaky and it still feels great.</li>
      <li>Im african american with curly kinky hair thats lightly texturized by this same African Pride Shea Butter texture kit thats supposed to compliment this pudding product.  </li>
      <li>However when I finally big chopped and used this as a moisturizer, my hair felt very, very soft and I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair!&lt;br</li>
      <li>So apparently, everyone loves this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was really surprised that when I used it the second time my hair felt so soft, especially since there are cones in this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just worlds above anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>The other brand worked really well</li>
      <li>Also, I paid less than $5 for it at the local hair store, so look in your area first before paying this price.</li>
      <li>While  I was transitioning, when I used this product, my hair didn&#x27;t look very moisturized, it looked dry and felt dry.</li>
      <li>It also does not dry, it stays white on the hair.</li>

    <li> I used this product on my natural hair and while I transitioned. While  I was transitioning, when I used this product, my hair didn&#x27;t look very moisturized, it looked dry and felt dry. I didn&#x27;t like it. However when I finally big chopped and used this as a moisturizer, my hair felt very, very soft and I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very wet, and the smell is tropical and fruity. Although I don&#x27;t really like it, I had to get used to the scent. The scent also lasted in my hair. I used it on a Bantu knot out, and my hair came out very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised that when I used it the second time my hair felt so soft, especially since there are cones in this product. Although there are a LOT of good ingredients in this too. I would recommend this if you need a cheap styling product that gives good results.</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel dry.  Luckily I had staples already thst work perfectly so that ttaught me a huge lesson about trying to experiment</li>
    <li> My hair loves this pudding. I just love, love love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair pudding out there. It makes your hair so curly and soft. It adds bounce and body. Good for a setting lotion for  your hair to. Just make sure to start on clean hair to get your desired hair style because you can achieve the hair style you want to get.</li>
    <li> Way overpriced.  Watery, weird, white stuff that never absorbed into my hair and yes I followed the instructions.  I had to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I am confess, I am a product junkie and the color of the container is pretty,lol. I have both this one and the leave in conditioner, which is lighter. I use them together I have a decent braid out. My are is very soft after using this and managable. And I did not purchase it here, I got it at a beauty supply store for about 4.99</li>
    <li> so creamy and smells amazing. Makes my hair soft, moisturized and manageable!.</li>
    <li> I have like 3c-4a type hair. For those of you that don&#x27;t know what that means, it means my hair is kinky curly. This product works wonders on it. Ive used the Shea moistures curl enhancing smoothie but all it does is give a good smell to my hair. I use this for twist outs, Bantu knot out, briad outs, mix it with argan oil Eco styler for a defined wash n go. It&#x27;s a little pricey on amazon but, I would rather pay the extra on here than use the gas to search for a store that carries it :)</li>
    <li> This would be a great product if it didnt leave white deposits on hair</li>
    <li> The African Pride Shea Butter Miracle Bouncy Curls Pudding is one of the best natural hair products I have used.  It is a styling product that also moisturizes hair and gives great shine and good hold.  I use this product for braid/twist outs and wash and go&#x27;s. My hair tends to get over conditioned and start to poof; however, with this product I can substitute it for my leave in conditioner and still have hair that is defined and has hold. This product also dries well with little to no residue left in hair.  The smell of the product is an added bonus.  This product has just the right thickness to weigh my thick hair down unlike lighter conditioners which can cause hair to poof.  Keep up the good work African Pride!!!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes, does not leave your hair greasy but hair does not stay moisturized long. You have to reapply each day. Smell is okay.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local beauty supply store and i absolutely LOVE it!!! The smell is Amazingggg and it kept my Bantu Knots moisturized and bouncy for dayss!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this pudding, but boy was I wrong. I used this pudding to twist my hair and the next day, my hair was dry and unflattering. I was so disappointed. I have very thick curly hair and I need moisture...not moisture mixed with weird sounding ingredients and WATER! My hair loves oils and butters to weigh it down a bit. Not that my hair doesn&#x27;t love water, its just that it loves water in its &#x27;purest&#x27; form. I didn&#x27;t purchase it from here. By all means, if your hair doesn&#x27;t need much moisture, then this product may be a winner for you...not for me</li>
    <li> I just going to be completely honest. I hated this product. Af first it seemed moisturizing but when I took my twists out it was not moisturized and felt weird. It really sucked in a wash and go and only gives my hair good curl definition when it&#x27;s first applied. As far as setting styles go it doesn&#x27;t have much shine, definition, or hold. I will not repurchase and wish I could find use for it. I will try it on my little sisters 3c hair. ( my hair is majority 4b with 4a in the back and front)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I LOVE this product. I bought it spur of the moment for my toddler&#x27;s hair. As a 2b mom it&#x27;s been an adventure trying to figure out how to manage my son&#x27;s hair which covers the full range of type 3 hair. This product is a bargain for what it does. It defines and most importantly MOISTURIZES his hair--in seconds! You can actually see it work. I apply it to his wet hair and gently tug on his cheeks and just watch them spring back and coil up the more I do so. I&#x27;m beyond pleased with this product. It&#x27;s just worlds above anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far. I recommended it to other friends and family with dry or curly hair and they&#x27;ve all raved about it. I am stocking up!</li>
    <li> I have curly about 3b hair and i tried this out it was a cheap moisturizer so i decided to try. First if all it smells soooo good!! It just instantly quenched my hair!! i did a 3 strand twist and took it out 2 days later and my hair stil smelled really good and it was still soft. I think it served its purpose but still not better than cantu&#x27;s natural hair line.</li>
    <li> All I can say is dont sleep on this product. Im natural and my hair texture is a 4a/b  and when I say this product moisturise that what it does for days!!!!! I discover this product at walmart for $3.47 so go to walmart. before the price go up. I already have three jars and when I go back to walmart this month Im buying three more jars,  its a matter of time before this product is on high demands,  which means the price will go up. this is the best product I have ever bought. I spent tons on Miss Jessies products and the crap dries my hair out . So run out to your local walmart and buy it .</li>
    <li> It smells good but by the end of the day my hair is thirsty and dried out. My daughter&#x27;s hair is curlier and it does the same for her too.</li>
    <li> This works on my two strand twists and helps achieve great twist outs. I have mainly 4c hair and in my opinion I get better twists than with Shea Moisture.</li>
    <li> Love shopping from you</li>
    <li> I just happen to buy this on a whim, for my daughters course, thick, curly hair. I am more than pleased with this product and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find something in a decent price range that I could use AND that worked, this does! Also, I paid less than $5 for it at the local hair store, so look in your area first before paying this price.</li>
    <li> Just so you&#x27;ll know. Im african american with curly kinky hair thats lightly texturized by this same African Pride Shea Butter texture kit thats supposed to compliment this pudding product.  I used this in my hair with HIGH HOPES. The ingredients are listed in a manner that i assumed it would be very beneficial, good quantity of the good stuff with less fillers, and good quality. I washed and conditioned my hair and put this in my hair after. My hair felt fine. Kind of moist. Not greasy. But the consistency of this product is like a pudding that turns into more of a liquid when it&#x27;s rubbed in. Like a lotion kinda. Getting to my 1 star. My hair dries and feels like its stringy and completely dead. Like extra dry plastic straw. So i thought that maybe it was because i didn&#x27;t have enough in my hair. I used more. Same thing. Initial wetness then dries like straw. Im sooooooo disappointed. I will not be buying this again and i definitely wont recommend it. Do i hate the company, no. This product and the cheap texturizer, definitely no. I almost thought i would have to cut all my hair off. Luckily im nursing it back to a better state with Wen Fig shampoo, jojoba oil from dessert essence, and coconut oil from Nature&#x27;s Way. I threw that in there just in case anyone was wondering. But try this product at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I really loved the consistency and the way the product felt on my hair. It was immediately moisturizing and made my hair so soft. BUT, immediately after using it, the product caused my eyes to become irritated and water really bad. I also experienced chest pain. I did not touch the product to my eyes. Unfortunately, there is a chemical in this product that I was allergic too. I had to wash my hair out and ended up throwing the product away. So disappointing, but health comes first.</li>
    <li> So apparently, everyone loves this product. It is great for the hair, but i&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s because I used it (twice) with another product called cantu shea butter but it&#x27;s leaving white flaky residue in my hair. It also does not dry, it stays white on the hair. At first I thought I was putting too much but then I started using a very small amounts but it still left residue( it could be the other product). However, it does leave your hair really moist and it feels good (I use it with Jamaican Black Caster Oil and Cantu Shea butter). I use it with the loc method and it really &amp;#34;locs&amp;#34; my hair stays moist for about a week. I usually just rinse out the white stuff when it is dried and flaky and it still feels great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with another curly pudding. The other brand worked really well and I tried to use this one after. However, this makes my hair a bit frizzy and doesn&#x27;t really define my curls. I use this when I run out of other products but wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this. Moisturizing and helps my curls to stay</li>
    <li> Makes my curls soft and defined. My 4a hair is very undefined and after a wash and application of this product, my curls looked salon fresh!</li>
    <li> For some reason the butter didnt give me hair bouncy curls. It made it very soft but it wasnt that curly.</li>
    <li> Left my hair kinda crispy. The curls hold for two days, felt too sick to set it and woke up it still looked decent. My curls did look more natural and shiny and held all day. I have been using Beautiful textures for the last few months and I love the way it works but couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart anymore, so I tried African pride it&#x27;s like $4 bucks at Walmart. It&#x27;s very watery compared to the puddings I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The product made my hair feel gummy.</li>
    <li> this is nice but the smell is strong and the product is thick. not really for me.</li>
    <li> Has a lovely smell, but it left my hair dry and brittle. I naturally have curly hair, yet this product made my hair frizz. I wouldn&#x27;t mind receiving a refund.</li>
    <li> The product is great and works great but I suggest you check the stores around you areas before ordering it online.  for the price of snh i could have bought 2 my son found it in a beauty store $4.99 for the same 15 ozs</li>
    <li> And now women are attracted to me without me paying them to like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has changed my pathetic life.</li>
    <li> My curls start to unwind and relax after day 2 and 3. I dampen my hair, put this product on each section as I bantu knot it, and in the morning - my curls are good as new!</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and wavy.  This pudding works well in moisturizing my hair and making it soft and manageable.  It does not feel sticky or make my hair feel heavy or weighed down.  It works just like Olive Oil Smooth and Hold Pudding.  I wanted to try this one to see if it made any difference but it seems to work the same as the Olive Oil pudding.  Would I use it again?  Yes.</li>
