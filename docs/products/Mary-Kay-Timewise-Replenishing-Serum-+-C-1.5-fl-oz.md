      <li>I am comparing this to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin face lotion that I have used for years.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes no amount of product will change that, but if you are looking for something that will be hydrating and give your skin a more polished glow...</li>
      <li>Lesson learned :)</li>
      <li>I love the Replenishing Serum</li>
      <li>So this is the next best thing that I have tried that is within my price range.</li>
      <li>It was smoother, more &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and had a glow- y dew to it.</li>
      <li>So glad I stumbled onto it.</li>
      <li>I can go without foundation and still look okay .  </li>
      <li>, What more could I ask for?  </li>
      <li>and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
      <li>The product lasts a REALLY long time, which is great!</li>
      <li>and this is by far the most effective MK product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>My face looks healthier, pores have shrunk and my fine lines are disappearing.  </li>
      <li>My skin is softer, smoother, and the fine lines around the eyes are almost invisible.</li>
      <li>I really like that I can order online and not have to worry about consultants pressuring me to buy more!</li>

      <li>Sking feels fresh, hydrated and taken care of.</li>
      <li>and it was received right on time.</li>
      <li>I had huge pores and I started to see some wrinkles between my eyebrows making me look a lot older</li>
      <li>The first time I used it,I could feel my skin just soaking up the serum and could see a difference right away.  </li>
      <li>I use it first thing every morning and night after cleansing.</li>
      <li>Will return to purchase more when necessary!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It really works !&lt;</li>
      <li>I have for the first time in my life received compliments on my skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth although I haven&#x27;t yet seen any reduction of wrinkles, I do like the way my skin feels after application.</li>
      <li>Seller packaged really well</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much &#x27;C&#x27; serum is in the product because it is not listed, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much.</li>
      <li>I have been using this treatment for about a month now and have really seen results.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>

      <li>I started using &#x27;C&#x27; products because they absolutely do make a difference in your skin.</li>
      <li>This price is so much better than other comparable products.</li>
      <li>Other &#x27;C&#x27; serums I have used have been much better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe that any over the counter topical is capable of making wrinkles go away, but if you have reasonable expectations, this product is worth a try.</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this one out because it was one of the products that got a high rating on the Today Show.  </li>
      <li>Has really helped with a couple of dry patches and also with my skin looking fresh.</li>
      <li>Now this product is in a single, larger container which last for 6 weeks rather than the original 4 wks!!</li>

      <li>At the end of this product, my skin looked young and radiant!</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel alive and very soft.  </li>
      <li>Unlike some products that I received from other Mary Kay vendors through Amazon, this product was unopened and FULL.  </li>
      <li>1 pump is 4X larger than the previous packaging, so more convenient to keep track of.</li>
      <li>Within three days, I could see a clear difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old</li>
      <li>and I am 56 years old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product and great seller too! thanks</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I started using it morning and night and after just one week I could see the difference. My skin is softer, smoother, and the fine lines around the eyes are almost invisible. I&#x27;m 42 years old and I&#x27;ve used Mary K products before and this is by far the most effective MK product I&#x27;ve ever used! Totally recommend it</li>
    <li> happy with product&lt;br /&gt;good to use, convenient package.&lt;br /&gt;very happy today and I hope in the future&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a job</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Can definately tell the difference in my skin when I don&#x27;t use it.  It is now a permanent addition to my morning and evening routine.</li>
    <li> No longer 4 separate pumps. 1 pump is 4X larger than the previous packaging, so more convenient to keep track of. Recommended seller. Fast and easy shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes your skin feel alive and very soft.  Will decrease wrinkles after using it for awhile.  One of my very favorite products of Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I have been using this treatment for about a month now and have really seen results.  I use it in  morning under my sunscreen and at night. My skin is softer, firmer with increased skin clarity and decreased pore size. I have for the first time in my life received compliments on my skin. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have had a rash on my face and although I was trying timewise replenishing  for the replenishing part there was a side benifit for me, it has taken most of the rash away and I have only used it for 4 days... that was sure a pluss!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful Vitamin C product. This price is so much better than other comparable products. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth although I haven&#x27;t yet seen any reduction of wrinkles, I do like the way my skin feels after application.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have seen great results in a short period of time.  I would buy this product again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I really like this product . When I ordered it I received it with a few day . I will order it again . Very pleased !</li>
    <li> Mary Kay products are the best.  I feel that my skin is the best that it has ever been and I am 56 years old.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product by seeing that it has 44 ml in it. But when I received the package it contained four small bottles which contained 7.5 ml. Even the aggregate quantity is not equal to the one they are showing on this page. And their customer service is  worst . So be careful friends!!</li>
    <li> This is not the Serum I thought I was ordering.....the one I wanted was &amp;#34;The Lifting Serum&amp;#34;.  I simply ordered the wrong one....this was much too thin and runny and did not perform well.  The mistake was mine, not yours.</li>
    <li> Unlike some products that I received from other Mary Kay vendors through Amazon, this product was unopened and FULL.  I love the way it feels on my skin (non-greasy) and I can tell it moisturizes :)</li>
    <li> My Mary Kay Timewise Serum + C came within a few days after my order in great shape.  They sent me chocolates too.  How wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I like it but it will be perfect if this product has seal. As you know, when I received it, it looks it was opened. how can you change this situation if I purchase next time?  The outer box is opend and the bottole also has no seal. it;s not good.</li>
    <li> I love the Replenishing Serum +C! I have been using it since it came out and have definitely seen the results in my skin. Now this product is in a single, larger container which last for 6 weeks rather than the original 4 wks!! I use it first thing every morning and night after cleansing. It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  Not greasy and I really like the smell, kinda of like coffee????</li>
    <li> Takes away my sallow look and adds a glow to my skin! I can go without foundation and still look okay .  I&#x27;m a product junkie and have tried everything. This C Serum is the best one for the price.  I cannot be without it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that any over the counter topical is capable of making wrinkles go away, but if you have reasonable expectations, this product is worth a try. I think that after a few weeks of consistent  use, my skin looks less red and puffy. I get the similar, if not slightly better (and immediate) results from Perricone&#x27;s Face Firming Activator, but that stuff is 120 a bottle. So this is the next best thing that I have tried that is within my price range.</li>
    <li> This serum was not as I had hoped it would be.  I am sorry to report that my pores did not get smaller and my sun spot did not fade.  I am comparing this to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin face lotion that I have used for years.  I thought I would try this one out because it was one of the products that got a high rating on the Today Show.  I used the whole bottle, which lasted about four months and kept waiting to see the wonderful results that I had heard about...Did not happen :(  I went back to using the Neutrogena and in two weeks time I can see the difference.  My face looks healthier, pores have shrunk and my fine lines are disappearing.  Lesson learned :)</li>
    <li> I bought this without really searching reviews.  The first time I used it,I could feel my skin just soaking up the serum and could see a difference right away.  It says to use three pumps in the morning and night.  I feel like I only need two pumps.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel great!</li>
    <li> This is something I use every morning and it makes my skin feel great. Has really helped with a couple of dry patches and also with my skin looking fresh. Seller packaged really well and it was received right on time. Will return to purchase more when necessary!</li>
    <li> A stable... other c serums break me out... been using this every day for 4-5 years before anything else.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re taking business away from HARD WORKING CONSULTANTS!!!</li>
    <li> Applause! This product is worth the price! I really like that I can order online and not have to worry about consultants pressuring me to buy more!</li>
    <li> I love this!!  I will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! I can&#x27;t say enough about it. It came at a really great price, quick delivery, and arrived in mint condition, What more could I ask for?  Does the product work? YES it does!  I am in my thirties and use the Timewise Line and this is one of my favorite products. My skin literally &amp;#34;drinks&amp;#34; the product in and keeps it hydrated and my skin somehow appears brighter. Also, I am keeping wrinkles at bay. The product lasts a REALLY long time, which is great!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this with a different purchase of Mary Kay products. I had run out of my other serum, so I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try this out for a few days before I could buy my normal brand. So glad I stumbled onto it. Within three days, I could see a clear difference in my skin. It was smoother, more &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and had a glow- y dew to it. I woke up with pretty skin and my make up even goes on better. As for the commenters saying their wrinkles disappeared or their pores were so much smaller, let&#x27;s not be unreasonable. You have the skin that you have. Sometimes no amount of product will change that, but if you are looking for something that will be hydrating and give your skin a more polished glow...this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best product Mary Kay is making now. I have Systemic Lupus with skin involvement that leaves my skin very dry - unless I am using this serum.  It does wonders for my skin.  I use it both in the morning and at night - it is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I had huge pores and I started to see some wrinkles between my eyebrows making me look a lot older then I am. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mary Kay so I decided to try this product regardless of the price.... I LOVE IT! By week 2, I noticed my wrinkles between my eyebrows were GONE! By the middle of week 3, my skin looked tighter, minimizing my pores. At the end of this product, my skin looked young and radiant! I love this product! No more huge pores! No more wrinkles! I&#x27;ll keep using this product for a long long time! Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and just under and around the eyes as I have dark circles under them. This seems to make my eyes look lighter and fresher. It also helps with putting concealer on under the eyes as well, it goes on smoother with a much more uniform look.</li>
    <li> It really works !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think it is the best anti-age product I ever used. I fully recommend it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great service, great product! Loved it! Will be shopping again soon. Mary Kay has always been a product that meets it&#x27;s expectations!</li>
    <li> This product works great! My skin looks so smooth and my skin tone is so even now. I will continue to use this product. I just love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very light serum. Sking feels fresh, hydrated and taken care of. Needs very little amount per application. Great Mary Kay product.</li>
    <li> I started using &#x27;C&#x27; products because they absolutely do make a difference in your skin. I don&#x27;t find them to be miracle products by any means, but using a good &#x27;C&#x27; product will make visible changes in your skin&#x27;s texture and &#x27;glow&#x27; factor. I usually like Mary Kay products and was excited to try this one. I don&#x27;t know how much &#x27;C&#x27; serum is in the product because it is not listed, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much. Other &#x27;C&#x27; serums I have used have been much better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this nor will I be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, my skin looks and feels great, works better than the expensive stuff.</li>
