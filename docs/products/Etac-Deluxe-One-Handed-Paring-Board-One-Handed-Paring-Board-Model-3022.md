    <li> It&#x27;s the handiest tool in my kitchen. After a stroke I couldn&#x27;t my right hand.  The vice holds everything, from cutting to opening an envelope with a scissors.  It is well worth the money ten fold.</li>
    <li> Is a wonderful tool! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> For me as a 1 handed teen thanks to 4 strokes(cerebral palsy) who has moved out of home.It is the difference between 1.Living on takeways  2.Having a carer (Im very anti social)  If you have a 1 handed kid BUY THIS and get them helping out in kitchen asap(like when 3 years old its easier than when they are teenagers)  This review is aimed at my age group but its also great for adults</li>
    <li> My husband had a stroke and only has use of one arm, this was great for him.  He is able to help out with prepping the meal.</li>
    <li> Better than the tiny board also sold on Amazon. I&#x27;m one-handed and was able to assemble it with no problem. I&#x27;ve used all the features - the clamp works well, although the two pegs fall out too easily.  Good, not phenomenal - but short of getting use of my left hand again, pretty darn good</li>
    <li> Very handy in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a family member that had a stroke. Since they can only use one hand this has been a huge help for him preparing his own meals. Very easy to use and wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars before even using it.  I bought this for a Christmas present for a family member who only has use of one arm.  Upon review,  there is no doubt that this is going to make her day.  Can&#x27;t wait to give it to her!</li>
    <li> I would give this item all five stars except for two things. Number one - it needs assembly. It&#x27;s made for a person with one hand and, for the life of me I can&#x27;t see how a one-handed person could assemble it. Not everyone has someone to help them as does my 10-year-old great-granddaughter.  It should come assembled. Number two - it is a bit small.</li>
    <li> Very useful and helpful piece of equipment, makes an independent life easier.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Saves me a ton of time each and every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Gave to my brother as a gift. helps him out being one handed for medical reasons. good concept</li>
    <li> It looks ok. I bought it for my one handed mother and try it out. So far I can cut somethings but I can not open a tomato sauce jar just using one hand and the board. It think it will require practice to get the most out of it.</li>
    <li> my mom only has one hand due to a illness and i got this for her to help her cut! i would say it works good if your talented but my mom is right handed and only can use her left hand so its very hard for her to use by herself!  but I&#x27;m sure with time she might get better at it  but for now she can only use it if we set it all up for her!</li>
    <li> My wife had her hand amputated, that is why I purchased this.. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but I decided to try one. It truly is a wonderful product and she uses it often. Thank  you.</li>
    <li> This  cutting  board  does  the  job  for  one  handed  person.  I  just  received  the  board,  so  I  haven&#x27;t  used  all  of  the  features.of it.  This  board  is  larger  than  the  single  handed  cutting  board  that I  already  have,  and it  has  a  vice  included  that  will  hold  most  anything  that  you  would  need  to  use  in  fixing  a  lunch  or  dinner.  I  feel  it  is  wiser  to  pay  the  additional  money  for this  board as  opposed  to  the  smaller  board,  as  the  features in  this board  make  it  a winner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom after she had a stroke and lost use of one arm. She uses it all the time and says it has made it so much easier for her to prepare and cook items. I am not a huge fan of plastic and wish it came in a stainless steel option but she seems very happy with it</li>
    <li> This worked beautifully for almost a year.  Then the suction cups began to come off .we put them back onbut theycontinue to stick to t he  counterinstead of the cutting board .  NOW THE vice DOESN&#x27;t hold tight and I see no. Way of f ixing it.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because I loved it so.much while it was working properly.</li>
    <li> Great, it made me feel that I can do for myself instead of waiting for someone else to the job for me!  What a feel of accomplishment!!!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this with confidence. He cannot use his left side. He opens jars, bottles, cuts most everything. HE takes great pleasure making dinner.</li>
    <li> does not provide as much help as i expected, my opinion is it is much overpriced, give it some serious thought!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, and well-made. You should not be disappinted.</li>
