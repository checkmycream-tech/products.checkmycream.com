<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked fine but I had to throw the shaver away.</li>
    <li> AS A BLACK MAN, IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND A CLOSE SHAVE ELECTRIC THAT REALLY WORKS TIME AFTER TIME..THIS ONE DOES...BUY IT! THIS REPLACEMENT FOIL AND CUTTER WORKS GREAT AND IS EASY TO SNAP ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I should have gotten these long ago. I don&#x27;t remember my razor ever giving me this good of shaving. I have been holding on to it because I broke my foot a few years ago and in physical therapy they did something they called ultrasound therapy and the thing they used to give it looked amazingly like my Wahl 4000 and I am a woman so I knew what it felt like on my leg, and that was it. I love this razor for the therapy and now for shaving again!</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> wish they would just sell the gold foil by it&#x27;s self. i have never had to change the blade on any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and i have owned dozens. other than that the product is great.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaver my face will accept........period!!!! So......therefore, and needless to say, this is all I will use.</li>
    <li> Great replacement great price..</li>
    <li> Hubby needed replacement blades and could not find them in the store, these fit just right and the price was budget friendly. WIll buy again!</li>
    <li> The replacement foil was as bad as the original that cut my skin</li>
    <li> Great razor  better price that locally&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time&lt;br /&gt;My father is 90 yrs old and legally blind this razor lets him get a close shave comfortably and safe</li>
    <li> Great product just what I expected on time delivery</li>
    <li> Very good shavers and it surely does it&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> Very good, would like if they lasted longer</li>
    <li> Great Service Great Shaver</li>
    <li> the outer foil failed after very little use,  the manufacture is at fault not the vendor.  The resrt of the raisor works to expection.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Super close shave.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor want leave razor bump behind ur shave . Plus gives a close shave what I like about it</li>
    <li> Shaver still cuts like new with the replacement head. Price is good so far the quality is too. Wish I could sharpen old blades for reuse.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it because it get real close to his head. Unfortuneatly we have to replace every few months</li>
    <li> this is a great shaver and the replacement blade fit and worked great too. nothing better to shave my bald head.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil does not work over the cutter bar. It was made incorrectly, you could tell just by looking at it once opened &amp; put on the razor. Plus there is a clear cover that goes over that part to protect it when not in use &amp; that part does not even fit properly over the replacement foil portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try another replacement foil on the new cutter bar just to make sure it was not the cutter bar &amp; the new cutter bars worked fine with different replacement foils on them. I own more than one of ths type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets just say I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great replacement, a must have for anybody who needs to replace their Wahl each year.</li>
    <li> Its no good. It didn&#x27;t work. It fell apart after one use. But it did fit it just din&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product works really really good, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Work great, glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement and everything works exactly the same with out any issues. I will definitely order another one in the future.</li>
    <li> Works as mentioned need to change blade and head once I did overall better shave. Easy to put on and delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> My barber used this on me after I told him I did not want a razor. I tend to break out very easily, and as a black man, that can be devastating for your face. After using this, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using clippers on my face again. A must have for those men that break out pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Delivery as advertised. Great replacement for my Wahl shaver.  Price is right!  I will continue to order this product and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> No issues.  Fast shipping.  Plug and play type parts are always easy to work with.  Amazon makes the replacement part process a breeze.</li>
    <li> Good product. However gold foil is flimsy. Please handle with care........ side button gets stuck, challenged to open by prying.</li>
    <li> Best Foil shaver kit (and foil shaver) you can buy. Like using a razor. No bumps.</li>
    <li> These do work, the shaver is great, not for me, but the person who uses it. they could be a little cheaper though, this the third cover I have bought, at that point, might as well just buy a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil was packaged sufficiently. It arrived when expected. The description was accurate. The foil fit very well on the razor and the shave was great! I will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> The Wahl did not shave as closely and efficiently as I expected. I needed to shave again using a razor to complete the process. It left many traces of whiskers behind</li>
    <li> Yes, great product. Keeps my big black head bald lol...</li>
    <li> They are the exact ones that came with the unit. This was a perfect purchase and will get more in future when needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement. As described. I usually use it to shave my bald head every 3 days or so. This foil usually lasts me about 3 months on average until I have to buy another one. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> good stuff, the thing that I needed, work as it promises</li>
    <li> Great replacement, love that it is super close! Leaves my skin very smooth, I have been buying the replacements for years now,</li>
    <li> Awesome works pretty good</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love using my shaver on haircuts at work.</li>
    <li> Great product with a clean shave...</li>
    <li> These are the replacement blades for the Wahl 8061 Professional 5-star Professional Rechargeable Shaver. These blades are long lasting blades a and will last much longer than comparable replacements for other name brands.</li>
    <li> I bought a Wahl battery operated razor quite awhile ago.  I love it!  I also like the fact that replacement heads (foil and cutter bar assembly) come in one package.  I replace the foil and cutter bar assembly every 7 to 9 months because I use my Wahl razor 4 to 5 times a week on my face and on my head.....hard use.  The pay-off: no more unsightly nicks, cuts, and razor burns from blade razors.</li>
    <li> they seem to be to thin and don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> love the clippers good work I will be reordering,These clippers cuts real close ,thanks for your yap  yap yap the end..</li>
    <li> great product,, have two, one personal, one in my shop. love it  would recommend for all types of people.  Well built .</li>
    <li> Does the job, and seems to last for a long time too.</li>
    <li> very good replacement head .fast delivery</li>
    <li> excellent replacement</li>
    <li> Great turn around time!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! work good. I would recommend this product for purchase.. the price is not bad also, just love it..</li>
    <li> Does the job for which it was intended.</li>
    <li> Nice replacement part,</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit does the job as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Genuine original manufacturer parts at a much better price even IF I could find it locally.</li>
    <li> The WAHL custom shaver 4000 is great, it meets my expectation, it is just what I needed for my trim. It works perfectly well.[[ASIN:B008BQR2HY Wahl Custom Shave, Dynaflex, Bump Free &amp; ID Series Cutter Blade]][[ASIN:B000UZXBDS Wahl 4000 razor screen foil, super close.]]</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and blades did what they should have for a little over a month before the foil snapped clean into 2 pieces. This was my first replacement assembly, and possibly my last. Very disappointed. I had the original foil and shaver for almost 2 years without problems other than the obvious dullness occurring from wear and aging. I&#x27;m very on the fence about replacing it at all if its not going to last.</li>
    <li> I thought my 1 year old shaver needed a new assembly but this new one cuts no better. I love the shaver though.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly and Item was brand new as expected!  A++++++++</li>
    <li> husband loves this shaver and needed replacement parts and they arrived quickly and shaver is back to new!</li>
    <li> I have used the Wahl shaver for several years on a heavy beard.  I like the ability to either recharge it periodically, or use it plugged in (although the plug doesn&#x27;t stay in very well when I am shaving).  The original shaver is noisy but shaves well; the replacement screens are of varying quality, specifically in how closely their foil profile follows the contour of the plastic head framework.  If the foil is just the slightest bit too floppy within its mounting, it will get &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; more quickly by the cutters, especially if you just got a new cutter, as I did.  Two of the last four Wahl replacement foil heads have lasted me as little as three weeks or five weeks in two cases.  I don&#x27;t find this reasonable, so I am returning to use my old Remington DA 57 corded shaver which has served me well for many, many years.  Hopefully I will find replacement heads when the current one gets chewed up.</li>
    <li> The product works just like the original. It extends the life of the shaver. It saves me from buying a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> Just what the bald head order, on my third foil with my Wahl. Works as good as the original, even better .It came with blades also.</li>
    <li> For some reason the silver foil replacements don&#x27;t go bad as fast as this gold plated version.  To me that spells poor quality.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST FOIL SHAVER IN THE BUSINESS FOR BLACK MEN.</li>
    <li> My husband uses the Wahl bump free razor to shave his head and loves it.  He prefers it to a manual razor as he never nicks his head or skin.  Worth the money to replace the foil and cutter bar assembly every couple of months.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit! Thank you!</li>
    <li> excellent&lt;br /&gt;allready used it</li>
    <li> Keeps me looking and feeling great!</li>
    <li> This replacement head is inexpensive and easy to use.  It cuts very close and the clients love the feel.  I order them monthly.</li>
    <li> I did not have any problems with the foil. The shaver was not really helpful, but I cannot blame Wahl. I am black; people from my community know how difficult it is for us to find the right product.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price I compared all prices and this was the best I needed a new one of these for my shaver it works perfectly fine and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The one thing I really like, and that keeps me buying Wahl shavers, are the replacement parts! This was my annual buy of a replacement cutter bar and Super Close foil head. I mainly use use the Super Close in the winter, then in the warm weather and summer months I use the &#x27;Super Close&#x27; and &#x27;Close&#x27; for face and jaw line only and &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; for under my chin and neck. NO razor burn or the pain in the neck of shaved too close with those uncomfortable red razor burn bumps for me, and still a very close shave on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Every Wahl system 4000 or the derivatives I&#x27;ve used since the 1980s that use the same cutter bar and foil heads are loud and noisy, but the parts that after they totally wear out are replaceable instead of buying a new shaver keeps me a happy Wahl customer!</li>
    <li> Great for men of color.  I haven&#x27;t been able to get a close shave until I bought this shaver.</li>
    <li> I needed this because my original&#x27;s that came with the set just were not holding up any longer. I purchased this item to prevent me from having to purchase the entire set completely. Great buy at a awesome price.</li>
    <li> It extended the life of my razor and gives me a good shave like new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this replacement it worked great and the price is just as great. You get the value for your money.</li>
    <li> best electric shaver ever. get these replacement packs every 6 months or so when the blades get dull. keeps it running like new!</li>
    <li> Fit right on my shavers &amp; it looks just like the original</li>
    <li> awesome, almost as good as a razor.</li>
    <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
    <li> Love this item,works very well. i will continue too order this item.i get super close shave, I will recommend it too all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Replacement blade &amp; coil were in perfect condition, very close cut. Hope the coil doesn&#x27;t break this time, 2 more &amp; I would&#x27;ve bought another shaver</li>
    <li> Have used this product going on two + years. This was my third Foil and blade replacement. To date, i&amp;#34;ve had no issues with the replacement components. this set didn&#x27;t make it Two Months. The foil which is extremely thin, split the entire length of the plastic bar that separates the two semi curved shaving areas. Very disappointed. the previous foil, after Months of use tore in the shaving area. It seems the quality of the foil may be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-dh</li>
    <li> good price works well</li>
    <li> Great product as advertised!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN A USER FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS  I USE THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BUMP FIGHTER RAZOR TYPICALLY ON MT OFF RAZOR DAY JUST AS A TOUCH UP</li>
    <li> Shave close, pricey blades wear out fast and the batteries last a bout a 1 yr. Dont know waht else to say!</li>
    <li> just brought one and the foil ripped and rather replace the whole thing just replaced foil and works just fine now</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase. Love being able to order the exact item we need.</li>
    <li> Great work ad well as the original parts.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Works very well,nice and sharp.Its always nice to be able to find replacement parts than have to go out and purchase another shaver.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery was flawless!</li>
    <li> Great Price. Doesn&#x27;t last that long before needing to be replaced again. Foil cracks and breaks away but it does work.</li>
    <li> I buy these all the time. Great product been using them for 2 years.</li>
    <li> My previous cutter bar and foil lasted almost 7 years.  The shaves I had been getting, while adequate for short terms, really missed the new cutter bar feel that this new Replacement gave my face again.</li>
    <li> Always nice to start a shave with a new foil and it came right on time for my next shave. The price was right so I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Outstanding replacement parts!</li>
    <li> good value for a replacement</li>
    <li> Works Great. Like new</li>
    <li> Worked as expected arrived on time</li>
    <li> Great product. I love this razor and use it every day to shave my head.  Therefore, I had to replace the cutter after about 5 months.  I do not mind at all.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Works great when new but for some reason these don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Like all electric razors, it works best if the stubble has not grown out into a full beard - and my beard is curly, so the razor could not get at the ends of the whiskers.  But if the stubble is still short, the razor works VERY well.  It&#x27;s louder than the Conair unit it replaces, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Delivery and product as advertised. I love the Wahl shaver and have had to replace the head several times.  It&#x27;s a thin screen, which is why it shaves close, so this is not a complaint, but it is delicate and needs to be removed, cleaned and reattached with care.  I use it on the Wahl 4000 &amp;#34;Custom Shave System&amp;#34; razor.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for at least 3 years and a replacement head will last at least 1 year... longer if you&#x27;re careful.</li>
    <li> happy to have purchased as well as pleased to be an owner of such quality and their product which does very well by the thank you Wahl</li>
    <li> One of my favorite trimmers of all time....good quality as expected from Wahl. Thanks!</li>
