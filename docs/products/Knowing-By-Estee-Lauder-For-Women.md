      <li>Love this perfume</li>

      <li>I also love &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and they will think of me :).</li>
      <li>pleased with this size bottle as it will travel well in my toiletry bag.</li>
      <li>Knowing is one of Estee Lauder&#x27;s 80s gems that is seeing the light of day once more.  </li>
      <li>Men can easily wear this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t untill years later when it was givin to me along with a bottle of Beautiful by my music teacher</li>
      <li>So use knowing more frequently Knowing has a clean outdorrsy smell.</li>
      <li>When I was young I use to love this smell</li>
      <li>The cologne is nice and was as described, I just do not personally like the scent.  </li>
      <li>She told me that this was the kind she was wearing, however, I purchased it and wore it and do not believe that it has the same smell as the cologne she was wearing.  </li>
      <li>It is a classy scent for a very confident and classy lady.</li>
      <li>Although my husband isn&#x27;t a fan, and I don&#x27;t normally wear such strong scents, I will always have Knowing in my collection in honor of my precious Grandparents.</li>

      <li>but now that I am older I do not like this smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and I guess Lauder&#x27;s problem with the sprayer (they lose prime quickly) was not a fluke.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this scent.</li>
      <li>It has a unique scent that I and my significant other can&#x27;t get enough of.  </li>
      <li>the flowers (mostly rose) give it freshness, the tiny bit of citrus adds further lift, and the moss (I don&#x27;t know if it is oak moss or tree moss) grounds it in dark sophistication.  </li>
      <li>Not heavy or too flowery.</li>
      <li>I get complements from complete strangers everytime</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Knowing is one of Estee Lauder&#x27;s 80s gems that is seeing the light of day once more.  I&#x27;d read Tania Sanchez&#x27;s review of the perfume, and my curiosity was piqued.  It really is a ravishing fragrance:  the flowers (mostly rose) give it freshness, the tiny bit of citrus adds further lift, and the moss (I don&#x27;t know if it is oak moss or tree moss) grounds it in dark sophistication.  I made the mistake of dosing too heavily before meeting people, and the response made me feel Knowing would always be a private pleasure for me; afterward I dropped it to a single spray on my sternum and I only get compliments now.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and I guess Lauder&#x27;s problem with the sprayer (they lose prime quickly) was not a fluke.  Nonetheless, this stuff is wonderful and a real value:  my first 1/2 ounce bottle lasted 4 years.  Men can easily wear this fragrance.  It is wonderful to find a floral that is fresh and sophisticated without any vanilla or gourmand notes muddying the water.  I highly recommend this scent.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!  Not too flowery.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite every time i wear knowing people ask me what i have on me .</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder perfumes are my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very pleasing scent, a little goes a long way.  Not heavy or too flowery.</li>
    <li> I met someone that was wearing nice cologne.  She told me that this was the kind she was wearing, however, I purchased it and wore it and do not believe that it has the same smell as the cologne she was wearing.  The cologne is nice and was as described, I just do not personally like the scent.  On the upside you only need to use a tiny bit!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give this a star.  The product isn&#x27;t even close to the product bought in the stores.  This bottle has virtually no scent to it at all.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder is my favorite designer of women&#x27;s colognes, etc. I also love &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34;. Everyone has there taste, this is definitely mine.</li>
    <li> When I was young I use to love this smell but now that I am older I do not like this smell. Its like I grow out of it</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought, but love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> My very favorite, I always receive many compliments.</li>
    <li> Love it, especially since it arrived just in the nick of time!!!</li>
    <li> My perfume for years!!!! Someone else can have this on pass by someone I know and they will think of me :). Since it is discontinued I have gone everywhere for this. I even have family and friends purchase it for me when ever they see it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this fragrance in the stores.  Great price and good customer service.  Hope Estee Lauder never stops making it.  Been around for a long time.</li>
    <li> Knowing was my beloved Grandmother&#x27;s signature sent. Long after my Grandfather had lost his sense of smell due to a stroke, he continued buying her Knowing every year for Christmas. My Grandma passed her love of Knowing on to me. Although my husband isn&#x27;t a fan, and I don&#x27;t normally wear such strong scents, I will always have Knowing in my collection in honor of my precious Grandparents. It is a classy scent for a very confident and classy lady.</li>
    <li> Knowing Eau De Parfum spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this size bottle as it will travel well in my toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> Classic perfume for classic ladies!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t need a lot.... lasts all Day or night!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume since college and always received compliments.</li>
    <li> I have no sense of smell, but whenever I wear this, even strangers tell me how good I smell. LOL! I have a large bottle at home, but keep this is my carry-on for travel.</li>
    <li> This product took forever to arrive and then I was very disappointed.  The smell is off. I have used knowing before that was purchased from department store and this is not the same.  Would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> way too stong, smells like something you would dig up in your back yard after it was there for a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> I first smelled this perfume when I was in first grade on a teacher. It wasn&#x27;t untill years later when it was givin to me along with a bottle of Beautiful by my music teacher the memories came back.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing is 1 of the 2 Estee lauder fragrances I use exclusively. Once  in a while I&#x27;ll use beautiful. as it reminds me of my Mom, but it&#x27;s a little floral for me. So use knowing more frequently Knowing has a clean outdorrsy smell. It reminds me of that time of year when summer turns in to fall, and the leaves start to fall. I guess I could say it&#x27;s more of an earthy floral scent. I really only try to stay with 3 or 4 perfumes, and switch them around. They say people associate  you with perfume, and I like people  to do that with me. I get complements from complete strangers everytime I ware it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume it&#x27;s always been the best smelling perfume. The bottle could be a little bit bigger but so what it just smells great</li>
    <li> I love it. I got the exact product that I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It has a unique scent that I and my significant other can&#x27;t get enough of.  It lasts long - one application lasts all day.  Thanks to the reviewers - they got it right!!!  Thanks.</li>
