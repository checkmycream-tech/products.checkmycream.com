      <li>I had braces for years as a teenager but wasn&#x27;t able to finish my treatment.</li>
      <li>If you would like to see my before &amp; after just email me at taylor.gaines12@gmail.com :)</li>
      <li>Thank you gap fixers!!!!!!!!:) #NoMorePain</li>
      <li>So make sure when you put the band around the desired teeth it does not try to slide up into your gums</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>My &amp;#34;gap&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t really visible, but did bother me because I&#x27;ve always had great teeth and never had braces.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall perfect for my teeth because my gap was closing already</li>
      <li>Omg i love this bands....</li>
      <li>Like I can go days without wearing the band and won&#x27;t have to worry, but I will continue to wear the band&#x27;s until I am able to get a retainer...</li>
      <li>beyond satisfied.</li>
      <li>and I have placed the bands on my teeth more than 30 day ago.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fix your gap and keep moving on:)</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t review just yet as it looks like my gap is closing, but its taking more than just 30 days.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure these would work.</li>
      <li>Ok gap fixers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very excited</li>
      <li>The best way to use this product is to use until gap closes then buy a retainer to insure gap stays closed.</li>
      <li>: I got braces over 5 years ago, i left the orthodontist with that perfect smile after getting 4 teeth pulled and a hereditary gap.</li>
      <li>Once you get accustomed to the bands, it becomes quite easy to use.</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest them.</li>
      <li>I was able to sleep a full night without the bands even moving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, you talk funny with them on so wearing at night is best but by afternoon your teeth will be back where they started.</li>
      <li>Their quick life savers!</li>
      <li>I had a huge gap and couldn&#x27;t afford braces.</li>
      <li>The 6 dollars for this product is well worth it :)</li>
      <li>So i ordered these and mind you, you can fit a skinny wire of a headphone through my teeth to give you an idea.</li>
      <li>One thing to watch is creating another gap after you bring the original together.</li>
      <li>In a matter of months, I have went from stuffing corn curls through my gap to squeezing thread in-between them when I clean my teeth at night.</li>
      <li>So when my gap closes completely I will place an honest review on these bands.  </li>
      <li>And one more thing, be VERY cautious when putting on the bands.</li>
      <li>For better and fast results, I use it two at once.</li>
      <li>so much I will continue to buy from you as needed :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be more effective if I didn&#x27;t have the small spaces between my teeth</li>
      <li>We are pleased with the results thus far.  </li>
      <li>If you miss a day your teeth nice right back.</li>
      <li>I put them on right away.</li>
      <li>no gain right?</li>
      <li>she has ever been giving and thank them for finally being able to smile.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any pain the first day</li>
      <li>first week or days</li>
      <li>At first it was not even close to being visible</li>
      <li>but overall I love it and the results</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really believe this product works, BUT IT DID!  </li>
      <li>My teeth hurt to much!</li>
      <li>the band will either slide or make your teeth more crooked than they already are.</li>
      <li>One more thing, if your teeth are crooked this band is not for you...</li>
      <li>If I wear them consistently, I can see my gap closing permanently.</li>
      <li>It hurts a lot at first, but you get used to it.</li>
      <li>Wearing it for only one day and one night and it were able to close my gap.</li>
      <li>I placed them not in the middle because they wouldn&#x27;t stay, but at the top.</li>
      <li>She did xrays first and could see that I had a gap between the bone and the roots.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my teeth, 6 months later subsequently i lost my retainer, which at the time didn&#x27;t seem like a big deal.</li>
      <li>first lets start with my situation</li>
      <li>This thing really seems to be working!</li>
      <li>these Elastic Gap Teeth Bands get the job done and fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had so much pain come from my face in my life!</li>
      <li>they keep poppin off my teeth but after holding it in and practicing keeping them on, they actually work pretty fine.</li>
      <li>Or just make sure the band is midway between your teeth, not too high and not too low....</li>
      <li>Its amazing how you notice a slight difference overnight.</li>
      <li>I had a huge gap,  probably 3.5mm or bigger..  </li>
      <li>After using for two days (one hour each time) and one over night placing we can see a very noticible difference.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
      <li>This has changed my whole appearance.  </li>
      <li>I used tweezers on one side and it really helped.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>One thing I would like to say, is that one band will not suffice, you will need to place two bands on the gap teeth to really see \\&quot;some\\&quot; movement and</li>
      <li>I did  not like it much.</li>
      <li>get these,  they really work</li>
      <li>but it was very noticeable which was my problem.</li>
      <li>I recommend highly recommend these as a affordable, reliable solution!</li>
      <li>but it really closes the gaps.  </li>
      <li>My teeth HURT LIKE HIGH HEAVEN!</li>
      <li>For now, it is good for smth like my wedding day, my gap bothers me and it will be closed for the big day!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> came in under a week, is working well with my gap though i was already using different rubberbands so they helped. Overall perfect for my teeth because my gap was closing already</li>
    <li> These work indeed, it&#x27;s just the gap would come back shortly after not using. If I wear them consistently, I can see my gap closing permanently. Great for events.</li>
    <li> This totally got Rid of my Gap I LOVE GapFix and would recommend this to anyone who has spaces in between their teeth or aren&#x27;t happy with it. But I must tell you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week or days.... It&#x27;s going to make your teeth sore as helllll. It&#x27;s going to be sore to the touch and sore when you try to bite down with the teeth the band&#x27;s are around. But that is because your teeth have shifted or ARE SHIFTING...Might even make your teeth feel as if their loose (But they aren&#x27;t, trust me I know, I&#x27;ve been using them for months now) on scale of 1-10 for pain I&#x27;d rate it a 5.5 or 6. You must wear them 24/7 (Unless you&#x27;re eating) Take them off when you&#x27;re eating, or when you&#x27;re about to brush your teeth or floss. Or your gap will try to reopen the first few weeks. My gap is completely closed. Like I can go days without wearing the band and won&#x27;t have to worry, but I will continue to wear the band&#x27;s until I am able to get a retainer... It&#x27;s TOTALLY worth your money and waaaaaay cheaper and less complicated than braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH!! And one more thing, be VERY cautious when putting on the bands. Make sure that they do not ride up into your gums, it is EXTREMELYYYYYYY painful. My God, it feels like their slicing into your gums and a lot of pressure.... if you let that happen you have to dig them out with your finger. It also can damage the tissue and nerves in your gums and in some cases can numb a vessel in there and loosen your tooth or even make it fall out smh. We don&#x27;t want that happening. So make sure when you put the band around the desired teeth it does not try to slide up into your gums, if it does, just slide it down a little. Or just make sure the band is midway between your teeth, not too high and not too low.... Midway... When your gap does close you might have a small gap between your other teeth, you could get them filled...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the GapFix company also. They sent me a few pack of bands because I started off with a pack of 1/8 then needed bigger bands and they gifted them to me for freeThanks so much I will continue to buy from you as needed :)</li>
    <li> Yay my gap is closed! But I only wear it during the day because I swallow them at night sometimes...It does make me lisp on my S words a little but hey I works. It closed in like 4 days.</li>
    <li> It does not fix your gap at all, it sure in hell didn&#x27;t fix my sisters ugly gap</li>
    <li> They work, when you have them on. If you don&#x27;t use them for a day, the gap opens back up.</li>
    <li> This thing really seems to be working! I removed the gap between my 4 upper teeth. The only disappointment is that I can&#x27;t move together my front teeth. Bands don&#x27;t hold them and slip all the time, so I find them on my tongue every morning. Nevertheless, I am still satisfied with the results!</li>
    <li> difficult to use; irritating to the gum; sizes need a more detailed explanation; I gave the product a 3 because I could have chosen the wrong size.</li>
    <li> well here goes. I got my braces off and lost my retainer 3 weeks after! and after 1 or 2 days i noticed the gap coming back!!! At first it was not even close to being visible but then it became beyond easy to spot from a few feet away. And my gap started coming back over spring break (lucky me) because this meant people in my school wouldnt see it. So i ordered these and mind you, you can fit a skinny wire of a headphone through my teeth to give you an idea. The gap wasnt BIG but it was very noticeable which was my problem. I ordered these and didn&#x27;t notice they came until today when i looked on my table and today is the day before i go back to school. Putting these on is a pain in the ass. these will go in your gums. they will slide up theres no way around that. almost impossible to get them to stay in the middle for me at least. but i put 3 on my teeth because i needed to see results NOW! and in 1 hr the gap wasnt even noticeable. pardon my french but i s*** you not, the gap wasn&#x27;t even there anymore. you dont notice that your teeth are sore unless you bite down on them. but my gap is completely closed now and its 1.25am here and i put them on at 11:50pm. i have school in 7hrs so i am very satisfied right now! beyond satisfied. i will only be using these until my replacement retainers come in but these work! and you can safely put down 10$ to buy these</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the fault of the product, It works well but it doesn&#x27;t last. Teeth naturally come back to normal and those bands damage gums, teeth and roots.&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned that to my dentist and she told me that it was terrible for the teeth and that I could lose them. She has seen cases. She did a bonding instead. That lasts and doesn&#x27;t damage the teeth. Cost me $50 with insurance. She did xrays first and could see that I had a gap between the bone and the roots. Probably due to the force applied by the bands. I stopped, I want to keep my teeth.</li>
    <li> When I first started using the bands, it took about a month for the gap to completely close. The first week was pretty painful. Stick to mashed potatoes, applesauce &amp; aspirin. Now I just wear them overnight. Works like a charm &amp; is inexpensive. One bag lasts me 3+ months.</li>
    <li> Omg i love this bands.... they Close may gap in just 4weeks😄😄</li>
    <li> I had recently bought this item right before Christmas of 2013 and since I&#x27;ve been using this product my gap had begun to close up. .. but one thing with this product is that you cant skip nights if you want it to work effectively... but overall I love it and the results</li>
    <li> These work but you have to wear them daily or all the time. If you miss a day your teeth nice right back. Also, you talk funny with them on so wearing at night is best but by afternoon your teeth will be back where they started.</li>
    <li> i use this for the first few days then after a week i stopped using it because i got lazy but it works. you need to keep using it for a month at least so it wont reopen your gap</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about whether these would work. They do! it was a little - more than a little - difficult to figure out how to put them on. But I finally made a plan. I used tweezers on one side and it really helped. These made the gap in two teeth I have basically disappear. I figured this was a gamble but worth the small expense. Buy these if you have a gap.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t realize how tiny the bands were going to be plus they keep poppin off my teeth but after holding it in and practicing keeping them on, they actually work pretty fine.</li>
    <li> they slip off but with a teeth or braces protector they stay in place, my daughter sleeps w them on</li>
    <li> These do not work. I should have read about them before I bought them. Apparently they not only fail to do what they show, but also can ruin your teeth</li>
    <li> PLEASE NOBODY BUY THIS! ALTHOUGH THEY DO CLOSE GAPS, THEY DO NOT IN FACT FIX YOUR TEETH! IN FACT, THEY WILL DAMAGE THEM SO PLEASE DO NOT RISK IT.</li>
    <li> I can not tell you how miuch i love these bands!! I ordered them because I lost my retainer and these bands have helped with keeping my front gap closed! Their quick life savers!</li>
    <li> Wearing it for only one day and one night and it were able to close my gap. For better and fast results, I use it two at once. Unfortunately after one day without using it the gap goes back to normal. I&#x27;ve been wearing every day, let&#x27;s see if it will help keep closed in the future. It hurts a lot at first, but you get used to it. Beware if your gap is to wide, once it closes will leave you with gaps right next! For now, it is good for smth like my wedding day, my gap bothers me and it will be closed for the big day!</li>
    <li> I could see the difference in gap after 1.5 month of daily use, until then there was no change. Now slowly the gap is reducing. its a good product. I have not experienced any side effects from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> These bands are very strong and very easy to apply.  Shipping was fast.  This is no substitute for orthodontic work, but it does close gaps between teeth.  However, you must be diligent to use the bands every night.</li>
    <li> they worked as intended</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;m writing this review after just two days of use and I&#x27;m noticing a difference already. I&#x27;ve heard that drying your teeth before putting them on prevented slipping, and it worked for me. I was able to sleep a full night without the bands even moving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen people giving bad reviews because their gaps come back, but what they fail to realize is that they need a retainer once their gap closes. Keep in mind that these bands are only used to close the gap, but not permanently. The gap coming back is a natural thing and is not a fault in the bands. I&#x27;ve also seen a bad review of a mother who had her son use these while he was eating, and, of course, things didn&#x27;t end well. If you are able to follow instructions for these bands correctly and understand that you&#x27;ll have to purchase a retainer once your gap closes, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great purchase. I&#x27;m very excited to be seeing my gap closed soon, I&#x27;ll probably update in the future.</li>
    <li> I broke my retainers about 6 months ago.  Only my tow front teeth were spreading.  This product worked with two days.  The gap is gone.  So I wear every night, my dentist also approved of it</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure these would work. I stumbled upon these looking for retainers. I have never had braces before. I was simply looking for a quick fix. I looked at all the ratings and thought I might give it a try. I ordered two packs because others had trouble placing them thereby breaking the bands.  The package came in 5 days. I put them on right away. (I only needed about 60) Some did break, yes, but it didn&#x27;t hurt. I had my mouth open wide enough that they flew across the room injuring my dresser instead.I placed them not in the middle because they wouldn&#x27;t stay, but at the top. (NOT touching the gums) I kept them on during the day only to take them off when I brushed my teeth. I even ate with them on. I was truly committed. (I wanted my gap gone NOW) I just ate with my back teeth so the band&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t break. I doubled them up when I slept. I put 1 on my four teeth and 2 on my front 2 teeth to close the gap. I woke up. And my mouth was a little swollen so I knew it was working. I frequently took ibuprofen as well. Today is the third day (only two nights). And my gap is fully closed. I would not recommended the three day challenge to anyone, because it&#x27;s painful. I only did it because I&#x27;m going on a trip in 4 days and I didnt want to be in pain then. The pain is over. My gap is closed. Now I&#x27;m going to order the 3/16 (B) packets to keep my gap in check. They are bit bigger so there wouldn&#x27;t be spaces in the teeth. Thank you gap fixers!!!!!!!!:) #NoMorePain</li>
    <li> I wore braces for years and used a retainer for a few years as well. I haven&#x27;t wore a retainer for a while and I notice slight dental relapse starting to occur. i bought these to close a small gap before I buy a new retainer. This product does work, but you have to keep in mind that it takes quite a bit of use to get the gap to close permanently. The best way to use this product is to use until gap closes then buy a retainer to insure gap stays closed. You may need to use the retainer for a while afterward. This is just the nature of teeth. They spend so long in one position, it&#x27;s going to take some time to get them to adjust to being in a new position. In the long run, doing this will save you tremendously compared to going to an orthodontist.</li>
    <li> They work great, it&#x27;s not a permanent solution but it really closes the gaps.  you will have to use them every night.</li>
    <li> I had a huge gap,  probably 3.5mm or bigger..  These bands closed my gap in a LITTLE over a month.  These are great,  now all I need is a retainer,  get these,  they really work and I&#x27;m very excited 😁😁💞💞</li>
    <li> Saved my teeth when i misplaced my retainer.</li>
    <li> Rubberbands slip into my gums.  Won&#x27;t stay toward the center of teeth.  Made gums bleed and couldn&#x27;t continue to use.</li>
    <li> Whether a big of small gap these Elastic Gap Teeth Bands get the job done and fast! Skip getting braces and try this simple solution.&lt;br /&gt;So first lets start with my situation: I got braces over 5 years ago, i left the orthodontist with that perfect smile after getting 4 teeth pulled and a hereditary gap. Very happy with my teeth, 6 months later subsequently i lost my retainer, which at the time didn&#x27;t seem like a big deal. Within 2 months i started to see my two front teeth separate, forming a small-medium gap between my front teeth. Instead of going back to my orthodontist (which would&#x27;ve likely cost me hundreds of dollars) I tried these. Within just 3 short days of using 2 Bands on my front two teeth the gap was virtually gone. Luckily the gap didn&#x27;t cause any significant spaces in between my surrounding teeth, which was great. However if your gap big you might want to consider bonding to close up the remaining spaces. Also be prepared to buy a retainer after to ensure the perfect smiles lasts! Best time to is to wear at night during sleep to maximize results. I recommend highly recommend these as a affordable, reliable solution!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work i wouldn&#x27;t recommend anybody to buy this i bought this for my daughter because her front teeth is crooked once i put it on her front teeth it popped and wouldn&#x27;t fit it was a waste of money</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these gap bands 24/7 for that past seven weeks since the first week of new years, they are painful when they dig into your gums but they DO close your gap and yes my gap is no longer there but you have to do an aggressive approach to close them. You cannot just wrap them around your two front teeth, preferably creating a tighter squeeze I used two bands at a time wrapped around three teeth for each band (teeth 1,2,3 and teeth 2,3,4). It is just this week that the gap has completely closed. I am going to either keep using the bands or get a retainer. If you stop using the bands after the gap is closed naturally your teeth will realign back to their original place. One more thing, if your teeth are crooked this band is not for you...the band will either slide or make your teeth more crooked than they already are. If your teeth are straight might work you but obviously need to do some experimenting. Yes this product works but it is not universally for everyone and yes there is slight pain when the teeth move but they do the job period. The money you saved by not buying braces I would invest in at least one set of retainers to make the hard work pay off.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> The gaps do close, as the product says; however, it&#x27;s only VERY temporary, and they will open again if you miss a night or take them off for a long dinner.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, diasthemata (gaps inbetween teeth) have the highest relapse rate of all dental imperfections, even with braces so that&#x27;s not really surprising. Though, with that being said, the speed with which relapse occurs with this product is abnormal. And you WILL, at some stage, remove this product from your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the most painful thing, the product slides up the teeth and into the gums; it then sinks into the gums, and can be very painful to remove. I have had to use a sharp knife to cut it loose and, when I decided to try again, I actually had to bite into an apple to snap the band in order to get it out of my mouth because it wasn&#x27;t moving when I tried to pull it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you invest in this, even after reading the reviews, you are an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> does not stay in the middle of your teeth. it rises to your gums and irritates them to the point of throbbing</li>
    <li> I had braces almost 15 years ago; unfortunately, my retainer broke nearly 7 years ago. Time had taken a toll on my teeth, and they had shifted apart. I was convinced I would have to spend thousands to fix my once perfect smile. I was a bit skeptical, but decided to give these rubber bands a try. Within 6 weeks of wearing the bands every night my teeth were close to where they were after getting my braces removed. I bought a retainer kit and do not have to wear the rubber bands any longer. If you are going to buy these, it is important you get a retainer made, otherwise your teeth will shirt back in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> Wrong ones want to send back</li>
    <li> My second time ordering..great</li>
    <li> Once you get accustomed to the bands, it becomes quite easy to use. I&#x27;d recommend using a tweezer to hold onto one side as you slide between the first tooth and cross over to the other. If you have a small gap, you&#x27;ll see a difference overnight. I&#x27;d recommend at least a month of wear overnight, or several weeks if you wear during the day and night. One thing to watch is creating another gap after you bring the original together. You may have to use several bands crossing several teeth to eliminate all gaps. My &amp;#34;gap&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t really visible, but did bother me because I&#x27;ve always had great teeth and never had braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend getting one size smaller than you think you need. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I had a huge gap and couldn&#x27;t afford braces. If you actually wear these all the time and stick to wearing them they do work. Its a bit painful in the beginning and it took over 9 weeks to get mine completely closed, but it worked. I tried to post pictures, but its not letting me. If you would like to see my before &amp; after just email me at taylor.gaines12@gmail.com :)</li>
    <li> I decided to get this to close my gaps I had braces for years as a teenager but wasn&#x27;t able to finish my treatment. Now that I&#x27;m a adult I wish I can finish getting my teeth fix but I can&#x27; afford it. After getting these bands I put them on my teeth to close the gap unfortunately these bands didn&#x27;t work they either kept slipping of or digging my gums it was frustrating.</li>
    <li> Ok gap fixers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a hereditary gap all of my life, but I have alway disliked it, so recently I thought I would try these bands. But I can&#x27;t review just yet as it looks like my gap is closing, but its taking more than just 30 days. So when my gap closes completely I will place an honest review on these bands.  One thing I would like to say, is that one band will not suffice, you will need to place two bands on the gap teeth to really see \\&quot;some\\&quot; movement and if you do this, one bag will not be enough to complete the process, so just FYI.  Also, do not let the bands rest on your gums, as this can be very painful, you want to place bands on the mid portion of your teeth to get an even pull together, if you will.  So I am still in the process of closing my gap and I have placed the bands on my teeth more than 30 day ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 25, 2013 - Post Note&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the gap fixer for over 30 day&#x27;s and I must say I am very surprised to see that I no longer have a gap. I ran out of the bands, so I purchased Goody clear hair bands to completely close the gap....If I had heard about this on TV I would have thought this a scam, but it actually works. My family and friends can&#x27;t believe it and neither can I.  This has changed my whole appearance.  I smile a little bigger NOW! I can&#x27;t really believe this product works, BUT IT DID!  Once I though about the science of pressure and braces, it make sense. So if you want to close your gap try these gap fixers or go and get the clear Goody Bands they work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goody Hair Bands should possibly get into the gap fixing business as well; with degrees of bands for gap closure...as they work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 9, 2013: Follow-up Final Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using goody bands to keep my gap closed. I place these bands on my two front gapped teeth at night only just to keep my gap closed, as once you stop using the bands your gap will open slightly, So I have committed to use the bands for a year like braces to fully make the transition from gapped tooth diva to fully closed gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I must say, this is the best and easiest and most inexpensive way to close ones gap. I am amazed at the short process of closing my gap.</li>
    <li> Hi -&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these for my 10 year old son that has/had a large gap between his two front teeth. After using for two days (one hour each time) and one over night placing we can see a very noticible difference. His teeth were very sensitive after the eight hours of having them on so we took a couple days off. We are pleased with the results thus far.  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> it works its just that simple. at the beginning your teeth would start hurting, which is good its means its working,so yeah basically it works</li>
    <li> Like some one else stated I have had a gap all my life. I have always wanted to get rid of it but braces are expensive.  I have watched alot of videos on YouTube as well as read reviews on Google. So far I have been wearing the bands for 3 days and my gap is almost completely  closed I am very happy with the results!!! I didn&#x27;t feel any pain the first day but today I have had to take pain meds because of the shifting.  I know my gap will not permanently close from the gap bands alone so after it is completely closed I will purchase a retainer. The 6 dollars for this product is well worth it :)</li>
    <li> I did  not like it much.</li>
    <li> Its amazing how you notice a slight difference overnight. Be consistant with placing the bands on your teeth.....you will get the best results. My teeth were sensitive in the beginning and biting down on foods as well as my teeth tapping one another created some discomfort but it goes away. I will be buying another pack of bands when the ones im currently using runs out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much of anything. It doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
    <li> Gapfix is an excellent lifesaver. After breaking my retainers, I found this was the only thing that helped to keep the gap between my two front teeth closed. Gap fix offered me extraordinary customer service after I received the wrong band size in the mail. I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I started using these teeth bands for 4 days and my teeth went from picture one that says before, now my teeth look like picture two that says 3 days. I will continue using these bands and come back for an update, after my gap is completely close.</li>
    <li> They are working for me although they hurt really really bad and almost made me cry I strongly suggest them. I don&#x27;t know if you should only wear them at night on 24/7 but I&#x27;ll try 24/7 without no one noticing. I would also recommend oral gel for the pain.</li>
    <li> The product works great and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my results. Only wish I had know about this sooner !</li>
    <li> My package came in the mail VERY quickly! I ordered it Friday night, and it came Monday afternoon! Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last night I tried them for the first time, It felt a bit uncomfortable, but kinda cool! It was like a 1/2 on the 1-10 pain level scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up in the morning after sleeping with my two bands on my two front teeth, my teeth were sore (2 on the 1-10 pain level scale). I pulled them off my teeth and my lord jesus I&#x27;ve never had so much pain come from my face in my life! My teeth HURT LIKE HIGH HEAVEN! I couldn&#x27;t even brush them with my vibrating tooth brush they were so sensetive! Now that was a definite 6 or 7 on the 1-10 pain level scale! I tried to put a new band off after I took my overnight ones off but that did not work! My teeth hurt to much! I&#x27;m going to try again this evening, I have I hopes for this product, no pain no gain right? Don&#x27;t let me discourage you! Fix your gap and keep moving on:)</li>
    <li> FAKE THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAS BRAISES</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people give negative reviews. I&#x27;ve already noticed an increasing improvement!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about three days. My teeth are pretty sensitive but I&#x27;ve taken breaks off and on with these. I will do a follow up within a month.</li>
    <li> Iv been using them for about 7 months and they&#x27;ve nearly completely closed it. A little spacing though, that&#x27;s normal.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the rubber band to stay in between my teeth any help ?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without these amazing Elastic Gap Bands. In a matter of months, I have went from stuffing corn curls through my gap to squeezing thread in-between them when I clean my teeth at night. If I could, I&#x27;d give the seller the warmest hug he/she has ever been giving and thank them for finally being able to smile.  I am truly in debt. Even though my gap has closed, I continue to buy to support the seller and stock up in case I find others with similar struggle.</li>
    <li> Needs more bands, but good stuff</li>
    <li> These bands work very well and very quickly, however, as soon as I take them off, my teeth go back to the same position they were in mere hours.</li>
    <li> It did close my gap but because I have spaces in between my teeth the gap comes back. I&#x27;m sure this would be more effective if I didn&#x27;t have the small spaces between my teeth</li>
</ol>
