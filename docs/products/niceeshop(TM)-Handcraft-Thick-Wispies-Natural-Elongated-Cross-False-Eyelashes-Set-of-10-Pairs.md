<li> I find that the thick band helps make the lashes last, especially when cleaning off old glue to reuse.</li>
<li> feeling like some other lashes I have gotten from China.  </li>
<li> The band needs to be trimmed because these are not glued down, but instead threaded through the cardboard box.  </li>
<li> they are natural yet dramatic.</li>
<li> The band is a little thick</li>
<li> Because the band is thick, it is also stiff, I find that bending it while the glue dries, help it stay the shape of your eye.</li>
<li> Also they are very hard to glue on.</li>
<li> This is the fist time I have ever worn false lashes</li>

    <li> These eye lashes suck . The lash line is too straight so they don&#x27;t really fit on your eye correctly . Would not ever recommend these !</li>
    <li> I gave these too my mom and she loved them.</li>
    <li> Loving these lashes. I got them in style 5. I have naturally long lashes, but they are not too full, so these provide a great natural look for me. The price was great, and these are good quality. I find that the thick band helps make the lashes last, especially when cleaning off old glue to reuse. Because the band is thick, it is also stiff, I find that bending it while the glue dries, help it stay the shape of your eye. Over all very pleased. Only give 4 because I thought these would look a bit more like another pair of wispies that I have, more dramatic for special occasions, but these are still great.</li>
    <li> Do not get these they do not stick made very cheap.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the greatest quality but get the job done. I had to trim the edges bc there was a bit extra string on each side</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Very pretty. Love it.</li>
    <li> No, they are super CHEAP,  you get what your pay for,  lesson learned</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes. they are natural yet dramatic. These eyelashes are well worth the price. I have bought various types of eyelashes before and these are basically better than any drugstore. The only other lashes that I love are Red Cherry, but these are AMAZING for the price. 10 for a fraction of the price for one</li>
    <li> These are very nice and amazing for the price.  The band is a little thick but it&#x27;s soft and bendable. The lashes themselves are soft and feel a lot more like human hair than synthetic, not plastic feeling like some other lashes I have gotten from China.  The band needs to be trimmed because these are not glued down, but instead threaded through the cardboard box.  You&#x27;d need to find another box to store them in if you want to reuse, because the packaging it comes in isn&#x27;t durable.  But overall, a great deal and I would probably re-order.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. This is the fist time I have ever worn false lashes but I really love these.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the fast delivery! I&#x27;ve ordered only 5days ago and very pleased with the lashes that I got! Will order again!</li>
    <li> these lashes are way too long and require too much trimming prior to use. I like the style and would be a must-have if it they were shorter. Also they are very hard to glue on.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, soft base made for easy molding to my eye shape</li>
    <li> I love these lashes and they are perfect for going out of even a everyday look. Also the picture is very accurate so u get what you see.The shipping was also fast and i would recommend these to anyone.</li>
