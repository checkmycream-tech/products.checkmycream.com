### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This company has created the best products!     </li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>It lasts forever and finishes your makeup wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>They go on light, are almost invisible on the face, but give excellent coverage.  </li>
      <li>I am a makeup artist and have worked with some of the best lines of makeup available.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you get the color that most perfectly blends with your skin and neck tones</li>
      <li>I love this product and will continue to purchase!</li>
      <li>They have improved the quality of my skin so much that it still surprises me, it feels like I have no makeup on at all and makes me look as if my skin is flawless.</li>
      <li>I ordered the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; which looked light online</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>how wonderful my skin is, but it&#x27;s not really that nice.  </li>
      <li>I have been using bareMinerals for 3 years now and love it.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the greatest products I&#x27;ve ever tried in my entire life.</li>
      <li>And when you break out, you use more to cover it up, which caused the skin to break-out more.    </li>
      <li>so I stay away from most products.</li>
      <li>But I love it too.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Great coverage, feels very natural.  </li>
      <li>I have found the advertising to be very true.</li>
      <li>It arrived in good condition, and within a reasonable time after I placed my order.</li>
      <li>But honestly the fairly light shade is a deep medium to olive, so fair maidens like me, order the lightest shade and pray.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>so trust me, it is very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>It works great for my super-light, red and ruddy complexion.</li>
      <li>but I found perfect color match for my pale complexion.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals foundation is by far the best makeup I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals, just needed some more</li>
      <li>This foundation allows my skin to breath yet gives me full coverage.</li>
      <li>I assumed it would be a full size version of the powder tin as you would see in the stores - it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of bronzers, especially for me as I&#x27;m auburn with fair skin</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin, be sure to use a moisturizer or this will not look nice.  </li>
      <li>The brushes feel are of such a high quality and really do make my face look flawless.  </li>
      <li>Really, Bare essentuals has become my top 1 make up</li>
      <li>Not only do my friends and clients love it.</li>
      <li>I first received these products as a gift and find that I cannot use anything else.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, very natural, covers imperfections nicely with only one product.  </li>
      <li>This is not only easy to wear</li>
      <li>It has really helped to boost my self esteem.</li>
      <li>plus, for the quiality is really chip.</li>
      <li>It does cover very well</li>
      <li>Light on your face, covers the minor flaws well, never break out from it...</li>
      <li>She has used many different mineral make-up and always goes  back to this one.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products to women who have problem skin and don&#x27;t want to look like they are wearing a \\&quot;makeup mask\\&quot; to cover their flaws.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals was so light, yet it covered up all problems (age spots, red spots, acne, etc).  </li>
      <li>This is the first foundation that I have every used regularly.</li>
      <li>Looks natural, covers well, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
      <li>There is no line of demarcation...very natural.  </li>
      <li>In the end, I actually use less of the product than when I first starting using it, because my skin is actually looking better.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend Bare Escentuals to anyone!</li>
      <li>I higly recommend the Bare Escentuals make-up products.  </li>
      <li>I swear by Bare Escentuals.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s much darker and too dark for me to use.</li>
      <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The first thing I purchased was the kit with a few different foundations, brushes and the mineral veil.  </li>

<li> but I&#x27;m afraid to order the lightest shade to see if it will work for me, so I&#x27;m going to try some L&#x27;Oreal product from the drugstore which is less expensive to see if I like a similar product in a shade that I can wear.</li>
<li> I have terrible skin, and have tried tons of different makeup over the years.</li>

    <li> This is one of the greatest products I&#x27;ve ever tried in my entire life. Really, Bare essentuals has become my top 1 make up and I&#x27;m gonna stick to it 4EVER! plus, for the quiality is really chip. THIS MAKE UP KICK ASS!</li>
    <li> I higly recommend the Bare Escentuals make-up products.  They go on light, are almost invisible on the face, but give excellent coverage.  Just make sure you get the color that most perfectly blends with your skin and neck tones and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She adores the product, and if fact has now limited her make up to only this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the \\&quot;fairly light\\&quot; which looked light online but it&#x27;s much darker and too dark for me to use. I&#x27;m not a fan of bronzers, especially for me as I&#x27;m auburn with fair skin so if I use anything other than ivory shades I look like I&#x27;ve been subjected to radioactive fallout. But honestly the fairly light shade is a deep medium to olive, so fair maidens like me, order the lightest shade and pray. It does cover very well but I&#x27;m afraid to order the lightest shade to see if it will work for me, so I&#x27;m going to try some L&#x27;Oreal product from the drugstore which is less expensive to see if I like a similar product in a shade that I can wear.</li>

    <li> Bare Minerals foundation is by far the best makeup I have ever used. I am a makeup artist and have worked with some of the best lines of makeup available. But this one has beat them all in my book. Not only do my friends and clients love it. But I love it too. I have rosacea and my skin is oily/acne prone. This foundation allows my skin to breath yet gives me full coverage. I would recommend this makeup to everyone.     C.J.</li>
    <li> This is the first foundation that I have every used regularly. I have dry sensitive skin so I stay away from most products. This is not only easy to wear but I found perfect color match for my pale complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue to purchase! This product is much easier to apply than the messy goop of the past.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals, just needed some more and I had a reward certificate!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, be sure to use a moisturizer or this will not look nice.  Otherwise, very natural, covers imperfections nicely with only one product.  Have been using it for almost a year.</li>

    <li> I have been using bareMinerals for 3 years now and love it.  The first thing I purchased was the kit with a few different foundations, brushes and the mineral veil.  It lasts forever (meaning I&#x27;ve only had to buy it I think one other time) and I put on at least the foundation and mineral veil everyday.  The brushes feel are of such a high quality and really do make my face look flawless.  People tell me all the time how wonderful my skin is, but it&#x27;s not really that nice.  I just let them think that it is!</li>

    <li> Looks natural, covers well, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  It works great for my super-light, red and ruddy complexion.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It lasts forever and finishes your makeup wonderfully.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 11/2 years and just got my second container....so trust me, it is very cost effective.  barb</li>
    <li> I just buy what my daughter likes as gift this Christmas.  She has used many different mineral make-up and always goes  back to this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I swear by Bare Escentuals.  It feels like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, but at the same time, providing the coverage I need.  There is no line of demarcation...very natural.  I love it.</li>
    <li> With shipping &amp; tax, this purchase topped out over $30.  I assumed it would be a full size version of the powder tin as you would see in the stores - it isn&#x27;t.  It is like a little tester version, maybe 1/3 the size I was expecting - steer clear, this product can&#x27;t sell on the counter at the price they charge, so they are selling it over the web...</li>
    <li> I tried quite a few foundation products before I came across Bare Minerals.  I had given up on make-up foundations because no matter what product I used on my face, it would break-out after a day or two.  And when you break out, you use more to cover it up, which caused the skin to break-out more.    Bare Minerals was so light, yet it covered up all problems (age spots, red spots, acne, etc).  And then you get a benefit from the product, it actually reduced the acne, the red spots.  In the end, I actually use less of the product than when I first starting using it, because my skin is actually looking better.  Who would have thought?  buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, feels very natural.  I wish the price would come down a little...</li>
