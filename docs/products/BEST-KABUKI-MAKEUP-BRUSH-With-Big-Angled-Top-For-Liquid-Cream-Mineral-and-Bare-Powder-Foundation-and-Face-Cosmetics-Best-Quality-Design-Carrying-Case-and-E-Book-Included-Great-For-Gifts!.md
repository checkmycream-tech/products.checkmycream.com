<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this brush and it will blend liquid or powder makeup really well. It is soft but does not fall apart or lose bristles as you use it. Like some makeup brushes do....And Castle Rock ships quickly...</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush. My only complaint is that the handle comes loose and I have to push it back in, often.&lt;br /&gt;But the bristles are lovely and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This brush is HEAVENLY!  Super soft and blends my mineral foundation beautifully. Cant believe I got a brush this good for the price.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I love this make-up brush, it&#x27;s soft, full and just firm enough to give great coverage. I&#x27;m using it with my bronzer and plan to buy a second one for my face powder. This is a very high-quality product that is now a critical part of my daily make-up application.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome, it is sturdy quality and the bristles are SO soft. It gives me great powder foundation coverage, better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, high quality bristles. Does not disintegrate.</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality, perfectly sized and angled powder brush.  I love it and will use it daily.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I use it for my all-over face powder and it goes on very evenly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I use it mostly for putting my base on in the morning and it has worked out so much better than the last few kabuki brushes that I have owned. They bristles aren&#x27;t too hard and they actually give me the full coverage that I am supposed to have with my foundation. If you&#x27;re looking for a new brush then I highly recommend this one because it will definitely give you what you need.</li>
    <li> This kabuki brush is by far the best brush I have own. The bristles on this brush are super soft and the design of the brush is sleek. I have used this brush to  apply my foundation in the morning and have noticed that it leaves my foundation looking very natural, flawless. I have found that applying it in a circular motion, it has cut down on my time and the amount of foundation I have to use. I even use it to apply my under eye foundation. I love using this brush because I can use on every inch of my face.</li>
    <li> Like the brush very much. I found it easy to use and it covered nicely.</li>
    <li> This beautiful brush is good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Very light touch and the coverage this Kabuki Brush creates with Bare Minerals is better than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with any other makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever tried.  All my other brushes are going away... and I am ordering a second Kabuki Brush by Castle Rock Essential Products.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Use this to apply my mineral make up. Much better than the competitors brush. Nice sturdy bristles. Great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this brush..it works great for blush..its soft and feels great on my skin...I will definitely be buying more in the future</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It works just as well if not better than the expensive brushes I have gotten from Sephora over the years. Wonderful brush for the Price!</li>
    <li> This brush is AWESOME. It&#x27;s nice and dense while being soft as well. Love it</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of makeup brushes in my time, and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;ve bought expensive ones and they have left bristles on my face that I have to pick off.  This one is firm enough, yet soft enough to make my makeup perfect - and not bristles left behind.  I&#x27;ve ordered them for gifts for several people since I started using them.</li>
    <li> good produce, very comfortable</li>
    <li> At first glance, when I got the brush, I was worried because I expected the bristles to be a bit more dense. I have used this brush to apply foundation, powder and blush as well as bronzer. After using it, I admit that I LOVE it! I love the angled brush, the bristles are so super soft and this brush did an amazing job of applying and blending out ALL of the makeup I have tried thus far. Most importantly to me. NO SHEDDING! I love it and I would highly recommend the brand!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of this brush and the slant is perfect for contouring I love it. The bristles are soft and I am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Good quality brush...thicker and softer than those I currently use.  Admittedly, I&#x27;m not too picky about my brushes, but I like this one. I don&#x27;t have an angled brush in my current collection and am glad to have this one.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush!! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is very simillar to the bare minerals brand better.  My makeup goes on flawlessy and smoother than ever before.  I will defintely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I love this brush and its design, in fact it was the design that won me over, It is very soft, well made and gives a flawless finish. Thanks,  good seller/communication too.</li>
    <li> I love how the bristles are so soft, but firm enough to provide good coverage. I use it to apply both liquid and powder foundation and it gives me a really flawless look!</li>
    <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made. Really does keep the makeup on the brush, unlike a normal power brush. Would recommend to anyone. Don&#x27;t bother paying more for a B.E. brush. This is absolutely equivalent.</li>
    <li> I love this new Angled Kabuki Brush!  The density of the bristles and the angle they are set in seems to pick up and hold the makeup really well!  Big improvement over the original kabuki brush which I have worn out.  Thank you too for the clear sheath to store the brush in.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever purchased. The bristles are good quality and  The makeup stays on the brush and then on your face when brushed on so the coverage is much better.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. I thought I was getting the Bare Minerals one, but this one is fine, just not as stiff as the one from BM.</li>
    <li> This is indeed a great brush for applying foundation and powder, but some of bristles do come out and stick to your face.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush is a great buy. The handle is pretty looking and very sturdy. Its bristles are soft and flexible and does not shed at all. I used it to apply my Jane Iredale  pressed powder mineral makeup and it blends the makeup well on my skin. The price of this brush is also phenomenal. It looks and feels like a a Sigma brush but a lot cheaper. I would purchase the brush again form this company.</li>
    <li> PERFECT brush... It makes me feel so glamorous when I put on my makeup. I used this brush with bareminerals AND Cover Girl Mineral powder. I love the way it all works. It provides perfect coverage. I am very happy with this brush! Bought it on sale, 50% off.. so happy I took a chance... this is a VERY great brush.</li>
    <li> Was far less expensive compared to the Bare Minerals angled brush I purchased previously. Guess you get what you  pay for - Bristles weren&#x27;t stiff enough (they fell over when I tried to apply makeup). Not satisfied, so I returned the product. The return process was smooth.</li>
    <li> I am using this brush as a contour brush. . . It is both soft and firm. It is firm enough to contour yet soft enough to like the feel of it on your  skin.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. The brush sheds and the quality should be much better for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this brush with my cream foundation. I used to use a beauty blender that I would dampen to blend my foundation, but this kabuki brush really blends my foundation much better. It buffs in the foundation to where my pores are basically invisible, and I don&#x27;t have to use as much product. The brush is very soft. When I first washed it when I received it, there was little to no fallout. It seems very well made and could last a long time. I would like to see more from this line since this is the only one I found made by Simply Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my hont review. This is my opinion after receiving and testing this product myself.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush! plus it comes with this heavy duty plastic holder that keeps the bristles intact....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M SOOOO IN LOVE WITH THIS BRUSH...the first time I ran my fingers through the bristles I was taken back of how soft and amazing it felt....THEN.... I used it with my liquid fountain *FLAWLESSSSS* and I didn&#x27;t need as much foundation with this brush like I did with other brushes I&#x27;ve used (a little goes along way with this brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome even coverage...I&#x27;m buying 4 more just to because ;)</li>
    <li> In use for over 2 weeks w/Physician&#x27;s Formula BB compact, this IS THE BEST BRUSH for mineral powder. Love it!  Exquisitely soft &amp; dense--feels like silk on your skin. Nicely distributes foundation, no powder &#x27;poof&#x27;  (you know how the bristles move left to right when swirling face and that little bit of powder flicks out into the air?) during application.  Comes with heavy plastic sleeve for storage so bristles stay perfectly aligned while not in use.  Seriously, this is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Daughter is in love with and wants more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mom of toddlers.  That being said, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time in the morning to apply what used to be my typical makeup routine.  But ever since I received my Simply Essentials kabuki brush, I have been taking the time I deserve to give myself a little pampering.  And I feel so much better because of it!  The bristles on this brush feel link mink across my cheek bones.  Even my toddlers love to rub it against their porcelain faces.  The handle provides a nice, comfortable grip, and my blush and bronzers apply so smoothly and blend so nicely...just like the day of my wedding!  I am so thankful that I decide to take a mini-spa moment on myself now every day.  At least I can look and feel good while I&#x27;m chasing toddlers!  I will certainly be buying all of Simply Essentials products for the rest of my beauty needs.  I will be recommending this line of trust-worthy products to everyone!</li>
    <li> Best brush for applications of mineral powder or any powder for that matter! Wonderful brush for cost, Seriously!</li>
    <li> This is the softest brush I have ever owned, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great brush, use it every day. Makeup applies evenly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed because the angled brush is not really for foundation powder application. From the instruction guide the seller emailed me the angled brush is for blush application and I was looking for a new foundation brush. It works well applying brush giving a more contoured look to the cheeks. Also it&#x27;s not as soft as I expected it to be compared to the kabuki&#x27;s I&#x27;ve felt in store at Sephora.</li>
    <li> Super-soft bristles pick up Bare Minerals matte foundation really well; angle makes it an ideal tool for applying finishing touches and concealing imperfections; handle length is great for home or travel.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Not flimsy does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Great product - very smooth and non-irritating and applies evenly! They even sent a free pdf to my email address with all sorts of pointers on use of the brush, etc! Great customer service there!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Soft and wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Kabuki Angled Brush by Simply Essentials to replace my Bare Minerals Kabuki brush that I had used for quite some time.  I use this brush to apply Bare Minerals powder foundation.  As other reviewers have stated, it has extremely thick soft bristles that allow for even application of the foundation.  It far exceeds the Bare Minerals Kabuki brush I had been using and there is very little waste of the powder due to the denseness of the brush.  There has been no shedding of the hairs.  Castle Rock Essential Products, Inc has been a pleasure to deal with!</li>
    <li> I received the brush in the mail today. My first impressions are good, I like the angle and think it will work well for powder applications. Also, comes with a great brush cover.  Honestly, I have no reservations that the brush will work great; my question is how well will it hold up over time, cleanings and general wear and tear. Those are things I cannot review and answer right now.  I will post an initial review on amazon and a follow-up in a few months.</li>
    <li> Recently received the brush and allows you to apply makeup evenly.  I was worried at first that it would not be able to compete with the bareMinerals brushes but, so far, it does.  Castle Rock does a great job at following up regarding delivery.  I recommend the brush.</li>
    <li> This is the softest makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have always been satisfied using the Bare Minerals brush, but this one far exceeds in the way of softness.  Also, the brush is very dense and there is very little waste of makeup.  The makeup stays on the brush and then on your face when brushed on so the coverage is much better.  This would be a great stocking stuffer since it is different and higher quality than what you can find in the stores.  Very pleased overall!</li>
    <li> Yes this is a fantastic brush.  When I applied my foundation it went on smoothly.  I will never use a sponge again. This brush is a great way for an even coverage. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this kabuki brush by simply essential on amazon after seeing it advertised . I have used expensive foundation brushes from bobbi brown (the flat foundation brush) to shu umera, shisiedo, and my favorite foundation brush was a tarte brush I purchased with a powder foundation from QVC. I love my makeup and I honestly have never used a more soft yet firm foundation brush. The brush buffs the skin perfectly and places the foundation in every pore. I have used sponges and the beauty blender and disklike them both. This again is so worth the money a little steep but I find that synthetic brushes pick up more product but it is important to make sure they are not too soft. I will be getting another one as I am obsessive about having a back-up at all times courtesy of simply essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
    <li> It is great price for its quality. I am glad to choose this one. No irritation on my skin, velvety smooth. I also like the small brush cover comes with it. It keep the brush in shape and easy to store.</li>
    <li> I love the brush! This is the best foundation brush I have ever used. I use Bare Minerals loose foundation and this brush applies the makeup so beautifully. I have never had my makeup look this good before. I am thinking of ordering another brush so I have a backup.</li>
    <li> This is a great, quality brush. I purchased a bare minerals one just like it that cost more than twice the amount for this one. I use it for my cream foundation and it works great. Flawless, smooth, and nice coverage. I will buy more brushes from this company.</li>
    <li> Very high quality!  I will order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;It is softer than Sigma brushes and provides a great coverage with my BB cream (better than I was ever able to achieve with my fingertips). It is a quality brush and survives washing just fine without shedding.</li>
    <li> i love this brush! help me to apply an the foundation at fast and even way!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Use it every day. Best brush for holding and distributing powder.</li>
    <li> This may be the perfect makeup brush!  It is soft with a very helpful slant....Excellent coverage!&lt;br /&gt;It is of very nice quality and at a bargain price....I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  Even coverage, no waste. No bristles shedding. It is soft and easy to clean. I have used several other brands and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. Much lower cost than other comparable brands and just as high quality! I use bare minerals pressed foundation and my brush of theirs is past its prime. Instead of shelling out twice as much for another of their brushes, I opted for this one and I&#x27;m happy I did. Also - a plus - great customer service.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I own. It really gives the skin a nice smooth look and good coverage. Buying another one!!</li>
    <li> This Kabuki Brush Angled is now my favorite brush!!!!!  I Love that it&#x27;s Angled!  Linda</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used. Works great on mineral make up.</li>
    <li> Love the even surface and when the review says there is no loose bristles-they mean it! I have used it now daily for almost two weeks and no loose bristles. Provide great application of my mineral foundation without leaving the skin feeling scrubbed - like some brushes can do-and I have sensitive skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I can use with liquid make up or powders. Will be buying another. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a very soft, densely bristled brush.  It is perfect for applying foundation.  I buff the makeup into my skin and this brush easily blends it into my hairline, jawline, and around my nose and eyes.  It is the perfect size for reaching every nook and cranny.  I also have a flat topped kabuki style foundation brush, but I prefer this angled style.  The bristles pick up the perfect amount of foundation without absorbing too much.  This brush also washes beautifully, coming completely clean with a little baby shampoo and it dries quickly.  The handle is well made and is the perfect length which makes it easy to use.  All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this brush and will definitely purchase another one.  (Unlike many of the 5 star reviewers, I did not receive a free sample of this product.  This review is totally unbiased and totally true.)  I definitely recommend this product.  It performs well and is reasonably priced.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> My favorite make up brush by far!  I have used other make up brushes (actually the Bare Minerals Kabuki) and it hurt my face.  This brush is thick/full and very soft.  I thought that since it was so soft it wouldn&#x27;t have great coverage but it has the best coverage of all brushes I have ever had!!  I would recommend this product for sure especially if you have sensitive skin and/or want a full coverage brush.  The hand is a nice length, not too long, not too short.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service from Castle Rock Essential Products is Great too!!!&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Really soft brush, works really well for my powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased mineral READY Foundation (Bare Minerals) that is in a compact. The round brushes I use for loose mineral did not work with the compact, so I purchased this angled flat brush. The quality is excellent and it works perfectly for my compact mineral foundation. I love the dense, yet very soft bristles that feel so good on my face. I&#x27;ve never used a flat angled brush before but I can see it is very versatile. I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
    <li> It has super soft bristles so feels much better on my face than the brush I previously used. Also, great customer service from the seller.</li>
    <li> I use a kabuki brush every day to apply mineral powder, and was in desparate need for a new brush. Enter this brush. I like the handle, but the bristles just were not as tightly packed as I prefer. It was certainly very soft, but I did not find it to be suitable for me for a daily full-face brush. It will work great as a contouring brush, though.</li>
    <li> I have some very expensive makeup brushes from all those big name makeup companies.. this brush leaves them in the dust. This makes my powder go on flawlessly. My friends keep asking about my complexion since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  I have many other brushes, many that are a lot more expensive than this one is but this one has taken the place of my usual go to brush.  I have only been using it about a week and I already love the results it gives when I use it with my loose powder foundation and my compact foundation.  Because the the bristles are densely packed it picks up the right amount of my product which results in an even, buildable coverage that looks natural!  Must try if you use powder foundation for sure, I don&#x27;t use liquid so I am not sure how it works with liquid but I am sure it would be just as good! :)</li>
    <li> i love how soft the brush is...too bad I cannot enjoy it&#x27;s softness anymore as someone stole it from me...ugh!!! i guess i need a new one. It just saddens me coz it&#x27;s hard for me to find a good product as my skin is very sensitive, and when i finally found one,</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  Make up goes on very smooth and you are able to control how much you use.  It blends in beautifully and no clumping.  I would definitely recommend this product!  The company was very &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; and keep me in the loop of receiving my order and when it shipped.  Great job!!</li>
    <li> Great powder brush!!  Applies powder evenly over entire face. Strong yet soft bristles and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Wow.. I love this brush! I&#x27;m so glad&lt;br /&gt; I ordered two of them. I will be ordering another..you can&#x27;t have to many. So full and so soft it glides over your skin. It has an angle to it that lets you apply foudation or blush perfectly. Great customer service too! I got an email from Jessica to make sure I received it and that I liked it. I think you will be so happy with this brush..get 2!</li>
    <li> I have received my new brush and am very happy with it.  I already had one that is a Bare Minerals brush and this one is every bit as good, if not BETTER, than that one.  It is very soft and is so nice to use on my face.  It is made very well and the bristles are compact and do not seem like they will come apart.  I was very pleased with the price too.  I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who uses mineral makeup.  I am using this one to apply blush and it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> I personally did like this brush, it was very soft, and wasn&#x27;t harsh on my sensitive skin like some brushes are,even though it was a bit expensive , I think it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1YJRK5LB4BHG4]]When I first ran my finger through this brush one word came to mind - luxurious.  The brush is thickly filled with bristles and the bristles are soft. I hope the attached video gives you an idea of how it feels.  The brush is soft yet firm (from the volume and how close the bristles are held together) so it buffs the make up on my face very well. The handle is 5\\&quot; long (black and silver parts together).  The bristles are 0.75\\&quot; long in front and 1\\&quot; in the back.  The brush (the bristles end) is 1.5\\&quot; across. Note that Amazon description has a typo using feet to describe the size of this brush (no, it is not 6 feet long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush to put on concealer foundation and it does a great job, good even coverage.  After using it for a couple of weeks I can say that it did not shed any bristles and continues to feel very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for testing.  It is a little pricey.  Will I buy a replacement next time? Yes. This is very nice make up brush.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> Really a great brush.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Being the makeup junkie that I am, I was super excited to try this brush, and I was not let down in the least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush. I have found many uses for it, and find myself reaching for it time and time again. It feels so incredibly soft, yet it is still very dense and strong like a typical kabuki brush. I began using this as a blush brush. It&#x27;s angled bristles make it easy to contour to your cheek bone and apply a nice wash of color. Next I used it for my bronzer. I again love that it fit perfectly along the curves of my face. The next use was for my face finishing powder. Blended perfectly and evenly distributed the product. Last use was my liquid foundation. And yet again, it worked amazingly. So easy to blend products, and so soft on the skin. Like I said, I find myself reaching for this brush now over my high end $40+ brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the brush is easy, I just use baby shampoo and let it dry upright with bristles downward. I have not had any shedding of the bristles what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good angled kabuki brush, I cannot recommend this enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> quick delivery and just what I wanted thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received this brush just a few days ago and I love it! It&#x27;s very well made and very soft.</li>
    <li> Product shipped fast and works amazing! I use it with both my powder &amp; liquid  foundation... The brush covers all my sun spots and scars, seriously giving me an air brushed look! It spreads my powder/foundation evenly &amp; perfectly! And the best part is... A little goes a long way, you just need a small amount of makeup! I&#x27;ve already recommended the Kabuki Brush to my sisters and friends!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!  It is so soft and the&lt;br /&gt; coverage is wonderful with mineral make up.  I will definitely be buying&lt;br /&gt; more brushes from your company!  Thank you for making a great product and&lt;br /&gt; checking in for feedback.  I wish more companies would do this!</li>
    <li> AMAZING BRUSH!!! This is the smoothest brush I have yet to use on my face. It moves the product around so smoothly and evenly and blends it into the skin as if makeup was airbrushed. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also received a note before I got the product saying thank you for ordering and a note after to ask how I liked it. Very personable and professional. It was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a replacement for the brush that accompanies the Bare Minerals Bare Skin foundation (as seen on tv commercial). I bought the BareMinerals brush but someone took it from me and I wasn&#x27;t anxious to get another one since they&#x27;re quite pricey.  That&#x27;s when I went on the hunt for a similar brush.  I came across the Castle Rock brush and decided to try it.  As other reviewers have said, what first struck me was how lush and soft it was.  I have used it for about a month now and the bristles look as if they haven&#x27;t even been used and still as soft as ever.  I also have the flat brush and intend on getting the round brush too.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Love the angle and the density of the brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my very sensitive face.  Very comparable to the Bare Essentials kabuki brush but a whole lot less money.</li>
    <li> Great high quality brush and wonderful customer service from Castle Rock. I intend to purchase more from them. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The best Kabuki brush I&#x27;ve owned so far. Soft, and coverage is great. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other brushes this company has to offer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome to put on my bronzer,blush,and powder. It is very well made and helps my makeup go on so nicely. It even seemed to help conceal my pores and gave me a beautiful finished look!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice make up brush--so much better than the one I replaced. It is soft and buffs well. I have never had a make up brush that applies make up as well as this. The price seems good, too!</li>
    <li> I love the brush, I believe it applies more foundation from a pressed mineral powder compact - probably the only brush to use for a pressed powder.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, soft and full kabuki brush that is just as good ( I actually like it better) as the Bare Minerals brush that I have&lt;br /&gt;used for several years. I had wanted a kabuki brush to keep in my purse with my minerals foundation and checked out Amazon prices.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled that I took a chance on this much cheaper brush and will certainly tell my friends about it. Thanks for a well made brush at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I reviewed the Kabuki Angled makeup brush and I loved it. It applies makeup perfectly and evenly and the coverage looks totally natural. The brush is so soft on your skin and makes it look radiant. The handle is long and wooden and the bristles are very secure and resist shedding. I love this brush because it looks great and works well with all my makeup. Great quality brush that will last and is a good value. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee!</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Hold its shape extremely well.  Love the way it carries &amp; applies to my face.  Covers good &amp; helps to cover imperfections</li>
    <li> This Brush Is AMAZING for powdered foundation, coverage is perfect. The brush dusts off nicely, the bristles are not all over your shirt after your done applying your make up. If you are looking for a great brush for powdered foundation this one is it!</li>
    <li> The perfect makeup brush.  Feels like silky velvet.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This Kabuki brush makes applying foundation and powder quick, even, and mess free.  I used liquid foundation with it, and would definitely recommend it.  In addition to working well, this brush is silky and gentle even on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!! I will be buying all of my brushes from this company.  Shipping was on time and I opened it and brushed it over my face right away and it was super spft. Not the soft that doesnt give good coverage.  Luxurious soft. My bare minerals brush (3 times the price) did not work half as well nor was it soft. You will LOVE this brush. I honestly would have paid 40$ for this. Quality is off the charts. Makeup is applied perfectly.</li>
    <li> Received free for my fiance. She loves it and it comes highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://ramblingsofasubscriptionaddict.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I am new to &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34;makeup - I have typically used either my fingers or a sponge to apply my preference of liquid makeup.  I subscribe to Reddit&#x27;s Makeup Addiction channel and read about how to use a brush to apply the makeup this way and went on the hunt for this magical tool. Lo and behold I found this - it is a fabulous brush.  Great coverage, the hairs are nice and thick and feel good on my face.  It provides a very finished look - with just quick swipe of powder to set the makeup I definitely feel more professional and polished.  I can&#x27;t wait to try other sizes, particularly a smaller version to get closer to my eyes.  Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! Love my new brush!</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for makeup, great value, well made</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush! I have been using it almost a month now, and i have not seen one bristle shed. It is thick and firm, yet somehow still maintains an extremely soft and luxurious feel on your skin. it has great coverage for both powder and liquid foundations and i have even used it to apply blush. If you like getting excellent coverage while maintaining a silky smooth feeling, this is your brush!  I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I received the Kabuki Angled Brush as a Christmas gift.  Love the quality of&lt;br /&gt;this brush, as it holds in your hand very comfortably, durability plus (it will&lt;br /&gt;last for years) and the bristles of the brush are so-o-o smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this brush and other Kabuki products to my family, friends and&lt;br /&gt;anyone who&#x27;s smart enough to purchase one!</li>
    <li> I thought I had great make up brushes but this one is amazing! It is super soft and it&#x27;s obvious from the touch that it&#x27;s a high quality brush. I&#x27;ll be looking for more of these. The angle of the brush works wonders!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  I have tried countless brushes/applicators to apply my powder and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve used that actually hides my pores!  I have a clear complexion, but I hate the way even the smallest amount of makeup looks caked on.  This brush is my new favorite beauty tool!</li>
    <li> Great brush! It&#x27;s pretty soft and works well with light powder foundations. I only have a problem with it if my skin is already very dry. But as long as I&#x27;ve exfoliated and moisturized, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup person but recently wanted to try contouring for fun so I got the Anastasia contour kit and this brush to try out to blend. The brush feels sturdy and the bristles are soft and feel nice. Again, I&#x27;m not familiar with brushes or anything but this is an honest layman&#x27;s opinion. I&#x27;d  recommend it as a blending brush, which might be its primary purpose anyway, but not for actually drawing the contour lines.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered so quickly, I could not believe it! The brush is SO soft and yet firm. It is my favorite brush! Given the quality of it, I did not think the price was too much. I will be doing a review of this brush soon at tomboyangel.net.</li>
    <li> How do I describe perfection?! This brush not only is very well made and has the softest bristles but the contouring aspect of hits it off the charts as a A+++++++</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush!!  I&#x27;ve used it and washed it and used it......  It&#x27;s not like some that once you wash it, it&#x27;s never the same.  It dried and its still as soft and great as new :).  Would recommend to anyone that wants a professional style brush</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Perfectly angled to get under the eye area. Also, the bristles are very soft, unlike many that are stiff and sharp.Seems to be very good quality. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for her and now it is her new favorite.  This is a high quality and the hairs stay put, they do not fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it applies everything evenly and effortlessly.  The Kabuki Brush by Simply Essentials is the ultimate brush for what you need!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. I have been using another companies makeup brush which was ok but when I received my Kabuki angled brush, I was so happy. The difference in feel and application of the brush was great. I use the brush for my powered foundation. I love the Kabuki angled brush so much I order another to use for my finishing veil powder.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this brush but when I received it I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. 1. It is VERY heavy, which might be fine if the quality  was superb but the wooden handle is pretty thick and it doesn&#x27;t seems to attach into the chrome part as securely as it should. The brush itself seems to shed bristles which I find extremely annoying. I don&#x27;t recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> The brush is soft, feels good against your skin and is angeled perfectly for full coverage.</li>
    <li> I wish the brush was a little bigger and could cover lot surface area on my face other than that it works well I just use it on small or harder to define areas</li>
    <li> I have been wearing powder makeup for about ten years. Which means I have been using kabuki brushes for just as much time. I absolutely love this angled brush from Castle Rock. I was hesitant to switch to a new brand, but mine have not been lasting as long as they used to. I must say I&#x27;m pleased. Excellent coverage, and beautiful design. I would definitely recommend this brush to a friend.</li>
    <li> This brush was given to me as a gift and I was grateful to receive it but I have really sensitive skin and eczema. Almost everything that rubs across my face can make me itch (yes, how annoying!). When I opened this brush and felt it, I could see that it was not like any brush I had used as the bristles were super soft and very densely packed. The angle in the brush is cut completely cleanly. There are no odd strands. It&#x27;s precision cut.    Well, it does not make me itch and in fact, if I had another one, I would not use it for makeup and I would use it just to apply my face cream because it feels so nice and actually relaxing. This is the BEST brush. It feels so good on my skin and because it is so dense and soft, makeup glides evenly across my face. I am really happy with this brush. My guess is that you would probably feel the same.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to find this brush on Amazon and then the day I looked it was on special.  Great price and the service was very fast.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great softest brush I&#x27;ve ever felt. It makes my mineral makeup very easy to blend, I like the slight angling. I did, and do notice a brush fiber or two that sheds on my face. But very very expensive brushes have done the same. Thats&#x27; not a deal breaker for me. Love it will be ordering another one for my blush application. Customer care is great too.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Feels amazing on my skin! I use it for my powder foundation and for blush and it makes it look great!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It has taken the place of two of my mineral makeup brushes.  It applies the mineral foundation and settles it on my skin quickly and I don&#x27;t have to keep buffing to get the coverage I want.  The brush does what it says it will do with my mineral makeup.  I would recommend this brush to anyone using mineral makeup.  Will definitely use it if I switch to a liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I love a good makeup brush! Soft bristles well put together… There is nothing worse than a brush that feels like is scratching your skin or a brush that sheds all over your beautiful face! Honestly, it is really difficult to find a good makeup brush online. You don’t know how it feels or if it sheds! You depend strictly on honest reviews from customers, that is why I am here to help you today J&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough test a makeup brush that I actually really like! I am so weary about using a brush from the internet, but this brush is great! It is an Angled Kabuki Brush By Simply Essentials. I personally use this as my blush brush. The angle is perfect for applying my blush with just one swipe! It feels great on my skin. It is one of the softest brushes that I own. It is cheaper than the professional brushes, but just as good. I would highly recommend Simply Essentials brushes! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush. Will never buy anything else. If your teetering about buying one...I recommend just buying 2 or more of the get go because your want to use one with every product . You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The Kabuki brush provides great coverage for bare minerals foundation, and the brush tip applicator has nice soft, but sturdy bristles that are of great quality.  In comparison to other make up brushes, the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend purchasing it!</li>
    <li> Just replaced my other kabuki brush with this one. Great quality &amp; a must have for any makeup fanatic. Five stars!!!</li>
    <li> Well made and very soft.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! Fantastic quality, awesome for bronzer. Really evens out powder, I want to buy one for every girl I know. Just as good as super expensive brushes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This angled Kabuki brush is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the brush is. I use this brush with Bare Minerals powder and I like the amount of coverage it provides. This is a quality brush for a reasonable price. Thank you! I will be ordering again from Castle Rock.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush.  Ordered more after first purchase to share.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use it with the Forever foundation and I love the coverage and natural look that this brush gives. 5 stars in my book!!!! Excellent value. I used Macs brush and the bristles kept coming out but not with this one. Pure perfection!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it and no shedding and covers beautifully!!!!</li>
    <li> I use my brush every single day.  I love it!!!! I wish I could afford an entire set!  The angled bristles and softness are a major plus!  I love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these gorgeous brushes. I have mature skin and I love the way my makeup looks when I use these for application. Excellent, concerned customer service and instruction. Very good buy.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  I have never used a kabuki brush before and wanted to try one and it is great! It applies the foundation very evenly and I love that I can control the level of coverage.  The angle on the brush allows you to get great coverage under and around your eyes.  It is a definite must have for applying foundation..</li>
    <li> The kabuki brush is awesome! It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used to apply and blend Bare Minerals radiance products. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very soft.  I love the way it feels against my skin, and it buffs my mineral makeup really nicely.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and holds bare minerals powder very well.</li>
    <li> The reviews before me were all correct!!! This brush is AMAZING!!  My favorite so far.  I was a little hesitant to believe all the positive reviews on this item, but Im glad to report that everybody is right!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after reading all the great reviews. As soon as it arrived in the mail I ripped the package open and tried it with my mousse foundation. The coverage was awesome no streaking and the brush is luxuriously soft yet dense enough for my foundation application. Love it!</li>
    <li> Feels great in your hand and on your face. Spreads on powder foundation just as well as those really high end Kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for about a week now and I absolutely love it!  My makeup goes on so smooth without any lines and looks very natural.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s high quality and super soft.  It works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Despite having only used this for a short period of time, I am very satisfied with the quality of the product. The price was right and the service from Castle Rock was excellent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!!  It holds onto the mineral foundation when I put it on. Other brushes I have used “leak” the powder and cause a mess on my clothes, it does not feel scratchy on my face again other brushes are kind of itchy, &amp; the handle is long makes it easier to apply the mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy brush!  The bristles are soft so when I apply my face powder, it does not leave a cakey look. It leaves a very smooth and even look. I love it!</li>
    <li> Best makeup brush on the market! I use this brush to dab on my foundation to get an airbrushed affect and it does a wonderful job! Easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t lose bristles like many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I was needing a new brush for applying my powder foundation and I have to say this does a fantastic job. It does provide good coverage and evenness over my face.  Glad  I ran across this...very happy with the results it provides!</li>
    <li> I have purchased many make up brushes before and I am sure man of us have a huge collection of ones we don&#x27;t like. well this is not the brush to be put away. This is a great quality brush and what akes it great is the angle of the brissles. Tha angle of the brush ensures that the make up is applied even on the skin leaving no skin with out make up. I love how it blends and leaves just the right amount of make up on my skin. I also did the pull test and guess what not one hair pulled out!! Perfect !!! I am very happy with my Kabuki Brush and will order more because i will never put this brush in my bad collection drawer...... I love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush. It&#x27;s soft and perfect size for applying my powder.  The angle makes it easier too!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s soft and applies my powder very evenly. I will be looking into other products that this company offers. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the brush so much! Totally professional quality at a great price. The seller is so friendly and helpful, offering lots of tips on how to use the product. Would definitely buy again as gifts for my friends.</li>
    <li> I have used many other brand brushes an i will have to say this is bar far the best makeup brush i have ever used, i will definitely be ordering other brushes from your company, thank you very much</li>
    <li> I give this brush 4.5 stars. Only reason is because it shed a little during the first couple uses. I used this with a liquid foundation it applies it evenly. Great for those getting into makeup and need a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Simply love this brush!!! Wish the seller had the whole set of brushes!&lt;br /&gt;It is firm and gentle at the same time! I use for liquid foundation and always get a perfect blended look! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seriously impressed with this makeup brush; it&#x27;s incredibly soft and applies my powder foundation quite smoothly. I&#x27;m curious to see how it will hold up over time, but right now, it was easily worth the price. Definitely the nicest feeling foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The brush is soft and works good on contouring the bronzer on my face. I would have like it to be a little smaller so it would not spread the product so much.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a Kabuki brush after watching a few tutorials on youtube about applying mineral foundation and all said this type of brush would achieve the best results, I had previously given up on it because of how poorly the brush that comes with the kit I purchased applies the foundation.  I wanted to give the mineral makeup another try in search of the perfect way to apply my makeup for my upcoming wedding.  This brush is very soft and evenly applied the mineral as well as solid face powder I have.  I have not used this for liquid foundation so can&#x27;t review on that.  But, I absolutely love this brush and the way it feels on my face while applying make-up.  This is now my new favorite brush, can&#x27;t wait for more brushes from this company to purchase!</li>
    <li> Pretty good brush, but it is hard to reach in small corners of the face like around the nose and under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  Worth the price because you use less product.  I am turning my daughters and coworkers on to Kabuki.  Customer Service contacted me to see if I was happy with the product, now how often does that ever happen!!!!!  You will not be disappointed with this purchase,  it is so well made I am sure it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is a full coverage brush that does not shed. I found it hard to find the Kabuki brushes with the long handle, but this brush is a perfect fit for my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush for those who order the Bare Minerals brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush to use with my mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. The angle contours your cheek perfectly. The brush is soft and blends well. I received it quickly and I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I used it with the bare minerals foundation and it works well. Is soft and feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love the angle of this brush .. Also it&#x27;s very soft. I have very sensitive skin. But this brush does not bother me at all!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I use it for loose powder or Bare Essential Mineral Veil.  The brush is very soft and evenly distributes the powder.</li>
    <li> Great product, just what I have been searching for.  Excellent service, prompt delivery.  Plan to order another one.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush!</li>
    <li> The brush was exactly what I need and the price was right. I lov bare minerals, and was happy to be able to save and buy at the ssame time.</li>
    <li> Too slippery and flimsy. It will work for my purse but not at home for my main brush!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush,  it looks so sophisticated and its texture is soft and can make a nice work with your makeup. Also the seller is very professional and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was a bit skeptical when ordering this brush at first, just because the price was so cheap compared to other places I have looked.. However, I am so glad I decided to order it because this brush is amazing in my opinion! It&#x27;s super soft and yet the bristles are bound together tightly, so I have no doubt that it&#x27;ll last for a while. Definitely going to be using it a lot :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller emailed me just to follow up and make sure I got the brush and to see what I thought about it. That&#x27;s never happened with anyone else I have purchased anything from, so I was pretty impressed lol.. All-in-all, I am very pleased with this purchase and the seller!</li>
    <li> I was sent this brush to review. I am loving this angled Kabuki brush. It is extremely soft and goes into every groove and crevice on my face. It spreads my liquid foundation on very evenly. I also used it to blend my liquid/cream concealer under my eyes and used a tapping motion and it blended out perfectly. I love this brush. I would recommend it if you love an extremely soft brush. I received the product for an unbiased and uncompensated review.</li>
    <li> This Angled Kabuki brush truly gives my mineral make up the power to cover imperfections and give me a very natural look that I like with my make up. This really is a wonderful Kabuki brush. I can honestly say, this is the nicest make up brush I’ve used. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the angled, dense bristles.  The bristles are synthetic so it can be used with any kind of make up.  You can use liquid, cream or powder makeup. My makeup looks flawless!!&lt;br /&gt;Things to love about this Kabuki Brush are of course the angled brush part, this really lets me get the best coverage in my mineral make up! Seriously, this brush has very dense bristles.  I get perfect coverage everywhere!!  This easily get’s make up around the nose, in the corners of my eyes and at the hairline.  The fact that it has a long handle is a big plus for me, I feel like I have better control where I’m brushing.  The bristles are soft. Super SOFT!!&lt;br /&gt;Best brush EVER!!</li>
    <li> The brush came in a sealed plastic baggy. Inside the plastic baggy the brush was also covered by a little plastic brush protector. I liked the way this was packaged, I knew there werent going to be many germs that found its way to my brush. At first glance this brush looked soft. It had a nice weight to it. It is heavier than most of my other makeup brushes. I like the weight of it in my hands. It is not too heavy.  Definitely can tell  it is made up of nice quality material. After unpacking the brush I finally got to get my hands on the brush to see  if it was just as soft as it looked. It was. I was very surprised. There aren&#x27;t many brushes that look this dense and are also soft. I played with it a little in my hands, moving the brush around, fanning the brush out, just trying to see if there was any fall out. I did not have any. It was so soft I loved just brushing it on my face. Next, I washed the brush. I always wash my brushes when I buy them because you just do not know if any germs have found a home. I washed the brush like I do all my others. I had no fallout. I made sure to keep water from getting under the metal. I hung the brush upside down to dry. It dried perfect just like how it was when it came to be mine. I tested this brush out my using it for every step of the way in putting on my face. This brush was perfect for blending in my concealer, buffing out my foundation and contouring my features. This brush has many uses. I have not picked a favorite use for it yet. I think this is a great quality brush and would purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using mineral powders for at least ten&lt;br /&gt;to fifteen years and have tried many brushes. I wanted a face foundation&lt;br /&gt;brush for travel. Yours fit the bill!  Not only is the brush wonderful&lt;br /&gt;feeling, but it covers beautifully. Because I carry it in a makeup case, I&lt;br /&gt;adore the cover sleeve. Easy to slip on, it doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs out of&lt;br /&gt;place and it is sturdy and I expect it will last the life of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I also like your personal approach in asking for my feedback. It makes me&lt;br /&gt;feel part of a family. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I recently started using bare minerals makeup and i needed a better brush to apply it with. i read the reviews for this brush and decided to try it. i&#x27;m so glad i did! it&#x27;s so soft and my makeup went on so easily. it looks so much better! i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good brush to apply foundation. it really exceeded my expectations. i&#x27;ve never used any of the expensive brushes like sephora or the others so i can&#x27;t say how this brush compares to them, but i don&#x27;t really see how a brush could be much better than this one</li>
    <li> I use this with my BareMinerals pressed foundation. It&#x27;s a great option in lieu of the BareMinerals branded brush. Very nice quality, soft bristles. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about 6 months and it&#x27;s still in great shape.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and great price.  Product arrived on time, unopened.  I love the brush - it works great.</li>
    <li> This is the brush I have been searching for! Absolutly worth every penny and it is my favorite brush I own. Very soft and dense perfect for Bare Minerals makeup and gives the air brushed perfect look. I LOVE this brush!</li>
    <li> thick, fluffy, soft and provides awesome coverage.  very well made.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this makeup brush! I threw away my small handle kabuki brush and I use this one every day. I use it with a powder foundation. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flaky like other makeup brushes have in the past. It gives great coverage of makeup around my nose and eyes without leaving my foundation looking streaky or cakey on my skin. I was a little surprised at how natural my powder foundation looked after using this angled kabuki brush. Very impressed with the results. The makeup brush is easy to clean and is vegan- friendly!</li>
    <li> When I saw this brush with 5 star reviews &amp; viewed its price, I thought it must be a joke. I was blown away after receiving and testing this product today. The angled Kabuki brush applied my Bare Minerals foundation better than any of their branded brushes. I would have easily paid double this price if I came across this product in a store.</li>
    <li> So soft and durable. Applies makeup beautifully.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It provides great coverage and does not shed like other brushes while applying foundation. However, when I was using it I did notice some minor streaks, but it didn&#x27;t bother me because i just blended it out with my fingers or with a few extra strokes from the brush. It arrived the next day - talk about fast shipping! - and came with a discount on your next order with the company. This is a great buy if you don&#x27;t want to splurge on brushes from cosmetic stores and works just as well.</li>
    <li> Omggggggg! I love this brush I have 2 one I use for foundation and the other for powder and it makes my make up flawless! Excellent product! Also this item ship immediately and thank u for outstanding product! I recommend all makeup artists to have this!</li>
    <li> It is everything other reviews have stated (durability factor is still being tested). I use bare minerals and I am impressed so far.  Holds the powder well and transfers well. I am used to a slightly wider brush, I would have preferred if this brush was wider but like many things in life, you adjust when you find a good tool.</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty awesome!! I use with my bare minerals makeup. I am really impressed so far. I always read reviews, so it&#x27;s about time I write one.</li>
    <li> Only used a couple of times,very recent order.  So far love it. Does what is suppose to do and does not irritate my face, which is sensitive.  Order arrived swiftly and I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> this kabuki brush is absolutely amazing. I have used bare minerals (or essentials) since they first came out. Therefore I have used multiple different brushes. And this one is by far the BEST I&#x27;ve used thus far. It has a slight slant to it which makes the application perfect and goes on evenly. Previously I tried the same type of brush that doesn&#x27;t have the slant, and it picks up to much product. This one doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a must have in any makeup collection.... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the brush . Makeup goes on nicely</li>
    <li> Simply Essentials&#x27;s Kabuki brush is a flat-edged makeup brush for foundations and other face makeup like primer, BB cream, powder, etc. It has super soft bristles that are compact, so you get good coverage with face makeup, without causing irritation or any streaking or unevenness like you would if you just used your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a very reasonably-priced brush, and is perfect for beginners. It applies foundation and BB cream very smoothly, and makes your foundation less cakey. I would recommend washing it after every use, just because of the potential bacteria buildup on and inside the bristles if you leave makeup and residues from your face sitting in them for too long. Immediately after usage, just rinse it with gentle soap (like baby shampoo or body wash) and warm water. Scrub the bristles a bit, but don&#x27;t handle them too roughly, as they could fall out. Be gentle with it and let dry completely before using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend you only use this for liquid or cream based makeup products. It isn&#x27;t a huge fan/powder brush, so it made my powder foundation application a little clumpy. I would not use this with powder foundation or finishing powder again; there are different, wider, and less dense makeup brushes for that. If you absolutely need to use this for setting powder or powder foundation, dip it into the powder carefully, tap the excess off, then swirl and buff it across your face. Don&#x27;t directly put powder on your face, or it will definitely clump up on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this kabuki brush from Simply Essentials in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Soft and dense but takes a lot pf product to make a difference.</li>
    <li> When I got it I was excited cause I  read the reviews on it before  I purchased it but I didn&#x27;t really like it.the bristle was too soft.</li>
    <li> Great brush - very soft - applies makeup evenly and the bristles really hang on to the powder - love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!  The angled design provides more thorough coverage of my mineral powder. And it doesn&#x27;t shed!  The bristles are very soft. I will be getting one for my daughter too</li>
    <li> I now have 2 of these cause I fell in love with the first 1 I got. Great product feels so soft on the face while doing your makeup. Other brushes were rough &amp; just down right horrible to try &amp; put makeup on with. Very happy I decided to give this brush a try so worth it.</li>
    <li> Great brush until 3 months of use.  I clean my brushes one to twice a week. This brush became impossible to clean and therefore useless to me.</li>
    <li> softest brush I have ever felt.</li>
    <li> love this brush! it is so nice and unlike other foundation brushes! it is so soft and fits all my needs.</li>
    <li> So soft and feels great, works great as well. Get makeup on evenly. I like it.</li>
    <li> This brush is so great! It&#x27;s so soft and works so well.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Applies well.</li>
    <li> Nice soft bristles.  Love the angle, feels like it gives better coverage.  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teen daughter for Christmas - she LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use with liquid foundation and it spreads smoothly and evenly with no real build up like a sponge would have. This brush is very soft and cleans up quick and easy. This is the first time I ever tried a kabuki brush and it was priced good for a first time buyer. Well worth the money spent and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love my Kabuki brush. I have never had a brush quite like it, it applies my make up in such smooth distribution. My skin looks flawless after using it. I have a 3 1/2 scar on my forehead and using the Kabuki brush keeps my make up on evenly and the scar is less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I use the angled brush regularly for my illuminating powder and use the flat top to blend.</li>
