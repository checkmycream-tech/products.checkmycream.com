### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product was introduced to me by my hairstylist and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I holds my curls perfectly and is what my hairdresser uses on my hair at the shop.</li>
      <li>Excellent hold without drying my 4c hair out.</li>
      <li>It smells great, it has slip and helps to hold my curls.</li>
      <li>LoL</li>
      <li>As my hair has grown out this has been a great product for my curls and hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely MAGICAL!!</li>
      <li>Loved it it is a staple of my hair supplies</li>
      <li>It is really good.</li>
      <li>Love this product, great smell, and makes my hair wraps come out really nice.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I just love it!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not going to give you amazing curl definition.</li>
      <li>Always liked this product.</li>
      <li>Will by more products soon.</li>
      <li>much better ( 3-5days of curls).</li>
      <li>smells wonderful, smooth my frizzes on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>First of all, the smell is great, and leaves your hair smelling like that for the whole day.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything significant to my hair...</li>
      <li>The best only thing I use on my hair leave my hair soft and shiny</li>
      <li>Once you take off the tie, your hair will still be wet, but you will already be able to see the curls defining...and as your hair dries, the curls will get more and more</li>
      <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried thus far to give curl to unprocessed hair.  </li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
      <li>My hair is cut very low like a guy, so this product further defines my curls, keeps them in shape, and provides a very nice shine.</li>
      <li>It also last the whole day or more depending on how I sleep on it.</li>
      <li>So, didn&#x27;t do much of anything for curl enhancing.</li>
      <li>It really curls the hair.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with very curly hair who wants definition and hold without flaking.</li>
      <li>I have very curly afro textured, and this product works really well with my hair type and length.</li>
      <li>I then scrunch it up, and tie it in a bun, and leave it like that while I finish getting ready.</li>
      <li>defined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried ENDLESS amounts of products, but this is the magic recipe for MY curls...</li>
      <li>Oh, also to note, I did not use any other product on top of it nor under it (not even a leave-in conditioner).</li>
      <li>No Frizz works really well for shiny and defined curls and the hair is still amazingly soft!</li>
      <li>This stuff has allowed me to cut down to 2 products at most instead of the usual cocktail of 3 or more.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
      <li>i used this this product with the other Design products and I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product since November and will continue to use it for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I could only see it when I go real close to a mirror.</li>
      <li>It dries smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hard.</li>
      <li>There was barely any curl.</li>
      <li>In the past couple of years, I went through a straight-hair phase, which completely deteriorated my natural curls, so now I&#x27;ve invested in natural sulfate-free products to get them back--</li>

    <li> Excellent hold without drying my 4c hair out. No product build up.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely MAGICAL!! First of all, the smell is great, and leaves your hair smelling like that for the whole day.

    <li> I have been using this product since November and will continue to use it for my natural hair. It really curls the hair. It is really good. I love it.</li>
    <li> The best only thing I use on my hair leave my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I have 4c kinky coily hair. I used this mouse with the daily moisteriser; my hair was very dry and I had minimal curl definition (with two twist braid). The little curl I had, lasted for only a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend their streching cream; much better ( 3-5days of curls).</li>
    <li> It smells great, it has slip and helps to hold my curls. They are bouncy and behaving.</li>
    <li> i used this this product with the other Design products and I was not disappointed.  It worked so well on my hair.</li>
    <li> Luv it. Well needed moisturizer. Always liked this product.</li>
    <li> I have very curly afro textured, and this product works really well with my hair type and length. My hair is cut very low like a guy, so this product further defines my curls, keeps them in shape, and provides a very nice shine. It also last the whole day or more depending on how I sleep on it. I would recommend this product to anyone with very curly hair who wants definition and hold without flaking. I just love it! The picture I provided is me with the product in my hair....if that helps.</li>
    <li> This stuff has allowed me to cut down to 2 products at most instead of the usual cocktail of 3 or more. I have found that mixing this with the Sahag No Frizz works really well for shiny and defined curls and the hair is still amazingly soft!</li>
    <li> As my hair has grown out this has been a great product for my curls and hair. It doesn&#x27;t give it the flakiness and keeps the curls nourished. Love it!</li>
    <li> I washed my hair and conditioned and attempted a wash and go using this product. I&#x27;ve been eyeing various Design Essentials products for months and saw their products at the hair salon I go to which reminded me to try their products. I decided to go for this since I wanted a mouse styling product as opposed to gels. I applied one pump to a small section of hair (about 2 inches) and raked it through using my fingers. I let it air dry. There was barely any curl. You could only see a slight curl when you get extremely close. I could only see it when I go real close to a mirror. So, didn&#x27;t do much of anything for curl enhancing. Oh, also to note, I did not use any other product on top of it nor under it (not even a leave-in conditioner). I wanted to use it alone to truly see how it would perform. It was a disappointment for curl enhancing so I took off 2 stars. However, I will say that it did NOT leave my hair feeling sticky (like some mouse products), dry, weighed down, or hard and crunchy which is disgusting. LoL My hair was actually a little soft so that was a surprise. This product is not a repurchase for me but I will try and find other ways to use and maybe pair it with other products. I do think it&#x27;s worth a try but it&#x27;s not going to give you amazing curl definition. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for wash and gos but maybe roller sets or rod sets. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Love this product, great smell, and makes my hair wraps come out really nice. Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> For my hair... this was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t do anything significant to my hair... it just made it feel awkward.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful, smooth my frizzes on my natural hair. Will by more products soon.</li>
