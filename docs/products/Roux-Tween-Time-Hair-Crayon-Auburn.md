      <li>Also it&#x27;s a light orange, so it&#x27;s not quite bright silver</li>
      <li>This crayon is ok, but it does not cover the gray as well as another product I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to, but I could :).</li>
      <li>the auburn  color needs refreshing after a week.  </li>
      <li>, this is an outstanding value.</li>
      <li>Am so glad we were able to find it in amazon and get it with the rest of her purchase.</li>
      <li>There are better products out there.  </li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t sure about it to start with, but now she is talking about ordering more just to have them on hand in case</li>
      <li>So worth it!!</li>
      <li>and I love which is called Gray Free.  </li>
      <li>It has a very opaque, matte finish - kind of like shoe polish.  </li>
      <li>Works really well and blends nicely.  </li>
      <li>She was really happy, now she knows where to go back to buy it.</li>

      <li>Since my gray hairs are at my front hairline, I need something more natural looking.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of the much more expensive Joan Rivers product, but Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon is great in a pinch, and the price speaks for itself.</li>
      <li>I tend to have a lot of white right on top of my head and</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>Easy and quick to use, and especially considering the price</li>
      <li>It really helps in between color appointments!</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The Auburn is always first to sell out at beauty supply stores, so I&#x27;m now getting it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just dampen and &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; a bit over those first pesky grays</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been to the store looking for something, but couldn&#x27;t really find anything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m switching back to Gray Free.</li>
      <li>The tone matches up really well.</li>
      <li>I heard about this from a friend, and decided to try it without expecting much.  </li>
      <li>This stick doesn&#x27;t cover very well.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better for parts near the back of the head.</li>
      <li>You have to press down hard in the direction of the hair growth, but it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only just used it, so don&#x27;t know how it will be long term,; however, I feel it will be just fine.</li>
      <li>And my hairdressers are wild about it too.</li>
      <li>I had it on all day and it didn&#x27;t last very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying such a product!</li>
      <li>I tried rubbing it on my fingers and then just running my fingers over the hairs directly</li>
      <li>When I received this item the packaging was old, and looked like it had been opened already.  </li>
      <li>Wow, this will help save on haircolor.  </li>
      <li>I was also surprised that the &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34; color blended so well with my haircolor.  </li>
      <li>You need to wet it first, then it is a struggle to get the color on your hair.  </li>
      <li>Compared to other products, this price is very reasonable, and it lasts for some time.</li>
      <li>From my wife&#x27;s expression each time I see her looking at her hair in the mirror, I would suggest the Tween Time Hair Crayon to anyone who wants to keep that younger look between now and the next salon visit.</li>
      <li>As a prematurely gray 23 yr old who dyes her hair red, my white roots show up even ten days after colorings.</li>
      <li>I have really coarse, full hair, which usually takes well to things such as this.  </li>
      <li>I apply it daily when my hair is not completely dry.</li>
      <li>The hair crayon was dry and even when I wet it, did absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>

<li> This is a giant waxy crayon that you wet and rub on the gray hairs, but for my temples that means the skin under the hairs also turns orange -</li>
<li> But there&#x27;s no other product I&#x27;ve found where you can put the color where you need it (unlike sprays) and cover lots of territory, and if you use auburn, as I do, other products don&#x27;t come in auburn, so those other products never blend in..</li>
<li> I thought this would be a soft, creamy stick that would be easy to apply, but it is hard and difficult to work with.  </li>
<li> You have to wet it before you use it and thus, wets your hair as well.  </li>

<li> This takes that glare off the hairline and alleviates worries with&lt;br /&gt;just a little dabbing.</li>
<li> I suggest getting the crayon a little darker than your hair color, since the area closest your scalp can be darker than the ends of your hair.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because of the overall poor quality.</li>
<li> a dead give-away that it&#x27;s been colored.</li>

<li> Messy to use</li>
<li> I bought a few of these as stocking stuffers for my mom and aunt.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s been extremely helpful for emergencies, but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, nowadays (I have no idea</li>
<li> This was hard to apply and ended up being messy.</li>
<li> Way to waxy and hard to apply</li>
<li> Followed directions by wetting the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; and it remained hard and waxy.  </li>
<li> Like an old man who doesn&#x27;t realize that his aftershave has gone bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> no more roots in between color! yeah!</li>
    <li> this is excellent to fill in hair color between hair appointments.  I tend to have a lot of white right on top of my head and the auburn  color needs refreshing after a week.  I use this product after each hairwash.  I suggest getting the crayon a little darker than your hair color, since the area closest your scalp can be darker than the ends of your hair.  I like ordering it online because they never run out of the color I need, which happens when I try to buy it  in a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying and this product had really good feedback. As a prematurely gray 23 yr old who dyes her hair red, my white roots show up even ten days after colorings. This product works beautifully. I could even dye my hair black if I wanted to. I&#x27;m not going to, but I could :).</li>
    <li> Did what it was supposed to!</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with our purchase. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  My sister loved it.  I&#x27;ve used one before and now she knows how great a stick can be.</li>
    <li> I know this product.  It&#x27;s been extremely helpful for emergencies, but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores, nowadays (I have no idea why).  For anyone who thinks it&#x27;s waxy and doesn&#x27;t wash out with just water, that is true.  I have to protect my pillowcases until I wash it out.  But there&#x27;s no other product I&#x27;ve found where you can put the color where you need it (unlike sprays) and cover lots of territory, and if you use auburn, as I do, other products don&#x27;t come in auburn, so those other products never blend in..</li>
    <li> Works great for covering up the gray at my hairline in between coloring and/or coloring roots.  I apply it daily when my hair is not completely dry. You have to press down hard in the direction of the hair growth, but it works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t run and matches well with my dark auburn hair.</li>
    <li> My mother in law was looking for this product everywhere. Am so glad we were able to find it in amazon and get it with the rest of her purchase. She was really happy, now she knows where to go back to buy it.</li>
    <li> Simple solution when I am too lazy to color my hair</li>
    <li> When I received this item the packaging was old, and looked like it had been opened already.  The hair crayon was dry and even when I wet it, did absolutely nothing for my hair.  I have really coarse, full hair, which usually takes well to things such as this.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the product, or just the fact that it had been opened for so long, but I would not recommend this for the future</li>
    <li> Helped me make it through to the next time I colored my hair.</li>
    <li> I was so delighted to find this.  I&#x27;d been to the store looking for something, but couldn&#x27;t really find anything.  Then I spotted this, and knew it was what I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve only just used it, so don&#x27;t know how it will be long term,; however, I feel it will be just fine.</li>
    <li> I have used everything you can imagine to cover up my increasingly salt and pepper roots. Dying my hair every two weeks is definitely not an option. My hair is dyed auburn -- a medium shade. My mother, aunts and sister all used this -- it&#x27;s been around for years. Compared to other products, this price is very reasonable, and it lasts for some time. The Auburn is always first to sell out at beauty supply stores, so I&#x27;m now getting it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of the much more expensive Joan Rivers product, but Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon is great in a pinch, and the price speaks for itself. Very highly recommended. Follow directions and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works really well and blends nicely.  I am very happy with this and told my hair dresser about it, too.  I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> This gave terrible coverage, but the worst thing about it was the horrible, horrible smell. Like an old man who doesn&#x27;t realize that his aftershave has gone bad. Truly disgusting and depressing. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these as stocking stuffers for my mom and aunt.  They were a little skeptical about it but after trying it they are believers.  Wow, this will help save on haircolor.  Thanks for carrying such a product!</li>
    <li> Luv this product. It really helps in between color appointments!</li>
    <li> color does not blend well. Messy to use</li>
    <li> I heard about this from a friend, and decided to try it without expecting much.  It works great!  I was also surprised that the &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34; color blended so well with my haircolor.  Easy and quick to use, and especially considering the price, this is an outstanding value.</li>
    <li> A friend of ours suggested this product when she heard my wife complaining about the silver edges around her temples and forehead.  I decided to surprise her and order the Time Hair Crayon.  I didn&#x27;t really know what color to get or if it would work, but I made a pretty good guess.  She wasn&#x27;t sure about it to start with, but now she is talking about ordering more just to have them on hand in case she misplaces the one I got her.  From my wife&#x27;s expression each time I see her looking at her hair in the mirror, I would suggest the Tween Time Hair Crayon to anyone who wants to keep that younger look between now and the next salon visit.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. It really works and is easy to use. Just follow the directions and add some water and its a great temporary fix!!!</li>
    <li> Not that great. Like putting waxy crayon on your hair . Wish I had not purchased it!</li>
    <li> I have to press too hard and go over the same are repeatedly to get the color to cover my grey.</li>
    <li> This will do the job, but I would recommend ColorMark Gray Roots Gone over this product. This was hard to apply and ended up being messy. I had it on all day and it didn&#x27;t last very well.</li>
    <li> Way to waxy and hard to apply</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This stick doesn&#x27;t cover very well.  I thought this would be a soft, creamy stick that would be easy to apply, but it is hard and difficult to work with.  You need to wet it first, then it is a struggle to get the color on your hair.  You need to press very hard; it hurts your hair.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the color does get on your hair so I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  There are better products out there.  Try the ones that come in a tube with a wand. There are a few different brands of the liquid type on Amazon.  Buy those instead, they are all good.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m starting to have silver hair at my temples, which drives me crazy. They are very thin hairs. This is a giant waxy crayon that you wet and rub on the gray hairs, but for my temples that means the skin under the hairs also turns orange - a dead give-away that it&#x27;s been colored. Also it&#x27;s a light orange, so it&#x27;s not quite bright silver but it definitely doesn&#x27;t math my auburn hair. I tried rubbing it on my fingers and then just running my fingers over the hairs directly but it didn&#x27;t cover the silver at all that way. So this is not for me. Maybe it&#x27;s better for parts near the back of the head.</li>
    <li> A solution to covering up grays between hair colorings. If you can use a crayon, you can use this product! You do have to activate the crayon by wetting the tip before applying it to your hair, however. So far I am satisfied with the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just dampen and &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; a bit over those first pesky grays and you are good to go!  The tone matches up really well.</li>
    <li> This product is messy - you wouldn&#x27;t think so being in a stick form and all...  It also looks very fake. It has a very opaque, matte finish - kind of like shoe polish.  Since my gray hairs are at my front hairline, I need something more natural looking. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because of the overall poor quality.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff.  Never comes off on the pillow and gives great coverage.  I can&#x27;t live without it.  And my hairdressers are wild about it too.</li>
    <li> This crayon is ok, but it does not cover the gray as well as another product I&#x27;ve used and I love which is called Gray Free.  I have auburn hair and it&#x27;s very hard to match the color during that in between time where your roots start to show.  You have to wet it before you use it and thus, wets your hair as well.  I&#x27;m switching back to Gray Free.</li>
    <li> Good product. Not as messy as some other touchpad I have used. Also considerably less expensive. A win win situation.</li>
    <li> Followed directions by wetting the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; and it remained hard and waxy.  Didn&#x27;t seem to transfer any color to my roots.  Very disappointed.  If you are looking for a quick root fix try the Style Edit Conceal Spray.</li>
    <li> The color stick does not color!  You could rub it on your scalp till your scalp is sore, but it won&#x27;t leave any color.</li>
    <li> The description says it&#x27;s a crayon and it is! I ignored that part. It is weird trying to color your hair with a crayon. It&#x27;s waxy. I just gave up.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic!! Use while your hair is damp&lt;br /&gt;Matches color perfect :) would recommend it for in between colors&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it leaves your hair cruncy and waxy.</li>
    <li> Works good! My wife like it</li>
    <li> Such a deal!! How could anyone complain? This takes that glare off the hairline and alleviates worries with&lt;br /&gt;just a little dabbing. The price is excellent. Wish I had found this 20 years ago. I hate being a slave to dying&lt;br /&gt;this hair. Plus you can cut back on how often you have to apply color. So worth it!!</li>
