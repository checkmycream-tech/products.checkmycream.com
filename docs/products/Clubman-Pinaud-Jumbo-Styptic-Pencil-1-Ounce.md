    <li> Wish I had this since the 1st day I started shaving. Cuts from shaving are no longer a hassle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s styptic pencil. Does what it should.</li>
    <li> This Pencil is not flexable so if you drop it you break it. However, save any pieces you&#x27;ve broken because this pencil is multi purpose. Not only have the blood stains from my husbands towels disappeared after shaving, I&#x27;ve been using the pieces I broke off to treat my pimples with great success.  I only like it because I broke it. I love it because it works.</li>
