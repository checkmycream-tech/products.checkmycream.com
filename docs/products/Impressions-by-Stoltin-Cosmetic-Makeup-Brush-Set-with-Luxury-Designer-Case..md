    <li> Product shipped well, the box was a wee bit damaged.. but the goods inside were fine.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the case these brushes are in.. very unique.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes them self are very soft and they work well! I was blending like a pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didn&#x27;t really like was that one of the brushes shed just a bit.. about 7 bristles&lt;br /&gt;came out but stopped after that.. so no biggie really.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this set for me, so I will write the review since I&#x27;m the end user!  I am very impressed with the quality of the Impressions by Stoltin makeup brush set.  From the packaging, storage case and the brushes, everything is top notch.  I recommend this brush set and will buy again from Stoltin.  - Nicole B.</li>
    <li> i love the case and the brushes.  The y are really good the hair doesn&#x27;t fall of and they blend really good.</li>
    <li> High quality brushes and storage case.  Bristles are soft but durable.  They do not shed.  They hold the makeup.  Comes in a very nice white leather-like case.  The top snaps off.  Not shown in the pictures, but when the top is on it is really sleek looking.  Ideal for personal use and as an attractive gift.  I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My brush came today and I find this one so amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and the brush is actually soft and thick!</li>
    <li> Great kit! The makeup brush set came super fast and the seller was super helpful. Really nice packaging and even better carrying case. The brushes are quality material and work really well. The little explanations on the box describe perfectly what each brush is for and how to best use it. These are going to be the perfect gift set for friends :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging, comes in the very durable white cylinder case pictured. The brushes are perfect travel size and nice quality bristles. My only wish is that it came with a larger eyeshadow shading brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are high quality!! I bought this when it had a limited time prime sale and I&#x27;m so glad I did. The brush case/holder is going to be very handy during travel. These makeup brushes are extremely well made, and I&#x27;m glad it provides the basics. The hairs are soft to the touch, and gentle on the face. Definitely recommend this for beginners, professional makeup artists...pretty much anyone who is into makeup!</li>
    <li> Very fine brush! Good gift to someone.</li>
    <li> Great brush set!! The color is amazing. Theres been no loosing of the brush hairs. They feel very silky smooth and don’t leave streaks or soak up too much foundation. Easy to clean and haven’t lost any hairs during the cleaning process either. The angled brush is a must and  the way this one glides makes it easy to use even for not so great makeup appliers like myself. Its in a cute case that offer the brushes protection and make it easy to pack and take with you anywhere. Great!</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I ordered three of these brush sets. We love the container that comes with it. All of the brushes that came with it are of great quality. My favorite brush it the kit is the angles eye liner brush that I use for my eyebrows. It works great for eyebrows as well as eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great quality makeup brushes, no streaking or broken bristles, great price! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes and adorable case. Love it!</li>
    <li> This set came with me to Florida for vacation . I think the case made all the difference because I used it to also houses the brushes once I got there and it prevented the bristles from getting all crunched from packing. The brushes included are decent quality and are all you need if you aren&#x27;t a obsessed make up geek like me. I did need to take some additional brushes but there was plenty of room in the case to add those without squishing anything .</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. The packaged just came in and she immediately opened it up. Judging by the looks, its really high quality. It comes in this white leather like case and the brushes feel high quality. I can see this a being a great gift for anyone who loves makeup. Im glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> The bristles are super soft, and the carrying case is perfect for taking with me to the gym or on vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this item at a promotional discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel great! The thin brush may be thin enough to use for gel eye liner. They come in a fancy hard case. I love them</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick! I absolutely love this product! The case is beautiful and a plus! Totally worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a avid makeup brush collector... Who am I kidding... I&#x27;m a makeup brush hoarder! This set is super cute and comes in a really nice white case. The brushes itself are very well made and I even pulled on them to test fall out and it passed! Will be using this set to travel with to work from here on out! Note: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Very bad product would not buy it again</li>
    <li> I got my order really fast. The brush is soft and high quality. The hair does not fall out like other brushes. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these new make up brushes  thank you for the super quick shipping as well. Love the case they come in too. So cute.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles&lt;br /&gt;Cute box/case(cheap and dirty)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Some of the brushes had been damaged, the bristles were folded and split.(took a while but I managed to kinda fix them)&lt;br /&gt;The case is glued together.&lt;br /&gt;As cute as the case is, it&#x27;s cheap, poorly made and the thread was gross(dark on one side)</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. :)</li>
    <li> Love them!!! Can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes. Everything from the container, to the brushes themselves is perfect. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Case came broken. Brushes are very soft. Love the blending brush. Eyeshadow brush is very small. Overall good set.</li>
    <li> These are great! No shedding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received these for a promotional price in exchange for my honest review**</li>
    <li> Really amazing product, especially for the price! I needed a good set of brushes, and these work great! The case also looks very nice and professional. Very happy with my purchase! 😊</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes!  The bristles are really soft! Ans the best part is the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality! So happy with this!</li>
    <li> When I received the Impressions by Stoltin makeup brush set, I was excited to try them out! I was impressed with the quality of the brushes; they didn’t shed which is a big factor when looking for new brushes. They have nice feeling handles that are a pearly white. In the set you have enough brushes to complete your full face with a nice white case that you could use for travel or just store the brushes. The 5 brushes included are: Powder/Blush Brush, Foundation Brush, Eye Shadow Brush, Angled Liner Brush, and Lip Brush. I will shop again with Stoltin to purchase more sets, they would make a great gift for your makeup loving friends and family. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> I like the nice case that comes with the brushes for travel and storage. The brushes are nice and soft. The brush for my face powder works well and I really like the slanted brush for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these for my mother in law and figured I&#x27;d get one just in case I ever needed it for a gift. When they came I opened one just too see them. It&#x27;s a BEAUTIFUL set! The case is perfect for your brushes when you travel too. Now, I have horribly sensitive skin and have to use super good &amp; ridiculously expensive brushes or else my skin gets so irritated. I was feeling brave so I decided I&#x27;d keep the extra set &amp; tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;IN. LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are so soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, and had a flawless application. The angled brush was amazing with cream eyeliner. I am so happy I decided to get an extra set &amp; can&#x27;t wait to give my mother in law hers!</li>
    <li> Took under a month for all the brushes to fall apart. The liner brush left fibers in my eye. The smell like chemicals even after cleansing. I gave them to my son to paint with.</li>
