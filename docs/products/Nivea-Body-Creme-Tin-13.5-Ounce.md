      <li>I love it especially in winters.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s pretty much what this spreads and feels like..</li>
      <li>In UK, symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face.</li>
      <li>I love this creme for my dry hands and feet.</li>

      <li>I will keep buying this since it does a much better job on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>stuff is really thick, but it rubs in well, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is a large container.</li>
      <li>Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by MI chemical.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the floral smell</li>
      <li>Take care with how much you use -</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is exactly what it is supposed to be</li>
    <li> This is the best creme on the planet. They even did a study that showed Nivea Creme worked better than $100+ creams in the market. Nivea beat all other expensive brands hands down!</li>
    <li> Thick and fatty, but great for your skin. I put it every night and morning and my skin soaks up all that fat. Not for hands while working though, but otherwise I would recommend this tub of a lotion!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> This tin is HUGE! Like you can just get your thumb and fingers around the edges to pick it up. It works great. It does smell like Noxema, but doesn&#x27;t burn my super sensitive face. My skin is ultra dry, and I put this on after shower and let it set for a while, rub it in again and good to go. Great price, great product. No more need for expensive face creams!</li>
    <li> Glad I found this again after all these years. Love the tin and the light scent. Nice and thick for dealing with &#x27;winter feet&#x27; and legs. I use this right after my shower and am pleased they have not changed the formula after all these years. My mother and grandmother swore by this product. Now I do too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the other feedbacks saying it&#x27;s made in Germany.. I was trying to get a hold of the original German Nivea, because the stuff made in Mexico just isn&#x27;t the same.. What I got was made in Mexico.. Dang!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the same scent and it isn&#x27;t as creamy as the German kind.. It feels kind of like Crisco! I&#x27;m very disappointed. The description does not state it&#x27;s made in Germany, so I can&#x27;t fault Amazon for that.. I was hoping it was German made based on what other customers received..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it to remove makeup, but picture using Crisco solid and try rubbing that on your legs and arms.. That&#x27;s pretty much what this spreads and feels like.. It leaves my skin feeling very greasy and that great Nivea scent is so faint, I can&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes..</li>
    <li> These are from Mexico. Difference I notice (as opposed to German origin) is if your hands are damp, the product will not spread as easily. Would have given 5 stars if it had been German origin.</li>
    <li> Great for hands after gardening.</li>
    <li> Love love love this.  Way better value than buying it at a drug store.  I have one next to my bed and one at work.  Best hand creme</li>
    <li> Thick and creamy moisture! Love it. Will never look for anything else!</li>
    <li> Great deal for a great price</li>
    <li> I like this much better than the Oil of Olay that I have been using.  I received the product made in Mexico and I don&#x27;t really like the smell but it seems to go away after it is on your skin for awhile.  I will keep buying this since it does a much better job on my dry skin. After reading the other reviews, I would like to try the Germany product.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Nivea Cream. This tub of Nivea is a really good deal. They must still use the same ingredients as 40 years ago. What a good lotion</li>
    <li> Too many chemical methy what?</li>
    <li> I love this creme for my dry hands and feet. This thick, rich creme works great on dry rough hands and callouses on feet.  I use it at night because I am constantly washing my hands during the day.  It has all night to soak up the oils and richness.  My hands feel soft the next morning. I like the scent too .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for close to a year now, and it&#x27;s become my go-to lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great lotion - I suffer from really, really dry skin. Not only does this moisturize, it also does a good job of protecting the skin from drying out after. With more fluid products, I usually have the problem that within five minutes my skin is as dry as ever. I&#x27;m also have nasty reactions to a lot of stuff - I get burning reactions to a lot of products, and even hives sometimes - I have really, really sensitive skin in that regard. Nivea Creme is one of the only things I&#x27;ll use on my face, which is the most sensitive. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really thick, but it rubs in well, and has a pleasant smell. Take care with how much you use - it&#x27;s easy to use too much and end up with a tacky layer on the skin. If you keep rubbing it in, the tackiness goes away. I use only little dabs on my face. For my feet, I use a lot more. This stuff is great if you have thick, dry soles, because once it&#x27;s absorbed, it will also protect it. Way more effective than GoldBond, at least for me. I recommend experimenting with the amount and frequency of use - this is different from the typical, watery lotion.</li>
    <li> Nivea creme in the tin is a thick, white emulsion (water w/oils). I just started using it this past week on my face and hands. The cream feels really fresh on my skin. I don&#x27;t really care for the floral smell but it does not irritate my skin at all. So I put some on during my lunch break today and later on when I walked past my coworker, she asked if I touched up my makeup! She said my face looked really fresh! Nope, didn&#x27;t put any more makeup on! So I am happy to report this is the first compliment on my face/skin since who knows when! I also love using Nivea on my cuticles and hands. I keep a small tin on my bedside table and another in my purse. Now that I know how well it works I am definitely going to &amp;#34;super-size&amp;#34; up to the larger tin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, doesnt seem to be greasy and works well for my skin. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The tin is a bit of nostalgic marketing - nice touch!  The scent of Nivea has changed over the years, but the quality feels the same.  This is really, really great stuff for dry &amp; cracked winter skin on hands, feet, and anywhere else you need it.</li>
    <li> This item came really quickly! It&#x27;s exactly the product and size I need. However, I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars because the actual container is a different shape, which is a bit strange, and the lid was secured with tape which was a bit odd to see (perhaps it was to make sure it stayed closed during shipping, but it was still a surprise for me). Happy with purchase and would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a huge tin of thick, creamy, Nivea, and the scent is wonderful, the clean, powdery scent I love. This has made me a convert from the lotion because the creme obliterates dry skin and leaves it smoothe and gleaming. Grade: A+</li>
    <li> We love Nivea when it comes to body creams, just another great product. This product is thicker than the pump version and leaves hands less watery.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  The smell od Nivea has always been a favorite of mine.  The tin is huge!! Great deal for what I paid!!!</li>
    <li> love smell and moisture.</li>
    <li> Well, I guess this is the Mx version. Does seem a tad different, but can&#x27;t quite say how--the smell isn&#x27;t what I remember, but it seems OK and seems to work well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is Amazon&#x27;s very poor packaging. They sent the first tin in a padded envelop and the tin was crushed (go figure). Then they shipped a replacement tin in a large box, with another item, and very little packing material, so the tin could bounce around and, as anyone can guess, the top came off and there was Nivea Creme all over the box. Amazon reimbursed me, of course (their customer support is great), but golly, their shipping department could use some training.</li>
    <li> I remember my mother used this more than 20 years ago. It&#x27;s still the same. We have a Nivea jar with us at all times. I love it especially in winters. It&#x27;s also great as a foot cream in summers if you are spending a lot of time in water. I keep trying out different creams/ lotions and then keep coming back to Nivea. LOL. It&#x27;s like a weird pattern now as Nivea never disappoints. Old is gold after all.. 😉</li>
    <li> Large can of Nivea cream handy in the bathroom. Many may not know it but a lot of Germans use this cream on their babys for diaper rash. I discovered that fact when I lived in Germany for 6 years.  (Nivea is a German brand) I also use it after I use the bathroom to help with irritation especially in the summertime. Let&#x27;s face it we women who wear pads  either for our periods or incontinence find we will get irrited in those areas and like me can develop a rash. Nivea cream helps me a lot to keep that irritation down to a minimum. If your life is a bit more sedentary as you have become older or you spend a lot of time sitting (i.e on the computer) your bottom will tend to become more sensitive -- the cream helps to relief that. Nivea cream in a can comes in all sizes. I also carry a small can in my purse for those times when I am out or traveling. And of course  this creme is good for all ages and not only on your bottom!</li>
    <li> While I ordered this for my mother, and its a wonderful product, the packaging was terrible.  It appeared almost opened and one of the Nivea tins was dented in at least TWO places.  Complaint was put into Amazon and they are replacing the one tin that was damaged.  Amazon is great when it comes to these types of issues.  Thank you for the understanding and the quick response to this issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this to have some childhood memories in sight. Honest, I haven&#x27;t used it much. But the blue box simply looks really nice.</li>
    <li> I always liked Nivea. It is affordable and a good product. I&#x27;ve been using many other name brands but in the past this always helped me a lot with those extra dry rough spots. It&#x27;s been around forever it seems.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea Creme for years. Recently I have stopped liking the fragrance. Whether this is just me, or as others have said in their reviews, the creme made in Mexico has a different fragrance? Either way I&#x27;m not buying it any more.</li>
    <li> Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics trade association, has told its members to remove MI from products that are left on the skin after explosion in cases of allergic reactions and eczema. Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT), is routinely added to moisturizers, sun creams, shampoos and wet wipes. Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by MI chemical. In UK, symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face. It is not important where any cream is made; any cream with Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT) is not an EU cream. Now read the last ingredient of this cream... Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
    <li> My mom used this on me as a child and I don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it. This winter has been brutal and this was my skins savior. I recommend this to anyone who needs deep moisturizer. It also last all day long. PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I love love love Nivea.  This tin can container is a b!#@% to open.  Do yourself a favor and buy a normal plastic container.</li>
    <li> I got the made in Mexico version. Darn. Too bad I ordered two... I love Nivea, but I was hoping to receive the made in Thailand version as I have previously.</li>
    <li> this 1 i use for face cream. i grew up with nivea and still like after 50 years</li>
    <li> Love nivea creme.  Buying it in bulk because it&#x27;s cheaper. No different than the smaller plastic models.</li>
    <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
    <li> 1. It works. I grew up using it during harsh winters of Soviet Union. It heals and the thick coat protects skin by providing a skin barrier.. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. When nothing else works, this does.&lt;br /&gt;2. People that warn others about dangers of Nivea ingredients. I appreciate the warning. However, this has been used for generations. I don&#x27;t think we should worry about it :-)&lt;br /&gt;P.S I am lucky I can stock up in German airport when I fly, I love Nivea in metal jar :-)</li>
    <li> really nice product.  I am now loyal to Nivea!</li>
    <li> Lovely, lovely, lovely. Thick and rich but not so thick you can&#x27;t spread it. Not the thick consistency of body butter, just a nice soft pleasant smelling cream.  The tin is sort of a nice treat, looks good on a counter in the bathroom.  Seems to last a long time too. My legs are happy to get this as a treat.  And just for kicks, I put some in another smaller tin and added some essential oils (peppermint, lavendar, and orange) to rub on my aching calves at night.  Blended in well and feels SO good.</li>
    <li> A good product for a reasonable price. The tin was a little bit damaged when I got it though.</li>
    <li> Oh so good! This is serious moisturizing that cost more than lotion and it should. It will rehydrate extremely dry skin completely better than most logos and for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Good stuff,  too pricey.  You can buy mini versions of this for .99 cents. Produces same results as bath and body works.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on a name!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazingly moisturizing. I use it on my face and my hands during the cold winter months here in New England. It is very thick and creamy and a little goes a long way. This tin last the whole winter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It came immediately and the price was very good.  I like the fact that it is a large container.</li>
    <li> Really Nice, Buy for my mother and she recommended to buy this with having having good quality experience. really Big one and she told that will enough for 2 years !</li>
    <li> thanks you really did good job good product ....thanks</li>
    <li> It is a little thick but works great.  Smell is ok and it hydrates my skin fine.</li>
