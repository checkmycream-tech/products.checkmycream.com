      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>but it works great.  </li>
      <li>It is not the very nice rotary motor clipper your stylist/barber uses, but it is still a pleasure to use.  </li>
      <li>Very happy, the camo motif is cool too!</li>
      <li>Still a good price for the quality of the product.</li>

      <li>5 or 6 buys a good one.</li>
      <li>It was on sale for a good price</li>
      <li>Now the clippers have a very good strong feel to them</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this item.</li>
      <li>Love the camo!</li>
      <li>They work great and are easy to use.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t come in a nice case.</li>
      <li>Oster makes really nice stuff.</li>
      <li>An absolute perfect beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>However, if you cut your own hair, you probably want this model.</li>
      <li>The camo makes good clippers look cheap.</li>
      <li>The camo design is original and has a good weight.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and hasnt over heated on my head.  </li>
      <li>Very light compare to the andis masters.</li>
      <li>This pivot-motor clipper is a refreshing step up from the cheapo magnetic \\&quot;mower\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Even though most electronics has a bit of tolerance for this, it still takes a toll on the equipment over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it was better than the Wahl clipper I was replacing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Power....our power is a bit more unstable over here, with it not always being 120 volts, or 60 hz on the dot.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to get the Operation Homefront version.</li>
      <li>This one is the best in quality &amp; power of such a form factor.</li>
      <li>I know you can buy more blades</li>
      <li>People love shiny chrome, why not that?</li>
      <li>There was nothing more to buy.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for a better set.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with these clippers.</li>
      <li>They are so much better than anything I&#x27;ve found in the department stores there</li>
      <li>This one is quiet compared to that one and it does an excellent job..</li>
      <li>The motor seems quality and works well but is louder (even after adjustments) than others I have owned and overall wansn&#x27;t impressed with the quality.</li>
      <li>Awesome as a secondary when your go-to clipper gets hot or the weight starts to get to you, or solely as a fading clipper as that is, in my opinion, what&#x27;s best about this product; cuts very clean.</li>
      <li>Right out of the box these clippers are far and away the best</li>
      <li>Fortunately, there&#x27;s a lot more to clippers than the way they look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Harsh conditions are as such....extra fine dirt over here has entered every nook and cranny that it could.  </li>
      <li>But fine dust and sand always get in to the clippers by the blades.  </li>
      <li>If you want that (i.e. to use for shaving) then fine.</li>
      <li>I suppose it would work fine for haircuts</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re just going to buy a little Army toiletry bag for it, which will be perfect.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to handle and clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to purchase a clipper based on one&#x27;s needs.</li>
      <li>The attachments are a bit flimsy but overall it&#x27;s a great shaver and buying this</li>
      <li>If you go cheap with an underpowered motor that pulls hair as often as it cuts it you&#x27;ll kick yourself.    </li>
      <li>(Think a light hum vs. a chainsaw.)</li>
      <li>The Wahl are getting louder as the years go by and one of my sons hates the sound (I don&#x27;t care for it either).</li>
      <li>Unless you know what you&#x27;re getting (and have a smooth head) don&#x27;t get a \\&quot;balding\\&quot; clipper like this [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>i did check out this clipper from Oster&#x27;s own website and this fast feed</li>
      <li>2 or 3 haircuts buys a cheap one.</li>
      <li>The construction is solid, and blades cut very effective and effecient.</li>
      <li>I was absolutely excited to get it in the mail...</li>
      <li>Each cut is clean and the guards don&#x27;t leave unsightly tracks.</li>
      <li>Keep your blades oiled and clippers clean, and this should pay for itself before you know it.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t cut very close and don&#x27;t come with many attachments or any angled attachments.  </li>
      <li>(A+ on that too, cuts at a spec&#x27;d #000 (really closer, more like #0000).     </li>
      <li>• Cuts the hair really well, probably better than my decade</li>
      <li>other than that they are absolutly great.</li>
      <li>Also a consideration for most is that a Classic 76 would be twice the price.</li>
      <li>I am sure these clippers are going through much more abuse than someone back in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, for the professional barber, I don&#x27;t recommend these as a primary clipper as they aren&#x27;t especially powerful and won&#x27;t be able to stand 20-30 cuts a day for very long.</li>
      <li>They are very fluid and cut amazingly.  </li>
      <li>Worth the value.</li>
      <li>I am pleased so far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably my favorite to use, and a perfect complement to my Andis Improved Master for all around cutting and fading.</li>
      <li>Well made well worth shaver.</li>
      <li>We just clean them alot more then what we would normally do back in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, this is a Camo edition of a top clipper: Oster Professional [</li>
      <li>Having a camo clipper is kind of strange</li>
      <li>They seem heavy duty and will last a while, perfect for the home barber who cuts the hair of the men in her family.    </li>
      <li>Yes, you will have to make an occasional second pass to get some stray hairs, but that&#x27;s true of any clipper and these are as good as it gets.    </li>
      <li>Not sharp enough for a good close trim but overall ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple, I do my research and if the product meets my requirements and my satisfaction, I rate appropriately.  </li>
      <li>Most of us start with a model bought at a box store or beauty supply that looks very similar in form to this one.</li>
      <li>The adjustable blade allows you to set the legnth exactly where you want it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is supporting Operation Homefront.</li>
      <li>The longest is 1/2&amp;#34;, and that is just too short of a haircut on top of my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s heads.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would have just bought this one first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Whal clipper before and several cheaper brands and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with any of them.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very light compared to other professional clippers while performing an equal, or better, job than most of them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this star is for manufucturer cause they have to put the voltage adaptar for 220.it burned in a minute.I&#x27;ve changed motor. what a pitty.</li>
    <li> This pivot-motor clipper is a refreshing step up from the cheapo magnetic \\&quot;mower\\&quot; I used for years to cut my son&#x27;s hair at home.  It is not the very nice rotary motor clipper your stylist/barber uses, but it is still a pleasure to use.  Doesn&#x27;t leave that buzz in the hand at the end from the vibrations the magnetic motors give, and doesn&#x27;t burn the scalp or hand.</li>
    <li> Only had a month but I use them weekly.  Really quiet for how close they cut.  The 000 blade is great if u like a nice close cut.  Can&#x27;t ask for a better set.    I&#x27;m not sure if you like a close cut, but would be tempted to buy a 0000000 if they have the blade for it.</li>
    <li> A few bucks cheaper than the plain version. Having a camo clipper is kind of strange but it works great.  An absolute perfect beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for cutting hair at different lenghts due to the adjustable blade. The blade is wide and cuts more hair in a shorter time period. The camo design is original and has a good weight. I recomend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Purchased this clipper due to the price.donation made via my purchase and the item qualifying for a free delivery at that time.    Due to a medical condition my hair was coming out by the handfuLLs.so MY decision was to simply return to my roots....literally- as having had what was once called a teeny weeny natural ! LOL.    And then learning how to skillfully manage a clipper which was accomplished by playing around with the \\&quot;guards\\&quot; for various lengths or \\&quot;\\&quot;degrees\\&quot;\\&quot; of bUzzing.    of course this IS NOT for everyone but you do get to the point where you stop fighting \\&quot;nature\\&quot; and go with the flow and I&#x27;m grateful this look IS classic and works.    P.S. i did check out this clipper from Oster&#x27;s own website and this fast feed IS the best motor etc---not a toy.</li>
    <li> After buying a couple of \\&quot;professional\\&quot; clippers from Conair and Wahl at stores like Target and Walmart, I was fed up.  The motors wore out, the products did not hold up like I expected them to with a description of \\&quot;Professional.\\&quot;  These Oster clippers actually have some heft, and the motor sounds powerful compared to my previous clippers.  The blades run at a speed that cut through hair well.  I am pleased so far.  They seem heavy duty and will last a while, perfect for the home barber who cuts the hair of the men in her family.    One last note:  There is only one clipper in this set with 6 accessories (guard combs, oil, and brush).  The amazon listing advertises this product as a \\&quot;7 pack.\\&quot;  You will not get 7 clippers, just 7 pieces in the box.  Still a good price for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of these clippers to take overseas while deployed.  I am sure these clippers are going through much more abuse than someone back in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harsh conditions are as such....extra fine dirt over here has entered every nook and cranny that it could.  Now the clippers have a very good strong feel to them and I feel the motor housing case has not been compromised at all.  But fine dust and sand always get in to the clippers by the blades.  We just clean them alot more then what we would normally do back in the states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power....our power is a bit more unstable over here, with it not always being 120 volts, or 60 hz on the dot.  Even though most electronics has a bit of tolerance for this, it still takes a toll on the equipment over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the two above mentioned items these clippers have preformed very well.  I have had alot more expensive clippers over the past few years and yes some were alot better, but these preformed just fine and were durable.  Like any set of clippers keeping the blades sharp are key and they will most likely need to be sharpened after the deployment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right and I am not disappointed one bit in these clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s important to purchase a clipper based on one&#x27;s needs. Cheap clippers are never a good solution, however.     With that said, I give this clipper 5 stars. Quality, nice weight, cuts great. And a great price. 130 dollars elsewhere. I was glad to get the Operation Homefront version. Quiet and very little vibration. I was absolutely excited to get it in the mail...like a little kid at Christmas (but without the ADD and abusive behavior toward the product :) )    Oster makes really nice stuff. I have a Oster Turbo A5 two speed I use on my three dogs. Absolutely Great.     Would buy again. Does exactly what I want. I buzzcut my head without any guards. I open it up all the way and it&#x27;s the perfect length. Close it up and it gets close.  I use it in conjunction with my Panasonic ER121 Trimmer (A+ on that too, cuts at a spec&#x27;d #000 (really closer, more like #0000).     Amazon and UPS came through, as well.</li>
    <li> This clipper is about the best you can get for fading hair. It&#x27;s also very light compared to other professional clippers while performing an equal, or better, job than most of them. Home users cannot go wrong with these. However, for the professional barber, I don&#x27;t recommend these as a primary clipper as they aren&#x27;t especially powerful and won&#x27;t be able to stand 20-30 cuts a day for very long. Awesome as a secondary when your go-to clipper gets hot or the weight starts to get to you, or solely as a fading clipper as that is, in my opinion, what&#x27;s best about this product; cuts very clean. Definitely recommend this clipper. It&#x27;s probably my favorite to use, and a perfect complement to my Andis Improved Master for all around cutting and fading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with these clippers. I&#x27;ve owned a Whal clipper before and several cheaper brands and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with any of them. I wish I would have just bought this one first. It&#x27;s the only clipper you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many drug-store shelf clippers in the past 11 years.  I got tired of clippers that quickly got dull or couldn&#x27;t handle my hair, and \\&quot;splurged\\&quot; on these.  They held up great for the past year, cutting my own hair and my son&#x27;s.  They fell off a shelf and hit a tile floor tonight, shattering the housing, and I am buying another set of clippers.      I think buying another is one of the highest endorsements a consumer can make.  I don&#x27;t think anyone who cuts hair at home will be disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several crappy $25 conair clippers from Walmart. You can&#x27;t even get replacement blades for them, so this time I spent twice the $ and got more than twice the quality in this Oster. Very happy, the camo motif is cool too!</li>
    <li> The clippers work well but for the price I expected a whole lot more.  They don&#x27;t cut very close and don&#x27;t come with many attachments or any angled attachments.  I know you can buy more blades but this particular model doesn&#x27;t have a lot of accessories.  The motor seems quality and works well but is louder (even after adjustments) than others I have owned and overall wansn&#x27;t impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Immediately I could tell by the weight and material it was better than the Wahl clipper I was replacing.  The Wahl product broke, blades were dull, and I decided this Oster clipper was worth the extra money.  The price difference will pay for itself quickly, and this will outlast most other brands, making it cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> awesome clippers. the only problem that i am having with them is the blade keeps loosening up after about every other haircut. other than that they are absolutly great.</li>
    <li> I was criticized for rating the products that I buy from Amazon fairly high (umm... stalker much?). It&#x27;s simple, I do my research and if the product meets my requirements and my satisfaction, I rate appropriately.  This Oster does just that.  I had to replace a Conair crappy set of clippers for use here in Afghanistan. I was heading towards Wahl (I have a good 12yr old 2000 that I probably spent too much for), but I kept seeing \\&quot;It&#x27;s no Oster\\&quot;. This set is a fair priced set of clippers. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is supporting Operation Homefront. My guys and I are benefiting from the purchases. The clippers are sharp. The weight and feel means solid construction. Where is used to take 15-20min to cut my hair, now takes no more that 5-10.</li>
    <li> 3 years and no complains, I have save a lot of money using this trimmer. My only complains (as far I know), it is not possible to exchange  its trimmer blade for a smaller one.</li>
    <li> As a military service member barber , these are a must have. Not only are they smoothe but they blend nice!! Best part is the weight!! Very light compare to the andis masters. Love the camo! I always get compliments on my fast feeds.</li>
    <li> I gave my husband a couple Army regulation haircuts with these clippers.  They are very fluid and cut amazingly.  It was not too hard blending different hair lengths for his usual medium fade (I looked up a military haircut tutorial online). The motor is NOT &amp;#34;whisper quiet&amp;#34; as the description states (in my opinion), but these are my first clippers, so maybe they&#x27;re considered quiet compared to other clippers.  I don&#x27;t know.  They&#x27;re not loud, just a medium non-annoying hum.  They&#x27;re easy to handle and clean.  My only complaint is that I wish it came with more sizes of length attachments.  The longest is 1/2&amp;#34;, and that is just too short of a haircut on top of my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s heads.  I wish it came with a 1&amp;#34;, 1-1/2&amp;#34; and even a 2&amp;#34;.  But, I think these sizes can be purchased separately.  There is no case.  I don&#x27;t know if other clippers come with one, but this one just has the styrofoam thing that slides out of the box.  There&#x27;s a little cleaning brush and oil.  We&#x27;re just going to buy a little Army toiletry bag for it, which will be perfect.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this is an excellent shaver for the money I paid..My husband had an Oster that he paid much more money for at a beauty supply store and it basically fell apart after a few years ..This one is quiet compared to that one and it does an excellent job..The attachments are a bit flimsy but overall it&#x27;s a great shaver and buying this also helps the military by Osters donation to Operation Homefront with every purchase</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail today and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was considering the Oster Classic 76 clippers but decided to go with these instead since they were about half the price and had an adjustable blade. They are so much better than anything I&#x27;ve found in the department stores there really is no comparison. The construction is solid and operation is very quiet and powerful. The pivot motor really makes the difference. I would highly recommend these to anyone considering cutting hair at home. Five stars and thanks for reading my review.</li>
    <li> They work great and are easy to use. The adjustable blade allows you to set the legnth exactly where you want it.</li>
    <li> First, this is a Camo edition of a top clipper: Oster Professional [[ASIN:B0012IXV7S OSTER Fast Feed Clipper (Model #76023-510)]]. (The standard version has 183 reviews and 4.5 stars as of this writing 5/3/11). Search for that model and read some of those reviews if this review doesn&#x27;t tell you enough. I went with the ugly camo version because it was eligible for prime shipping and the normal red one wasn&#x27;t.    Most of us start with a model bought at a box store or beauty supply that looks very similar in form to this one. They break or dull or whatever after a year or two. Fortunately, there&#x27;s a lot more to clippers than the way they look. This one is the best in quality &amp; power of such a form factor. No coincidence it&#x27;s the most expensive too.    To get a \\&quot;better\\&quot; clipper, you would need to get an \\&quot;OSTER Classic 76\\&quot; [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]], the gold standard for barbers and also available here on Amazon. If you cut other people&#x27;s hair, you probably want the 76. However, if you cut your own hair, you probably want this model. Why? Balance and noise. The 76 is heavier and weighted towards the back making cutting your own hair a little more difficult balance-wise. It&#x27;s also MUCH louder. (Think a light hum vs. a chainsaw.) Also a consideration for most is that a Classic 76 would be twice the price. If you just want the raw horsepower or need to give 20 haircuts a day and don&#x27;t mind the noise, you can certainly cut your own hair with a 76... it&#x27;s just easier with this model.    This is a solid clipper that will mow through the thickest hair easily for many years and stay sharp. Yes, you will have to make an occasional second pass to get some stray hairs, but that&#x27;s true of any clipper and these are as good as it gets.    If this is your first voyage into the world of clippers:    1) Be aware that the cutting head of this model has a lever adjustment on it that slides the guard forward/back adjusting the cut from 000 to 1. It may look kind of wonky, but it stays in place where you set it (most will typically slide it all the way out or in anyway). You can obviously also combine with the combs for longer cut. Other models like the classic 76 have a fixed blade on them.    2) Unless you know what you&#x27;re getting (and have a smooth head) don&#x27;t get a \\&quot;balding\\&quot; clipper like this [[ASIN:B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]]. Think crazy-sharp. It has to be to cut so low/close. Those clippers are designed to give a bald or 1-day growth closeness. If you want that (i.e. to use for shaving) then fine. But beware of anything like moles, as they will go bye-bye.    3) Oster is a solid brand. You can&#x27;t really go wrong with any of their models, just pick the one with features and price to suit your needs.    4) Think carefully before buying a cheap clipper. 2 or 3 haircuts buys a cheap one. 5 or 6 buys a good one. If you&#x27;re doing the cutting you&#x27;ll be glad you spent the extra money. If you go cheap with an underpowered motor that pulls hair as often as it cuts it you&#x27;ll kick yourself.    5) Put a drop or two of oil on them every use. It does come with it after all. Your clipper will appreciate it and reward you with longer service as a result.    6) Shame it doesn&#x27;t come in a nice case. Not something you really want to keep in a bathroom drawer loose (tiny loose hair clippings + light oil on the blade &#x3D; messy).    7) Camo? Seriously? If I&#x27;m hiding in the desert I probably am not worried about getting my hair cut. And the cord probably isn&#x27;t long enough to stretch to the nearest town/outpost. People love shiny chrome, why not that? Maybe even some gaudy american flag design on the case. Camo! Ugh. I have to hear about it from my wife every time I bust out these ugly clippers. I guess that&#x27;s the price of beauty. The camo makes good clippers look cheap. I almost took a star off just for that, but it might accidentally cause you to buy an inferior model.</li>
    <li> Well made well worth shaver. Just cut my head with it. Very smooth and hasnt over heated on my head.  Worth the value.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough for a good close trim but overall ok. Would have preferred a trimmer but it will do</li>
    <li> I was thinking the clippers were brand new, but when i opened them there was a big crack right down the middle of them.</li>
    <li> It was on sale for a good price and I needed a quick replacement for my old beard trimmer.  Didn&#x27;t realize this one is big and bulky.  I suppose it would work fine for haircuts but that was not my need.</li>
    <li> Look past the color... it is well worth it! I have had mine for over a year now. The cord is not tangled, the blades still sharp as ever, and no loose fittings that create an uneven cut as competitive products always have in the past. Keep your blades oiled and clippers clean, and this should pay for itself before you know it.</li>
    <li> Great product. You cannot go wrong with Oster. It was very affordable and the quality was right up there. The clipper had all the clipper guards needed. There was nothing more to buy. Very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> works flawlessly everytime, needed something after surgery. without going to barber just someone to cut hair. With adapters bought works great.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair decently. I&#x27;m deployed right now so with the way the converters are set up I only get about 75% power to it when I use it but it does a great job and it cuts evenly.</li>
    <li> Great clippers !I would definitively recommend this product to everyone, they cut like a knife through the butter, Best clippers ever.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box these clippers are far and away the best I&#x27;ve EVER used. A 20-30 minute haircut has been reduced to a 10-15 minute breeze. Each cut is clean and the guards don&#x27;t leave unsightly tracks. The construction is solid, and blades cut very effective and effecient. Buy these hair clippers with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the name. Oster is supposed to be at the top of the list for quality, but honestly I never use them. I still use my old Wahl that I had bought these to replace. The Wahl are getting louder as the years go by and one of my sons hates the sound (I don&#x27;t care for it either). That said, these Oster are even louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt; • Cuts the hair really well, probably better than my decade old Wahl.&lt;br /&gt; • Heavy duty cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; • Loud (especially with a guard on)&lt;br /&gt; • Heats up really fast&lt;br /&gt; • Comes with only four guards&lt;br /&gt; • Price - For less that half the price I can get a Wahl that&#x27;s quieter, doesn&#x27;t heat up and comes with three times as many guards.</li>
