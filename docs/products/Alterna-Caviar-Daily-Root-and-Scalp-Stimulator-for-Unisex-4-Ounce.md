      <li>and I have not seen any results so far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this product on my natural hair</li>
      <li>My hair does feel a little thicker, but haven&#x27;t notice significant hair growth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This container does&#x27;t spray properly most of the time.  Didn&#x27;t come with any inside wrap protection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money and I have not seen any results so far.  I would be happy to come back say otherwise if I should see something in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for few months and there is no change in my hair . Waste of money</li>
    <li> Stuff gave me headaches. Had to stop using it. But that was just my personal experience, it probably works fine for most people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s solely this product or in combination with other herbs and vitamins I have introduced into my lifestyle, but my thinning hair has definitely improved! Smells nice too. I will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> Did not help. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon.thank you very much, a parcel was to me delivered in time.with you оч it is pleasant to work.</li>
    <li> I have a substantial amount of new growth after just six weeks of using this product.  I will admit that I started using Viviscal three weeks in, but I am sure the new growth is due to Alterna as Viviscal takes a couple months to show results.  I have lots of baby fine hair growing in at the middle, front portion of my head.  This definitely works!  It has a pleasant enough smell, which dissipates quickly.  I have used minoxidil and found it may or may have helped to keep the hair I had, but definitely did not grow hair as this product has.  Also, minoxidil left my hair feeling like straw and looked dull.  Minoxidil also caused my scalp to itch.  This has a spray applicator and I find that if I push the applicator all the way down, too much product is released, causing it to run down my head, wasting product.  Therefore, I use about five half pumps a day, twice a day.  I may be over using it, but want to be sure I get enough on to see results, rather than not using enough and not seeing results.  It seems like it will last about two months.  Also, I only wash my  hair twice a week and have found that there is no build up of product.  It&#x27;s as if I haven&#x27;t even used it.  With Minoxidil, I had to wash my hair each day due to the residue it left on my hair.  This product is not sticky. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Grew hair on my crown and adds body.  Nothing can grow hair on the front of the scalp, but the back crown has filled in very obviously!</li>
    <li> I have breast feeding hair, meaning it&#x27;s shedding, thin and fine. This is my second month using this product and I&#x27;m already seeing hair growth. Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> This product works, beginning to see new growth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years without success,  I can honestly say it&#x27;s working after two bottles</li>
    <li> Just started using this product but love the scent.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair growth. Recieved medication via shots to the back of my head/scalp, resulting in a bald spot due to trama.  Alterna stimulated growth to the area  I apply typically once a day.</li>
    <li> Just great! repaired my thin hair. Spend the money and repair your hair! This stuff is wonderful! Fast delivery and customer service was great!Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes hair look and feel thicker.  Scalp feels good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seem to work I guess!</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth the cost! You can feel it working but after maybe a week and a half I feel like I see regrow the.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it advertised hair regrowth.  I am using it but obviously it will take time to see if it really works.</li>
    <li> My hair appears to be slightly thicker and its texture is soft yet strong. I did not go in with high expectations so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My hair appears fuller and I love the smell. It&#x27;s worth the price. I&#x27;m using this product on my natural hair so I don&#x27;t know what would be the results on another hair type.</li>
    <li> This product is really great.  I have used this religiously for 3 months now and have noticed a difference in my hair and how well it styles.</li>
    <li> I had major surgery last May. My hair thinned terribly, I lost about 30 lbs &amp; I was freakin out! Looked into a lot of different hair products to use but after much research I decided on this product. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure that it was doing much of anything (although my hair felt awesome &amp; I thought it looked healthier etc) but it wasn&#x27;t until the girl that cuts my hair saw me &amp; she was stunned! She saw all the new hair growth &amp; could immediately tell that my hair was very much improved! I hadn&#x27;t even told her that I thought my hair was thinning...she told me! Anyway, long story short, this is great stuff so get it, use it &amp; you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> repeat buyer... great price.. when used daily helps prevent thin hair..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and the application is simple.  My hair does feel a little thicker, but haven&#x27;t notice significant hair growth.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use based on numerous positive reviews that I&#x27;ve read on various sites.  So, here&#x27;s hoping this is the answer.  I&#x27;ve also added Biotin supplements.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!! this stuff works wonders on my hair.  I really believe it helps my hair grow and makes it healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and I truly believe it is working.  Plus, it gives volume to your hair without adding weight.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Беру во второй раз вместе с комплексом (шампунь и ампулы), поэтому очень очень очень довольна. Результат есть. И я им довольна.</li>
    <li> Too soon to see if it is helping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any difference in my hair, especially for the price you pay.  IMO, a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month, once or twice a day.  My hair definitely looks fuller, and I see a lot of baby hairs growing in.  My husband says he can see a difference, too.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in length yet, but then again it&#x27;s only been a little over a month.</li>
