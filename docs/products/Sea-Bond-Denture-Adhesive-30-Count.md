    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sea-Bond for a couple of years now. It holds the lowers better than nothing and there&#x27;s no ooze. I even eat corn on the cob.</li>
    <li> These are great and very economical. One box will last an entire month and there is no messy ooze to deal with.</li>
    <li> They work as long as I don&#x27;t eat and drink.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised,,much better than adhesive goop</li>
    <li> Have used this item for years - no oozing.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet, I can eat corn on the cob AGAIN.  The upper &amp; LOWER both stay put. That&#x27;s a big Yummy.</li>
    <li> Works better than the tubes of polident and fixadent !!</li>
    <li> This sea-bonds are useful and protect sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> These are the only adhesives that work for my temporary partial.  Easy to apply and use daily!</li>
    <li> These wafers are easy to use and never messy. They remove easily from your dentures.  They seal out food particles and prevent any denture slippage from happening. They are easy to trim for a custom fit.</li>
    <li> Tried this product when ezo was off the market.  It didn&#x27;t work. It was a waste of money.  Try ezo..</li>
    <li> It did meet my expectations and more.  It is the best I have found for this purpose and the finest I have found.</li>
    <li> These we have been usung a long time, and&lt;br /&gt;they are very easy to use after you get use to the&lt;br /&gt;taste and feel of them. They stay in all day long and are&lt;br /&gt;comfortable.</li>
    <li> The girl at the dentist office told me about this product and I got it to try.The mint-I have not tried the other to compare-but I taste no mint here. I was told that what you do is put on denture and let it overlap the sides of the denture.Cut off the tiny excess at the ends and tuck it over.This works for me. I had tried it by doing just what box instructions said-did not work at all.By overlapping,you get more snug hold and it works.Of course NO product will work the 12 hrs. they claim it does.If you are going out at night-redo them. I have no trouble with my top,but the bottoms are like trying to to put socks on a rooster.......they will not stay down.  Try this and do what I said.It works .</li>
    <li> Fine product. I have used it for several years will continue to use as long as available. Love the convience</li>
    <li> Good product, consistent and superior to any other product of this type avaiable in New Zealand both in quality and price.</li>
    <li> These are good if the interior measurement of your denture is almost as big as the box it comes in (I don&#x27;t have a ruler handy for exact dimensions at this time). Otherwise you have to sit and clip with clean scissors ( another step so you do not transfer any bacteria etc. off you scissor to the wafer).  I found it extremely difficult to cut the wafer to look as nice as it does on the product packaging. The fresh mint is nice albeit strong, not sure how long it will last during the day. If they had this in pre-measured size options, they would have a winner. Cutting &amp; shaping is not what I want to do. I may go back to the paste approach.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  It is easy to use and holds dentures securely all day without the worry of food or debris getting caught under the plate.  Great price and quick delivery.</li>
