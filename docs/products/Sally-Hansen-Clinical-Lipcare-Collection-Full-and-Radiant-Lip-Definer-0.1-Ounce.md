      <li>TO BE THE BEST.</li>
      <li>This is the best product for lips that I have ever used and will not go without it anymore!</li>
      <li>It provides moisture and looks great applied over my lipstick or alone.</li>
      <li>I like to wear it under my lipstick or all by itself, either way looks and feel great.  </li>
      <li>and I had heard castor oil is good for helping to regrow eyebrows</li>
      <li>Product feels good on the lips for conditioning, however no improvement on plumping…</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year or so now and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>There is another Sally Beauty Clinical Lipcare product that gives amazing results: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044Q8VG6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_41</li>
      <li>I use)--the color kind of slides off</li>
      <li>Absolutely the BEST lip moisturuzer/plumper!</li>
      <li>I wasnt real excited about this stuff as a lip conditioner,</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the price</li>
      <li>I use it on top of lip stick or by itself.</li>
      <li>It moisturize your lips but it doesn&#x27;t make them more plumped.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the creamy feel and application is easy and none greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>Smooths my lips out real well, leaves my lips looking shiny and feels so nice.</li>
      <li>Makes my lips look smooth and application of lipstick smoother.</li>
      <li>I ordered one and then came back and ordered 3 more!!</li>
      <li>It smells natural &amp; clean and it looks good with lipstick as well.</li>
      <li>The actual lip balm is outstanding, I ordered four more!</li>
      <li>It is smooth, gentle, smells great, and is in a lovely pink lipstick tube.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok - I didn&#x27;t get much out of it except that it seems to protect from dryness</li>
      <li>I love most of Sally&#x27;s lip treatments and this one is not any different.</li>
      <li>My lips looked lush and plump and better than ever.  </li>
      <li>THE DONT LAUGH</li>
      <li>I am a fan of Sally Hansen&#x27;s lips products, and I love this lip definer, it makes my lips  fuller, softer and not heavy on my lips at all.</li>
      <li>but really, I think it&#x27;s probably worth it!</li>
      <li>, I love the smell, the smooth feeling, what a difference it makes all through out the long day.</li>
      <li>But I keep ordering it because it&#x27;s the only product that works for more than a minute.  </li>
      <li>I read that the first ingredient is castor oil.</li>
      <li>Even after it wore off, my lips remained moist and have not been chapped since before first use.  </li>
      <li>It makes your lips look and feel pretty.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I searched for it on Amazon and was very pleased by the quick delivery.</li>
      <li>My new fave!!</li>
      <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely soft pink, very feminine.  </li>
      <li>The shine is subtle and sexy, the lips are immediately plump.. and even when the shine wears off, the effect lasts as your lips stay full and soft.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really mind growing old, but</li>
      <li>She has been using it for years and cant live without it.</li>
      <li>I keep a tube on the bed at night so that when I wake up and my lips are dry, it&#x27;s right there.</li>
      <li>It looks like a lip stick but is really a clear chap stick.</li>
      <li>My lips are soft all the time and when I put it on it stays on.</li>
      <li>This product makes them feel soft and look it, too.  </li>
      <li>I have used this whole tube and see absolutely no difference.  </li>
      <li>So I usually wear this alone, paired with a subtle lip liner, it looks good.</li>

    <li> Product feels good on the lips for conditioning, however no improvement on plumping…</li>
    <li> I forwarded your product to a friend in Australia who is unable to purchase it.  She has been using it for years and cant live without it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product, because I did not see any improvements after using it. There is another Sally Beauty Clinical Lipcare product that gives amazing results: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044Q8VG6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_41</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok - I didn&#x27;t get much out of it except that it seems to protect from dryness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie!! I admit it. I keep a tube on the bed at night so that when I wake up and my lips are dry, it&#x27;s right there. THIS stuff is a lip balm PLUS!! My lips are soft all the time and when I put it on it stays on. I ordered one and then came back and ordered 3 more!! My new fave!!</li>
    <li> I had chapped lips for a few weeks.  I ordered this product and immediately after use my lips were no longer chapped.  My lips looked lush and plump and better than ever.  Even after it wore off, my lips remained moist and have not been chapped since before first use.  This is the best product for lips that I have ever used and will not go without it anymore!</li>
    <li> I only use this product because there is no comparison, no product works hard like this one, I love the smell, the smooth feeling, what a difference it makes all through out the long day.</li>
    <li> I can never live without this thing. It looks like a lip stick but is really a clear chap stick. It does wonder for your lips, especially if they are thin and dry like mine. You get instant gratification. I use it on top of lip stick or by itself. The shine is subtle and sexy, the lips are immediately plump.. and even when the shine wears off, the effect lasts as your lips stay full and soft. I simply cannot do without this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year or so now and I absolutely love it! It conditions your lips with moderate shine without color. It smells natural &amp; clean and it looks good with lipstick as well. I don&#x27;t love the price but really, I think it&#x27;s probably worth it!</li>
    <li> I have thin, dry lips.  This product makes them feel soft and look it, too.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my lips--so only 4 stars.  But I keep ordering it because it&#x27;s the only product that works for more than a minute.  It really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes your lips look and feel pretty.  I like to wear it under my lipstick or all by itself, either way looks and feel great.  I would recommend this product to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. Smooths my lips out real well, leaves my lips looking shiny and feels so nice. My lips feel fuller too but the effect doesn&#x27;t last real long. It&#x27;s also not the greatest lip base for long lasting lip stains (at least not for the ones I use)--the color kind of slides off and/or doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and then the lip stain wears off quicker. So I usually wear this alone, paired with a subtle lip liner, it looks good.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS FOR LIP LINE AND FULLNESS. I FOUND SALLY HANSEN  LIPCARE COLLECTION  TO BE THE BEST.</li>
    <li> Same as the other Sally Hansen product I bought.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on any of these products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know just what it is doing to my lips, but I like the feel of it.  And I have HOPE.  I want my lips back.  I don&#x27;t really mind growing old, but I don&#x27;t like looking like I have beed whistling all my life - and I can&#x27;t even whistle.</li>
    <li> I have used this whole tube and see absolutely no difference.  It was like I was using chap stick, only without the moisturizing effect.</li>
    <li> Love the creamy feel and application is easy and none greasy feeling.  Makes my lips look smooth and application of lipstick smoother.</li>
    <li> I wasnt real excited about this stuff as a lip conditioner,BUT,..HERES THE DONT LAUGH PART....I read that the first ingredient is castor oil. and I had heard castor oil is good for helping to regrow eyebrows SO.... I have been putting it on my eyebrows to set them after applying brow color!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertized.</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the finest lip balm on the market.  It is smooth, gentle, smells great, and is in a lovely pink lipstick tube.  I use it day and night and find that it works well under lipstick also.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I searched for it on Amazon and was very pleased by the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST lip moisturuzer/plumper!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Sally Hansen&#x27;s lips products, and I love this lip definer, it makes my lips  fuller, softer and not heavy on my lips at all. It also last for a long time. I use it all the time and cannot go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> It moisturize your lips but it doesn&#x27;t make them more plumped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about packaging, not the box it arrived in the actual product appearance.  It&#x27;s a lovely soft pink, very feminine.  The actual lip balm is outstanding, I ordered four more!</li>
    <li> I love most of Sally&#x27;s lip treatments and this one is not any different. It provides moisture and looks great applied over my lipstick or alone.</li>
