    <li> Very nice lathering soap.  My wife likes it too.  The only thing that is a little off is that the soap smells like dog shampoo.  Really, it does.  And the seller info is not correct: our shipping receipt showed the seller as &amp;#34;Obama Keepsake Collection.&amp;#34; Was is that all about? Still, a decent soap.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it. I never used it.</li>
    <li> Great soap for men, has manly scent, lathers all the way to end.</li>
    <li> Dries your skin a little, but it&#x27;s good..</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now. It smells great and does not aggravate my sensitive skin - every other soap I&#x27;ve found that fits that description is at least twice as expensive.</li>

    <li> The soap smells great and helps to keep your skin from getting dry.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent and lathers very well. Product was delivered very quickly. I am very satisfied with this soap. I have read that Shea Butter revitalizes the skin....we shall see. I am an avid fisherman and have permanently damaged the oil and sweat glands in my arms. It is my hope that this soap will help moisturize them. I will report back in a month or so after I see the result. At any rate, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the aroma...it is great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap bar. There&#x27;s a perfect amount of scent throughout soap bar. Both men and women can use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t change the formula. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> I have ordered multiple varieties of this soap product.  It is of exceptional quality and great gift idea to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Very nice and love this bath bar!</li>
    <li> This soap is the best after a shower oh man you feel as if you are in wonderland skin so fresh and clean if I could afford it I would use nothing else</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my wife and daughters for Christmas.  My wife liked it so much I decided to buy three more bars.  If my wife likes it, it must be an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Received product quickly and it&#x27;s a great product period.</li>
    <li> great, natural product.  The shea, frankincense and myrrh are very moisturizing.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought it on Amazon when it was unavailable at our local retail store.  Great price, quick delivery.  Will not buy anywhere else from now on.  My husband is pleased to know he will have a steady supply of his favorite soap as it does wonders for his clinically dry skin.  Thank you!</li>
