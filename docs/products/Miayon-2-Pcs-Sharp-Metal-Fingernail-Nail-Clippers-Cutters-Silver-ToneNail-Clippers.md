      <li>these feel like nice clippers not cheep metal .</li>
      <li>They cut nails. :-)  </li>
      <li>These are kind of cheap.</li>
      <li>cheap but do the job!</li>
      <li>Great clippers and very well made.</li>
      <li>Cheap, but effective.</li>
      <li>The top part of the clipper almost touches the lower part.</li>
      <li>These are okay.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re nice and sharp and do a great job!</li>
      <li>Nice clean cut without having to strain and bending the clipper handle.</li>
      <li>My hands aren&#x27;t huge, so I like the fact that these are easy to grip.</li>
      <li>Some of my fingernails would not even fit into the clipper opening,  </li>
      <li>I really liked the size and function of the older Trim brand and thus I’ve been searching for a suitable low cost yet quality replacement and am pleased to have found these.  </li>
      <li>Comes in handy for multiple tasks.</li>
      <li>The quality is okay as far as the feel and weight</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care how many Pcs there are, they&#x27;re not sharp.</li>
      <li>Luckily I was able to put it back together.</li>
      <li>The $1 at the grocery store are just as good, cheaper, and often have a little keychain at the end.</li>
      <li>Firstly it took forever to receive these clippers -</li>
      <li>No issues with them, crisp cut and work well.</li>
      <li>Nothing fancy, but very practical.</li>
      <li>Straight to the trash.  </li>
      <li>But the price reasonable.</li>
      <li>The title really says it all.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with these, they were sharp from the get-go.</li>
      <li>Steer clear!!</li>
      <li>Nothing special, just inexpensive nail clippers to keep in a purse, desk at work, or wherever you might realize your nails are getting a bit long.</li>
      <li>For the price, they definitely seem worth it to me.</li>
      <li>Well worth it, especially compared to all the over hyped $20 clippers.</li>
      <li>Cut one nail with these right out the pack...went back to the 6 year old nail clippers I have twice now tried to replace as an improvement.  </li>
      <li>First, only one clippers came in the mail, not 2 like advertised.  </li>
      <li>Well made, durable, sturdy, and they make sharp clean cuts.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>These nail clippers look like my beloved Revlon nail clipper that I lost, but unfortunately are nothing like them.</li>
      <li>These work fine, and are sharp enough, but the size isn&#x27;t as described.</li>
      <li>these are teeny tiny clippers, 1/2 the size of clippers you normally buy in the U</li>
      <li>The cutting surface is very sharp and lined up well so that you get a smooth quick cut that is accurate and doesn’t leave a frayed edge as the poorer quality clippers can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most clippers anymore tear the nail off instead of actually cutting, due to crappy alignment most times.</li>
      <li>I needed some new fingernail clippers and have found recently that the Trim brand clippers I’ve been using for years have gone downhill.  </li>
      <li>File is smooth and doesn&#x27;t file, the nail cleaner is bulky and dull.  </li>
      <li>These at least &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the nail like clippers are supposed to, and they&#x27;re cheap too.</li>
      <li>These clippers are nearly an exact match for the Trim brand, but they are quality made and functioning very well (at least the 2 I received).  </li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;m so rough on them, using them for nails and as a tool they dull pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>very sturdy and sharp</li>
      <li>Cheap, work well just small and hurts to use too long.</li>

<li> With the four pack I never have to hunt long trying to figure out where the heck my wife left the clippers</li>
<li> Sharp enough to last long.</li>
<li> About the only thing I can see as a bit rough is the file.  </li>
<li> Arrived when stated; however, both are almost the same size as each other.  </li>
<li> I thought when purchasing these that one was slightly larger than the other (is not).</li>
<li> Great value for the money, shipping is a bit slow, but not too bad.</li>
<li> These ship from China, apparently, so it takes a little while to receive them.  </li>
<li> The file surface is very rough and can really only be used for a rough file, you need to finish up after using it with something that has a softer feel to give me the smoother finish I like.  </li>
<li> I feel I was duped as I could have went into Chinatown down the street and bought the same quality for 99 cents.</li>
<li> Easy cutting.  </li>
<li> The little hole at the end works for adding to a key ring.</li>
<li> Not worth the couple of bucks and extremely long delivery time.</li>
<li> very small, not easy to use if you have large hands.</li>
<li> The small hole at the end is there like I prefer since I like to put a chain or key ring there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> &amp;#34;2 Pcs Sharp Metal Fingernail Nail Clippers Cutters Silver Tone?&amp;#34; They&#x27;re chrome, not silver.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s to be expected with the way I treat them!</li>
<li> Have used them about 1/2 dozen times over the past several months.  </li>
<li> but these are sharp and work well.</li>
<li> but when I try to clip my nails, you can feel the clipper stress and you have to push extra hard to finish the job.</li>
<li> Not sure how long they&#x27;ll stay that way</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had them for some time now and the only complaint I could make was that it took almost a month to get them.</li>
<li> Very sharp.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using one for a couple months now, and it still seems plenty sharp, and when it does eventually dull, I still have the other one.</li>
<li> Took a few weeks for the order to make it to my door....</li>
<li> Thirdly, they are on the smallish side and difficult, even for someone with small hands as mine, to use them.</li>
<li> Was looking for some clippers for my wife and daughter, too lazy to go to the store and found these at 5 am.</li>
<li> Im not sure whats wrong with the cutting edge to leave the nail so rough and torn....</li>
<li> Very weak- broke when I tried to cut my toenails.</li>
<li> I find it difficult to find a pair that has the hole in the end.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like to keep a fingernail clipper on my key ring.  Comes in handy for multiple tasks. A hangnail of course...an emergency pair of scissors, a thread that needs to be cut etc.  Because I&#x27;m so rough on them, using them for nails and as a tool they dull pretty quickly.  I find it difficult to find a pair that has the hole in the end.  I was pleased with these, they were sharp from the get-go. Not sure how long they&#x27;ll stay that way but that&#x27;s to be expected with the way I treat them!</li>
    <li> Need to cut nails here you go</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the clippers but these are sharp and work well.</li>
    <li> excellent product at an exceptional price!</li>
    <li> Cheap, work well just small and hurts to use too long.</li>
    <li> I totally fell for the bait and switch routine.  First, only one clippers came in the mail, not 2 like advertised.  And they were twice the size of those in the description. Steer clear!!</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Excellent product</li>
    <li> These work fine, and are sharp enough, but the size isn&#x27;t as described. I received two that were 2.75&amp;#34; (70mm), and that&#x27;s longer than I wanted.</li>
    <li> Perfect size nail clippers! My hands aren&#x27;t huge, so I like the fact that these are easy to grip. I ordered a pair so that I could attach one to my key chain and keep one at home. They&#x27;re nice and sharp and do a great job!</li>
    <li> These are okay. The $1 at the grocery store are just as good, cheaper, and often have a little keychain at the end.</li>
    <li> very sturdy and sharp</li>
    <li> Really good quality.  I was pleasantly surprised.</li>

    <li> Great value for the money, shipping is a bit slow, but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Very weak- broke when I tried to cut my toenails.</li>
    <li> Sharp enough to last long. Plus, it is a set of two only for $3.</li>
    <li> cheap but do the job!</li>
    <li> These ship from China, apparently, so it takes a little while to receive them.  But they seem like very good quality.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers look like my beloved Revlon nail clipper that I lost, but unfortunately are nothing like them. The quality is okay as far as the feel and weight but when I try to clip my nails, you can feel the clipper stress and you have to push extra hard to finish the job. The top part of the clipper almost touches the lower part. One of the clippers fell apart in my pocket. Luckily I was able to put it back together. I feel I was duped as I could have went into Chinatown down the street and bought the same quality for 99 cents.</li>
    <li> They work well as you would want.  No problems.  Easy cutting.  Comparably well priced.  Comparably well priced.  Comparably well priced.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and very well made. I&#x27;ve had them for some time now and the only complaint I could make was that it took almost a month to get them. Well worth it, especially compared to all the over hyped $20 clippers.</li>
    <li> They are great nail clippers and have yet to break!</li>
    <li> Took a few weeks for the order to make it to my door....I had forgotten to filer amazon prime only when ordering...big mistake.  Cut one nail with these right out the pack...went back to the 6 year old nail clippers I have twice now tried to replace as an improvement.  Im not sure whats wrong with the cutting edge to leave the nail so rough and torn....but a six year old well aged pair put them to shame.  File is smooth and doesn&#x27;t file, the nail cleaner is bulky and dull.  Straight to the trash.  Not worth the couple of bucks and extremely long delivery time.</li>
    <li> inexpensive to buy! very good quality for the money.</li>
    <li> Nice clean cut without having to strain and bending the clipper handle.</li>
    <li> The title really says it all. I&#x27;ve been using one for a couple months now, and it still seems plenty sharp, and when it does eventually dull, I still have the other one. For the price, they definitely seem worth it to me.</li>
    <li> These are kind of cheap. Talking about quality. But the price reasonable. What can be said its a nail clipper.</li>
    <li> They cut nails. :-)  No issues with them, crisp cut and work well.</li>
    <li> These work just like they are supposed to.  Nothing fancy, but very practical. The little hole at the end works for adding to a key ring.</li>
    <li> Firstly it took forever to receive these clippers - didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from Asia. Secondly, they aren&#x27;t the sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve ever had (lost those and hoped to replace with these). Thirdly, they are on the smallish side and difficult, even for someone with small hands as mine, to use them. Would not re-purchase or recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good material, very sturdy, excellent price</li>
    <li> Cheap, but effective.</li>
    <li> 2 Pcs Nail Clippers - product name and picture is deceiving...it shows two nail clippers but I only received one. The price is good, the nail clippers are ok. The come from China or somewhere in Asia according to the package.  They took about 3 wks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Was looking for some clippers for my wife and daughter, too lazy to go to the store and found these at 5 am. while still in bed.  They arrived two days later, and did the job!  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These clippers do a great job.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  But too big for fingernails</li>
    <li> Good price and work well</li>
    <li> I needed some new fingernail clippers and have found recently that the Trim brand clippers I’ve been using for years have gone downhill.  I really liked the size and function of the older Trim brand and thus I’ve been searching for a suitable low cost yet quality replacement and am pleased to have found these.  These clippers are nearly an exact match for the Trim brand, but they are quality made and functioning very well (at least the 2 I received).  They do not come in any packaging, just 2 in a baggie inside of a shipping package.  They are Asian made, with a character that means Beauty on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have a nice feel and quality cut to them.  The cutting surface is very sharp and lined up well so that you get a smooth quick cut that is accurate and doesn’t leave a frayed edge as the poorer quality clippers can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tension on the unit gives a very nice feel and I like it.  About the only thing I can see as a bit rough is the file.  The file surface is very rough and can really only be used for a rough file, you need to finish up after using it with something that has a softer feel to give me the smoother finish I like.  The small hole at the end is there like I prefer since I like to put a chain or key ring there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, I’m really happy with these clippers</li>
    <li> Good curved clippers.</li>
    <li> what can I say they work great</li>
    <li> these feel like nice clippers not cheep metal . 10/10</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;2 Pcs Sharp Metal Fingernail Nail Clippers Cutters Silver Tone?&amp;#34; They&#x27;re chrome, not silver. I don&#x27;t care how many Pcs there are, they&#x27;re not sharp. Calling them both cutters and clippers does not sharpen them.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I have been able to find for a while. Not the best I&#x27;ve owned, but the best I&#x27;ve been able to find in many many years. Most clippers anymore tear the nail off instead of actually cutting, due to crappy alignment most times. These at least &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the nail like clippers are supposed to, and they&#x27;re cheap too.</li>
    <li> I was looking for nail clippers to put on my kids key rings. These are inexpensive and work well.</li>
    <li> With the four pack I never have to hunt long trying to figure out where the heck my wife left the clippers</li>
    <li> Great value.  As always, Amazon Prime rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Rahim</li>
    <li> very small, not easy to use if you have large hands.</li>
    <li> Beware, these are made and shipped from the orient. these are teeny tiny clippers, 1/2 the size of clippers you normally buy in the U S. Some of my fingernails would not even fit into the clipper opening,  Just go to the store for your clippers.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, just inexpensive nail clippers to keep in a purse, desk at work, or wherever you might realize your nails are getting a bit long.</li>
    <li> Have to put a lot of force just to clip a nail and the cuts not that good either</li>
    <li> Good clippers, its nice that they come as a pair. Well made, durable, sturdy, and they make sharp clean cuts.</li>
    <li> Have used them about 1/2 dozen times over the past several months.  Work just fine; great value.</li>
