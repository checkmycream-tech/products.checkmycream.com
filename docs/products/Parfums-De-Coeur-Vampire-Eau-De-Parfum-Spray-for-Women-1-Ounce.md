      <li>but it does have a great scent to it.</li>

      <li>Well, I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
      <li>My best friend bought a bottle, the first time I smelled it..</li>
      <li>The one thing I ALWAYS find is that anytime I wear one of those, I am SURE to smell it on someone else!</li>
      <li>I was scoping for just a nice body spray.</li>
      <li>it reminds me of warmed spices with a touch of rose and musk.</li>
      <li>Since the price is great, I would recommend purchasing more than one bottle, if you enjoy this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is very feminine with an exotic edge and totally awesome for evening!</li>
      <li>design makes it easy to use with good quality</li>
      <li>can no longer find this amazing perfume at any store, so I was beyond pleased to know I can find it here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments on it</li>
      <li>thankfully around christmas, i was able to find a store that sells it again.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because I love vampires</li>
      <li>I never spray more than once at a time - and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I love the scent, so</li>

      <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself and I love it.</li>
      <li>I Love the exotic blend.</li>
      <li>Knowing that I love all things vampire,she brought it to me.</li>
      <li>I am SOOO glad I smelled it before I bought it.  </li>
      <li>(like it happens to MOST scents I like).</li>
      <li>so I am always looking for a bargain, as most perfumes are over 60$ these days.  </li>
      <li>i bought this scent thinking that i would love it.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better I would have thought it was one of those \\&quot;Pricey\\&quot; brands.  </li>
      <li>i bought this perfume because it was on sale, i really love perfume</li>
      <li>I love the combination of floral and musky scents.</li>
      <li>so many do.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
      <li>I tend to lean more toward the fruity scented body sprays just because they have a lighter scent</li>
      <li>I went to get more</li>
      <li>The best thing about that is that my bathroom smells like it all day long, even after I get home from work.     </li>
      <li>It is long lasting and of very good quality I don&#x27;t think it should be discontinued and is perfect to use every day.</li>
      <li>I came across this perfume and at first thought okay yet another cliche sparkly vampire homage...NO WAY!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, I first bought it as a joke at Walmart around Christmas time.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the first real perfume I&#x27;ve found that I actually liked!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not a big fan of musks, but this one was very nice.</li>
      <li>For $14.99 it is a wonderful, LONG LASTING perfume, with a scent all it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>I got this perfume because I was looking for a nice daily scent that I could wear that isn&#x27;t too strong and overpowering but is noticeable and appealing.</li>
      <li>I think Zombie would have been a better name for it ;)</li>
      <li>I actually purchased this scent at Walmart, and loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sexy smelling perfume, I would absolutely reccomend this for women.</li>
      <li>What I love about this is it seems to change from the time I put it on Until evening when I am ready to reapply.</li>
      <li>the smell, i think is a bit strong, it reminds me of what an old lady would wear. :)</li>
      <li>bottle design is probably what drew me in, it seemed so mysterious and that is a good way to describe the scent, which is light, airy and very uplifting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful, Long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a light, flowery/fruity perfume that is also romantic and sexy.</li>
      <li>i went through my first bottle rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind reapplying it throughout the day, but you end up going through your bottle pretty quick.</li>
      <li>Why buy more expensive perfumes when this smells so great and</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle at the  local cvs drugstore and wish i would have bought more than just one.  </li>
      <li>and i have received numerous compliments from men and women, love this perfume</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on, I was smelling my wrist all day.</li>
      <li>I bought it and when I had it on the next day at work, I had so many compliments on it and people asking what it was and where I bought</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a very alluring fragrance - sweet without being cloying, a teeny bit fruity, and it has a very alluring muskiness.</li>
      <li>This perfume has a unique smell thats sweet but not to sweet, sexy and subtle...</li>
      <li>Very pretty bottle, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You just have to be careful about putting too much on at a time; it can and WILL get overwhelming quickly if you overdo it.</li>
      <li>I wear musky and warm scents in the fall and winter Dark Kiss by B&amp;Bworks, Obsession CK.</li>
      <li>This is very flirty and sensual, but it has some lighter notes.  </li>
      <li>Let me say I didn&#x27;t buy it because of Twilight because I really don&#x27;t care for those movies.</li>
      <li>It made it smell just as cheap as it was, I don&#x27;t know, maybe it smells different on, but after smelling it when I sprayed it I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting it on my skin.  </li>
      <li>It made me feel like I could get a headache if I wore it much longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very musky but with a chemical overtone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very strong scent, so you only need a tiny bit -</li>
      <li>It smells like high end and costs as much as a body spray.</li>
      <li>Wow!, I cannot believe how fast I received this perfume</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not normally a perfume-wearing type, but I thought since it was cheap, why not give it a try.</li>
      <li>However, I was a little curious because the description sounded amazing!</li>
      <li>the scent is way too strong and overpowers everything./ when you hear the word \\&quot;vampire\\&quot;, you picture a fragrance that is sexy, mysterious and subtle, not something that is in your face overpowering and nauseating./</li>
      <li>This is immediately finding a new home.</li>
      <li>Just wish I could find it where I live instead of having to order online.</li>
      <li>It is not a childish fruity scent!</li>
      <li>I first saw this perfume at my local grocery store, in the pharmacy area.</li>
      <li>My daughter first alerted me to this perfume while we were shopping at a local department store.</li>
      <li>I was very curious about this scent, especially considering the fact that I love some of the notes in the description.</li>
      <li>Yes it may be a little strong</li>
      <li>Certainly going to be my daily wear perfume!</li>
      <li>I am in my late 30&#x27;s &amp; have worn many of the big name perfumes.</li>
      <li>It has a rich scent that seems to wear off slowly and makes you want to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, a little strong for me, but, you only need a few sprays of it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The overview provided says it all. I can&#x27;t get over this perfume. The first time I put it on, I was smelling my wrist all day. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself and I love it.Let me say I didn&#x27;t buy it because of Twilight because I really don&#x27;t care for those movies.I bought it because I love vampires,you know the Gary Oldman,Sadie Frost,Christopher Lee,Jack Palance,Frank Langella vampires.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance and it last.It doesn&#x27;t fade away like so many do.It lingers on the skin for hours,giving vampires the chance to smell great all thru the night.</li>
    <li> I recently got a bottle of this because I found it on sale after Christmas. I&#x27;m not normally a perfume-wearing type, but I thought since it was cheap, why not give it a try. Well, I absolutely LOVE it! It&#x27;s got a very alluring fragrance - sweet without being cloying, a teeny bit fruity, and it has a very alluring muskiness. It&#x27;s a very strong scent, so you only need a tiny bit - I never spray more than once at a time - and it lasts all day. You just have to be careful about putting too much on at a time; it can and WILL get overwhelming quickly if you overdo it.</li>
    <li> I was scoping for just a nice body spray. I came across this perfume and at first thought okay yet another cliche sparkly vampire homage...NO WAY! It is not a childish fruity scent! It is very feminine with an exotic edge and totally awesome for evening! I would recommend this product for sure. It smells like high end and costs as much as a body spray. I spray about two spritzes in my hair and it lasts up until the next day. The free travel size is perfect for touch ups.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this perfume from Amazon and it came in the mail today.  After opening the package, I spritzed one spray onto my wrist to test it out.  The scent hasn&#x27;t faded one bit and it&#x27;s incredibly pleasant!  I keep sniffing my wrist!  This is very flirty and sensual, but it has some lighter notes.  Certainly going to be my daily wear perfume!</li>
    <li> It is a good perfume. I was a little thrown off by the sandlewood but that&#x27;s because I have never particularly loved it. I might not buy another one, but I did get some compliments so that counts for something!</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle at the  local cvs drugstore and wish i would have bought more than just one.  I absolutely LOVE this perfume!!  the only thing is, the bottle is way too small. i went through my first bottle rather quickly.  thankfully around christmas, i was able to find a store that sells it again.  after i bought my 1st bottle of it, it was next to impossible to find again.  i found it again at the local Meijer store.  i am giving this five stars because it smells soooooo  good.  the scent lasts quite awhile after putting it on.</li>
    <li> Fist of I am not a \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; fan (so before anyone thinks THAT is why I bought this, lets get that out of the way.)  I had tried a tester, and wore the scent all day.... my husband said he could still smell a hint of it when we woke in the morning.. THAT is what made me decide to Purchase \\&quot;VAMPIRE\\&quot;.  I am in my late 30&#x27;s &amp; have worn many of the big name perfumes. The one thing I ALWAYS find is that anytime I wear one of those, I am SURE to smell it on someone else! NOT with Vampire... What I love about this is it seems to change from the time I put it on Until evening when I am ready to reapply. I Love the exotic blend. The description says fruity...  but is not a sickeningly sweet scent.... it reminds me of warmed spices with a touch of rose and musk. (You DO NOT need a lot... a little goes a LONG way)  My husband LOVES it and asked me to stock up in case the company decides to discontinue it (like it happens to MOST scents I like). He likes the fact that it lasts long, and in a room he can catch a slight hint of my scent even when standing with others who are wearing VERY heavy scents.    For $14.99 it is a wonderful, LONG LASTING perfume, with a scent all it&#x27;s own. If I didn&#x27;t know better I would have thought it was one of those \\&quot;Pricey\\&quot; brands.  Try it for yourself.... Just PLEASE leave a few for me!!!    Willow</li>
    <li> I first read about this scent in a magazine and was skeptical because I absolutely HATE anything to do with vampires. However, I was a little curious because the description sounded amazing! (Don&#x27;t they always?) So when I saw it in store I decided to take a whiff and I was thoroughly impressed! Yes it may be a little strong which is why I only use one or two spritzes a day and THAT&#x27;S IT, but it does have a great scent to it. It&#x27;s probably the first real perfume I&#x27;ve found that I actually liked! I tend to lean more toward the fruity scented body sprays just because they have a lighter scent and I&#x27;m not a big fan of musks, but this one was very nice. I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments on it as well and my husband especially likes it! He says it makes me smell like apples?? I don&#x27;t get it, but as long as he likes it who cares? Just wish I could find it where I live instead of having to order online.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for its look.. just for decor purpose.  the smell, i think is a bit strong, it reminds me of what an old lady would wear. :)</li>
    <li> Wow!, I cannot believe how fast I received this perfume and it smells wonderful !, a little strong for me, but, you only need a few sprays of it.</li>
    <li> i bought this scent thinking that i would love it. i was intrigued by the name and the description, so i bought two bottles./ when i finally got it and sprayed it on, i immediately felt nauseated.. the scent is way too strong and overpowers everything./ when you hear the word \\&quot;vampire\\&quot;, you picture a fragrance that is sexy, mysterious and subtle, not something that is in your face overpowering and nauseating./ i can&#x27;t wait to get this smell off of me! it has a sickening banana smell to it. :(</li>
    <li> I got this perfume because I was looking for a nice daily scent that I could wear that isn&#x27;t too strong and overpowering but is noticeable and appealing. As another reviewer already said, I sprayed it on my wrist and I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it all day. Hands-down my favorite perfume yet!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this scent at Walmart, and loved it. With that said, I have noticed that the scent tends to fade after just a couple hours. I love the scent, so I don&#x27;t mind reapplying it throughout the day, but you end up going through your bottle pretty quick. Since the price is great, I would recommend purchasing more than one bottle, if you enjoy this fragrance. Other than on Amazon.com, it has been next to impossible to find this particular perfume (I have searched Walmart, where I bought my first bottle, and it&#x27;s as if it never existed there). Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I first saw this perfume at my local grocery store, in the pharmacy area. The bottle design caught my eye, and the name pulled me in, but the scent made me ask for it for Christmas. Since then, I have used it everyday! I love the combination of floral and musky scents. I do the \\&quot;spray and walk through\\&quot; when I apply perfume, so the scent is not over-powering at all. The best thing about that is that my bathroom smells like it all day long, even after I get home from work.     I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that Amazon is listing this perfume. I was sad when I realized the store I purchased this perfume at only carried it for a short time, and was worried that I would miss it terribly when my one bottle was gone. Yay, online shopping!</li>
    <li> I smelled this the other day in the store because it was on clearance for $7.50 and had read such rave reviews figured I&#x27;d buy some.  I am SOOO glad I smelled it before I bought it.  Someone had written a review about it having a really bad chemical smell and honestly, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it.  It made it smell just as cheap as it was, I don&#x27;t know, maybe it smells different on, but after smelling it when I sprayed it I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting it on my skin.  It is definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> What a great price for vampire repellent! Ha ha! I got a sample of this fragrance along with my Designer Imposters Swept Away. I don&#x27;t think anyone will be nibbling on you if you wear Vampire. It&#x27;s very musky but with a chemical overtone. It made me feel like I could get a headache if I wore it much longer. I wear musky and warm scents in the fall and winter Dark Kiss by B&amp;Bworks, Obsession CK. For spring and summer I wear fruity and floral scents like Luscious Kisses VS, VW Princess. Vampire falls into the Fall and Winter category but I can&#x27;t imagine that I would ever wear this. I think Zombie would have been a better name for it ;)</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume, I think it is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is probably what drew me in, it seemed so mysterious and that is a good way to describe the scent, which is light, airy and very uplifting. It has a rich scent that seems to wear off slowly and makes you want to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design makes it easy to use with good quality haven&#x27;t had a problem with the spritzer coming  off like with some. It is long lasting and of very good quality I don&#x27;t think it should be discontinued and is perfect to use every day. Very pretty bottle, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aryan Somers</li>
    <li> i bought this perfume because it was on sale, i really love perfume so I am always looking for a bargain, as most perfumes are over 60$ these days.  the scent lingers all day even if I don&#x27;t smell it, i smoke so I usually reapply perfume throughout the day and i have received numerous compliments from men and women, love this perfume</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I first bought it as a joke at Walmart around Christmas time. I got so many compliments on it and I liked it so much I went to get more and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. This perfume has a unique smell thats sweet but not to sweet, sexy and subtle...</li>
    <li> I was very curious about this scent, especially considering the fact that I love some of the notes in the description. Immediately upon putting it on, I knew what it made me think of: Windsong. Rancid, stale Windsong. It has to be one of the worst commercial perfumes I&#x27;ve smelled in years. This is immediately finding a new home.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling perfume and it stays with you all day.  Why buy more expensive perfumes when this smells so great and the price is so low!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter first alerted me to this perfume while we were shopping at a local department store. Knowing that I love all things vampire,she brought it to me. I laughed and tested the perfume. IT WAS WONDERFUL! I bought it and when I had it on the next day at work, I had so many compliments on it and people asking what it was and where I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light, flowery/fruity perfume that is also romantic and sexy. It&#x27;s not over powering or heavy, but it does stay with you all day to give you a romantic sent that everyone will notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can no longer find this amazing perfume at any store, so I was beyond pleased to know I can find it here at Amazon. I will keep buying it as long as it&#x27;s offered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sexy smelling perfume, I would absolutely reccomend this for women. My best friend bought a bottle, the first time I smelled it..I was in utter heaven. It&#x27;s a wonderful, Long lasting scent.</li>
