      <li>I am going to do everything that I can to keep my skin looking healthy, but I would encourage even young women to make an investment in their skin care.</li>

      <li>It keeps my skin looking young and healthy.</li>
      <li>Am still evaluating these products but they are quickly becoming my new favorites.</li>
      <li>, wait 30 minutes to apply my Retin-A, and then wait 30 minutes before putting this moisturizer right over the Retin-A.  </li>
      <li>I just use the moisturizer right after I wash my face on nights</li>
      <li>very pure, no DMAE.</li>

      <li>thanks to Neo Cutis!</li>
      <li>My skin feels smoother and the fine lines are not as apparent.  </li>
      <li>I just wish it was a little more affordable!</li>
      <li>Because of the cost I used a cheaper product that was less effective, which caused me to bite the bullet and buy this.  </li>
      <li>the results.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well with eye</li>
      <li>I find the product very nourishing and creamy.  </li>
      <li>Very hydrating</li>

      <li>This weekend I was asked if my 50 year old friend was my dad.</li>
      <li>One package was tampered with and both smelled old and rancid despite an over 2 year exp.</li>
      <li>I am over 59 years old,</li>
      <li>I am 55 years old and am stoppped freqenlyty and told what beantiflyu skin I have.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and seems to do a really fine job to condition and grow my skin into a more youthful appearance</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion.  Came on time.</li>
    <li> There is a medical skin clinic that I love and trust. The aesthetician there told me that Neocutis Bio-Cream is the best moisturizer because it has all the growth factors. It is actually less expensive than many of the moisturizers that also contain them. At my age (54) I am going to do everything that I can to keep my skin looking healthy, but I would encourage even young women to make an investment in their skin care. The aesthetician is 47, and she looks absolutely AMAZING because she has taken care of her skin from an early age!</li>
    <li> I am an x New York model, with slightly aging skin. However, I have always taken care of my skin, as I was trained well.  My dermatologist suggested the Neocutis Bio-Cream Bio-restorative.  I am not sure I would ever try to duplicate this  product, as it works well under my makeup, and as a night cream if my skin gets too dry.  I am blue eyed and have light fair skin.  I am over 59 years old,</li>
    <li> I have been using this product over a year.  Tried to save money by going back to my old products.  Mistake.  This makes my skin feel more supple and moisturized.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years (at my dermatologists recommendation) and it&#x27;s the best!!!  Most creams make my rosacea (red facial flushes) appear, but the Neocutis Bio Restorative does not.  As stated, it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> I Love ir. My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel softer, slightly firmer.  Does seem to minimize fine wrinkles.  Have been using for over 3 years. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this product.  I have had mild rosatia and this product evened out my skin tone perfectly.  I am never without this product!  I have used Obagi and I like this much better.</li>
    <li> Works fine on sensitive aging skin. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Better than anything else I have used. would reorder</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. very pure, no DMAE. Use as part of a daily routine. I have very sensitive skin. I can easily tolerate Neocutis products. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and I use it every day!  This size is the best to order as it lasts and lasts as you just need a little bit!</li>
    <li> Of course I looooove Neocutis. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. This is the first time I ordered off Amazon and I could immediately tell the product I received was bad.  I know the smell of rancid oil. It is very distinct.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t realize Neocutis even contained oil, but I know the smell so well (I used to own a bady care line) that I put my glasses on and sure enough! Wheat germ oil. What a bummer! ;(. Makes me second guess the other products I order: Obagi, Skinceuticals, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of requesting a refund, I requested a replacement. The replacement arrived in only a couple days and... same thing! ;(.  Both were rancid ;(</li>
    <li> Follow the directions for clean skin and dry skin first then delicately pat it into forehead, cheeks, around mouth, and neck.  You&#x27;ll be satisfied with results..</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and the fine lines are not as apparent.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks so I&#x27;ll have to wait to see how my skin is over 3-4 months.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service experience from Express Health!!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product and Express Health.....&lt;br /&gt;Very good product for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I find the product very nourishing and creamy.  It was recommended by a cosmetician at my dermatology doctor&#x27;s office and I value her opinion very much.  You do not need to use moisturizer when you apply this.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams and this the most soothing and beneficial to my skin by far.  I have sensitive fair skin with occasional rosacea.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent. Makes skin radiant and Restores your skin as well.  I don&#x27;t use anything else on my skin anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used other product lines in this price range and with similar ingredients.  Neo Cutis Bio Crteam instantly makes my skin feel wonderful.  I am 55 years old and am stoppped freqenlyty and told what beantiflyu skin I have.  I would also rercommend using  Neo Cutis gerntle clensing cream .  My skin is soft and I have been told by my dermatologist that I have thin skin.,  This product is prefect foi me and receives 5 stars.  I am a small woman and have to be very careful at my age to ensure my&lt;br /&gt; face is moiturized correctly to avoid wrinkles.  I have been using this product for about 5 years and i have very few wrinkles.  thanks to Neo Cutis!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product...I have used it for 2 years......My skin always get compliments....and I am 63...One bottle lasts about 4-5 months...I use this first and then use Clinique 40 spf..sunscreen...(No spots and no wrinkles) ..I would suggest for anyone</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for face. Makes my skin look young again!!</li>
    <li> I was started on this by my dermatologist.  It is the best I have ever used for skin care.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Been using ths product for about 6 years. This weekend I was asked if my 50 year old friend was my dad. I am 63.</li>
    <li> Not slimy or greasy. Absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> Excellent Cream..........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream before. It&#x27;s great for after any procedure including mild peels. Lasts a long time. The new packaging is pretty while the product seems the same.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and I love it. A bit pricey but last a long time and worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it moisturizers all day!  It is a cream recommended for post laser treatment because of the PSP repair and heal skin.  I love it for everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews I read in a magazine.  It&#x27;s a little pricey and I would have been just as satisfied with a much lower priced product.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is very smooth, however I have not used it long enough to really tell how it is affecting my skin. According to dermatologist , it will help my wrinkles in 2/3 months.  Right now it is wonderful to have lotion on my face that I wasn&#x27;t allergic to.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I will continue to reorder this great product!</li>
    <li> No problems with my order.</li>
    <li> Am still evaluating these products but they are quickly becoming my new favorites. Very hydrating and it takes so little!</li>
    <li> When working for a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office, this was a product that staff used.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing Neocutis Bio restorative Skin cream for 5 years, best skin care product ever!  I have very sensitive skin and use daily morning and night. No breakouts or redness and small lines are gone. Although, it is expensive, worth every cent.  Also highly recommend using this with the Neocurtis eye cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is so rich. I bought it to use after a chemical and it was the only one that did not sting and yet kept my skin moist.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product . Keeps my skin moisturized</li>
    <li> An excellent product. Dermatologist recommended. Good to have the sunscreen feature with  a restorative product that is so good for the face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;Love the results.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well with eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the bio-creams. One package was tampered with and both smelled old and rancid despite an over 2 year exp. date stamp which I suspect is not legitimate. I know this product and these are either old or fake!</li>
    <li> I use this cream, the serum and the eye cream together, my face looks wonderful, and I only use a little amount each night, i can see and feel the difference,  great product, I have been using it for over a year, and it&#x27;s the best for your skin</li>
    <li> Worth the price and cheaper on Amazon than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  At 36 yrs old, I have sensitive skin, acne, and wrinkles.  This product moisturizes without feeling greasy or causing breakouts.  And, it allows me to use Retin-A without redness and dry skin.  My dermatologist instructions are to wash my face with mild cleanser (I use Cetaphil), wait 30 minutes to apply my Retin-A, and then wait 30 minutes before putting this moisturizer right over the Retin-A.  I usually don&#x27;t wait the full 30 minutes between Retin-A and moisturizer.  I just use the moisturizer right after I wash my face on nights I&#x27;m not using Retin-A.  I use the Neocutis product with spf for daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 years and they changed the ingredients. It no longer feels the same on my skin and has a unpleasant odor of chemicals (smells like rubber or toxic plastic). I am so disappointed. The last thing I want is a cream that smells like toxic plastic absorbing into my skin!!! I am never using this product again. I wish they would change it back.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product as I was able to see results immediately!  Easy to purchase and so easy to apply!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth and radiant, I like the packaging and its easy to travel with. I recommend it highly to women</li>
    <li> this is such a great product.  Having to use about fingernail amount it goes a long ways.  I love it, won&#x27;t let my boyfriend use on his face.. they never know how valuable a woman&#x27;s beauty products are.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS-SORRY I DID! IT SMELLS LIKE COOKING OIL AND LAYS ON YOUR SKIN LIKE IT TOO--NEEDLESS TO SAY IT DIDN&#x27;T IMPROVE MY SKIN--SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> great product.  just prefer the gel over the cream.  Cream is not oil free but gel is.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by m dermatologist several years ago and I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my doctor after surgery. He said it would help with healing the scars and also suggested I use it on my face for wrinkles. I bought it from him for $146 and then ordered another from Amazon for just under$100. My scars are extensive and I wanted to make sure I had enough. After over 2 months using this, I see no difference in the scars or wrinkles. Too expensive and ineffective!</li>
    <li> For those of you who are pro life this product contains an ingredient by the name of Processed Skin Cell Proteins, or PSP which comes from medically donated aborted human fetuses. Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams. Most of the line of this brand contains this ingredient, so if you are pro life or just find it creepy where the ingredient comes from I recommend you do not buy this product. If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year.  It seems to easily rub into my skin and feels satiny smooth. My face feels hydrated and cared for when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I started to used this product for the past 6 months because I have severe acne and it has help me healed my acne scars</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does wonders for my 50 + skin.  I just wish it was a little more affordable!</li>
    <li> I have used various other products to treat a scar below my eye.  The scar was from an impact injury rather than plastic surgery.  This treatment appears to remove some of the redness and swelling that occurs in the scar location.  Additionally massaging in the cream helps to prevent the keloiding of the scar.  I used this product in the past for other facial lacerations and have been happy with the success.  Because of the cost I used a cheaper product that was less effective, which caused me to bite the bullet and buy this.  Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several months, and I can see a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s not like surgery but it takes a few years off.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Very light but provides good moisture without causing breakouts. Best product I&#x27;ve utilized in a long time!! Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see difference than beauty counter hand cream.</li>
    <li> I initially saw this product at my dermatologist office and decided to try it.  I will never use anything else.  It keeps my skin looking young and healthy.</li>
