### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The color is perfect, purple!</li>
      <li>It is great for its purpose.</li>
      <li>These are alright, they provide good protection from UV rays but at the cost of great comfort.</li>
      <li>But over all it is a good brand</li>
      <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to for a good price.</li>
      <li>Good price for a good product.</li>
      <li>This item was shipped quickly and it works great, thank you!</li>
      <li>My one note to the seller - it would be nice if color could be picked.  </li>
      <li>But it would have been nice to get what I thought I was buying</li>
      <li>They are very flexible, excellent vision out of them and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I love these glasses, and from now on if i need anything else, i will be buying off them.</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased these.</li>
      <li>But great seller - shipped fast, no issues.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably be using these until I can get a better pair.</li>
      <li>Love these goggles.  </li>
      <li>I love my goggles, i love who sent it to me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m overall very happy with the value of what I got for the price.</li>
      <li>you ...... will ........... love ..........</li>
      <li>and I switched to these because I wanted more protection.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to people who want good protection and dont really care about comfort.</li>
      <li>it is just as it said it was, i need a pair of goggles for my own, because the place i tan does not offer them... airived very fast</li>
      <li>and they are super cute too.  </li>
      <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for a secure string this isn&#x27;t a product for you.</li>
      <li>However, they don&#x27;t fit my eye shape at all.  </li>
      <li>these fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>The Shipping on this was way more than the glasses themselves, but they were exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>The pink color is bright and adorable.  </li>
      <li>these were the last to arrive - they are so superior to any of the others.  </li>
      <li>These are soft, with a tall nose bridge - both very important if you want comfortable sun goggles.  </li>
      <li>I love the goggles and plan to order more for back up.</li>
      <li>but if you have the string just tied just right</li>
      <li>These are pretty good - average goggles.  </li>
      <li>Overall they&#x27;re ok.</li>
      <li>At first I thought the string did not come with the goggles</li>
      <li>I got mine in silver, I would&#x27;ve liked pink</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor if you have large eyes</li>
      <li>Really like these.  </li>
      <li>The outer corner is designed very well.</li>
      <li>These cup to your eyes very well</li>
      <li>Not like it really matters.</li>
      <li>They cover nicely on the side, so there is no light seepage.  </li>
      <li>I have round, prominent eyes that are large, and these goggles don&#x27;t cover my eye socket; rather, they rest right on the eyeball, making them completely unwearable.  </li>
      <li>but I prefer the flexible one only cause it has a full circle hole in the side vs just the clip like on here.</li>
      <li>They sent the wrong color, but they fit nicely.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.    </li>
      <li>the nose bridge is high</li>
      <li>For most people, especially those with smaller eyes that are not as round, these would probably be an okay choice.</li>
      <li>The seller even added 3 different little tanning lotion packets in the shipment that was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>My new tanning place doesn&#x27;t have goggles, and I needed some...</li>
      <li>The strap has to be inserted yourself when you get them - which can take a few minutes, but if you are patient, that works just fine.  </li>
      <li>I would have preferred colorful, but got black goggles.  </li>
      <li>Well they are not pink.</li>

<li> Well they are not pink.</li>
<li> I was surprised these goggles had a black elastic strap.  </li>
<li> I have two other pairs that push into my eye sockets and hurt to use, but these have a wide and soft eye cup - yay!  </li>
<li> Other goggles instead have a little circle where you just loop it and tie it which is much easier.</li>
<li> The only problem I have is that the sides where you put the string in instead of having a circle it has an opening to put them in which is too loose.</li>
<li> The only issue I had was that the string kept slipping out of the side notch</li>
<li> Mine are grey...</li>
<li> Would send back, but not worth the shipping costs.</li>
<li> so I had to tie them loosely to avoid this issue.</li>
<li> It does no more and no less than it is supposed to do.</li>
<li> They are also comfy and have minimal coverage on the nosepiece</li>
<li> They&#x27;re about the size of an average eyeball (I guess) and</li>
<li> These are your typical goggles you would find in any tanning salon.</li>
<li> and they even threw in 3 little tanning packages for my enjoyment.  </li>
<li> We had no light leakage with them.  </li>
<li> Those packets alone are usually a few dollars each at the tanning salon.</li>
<li> The part that touches your face (oval over your eyes) is not sharp but you can feel it in your eye (weird.)</li>
<li> The edges are very hard and dig into the skin around my eyes.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d buy again if these got lost or broken.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s really thin &amp; it attaches to the goggles by clipping in the plastic groove on them.</li>
<li> The string they send with you is weird</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought this was going to be like the flexible one that i&#x27;ve ordered off of a another website.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that the string can pop out on the sides of the tanning goggles but if you have the string just tied just right it will not pop off the side clip thingy. But over all it is a good brand but I prefer the flexible one only cause it has a full circle hole in the side vs just the clip like on here. Cause all you have to do is just tie it and that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> These are soft, with a tall nose bridge - both very important if you want comfortable sun goggles.  I have two other pairs that push into my eye sockets and hurt to use, but these have a wide and soft eye cup - yay!  Highly recommend.    My one note to the seller - it would be nice if color could be picked.  Or, if you need a note sent to designate color choice, say that on the description!  I would have preferred colorful, but got black goggles.  But great seller - shipped fast, no issues.</li>
    <li> These goggles seem sturdy enough.  However, they don&#x27;t fit my eye shape at all.  I have round, prominent eyes that are large, and these goggles don&#x27;t cover my eye socket; rather, they rest right on the eyeball, making them completely unwearable.  Do yourself a favor if you have large eyes like I do and skip these.  For most people, especially those with smaller eyes that are not as round, these would probably be an okay choice.</li>
    <li> These cup to your eyes very well and no UV rays can get in. The outer corner is designed very well. The only problem I have is that the sides where you put the string in instead of having a circle it has an opening to put them in which is too loose. Everytime I use these in the stand up the second I either adjust them or pull them over my head the string pops out which is a nuisance. I knocked a star off for the string issue. Other goggles instead have a little circle where you just loop it and tie it which is much easier.</li>
    <li> These are alright, they provide good protection from UV rays but at the cost of great comfort. The string they send with you is weird it&#x27;s really thin &amp; it attaches to the goggles by clipping in the plastic groove on them. It&#x27;s not a hole the string goes through so if you&#x27;re looking for a secure string this isn&#x27;t a product for you. I got mine in silver, I would&#x27;ve liked pink but I&#x27;m not complaining. They&#x27;re about the size of an average eyeball (I guess) and the nose bridge is high so it doesn&#x27;t leave a line. The part that touches your face (oval over your eyes) is not sharp but you can feel it in your eye (weird.) Overall they&#x27;re ok. I was using Podz before and I switched to these because I wanted more protection. I&#x27;ll probably be using these until I can get a better pair. Would recommend to people who want good protection and dont really care about comfort.</li>
    <li> I love my goggles, i love who sent it to me.  The color is perfect, purple! and they even threw in 3 little tanning packages for my enjoyment.  I love these glasses, and from now on if i need anything else, i will be buying off them. Thanks so much!</li>

    <li> The Shipping on this was way more than the glasses themselves, but they were exactly as shown. The seller even added 3 different little tanning lotion packets in the shipment that was a nice surprise. I received lavender as my color. I&#x27;m overall very happy with the value of what I got for the price. Those packets alone are usually a few dollars each at the tanning salon. Thank you!</li>
    <li> At first I thought the string did not come with the goggles but it was neatly tucked into the instruction paper. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to for a good price. Bought for use at my tanning salon since for some freaking reason their goggles never have the elastic attached</li>
    <li> Really like these.  My new tanning place doesn&#x27;t have goggles, and I needed some... these fit the bill.  Good price for a good product. I am glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> I think we&#x27;ve tried all of the tanning goggles now and these were the last to arrive - they are so superior to any of the others.  They are very flexible, excellent vision out of them and comfortable.  We had no light leakage with them.  I can&#x27;t praise them enough!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them.  The edges are very hard and dig into the skin around my eyes.  Would send back, but not worth the shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I got gray.  Fast delivery and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> you ...... will ........... love .......... this ..................item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........ you</li>
    <li> It is great for its purpose. It does no more and no less than it is supposed to do. I&#x27;d buy again if these got lost or broken.</li>
    <li> Love these goggles.  They do just what they are supposed to and they are super cute too.  The pink color is bright and adorable.  Matches my tanning bed pillow too...perfect!</li>
    <li> These are your typical goggles you would find in any tanning salon. The only issue I had was that the string kept slipping out of the side notch so I had to tie them loosely to avoid this issue. They still stay on though.</li>
    <li> it is just as it said it was, i need a pair of goggles for my own, because the place i tan does not offer them... airived very fast</li>
    <li> Well they are not pink. Mine are grey... Not like it really matters. But it would have been nice to get what I thought I was buying</li>
