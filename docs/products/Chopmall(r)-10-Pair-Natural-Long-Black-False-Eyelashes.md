<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was a great buy, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love love! We be getting these again! Easy to apply, look natural heavier then what I&#x27;m used to but still great!!💙</li>
    <li> They got here weeks before expected shipping! They do tear when pulling them out somethimes, but they&#x27;re still good</li>
    <li> I received these in like 2 weeks and these are far from natural, but I knew that from the picture. These are exactly what ai ordered and I love them! They fit my style and are so gorgeous. Super easy to apply compared to others I&#x27;ve bought. If I ever run out, I will definitly repurchase!</li>
    <li> Can I say these have to be for Halloween or something because they do  not look natural at all. So if your looking for lashes for a costume party then I would give it a 5 but for now like I expected it to be I am so disappointed not even to shape on the eye lid right.With glue it wont even stay right on the eyes. I tell you for a character mode I would def recommend you would really look like an anime character.</li>
    <li> They are glamorous for the times I want to up my look. I highly recommend lots of bending prior to applying them to you eye lid. The ends will lift if not properly bent and wiggled. The lashes arrived earlier than promised and I recommend them for the beginner or for those who prefer heavier/thicker lashes. They are very long and must be cut to the length of your eyelid - like most lashes. These are also excellent for learning to apply lashes because they are cheap enough to toss as you are learning to apply them.</li>
    <li> They are okay, all plastic but I only payed 1.20</li>
    <li> Very good price and fast shipping. These lashes are thick and a bit heavy but unlike them for the effect I want.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these lashes I&#x27;m very happy with them. People compliment often which makes me like them more.</li>
    <li> too thick some of them but ok product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these... They weren&#x27;t very flexible or comfortable.</li>
    <li> They look good, haven&#x27;t tried them yet so I don&#x27;t know how well they will glue. Downfall is they took a really long time to be delivered. Great price!!</li>
    <li> These are the weirdest eyelashes I have ever bought. I expected them to be thick and sorta natural. But they came and they&#x27;re clumpy and not natural looking at all.</li>
    <li> Thank you ....LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Gf8 lashes love it...</li>
    <li> The beautiful thing about these lashes is how well they photograph. I literally had my camera within inches of them and the gave off the most amazing sheen. They are definitely worth the purchase and with a price range like this , can you really complain? Me thinks not .</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t stick, even with the best glue. I threw two pairs away, will keep trying the rest.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive, and it came in fair condition.  Box was a bit crushed, but the lashes looked good. Although the title of these lashes say &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34;, its far from it. The lashes are very thick at the base, and doesn&#x27;t give a very natural look to your eyes, so its disappointing. If you&#x27;re looking for fake lashes that look fake, this is for you!</li>
    <li> There ok. Not what I expected but they do work</li>
    <li> The price was great but theyre a little stiff other than they&#x27;re good</li>
    <li> They are good for Halloween but definitely not for everyday wear.  The lashes do not look real.</li>
    <li> NOT taken care of at all they came in and they were all mashed and deformed, i would not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Love them easy to clean and reuse</li>
    <li> They looked so fake I didn&#x27;t even want to try them on. They didn&#x27;t even look anything like eyelashes. Play dolls have better looking ones.</li>
    <li> Perfect. There&#x27;s plenty and they are amazing quality. They&#x27;re long and sturdy and look great</li>
    <li> I love the lashes, yet this is the third or forth time I have ordered these and they arrive with the package smashed and the lashes are flat with no curl, and they don&#x27;t curl very well with a eyelash curler.  If they could package them in a better way so they can not get smashed, they would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Too stiff and not natural looking.</li>
    <li> Bought this months ago, still have some.</li>
    <li> pretty good. great price.</li>
    <li> They were really thick and thy didnt look right on me but thats not the providers fault.</li>
    <li> Great quality lashes. Not flimsy or fragile very strong but comfortable. And you get so many uses out of one pair.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time (like two months) but the price was very reasonable and the lashes are good quality so I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Real plastiky, so if you are going for a more natural look, this lash wouldn&#x27;t be suitable at all. Great otherwise though</li>
    <li> before i go throught these i&#x27;m going to buy 10 packs at on time, are really nice and the price i can&#x27;t beat that. I also recieved the package a lot sooner than i was told. I think it was about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I wish i can see more pictures.</li>
    <li> So just received my package after 22 days. The box was crushed by the mail but doesn&#x27;t matter the eyelashes itself are pretty long and fluffy. cant wait to try them on</li>
    <li> very cheap looking  not worth the few dollars I spent on it</li>
    <li> They are like in the picture.</li>
    <li> As good as the expensive ones</li>
    <li> Love them will be buying more</li>
    <li> Cannot beat it for the price, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them, they&#x27;re not stiff or hard to apply. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Lovely, thank you, I received it sooner than expected. I wish there were 20 pair for that price, but they are lovely no less. thank you and God bless. xoxoxox</li>
    <li> eyelashes were very thick and plastic. Not at all what I expected. I would not suggest purchasing!</li>
    <li> There a little tough to keep bent to the shape of lid</li>
    <li> They came completely smashed unusable</li>
    <li> They are a little bit more heavier that what they look in the picture....</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with the eye lashes I received. They are heavier, darker in color than they appear in the photo and a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use them but the glue doesn&#x27;t seem to work on them :(</li>
    <li> Like them which the package would tell you how to match the correct pair for the right left eye</li>
    <li> They look very Hollywood. They are a bit big and fluffy for me. But I Will try them next time I go out. Believe me if you like big eyelashes  you will love these . I think you get at least 8 pair. And they different types. The price was incredible,  like less than 5 dollars.</li>
    <li> Love love  my new favorite ex to use</li>
    <li> Very thin and are not like I thought they would</li>
    <li> Not happy with these at all. Very flimsy &amp; unmanageable! No stars actually!!</li>
    <li> I luv luv luv these lashes they are easy to apply takeoff and clean no shedding well worth the money will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> they look awesome have not got to wear a pair yet but, will soon still working on my other pack..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all it looks too fake</li>
    <li> Love these! Good quality for the price</li>
    <li> Love this eyelashes lasted me more than a month</li>
    <li> Very nice long lashes, comfortable to wear and easy to put on. I do have to cut them to my size as anybody else would. Very please with my purchase. Thanks. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> They look pretty false and they&#x27;re a little hard to put on</li>
    <li> I love the lashes I always purchase them cheap but I&#x27;m cool with it length is perfect just the right fleek look</li>
    <li> These lashes are the worst ever the don&#x27;t bend and they hurt your eye lids when u apply them the hair seem stuck together do not recommend at sll</li>
    <li> I would give no stars these were stiff and hard to apply the didn&#x27;t even last an hour before they were coming off.</li>
    <li> These lashes look very plastic. They shine in certain light and its unflattering and definitely unnatural. I tend to like lashes that give more length rather than volume, &amp;these lashes do both. The fit is pretty awkward, &amp;I had to cut them to fit my eyes (but thats normal)&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying them again.&lt;br /&gt;But I did give them to a friend who&#x27;s new to lashes and she used them to practice so it wasn&#x27;t a waste of my three dollars.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for HALLOWEEN lashes these will due!&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re not bad!&lt;br /&gt;Just not for me!</li>
    <li> I bought these and had someone apply them for me. They are fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> got them for my daughter.she liked them .better quality than cheap looking store bought lashes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes. They&#x27;re extremely high quality for only 2 bucks. I wear them almost everyday. They aren&#x27;t heavy at all. The lashes took almost a month to arrive at my house(in the States) but that&#x27;s understandable considering they came from Asia. I love this seller though, and I definitely recommend buying from them.</li>
    <li> Loved them. They worked great for my mother, my aunt and my halloween costumes. They didn&#x27;t come off or fall apart when taking them off, they were soft, they weren&#x27;t heavy like others I&#x27;ve had (I forgot I was wearing them until I went to take my make up off) and they looked great.</li>
    <li> Loved the better than I expected. I wiii shop with this seller again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get these. They are made out of plastic and look horrible!! Waste of money and time, they don&#x27;t stick with eyelash adhesive. They don&#x27;t bend no matter how much you alter them . They took forever to arrive and when you FINALLY get them it&#x27;s pure utterly disappointment!</li>
    <li> Great for costume use -- NOT FOR EVERYDAY!</li>
    <li> These lashes are terrible.</li>
    <li> I order these on a regular basis.  I am probably addicted to wearing them.  Love the look.  They do take a few weeks to arrive so buy a few.</li>
    <li> I luved my lashed thanks</li>
    <li> I always have such good luck with these. I usually just trim off the edges to make them fit the shape of my eyes, but I always come back!</li>
    <li> LOVE them the look so real! I have people stop and ask me every time I wear them if they are my real lashes or not!</li>
    <li> they are great for the price can olny use one but you cant beat the price</li>
    <li> good item &amp; service thank you</li>
    <li> horrible!! Not what i expected. The material looks really fake, unless your&#x27;e looking for something for halloween for an ugly zombie.</li>
