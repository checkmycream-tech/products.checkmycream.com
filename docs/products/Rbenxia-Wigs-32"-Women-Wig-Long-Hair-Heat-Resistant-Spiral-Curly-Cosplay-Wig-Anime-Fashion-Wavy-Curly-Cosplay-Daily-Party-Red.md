<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s too small. It would fit on a baby&#x27;s head. The inside tore apart, and the hair falls out when you brush it. Horrible quality.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a wonderfully good quality wig! Brushing was not a problem! The bangs are a bit hard to style, as they are a bit thin in the center to wards the front of the mesh and can easily show the mesh if separated, but after cutting them to a good length and adding a bit of body, they were great. Fit perfectly as well. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Arrived on the day of Halloween just in time, 2-4 weeks before the estimated delivery date! The red was a little duller than it appears to be in the picture and by the end of the night the curls were matted down. It was definitely a single use wig, but that is what I bought it for. It came out of the package in perfect condition no awkward kinks or bumps, ready to wear, silky smooth. Shorter than it appears on the mannequin. Only came to about my armpits. Unparalleled quality for the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money, and the shipping was actually must faster than stated. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great wig, the bangs are a little longer then I expected but I can work with it. I did not like the hair cap they sent with it, it was to loose, so I had to get a new one.</li>
    <li> It came in a decent time but not the time promised and the color was a bit off. But the overall product was good for the price</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong with this wig. It&#x27;s really long, and although it tangles easy it still looks nice. My problem with it was that it was a completely different color. The wig I received was vibrant almost neon red, which still worked it just wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. See photo for color and length. Would have been a better rating if they gave an accurate representation of the vibrant color.</li>
    <li> Wife absolutely loves this and was perfect for her Halloween 2014 costume. Quality was great for the price ---&amp;#62; great value</li>
    <li> My GF loved this wig. She used it for her Halloween costume. Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, vibrant wig but it had an extremely strong chemical smell that made it impossible for me to wear. The smell was overwhelming. I own many wigs and have never encountered a smell like this before. Unfortunately I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Love this! This is the perfect little mermaid wig, it&#x27;s long and sexy and the color rocks!</li>
    <li> This wig is NOT dark red. It is pink!! I am extremely unhappy with this purchase. There is no way I can possibly make this work. And wigs cannot be returned for health reasons so I am stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Great wig and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Awesome wig for the price!  It does get a bit frizzy but I just sprayed my comb with hairspray and brushed through.  Good coverage, bangs are long but a bobby pin gives it a great look and coverage for the hairline.  I would buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing! Exactly as described, I love it! Also arrived a day earlier ^_^</li>
    <li> Great color and styles well. A bit big for my head, even with adjustable straps.</li>
    <li> WAS PERFECT for my Ariel Halloween costume!</li>
    <li> nice red wig needs more curls and to be shorter hair</li>
    <li> Love, love, love !!!!</li>
    <li> Fair quality. Thin, but adequate for the pool party. You can see the mesh cap through the hair. Tangles very easily.</li>
    <li> My daughter needed this for her under the sea dance and it fit and looked great.  She loved it and she still uses it every once in a while just for fun.</li>
    <li> After a faulty wig was sent by a different carrier (not amazon) I ordered this last minute for halloween and it came so quickly, and was the hit of the party! Everyone thought it was my real hair, which was surprising but flattering!</li>
    <li> This does not look like the wig pictured in the product description, not at all. First it is not a dark red, it is a bright, bright red...little mermaid cartoon red. It is also thin at the top so if you mess with the bangs or don&#x27;t have it placed just right, the built in cap will show through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig does fit nice and long on me, it falls almost to the middle of my back, and except for the bangs it is very easy to brush. I was worried that the hair would come lose when I brushed it but it was fine. A hairnet was also included, it helped with getting all my hair under control so I could put the wig on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This would make a very nice costume wig, and for the price it&#x27;s actually really nice. The curls look great and were very pretty and my husband thought it looked cute. I think this would make an excellent wig for Halloween. My young granddaughters love dressing up in dresses and wigs for the plays they like to make up, so this will go to them. I think they will have a blast wearing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Free product sample received in exchange for review purposes.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit more red looking in the picture than in person. at least for me it was. mine was more like a red head type red rather than a cherry red. other than that I like it. makes me look like a lantina little mermaid haha.</li>
    <li> its one of those wigs where you would have to pull on to make it fit your head. there are also random short pieces of hair while the rest is perfectly long. looks great for photo shoots.</li>
    <li> The wig itself is good for the price - the hair was quite curly when it arrived, not tangled, and the bangs were still in the advertised shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest criticism is the color - I ordered the &#x27;Dark Red&#x27; wig, but the wig is closer to a cherry red.</li>
    <li> For the price you cannot go wrong. The color is perfect and the length spot on. Well made and wears well.</li>
    <li> Wig is as full a it looks. Love the style/design. Price was awesome too.</li>
    <li> looks very cheap.. and ends are not curled like advertised. Terrible product my advice I&#x27;d for no one to buy this wig.</li>
    <li> It looks pretty accurate to the picture, but it&#x27;s a bit more of a brighter red than I was expecting. Also I did not receive a wig cap with my purchase, but I own several already so that&#x27;s fine. All in all, I&#x27;m still pretty happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig, the color is gorgeous! The red is more vibrant than in the picture. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Perfect !! The color is amazing</li>
    <li> It arrived super fast! It&#x27;s a lovely color, a bit shiny but nothing some fabric softener won&#x27;t fix. The only thing I was a smidge upset about was that there was a bit of a tangle in it and the track was showing pretty bad. I had to flip the bangs the other way to cover it. Overall I love it and it&#x27;s great for my poison ivy costume.</li>
    <li> Came 2 days earlier than expected, was very pleased. Its very long, and its a great fit on the head. You can use heat, but not very high heat. Very flat on the head, might want to tease that a little, other than that, its pretty good. 😊😊</li>
    <li> I got this as a last minute Poison Ivy wig and it was perfect! It&#x27;s incredibly long, super silky, and stays put despite the volume, and without squeezing your head like a grape. I ended up using it for an elf as well since it was so comfy and beautiful. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more wigs from this seller.</li>
    <li> This wig is so silky and long! It goes to the middle of my back just as expected. Shipping was a little long but came at last designated arrival date. I gave it a 4/5 because its a little thin at the end and a little fuzzy but I half expected it from previous pictures I&#x27;ve seen, nothing a little fabric softener cant fix (the fuzziness anyway)</li>
    <li> I love the color...the style...it fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> It was not as thick as I would like. I returned this item. If I were to have kept it I would have needed to get another wig to fill in the spots on this wig. The color was good and the length. It was really shiny so it was very fake looking but it would get the job done. Unfortunately I want better wigs for my princess company and this one won&#x27;t cut it for Ariel</li>
    <li> The wig was much longer than I expected it to be and the bangs are a little awkward but the waves and color are perfect!</li>
    <li> Okay so for $8 not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is shorter than expected,  lighter shade of red (almost pink) than I was hoping for. It us very frizzy, comes out very easily and is overall not what I was expecting from the picture and reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I&#x27;m using it for a poison ivy costume and it looks decent against the greens and blue.</li>
    <li> It was a cheap wig that was cheaply made, but it&#x27;s not completely awful. The color is much brighter than in the picture, I have to edit all my photos with this wig on because it looks bright pink in the pictures. It&#x27;s more of a neon red color, very bright and bold. It&#x27;s long as described, but not as thick as I would have imagined. I&#x27;m using it for my Arial cosplay and it goes quite well with it. I&#x27;ve worn it more than once because I&#x27;ve always lightly brushed it to keep the curls intact and not have knots every which way.</li>
    <li> Bought this wig for a friend of mine and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I loved this wig! it was perfect!</li>
    <li> I am sure my daughter will buy more wigs for her cos play hobby.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous full, long red wavy hair. Slightly less curly than picture, but has nice waves...absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3b48c60e0a5c20e110505f200c1591bd]] Had to bring this outside so the fire red color could be truly captured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long wig for under twenty bucks? You bet! This is a great example of bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;This is a costume wig, not a $500 &#x27;real&#x27; wig. As you can see, it&#x27;s long, with a lot of body and movement.&lt;br /&gt;Not meant for an extra large head, but will be fine for small, medium,and most large heads.&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be good for Little Mermaid costumes, witches, Halloween, drag (if you have a smaller head, lol!), dolly, pin-up, and a number of anime characters. Tie ribbons in it, or choose a lighter color for Lolita or schoolgirl cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be styled and, of course, cut. It&#x27;s shown on the model after being taken out, given a shake, and positioned in place. No additional styling, just finger placement.&lt;br /&gt;Arrives in the traditional net, place it back in the net for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An open cap keeps it from becoming overly hot.&lt;br /&gt;Super fun look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t open the video on your device, let me know and I&#x27;ll give you a YouTube link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

    <li> The wig is red just like expected I was worried it would be pink from the reviews but I got a nice red wig, it was longer then I need so I had to cut it a bit but I think I should work well for my Ivy cosplay, but I think It would work best for an arial cosplay</li>
    <li> Item was very small, compared to pic seen</li>
    <li> This is a very, very long high-fashion, rusty vibrant red wig for costume purposes. On that basis, I give it 5 glorious stars!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not order this thinking you can wear it to school or work, unless the point of wearing a wig for you is to wear something that shouts out, \\&quot;Hey, look at me. I&#x27;m wearing a wig!!\\&quot; And if you are -- no judgement -- more power to you. Enjoy that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happily got this wig sample for review because my purpose was entertainment for an upcoming party. The price is AMAZINGLY LOW! I can&#x27;t even imagine how they made a wig like this for so little. The texture is really lovely. Quite silky and shiny. As a matter of fact, I would certainly coming back for other wigs from this company, because I am so impressed by what they can manufacture for such a reasonable price. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> pretty good wig for Poison Ivy cosplay</li>
    <li> Lighter than the picture. Very Soft.</li>
    <li> Great costume wig :) It is soft and not itchy at all like some of the other cheap wigs out there.</li>
    <li> This is a fun wig for dressing up. It is a bright red color with just a hint of orange to it. It arrived in good condition and was easy to finger through and get to look nice. Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> For the price, the wig was great. It&#x27;s brighter red than the photo but will work the the Phoenix costume I got it for. It&#x27;s not as curly as this photo and it is a little straggly but for the price, I&#x27;m happy enough.</li>
    <li> Beautiful red wig with very quick turn around time!  Amazing quality at such a low price.</li>
    <li> Did the job, color not as shown and started to tangle and fall apart half way through the night but for the price was worth every penny</li>
    <li> As described, very bright red (little mermaidish) but fits good and looks well made.</li>
    <li> The product worked well for my little mermaid outfit.</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite the same as in the picture there doesn&#x27;t see to be much black mixed into the red and the red reminds me of Ariel.</li>
    <li> It slides alot doesn&#x27;t want to stay on</li>
    <li> This wig is stunning. The bangs are a little long but nothing you can&#x27;t pin back, Its long and the curls are great. Works amazing with a curling iron</li>
    <li> Not as red as the pic shows but it&#x27;s thick, fits well, and will work for my Halloween costume</li>
    <li> this wig is really good quality and so long and pretty, i absolutely love it for what i am using it for!!! love love love it</li>
    <li> This is not for an average head size, this is only for children.</li>
    <li> A bit thin, but otherwise good quality!</li>
    <li> it doesnt look like the picture</li>
    <li> Well, what I can say is, that I&#x27;ve order from here before, and got a beautiful candy red wig (shown in picture). Sadly, it was a wig that was planned to be my &amp;#34;test wig&amp;#34; which is now just a chopped pixie wig. Wanting one again in such a pleasing color, I ordered one again. BUT after such anticipating waiting, I opened it up only to stumble acrossed a PINK one (the other picture). Very disappointing! I acually already have a pink one exactly like it, just a tad brighter. I will be ordering another one, since I expect mix ups to happen, but still upset.</li>
    <li> Not the red you would expected it looks like a faded red light orange</li>
    <li> Not a great hairline, the black shows through and the baby hairs or new growth at the front are very choppy. You get what you pay for. Very shiny, all one tone. More of a raspberry red. No wig cap included. Kinda thin? But good for a cosplay I guess.</li>
    <li> It was niice but is all frizy! And its still in box for Halloween I hope I can fix it :( but I guess that&#x27;s what ill get for $15 /:</li>
    <li> Great quality... Exactly what was needed for the stage production of &amp;#34;Little Mermaid&amp;#34; I designed. Didn&#x27;t expect longevity but it&#x27;s lasted and will be stored away for future use.</li>
    <li> Love the color and love it came early but it got tangled up really bad when I wore it at the convention but it made my cosplay more realistic of who I was so it was still amazing.</li>
    <li> This is NOT dark red, as indicated. Otherwise I would have given it a better star rating.</li>
    <li> Nasty and very nappy! Waste of money</li>
    <li> Had to make some adjustments but curl stayed good.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I Love this wig. It was so much better than expected. I&#x27;ll define be buying other colors. It was perfect for my costume.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! I recently had a bad product experience with Mapofbeauty bit this wig makes me feel better about buying wigs again!</li>
    <li> This wig looks and feels good.  It is great for roleplaying, and is comfortable and has a good fit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s very silky and nice looking, but there is not enough volume to the wig for my liking. It looks funny in the back because there&#x27;s not enough hair underneath. Not something I would wear unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Alright first of all: it came in time, no early, no late. The color I got wasn&#x27;t a dark wine color, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine, it&#x27;s more of a cherry red. (Yes my face is crossed out for a reason) and yes, right after I took it out of the package and tried it on, it shed... Pretty badly too. but that didn&#x27;t make it look any different. Also, it didn&#x27;t come with the wig cap as promised. Other than all of that, it feels and looks like real hair. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Kinda Pink. Not good enough for Ariel.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality, great price, great color arrived quickly from this company.</li>
    <li> it was a great wig-but color was way oof</li>
    <li> Almost too thin at the top but it works, everything is covered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit more bright in reality,  same length, overall is fine! Looks pretty real!</li>
    <li> Wig was packaged nicely and arrived very promptly. The color is very vibrant, which is exactly what I was going for! It is a good length and the curls are nice and full at the bottom. I have no issues with the wig cap showing/thinness. My wig is in excellent condition and it is plenty thick for the look I was going for. As with any synthetic wig, the hair is easily tangled.</li>
    <li> Very tight on head. Uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I love this wig so much. So soft and so long and curly I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
    <li> Had trouble tracking the item but did recieve it on time/earlier than expected. Color is not as vibrant in person however does photograph well (looks redder). Bangs were WAY too long - basically a bob, had to be cut. Curls were not as numerous as in picture, but acceptable. Material does seem prone to tangling (have only tried on twice as am saving for Halloween). Hair is thin on top, even a little  styling, parting, side sweeping will show wig cap. That being said...this wig was $10. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap once or twice wear item this should suit you fine.</li>
    <li> The color was slightly different, a little on the lighter side, like a brownish red. I was concern it wouldn&#x27;t get here in time for halloween, but then I emailed them and it came 3 weeks earlier than it said it would (!!!!) The size is great and I can definitely wear more than one time. I just wish the color was a tiny bit brighter. But, overall, pretty good.</li>
    <li> This wig served it&#x27;s purpose but I won&#x27;t wear it again. It was super frizzy even though I sprayed it down with hair spray and it got tangled SOOOOO easily. It was kind of frustrating to wear all night.</li>
    <li> Nothing at all like this picture, it is thin and bright bright red.  Very misleading picture, no where near this length or any curls. After reading everyones reviews, I am wondering if we get different wigs. There is no way anyone is going to think the wig I received is real hair like some people said.</li>
    <li> My family is actively involved in a local theater and always in need of wigs.  I don&#x27;t like to color my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair for plays ans so we have a few wigs that she can wear for the plays. This is the first red wig we have.  My kids thing that someone in our house should be The Little Mermaid in this wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very long wig - 32 inches.  The hair is very red and curly.  The hair was a little tangly when I first pulled it out but I just ran my hands through it and it was fine.  The wig did shed a little but not much.  The wig is thick enough and layered that I cannot see the underneath cap through the wig.  The cap that is attached to the wig is a lace like cap and has two adjustable straps so that once you get it on, you can tighten it so that it will stay on. The bangs on this wig are a little long but you could easily trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We compared this wig to others we have bought at Halloween stores and this wig is so much higher quality. It actually stays on the head well and can look very natural (well purple isn&#x27;t natural but it really looks like real hair). It could be styled with clips or worn pulled back. My daughter plans to wear this on Halloween just for fun. This could be worn just for fun when looking for a different look or for a play or Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided as a free promotional sample in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Not as dark of a red but it still a good wig for the price I mean it&#x27;s very thin</li>
    <li> Not as long as it says, looks extremely fake( and I was using it for Halloween), hair falls out like crazy. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this wig before and I was very satisfied with it.  However I ordered this one for my friend and it was no where near the color of the previous one or in the picture.&lt;br /&gt; I suppose every batch comes out a little different but this one varies far from the range of the color.  The color looks as if the one that I own or the one in the picture faded from sunlight.  It is more of a dusty brownish red shade rather than wine red.&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to bother returning this, it would be too expensive and not worth the time.  I&#x27;ll find another use for it.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is a very nice quality but it is not the color I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, the wig did not show much baldness, (except for if I parted the bangs a certain way).&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic material feels like real hair but be aware, since this is a very long wig it will tangle easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this order 4 or 5 stars if I received the color I wanted and if the wig was not so messily packaged (it looked as if the wig were shoved into the bag without much care) which caused it to be very tangled. The packaging for the wig was what looked like a black trash bag (for small garbage cans) that was wrapped around in tape a few times (which I had to peel off before I could even open the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Previous wigs I have ordered from this user were of a much better quality than this order.  In previous purchases the wigs were neatly packaged and treated with care, they also came out the correct color as shown in the picture.  Halloween season and the number of orders they are getting is what I am guessing would effect this as opposed to the much higher quality wigs that I ordered in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For the price this wig is decent however I do not believe it was worth the wait to get the results that I did.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what it looks like, and exactly what I expected. Arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> The wig is quite thin, tracks are visible and is not the same color shown, shipping back. This happens when you bargain shop, you get conned</li>
    <li> Great wig used it to be Ariel (the little mermaid) for Halloween  it looks nice and long tangles a bit like any other wig</li>
    <li> This was the first wig that I&#x27;ve gotten that was styled, and I was cautious because often times I&#x27;ve heard that when you order a wig that looks styled in the picture, you have to style it yourself. It comes exactly like in the picture and fits so comfortably that it feels like its almost your natural hair.</li>
    <li> The length is not the same. It is curly, but I am not sure if it will stay the same way. I&#x27;ll know by Halloween since I&#x27;ll be wearing it longer. It will show the cap underneath if you try to section the hair. It is designed to let the hair be left down. The bangs are not that bad.</li>
    <li> Not as long as pictured and very lightly wavy (unlike the picture) and bright bright red, would work for a little mermaid cosplay.</li>
    <li> Bright Red - looks like i&#x27;m going to be Ariel next year. I loved this wig, but not the bangs. Hard for me to deal with, but I&#x27;ve never been much for doing my hair. Looked great and really changed my look!</li>
    <li> Great wig and beautiful color. I ordered two to add more volume.</li>
    <li> this is gorgeous!! i wanted to wear it to work as a tutor, but they wouldn&#x27;t let me because it was so vavava voom! but it&#x27;s perfect for what i need</li>
    <li> Great quality very vibrant color!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig and one from https://www.airyhair.com/clip-in-hair-extensions.html to compare since price was pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my conclusion both are amazing but I&#x27;d go with Airy for the time being and mainly because it has real hair for same price</li>
    <li> Right amount of thickness. Has a spot in front where u can see the underneath but it&#x27;s no bigy when you move the hair there abit. Great color... Different then I expected it to look, looks similar to the picture but you can tell it&#x27;s not the same. I still love it anyway. It is high quality for the money it cost.</li>
    <li> Lobe this wig!  It. Looks and feels so real and will go perfect with dressing up as Ariel for my Princess Parties! Thank you!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my page at www.facebook.com/facepaintdesigns !</li>
    <li> I wish I could post a picture of this wig, the color(more of a burgundy maroonish color) is very pretty, but the wig cap is pretty tight and idk if I can fit my hair into the wig at all. This wig came with strings sticking out of the wig and dangling along with the hair. You can see the nasty tan color of the strings through the hair. The hair is very thin, extremely thin! I still plan on wearing this but I plan on taking a marker to the fabric in the wig to make it closer to the color of the hair. I am also need to rethink my head piece for my costume. Either that or go with the wig I bought from another seller for the same price but much better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost forgot to mention the SMELL!!  It smells awful. My boyfriend even agrees it smells awful and told me to get it away from him.</li>
    <li> This wig was brighter than expected, and I was really frizzy and tangled at the ends where the curls are. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product it shipped super quick and whatnot.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty true to photo. I&#x27;m a cosplayer and need this for my Phoenix costume and it says a month to deliver but I actually got it 2 weeks before it was estimated to even ship!!!</li>
    <li> Was really happy when the wig first arrived. All I did was style the bangs and comb out a few knots. I have yet to wear the wig, but when I went to go put it on, I noticed many of the wefts were coming unsewn. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing for the price. The first three wears the curls started to get a little bit nappy, but still very workable. I wore this wig for a week running production of the little mermaid as ariel, and after the first time I tried it on, I didn&#x27;t think it would hold up as well as it did.  After nights of taking the wig on and off (not to mention those thirty second costume changes) the wig did start to become a little tangled and frizzy in the back, but the front of it still looked good as new, and I was able to work around any problem spots with a few bobby pins and a hair pin flower. The length was perfect for what I was looking for, I am a pretty tall girl, and the wig landed at about my ribcage. OH and on the inside of the wig there is a strap for a secure fit.  I was tearing on and off clothes backstage and the wig did not budge. I was extremely pleased with this wig. The color comes almost exactly as shown, and the bangs tend to look less awkward with more uses. At the end of the show, the wig was pretty nappy looking in the back and a few small bald cap spots were showing, but with the proper care, ( basically not tearing through the curls to adjust your mic while hiding behind a wave)  this wig could easily last a month. Perfect wig for anyone doing this show (if it lasts more than a week I would suggest buying two it could hold up but with those costume changes good luck with that) or simply looking for a good wig.</li>
    <li> Thick and pretty it&#x27;s the perfect red it&#x27;s little darker than the picture but the picture looks like more of an orange red the wig is a red red love it so much and it&#x27;s really long and quick shipping</li>
    <li> I love the color and it fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Used this for a Poison Ivy costume and it was perfect. Obviously not the best quality but good costume quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> It says 32&#x27; but when I pull it out of the back it came in it is shoulder length......and in the picture it clearly shows that it comes at least if not pass the middle of a persons back...the color is awesome!!!! Just not happy that the length is not what it says...other than that I am still going to use it for my photo shoot and make it work!!!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Came a week early, which was very helpful. Fits great, looks beautiful. Only thing is I wish the bangs were stiles more, they sit straight down in my face and if I try to move them the wig shows. Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Takes time to arrive but great product although more of a strawberry/washed out red than bright red as shown</li>
    <li> This wig is way brighter than I expected. I wanted DARK red like the description stated, what I got was more of a bright red Little Mermaid / Anime red. It&#x27;ll do in a pinch but I would have never ordered it had I seen the correct pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality wise, all good for what I paid.</li>
    <li> Came just as described! Wore this for Halloween with my mermaid costume and actually had people asking if it was my real hair (although I will admit these people were very intoxicated and probably not very bright to begin with). I did have to cut the bangs since they were too long, but otherwise this worked out perfectly. Still have it hanging in my closet - it&#x27;s actually pretty creepy just hanging there. In retrospect, I should have kept the box it came in.</li>
    <li> I love the color and it fits so nice.....thanks again</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for my Halloween costume and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> The color shown is not what I received. Totally off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took forever to be delivered...</li>
