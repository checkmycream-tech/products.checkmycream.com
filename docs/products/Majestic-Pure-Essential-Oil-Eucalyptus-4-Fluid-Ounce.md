<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of eucalyptus so I was excited when the chance to review this came up. Most essential oils are rather pricey but we are trying to cut back on the amount of products so I loved the idea of eucalyptus bath bombs or lotion. The smell is really strong and rather unpleasant when you open the bottle, its not so bad once it is diluted into the product you are making though. I&#x27;m excited to try it out as I learn how essential oils are used.</li>
    <li> Majestic Pure Eucalyptus Essential oil is a must have for all in the medicine cabinet!! I was so excited about getting to try this need oil. It arrived here on time package wonderfully. It smells great!! Doesn&#x27;t take that much to be effective. There are many great uses for this oil. One is like a cold reliever...... can be used in a diffuser or massaged in on your skin. You can use it to clean with. Also a good bug repellent. Put some in hair to help with lice as well. It can be used to make your own candles, soaps, salves, and pesticides. Great great product. Couldn&#x27;t be anymore happier with this oil!!! Love it!!! You should try it!! Recommend for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received this product at a reduced price for the exchange of my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> It does not smell like any Eucalyptus essential oil I&#x27;ve used in the past. All the other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried smelled just like the leaves on my mom&#x27;s eucalyptus tree...this does not.</li>
    <li> This oil does not smell anything close to an eucalyptus oil.  I have bought many eucalyptus oil from many other stores, including whole foods of 365 brand, and Now Foods.  Most of the time, the only difference I see between different retailers is that the concentration level differs. I find that the Whole Food 365 oil to be stronger and last for a while, but it is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This particular eucalyptus oil from Majestic Pure does not smell anything like eucalyptus and has a distinct smell. I hated it, and returned it back to the seller, and they refunded my money. Now I’ll go ahead and buy the oil from Now Foods, which have used in the past and know at least it is the correct oil.</li>
    <li> We were sent this product for review. Opinions are 100% my own. I am a huge oil user and eucalyptus is one that I use religiously. This bottle does not smell like any bottle of eucyalptus that I have ever come across. Instead of having a crisp menthol/minty smell it has a sweet, clean, and smooth scent. It also it not a hot oil like eucyalptus should be.  It&#x27;s more along the lines of eucyalptus perfumes I have come across. All that said, it is still an awesome scent for soaps, lotions, and other cosmetic products along those lines so we will still be using and enjoying it.</li>
    <li> I love this. I put it in my diffuser mixed with my frankensence and its so relaxing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what it is but it is 100% not eucalyptus extract. Smells like rotten cotton.</li>
    <li> Just received this eucalyptus oil and am extremely disappointed.  This does not smell like eucalyptus oil at all!!!! Very weird smell. Everyone in my house commented on how bad the smell was. I will be sending back. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> The Majestic brand of Pure Essential Oils are really good and this Eucalyptus is no exception.  If you are into essential oils like I am or just starting out, the Eucalyptus is a must have for your oil collection. It has so many uses!  My two favorite is for the diffuser to help me breathe better and also for freshening up the dried eucalyptus that I keep in flower arrangements.  A drop or two emits the fragrance for quite a while.  It is such a beautiful scent.  I also use some in a drop of castor oil and place it on a tissue for when I get a massage.  Lying on my tummy while getting the back massaged is wonderful but causes my sinuses to clog up.  Just being able to smell the scent on the tissue (which I have placed on the headrest) takes care of that unpleasant stuffiness.  Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS OFFERED THIS OIL AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR TESTING AND REVIEW.  I use this oil and am so happy to have such a big bottle to keep in my collection!</li>
    <li> Smells like highly diluted with fishy smelling oil. It stinks and is not pure oil.  I had to return the bottles. Get DeLaCruz eucalyptus oil. I thought I could get 2 bottles cheaper than 1.  I got DeLaCruz brand before and they didn&#x27;t disappoint me and got a second bottle and DeLaCruz always smells great.</li>
    <li> All these reviewers who recieved discounted and free products are talking about how great this smells and how they would use this all over to clean and mine REAKS!! It leaked during shipping thanks to a faulty top and now the other things I ordered carry this terrible odor. Do not misunderstand, it is not that it is a STRONG smell that needs diluting or getting used to, it is a very bad, rancid smell.  There is no way I would ever use this bottle of oil to clean with, I wouldn&#x27;t want anything smelling this bad. There is no stain or problem I couldn&#x27;t clean with a different essential oil or something else to avoid this horrific stench.  I was hoping this would help with my asthma naturally and without breaking the bank, but the stink of it is unbearable, there is no way the bottle I received does not have some sort of contamination. My fault for thinking I could get something good for $11.  With the bottle cap not sealing right, I cannot even send it back, so this goes into the trash... What a dassapointing waste....</li>
    <li> Do not like this scent at all.  It&#x27;s does not have that clear beautiful eucalyptus scent  but rather more of a  sour scent that i wouldn&#x27;t associate with eucalyptus.  I bought it based on the reviews but it is going back.</li>
    <li> It does not smell anything like eucalyptus essential oil. And not even pleasant. There is no mentioning of steam distillation of the leaves on the bottle. I wonder what I&#x27;ll see if I put this through gas chromatography test. I will not use this oil and will never think of buying essential oil from this company.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils. Eucalyptus is wonderful for opening up your airways. My daughter has asthma and we use it to help her she has stopped using her inhaler almost all together now. This bottle is a nice large size. Great glass dropper easy to read and use. I highly recommend it. I was sent this product free to review I have compared it to the other brands of this oil I have and find it to be amazing thanks</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven in the steam sauna. I use a couple drops every time I go in, to help me breath better and it really works. Also whenever I am sick, I inhale the eucalyptus oil in through my diffuser and my airways open up very fast this way. The essential oil is excellent quality and comes in a generous amount. I am very thankful to Majestic Pure company for providing me the eucalyptus oil at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> cheaper than many others</li>
    <li> I’ve recently started making Christmas gifts and have a germophobe that I love that is on my gift list. The Majestic Pure Eucalyptus Oil is perfect for making her a wonderfully scented, highly-effective antibacterial hand sanitizer gift set. I use tea tree oil, witch hazel, aloe vera, vitamin E, and eucalyptus in a variety of antique jars refitted with pump top dispensers (and I add a small plastic travel bottle for on-the-go) and then tuck them all in an old fashioned looking basket. The eucalyptus gives the sanitizer bonus healing properties, the scent promotes vitality and overall wellbeing, and my sanitizer can serve double duty as a massage oil (although now that I think about it, she probably shouldn’t massage anyone that she feels that she needs to use sanitizer to touch).  I love using the Majestic Pure oils in my gifts: the quality is outstanding, the scents/consistencies are always spot-on and pure, and the results are always top notch! I received this Majestic Pure Eucalyptus Essential Oil at a promotional cost for evaluation and review. Love the quality of this brand and love the incredible variety of ways that eucalyptus can be used!</li>
    <li> I have been a essential oil user for a few years. Buying mostly &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34; oils and a few from others with complete success. I purchased Majestic Ylang Ylang and thought the smell was a little off but ok. I then purchased their eucalyptus oil and again the smell was off but waited until I cleaned my diffuser and used their straight oil. It smells like cat urine. It was only $10 and change and not worth the return hassle but I wanted to save anyone else from this experience.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great product and a little goes a long way. I use a diffuser at night in my bed room and I absolutely love it!  I will continue to order more!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to have around the house! Lots of uses for just one oil. It&#x27;s great for aches and pains, colds/congestion. You can use this product as an all purpose cleaner, just add a few drops with your other favorite oils to a spray bottle filled with water. Great purchase price for this amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
    <li> I use the essential oil in my diffuser, and it is fantastic. Love the smell in my house, not too intense, just right. The fresh and clean aroma is an excellent choice to handle any unwanted smells ​like my sometimes wet dog. Since I am living in Florida, I am always looking for a natural insect repeller and seem to have found it in Eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> Majestic Pute Eucalyptus oil is fantastic! I love the smell of eucalyptus! Line of my favorite things to do is take a hot bath and use Epsom salt and eucalyptus. The eucalyptus Epsom salt is much more expensive than store brand. Now I can use store brand Epsom salt with the Majestic Pure Eucalyptus Oil for a fraction of the cost! The bottle comes with a very convenient screw on cap that also is a dropper! Tonight when I took a bath I noticed that using the actual oil made my body really relaxed! I was also able to decide how much or little eucalyptus I wanted in my bath. It was amazing. I was able to receive this bottle at a discount in exchange for a honest review. I love it and I will definitely be buying another bottle! I highly recommend the Majestic Pure Eucalyptus Oil!</li>
    <li> Smells Gross. Nothing like it is suppose to. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This smelled so bad, nothing like eucalyptus.  I would have sworn it was rotten vanilla so i tossed it and threw it away.  never again.</li>
    <li> Good excellent product, smell so good. I like eucalyptus smell , it refresh my mind and i can relax my mind.I used this for my oil diffuser. I love it.It is also use for  Eucalyptus essential oil has far reaching effects on our overall well-being. It is is largely used for first aid purposes because of its vast remedial properties. Eucalyptus oil can be used in relaxing or therapeutic massages. Just add few drops of this essential oil to fractionated coconut or jojoba oil and apply on skin with a gentle rubbing motion. I regularly use this and it gives a great result good benefits for my family. wonderful product. I got this in promotional discount a good discount in product reviews. i reviewed this unbiased and honest that gives me a good result .</li>
