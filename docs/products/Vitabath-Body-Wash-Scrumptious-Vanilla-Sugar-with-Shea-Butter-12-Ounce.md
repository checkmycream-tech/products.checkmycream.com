### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The smell is simply delightful; if delicious had a smell, this is it!</li>
      <li>This scent is perfect, not overpowering yet doesn&#x27;t blend into the background.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something without sulfates and this one is awesome!</li>
      <li>Really good!</li>
      <li>It smells so good!</li>
      <li>Gotta love a multi-use product! :D</li>
      <li>The vanilla is a great scent but won&#x27;t compete with your perfume &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Another great vitabath product.  </li>
      <li>Very nice product.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell and lathers good too!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a paraben free body wash and this one worked great!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews on this product.</li>
      <li>i, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sweet and vanilla, it might not be the best option.</li>
      <li>I just enjoy it for a good shower/bath experience!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>but it is a really nice product.</li>
      <li>Nice soap.</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is nice, hubby likes it too.</li>
      <li>Good news is that if you are an older woman and want everyone to know, this scent lasts a good day on your body like perfume.</li>
      <li>Am quite pleased with the way my skin feels after a shower.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Too many vanilla products seem cloying or too chemically based.</li>
      <li>vanilla\\&quot; which is more what this Vitabath wash smells like to me.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and indulge in this fabulous body wash!</li>
      <li>Great scent, leaves the skin smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I love the lather, the clean rinsing, the softness of my skin after using it and that it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my eczema.  </li>
      <li>It is a strong smell</li>
      <li>Not bad but not my favorite</li>
      <li>But, that is fine for me since I wouldn&#x27;t want an over powering smell throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Lightly moisturing</li>
      <li>but I really enjoy the smell of this body wash.</li>
      <li>This body wash has none of the toxic ingredients found in too many personal care products, but it also delivers a good clean feeling.</li>
      <li>I know this is subjective, but I found the smell too sweet and perfumy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to finish using this as fast as I can, but the smell is really overwhelming.</li>
      <li>My skin is super</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a new vanilla body wash for a change (from Shikai) and this looked healthy enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Typically I smell this scent on women 40+ who, I think, want to smell like those 20 year old&#x27;s with the delicious scents from Bath Body works or Juicy etc, but their noses are out of calibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally wish I smelled like a cupcake a little longer after using this, lol, but I still love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is very powerful and certainly has the sugary vanilla aspect to it.</li>
      <li>that right there says something.  </li>
      <li>amazing and leaves my skin very soft and not dried</li>
      <li>I love to try different kinds of body wash and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
      <li>This body wash smells fantastic, but if you don&#x27;t like foody scents, steer clear.</li>
      <li>What this smells exactly like to me is the Earthly Body line of products in the scent Skinny Dip.</li>
      <li>A HEADACHE FIRST SNIFF.</li>
      <li>I really like this shower gel, the only thing that would make it better if it was a creamy shower gel.</li>
      <li>I continue to order this body wash because I love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really smell it on your body after the shower, however.</li>
      <li>We also both love the scent of vanilla, but prefer it be as natural as possible.</li>
      <li>Makes a bath into a sweet treat, however it is more a soap  than an expolient, not abrasive enough to bring skin down to a fresh alert sheen.</li>
      <li>Problem was I immediately recognized this perfume-like scent that reminded me of older women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>I also love that the smell lingers a little while after I shower.</li>
      <li>Since this wash was devoid of sulfate content, it seemed to fit my requirement.  </li>
      <li>What do you mean it smells nice?</li>
      <li>It reminds me very much of the fake vanilla smell of Bath and Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar.</li>
      <li>I recently tried this body wash as a shampoo and it worked great, even on my extremely dry, curly, thick, hair.</li>
      <li>Definitely not harsh on the skin.</li>
      <li>I prefer natural smelling vanilla and this scent is not that.</li>
      <li>We have two people with sensitive skin in our household.</li>
      <li>Not too much scent, just enough.</li>
      <li>Smells AH-mazing and leaves skin soft and not dried out.</li>
      <li>I have not used it long enough to know the full results there</li>
      <li>Skin softening agents really work even for dry skin in Texas heat.</li>
      <li>In fact, after three days of lathering with my regular body wash, my loofah still has that old lady</li>

<li> My allergy to sulfates is active internally, externally and eternally.  </li>
<li> Now if I could only find it cheaper as it is pretty expensive.</li>

<li> What I expected, what I got.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of body washes, some from the drugstore, hotels, others from Amazon, and some recommended by others, but this is probably the worst most chemical smelling one I have ever tried.</li>
<li> My hair is past my waist and no tangles when using this as a shampoo!</li>
<li> It smells like fake vanilla, and a lot, a lot of chemicals.</li>
<li> I HATE FAKE VANILLA SMELL.</li>
<li> STINKS!!</li>

    <li> Scent is divine. Skin softening agents really work even for dry skin in Texas heat. Amazing product. Do yourself a favor and indulge in this fabulous body wash!</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  The scent does not remain long, but it does leave my skin feeling moisturized.  In summertime at least, I don&#x27;t need as much lotion as previously.</li>

Good news is that if you are an older woman and want everyone to know, this scent lasts a good day on your body like perfume. In fact, after three days of lathering with my regular body wash, my loofah still has that old lady smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS -- 40-50 isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I did not care for the scent of this product. It does not lather well either.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells fantastic, but if you don&#x27;t like foody scents, steer clear. It says vanilla sugar, but don&#x27;t think Bath &amp; Body Works, because it smells nothing like their scent of the same name. What this smells exactly like to me is the Earthly Body line of products in the scent Skinny Dip. That scent is described as \\&quot;cotton candy and vanilla\\&quot; which is more what this Vitabath wash smells like to me. A little goes a long way, and it smells very loud in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t seem to hang on your skin very long after you get out, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on what you like. I personally wish I smelled like a cupcake a little longer after using this, lol, but I still love it! :) Update: I recently tried this body wash as a shampoo and it worked great, even on my extremely dry, curly, thick, hair. My hair is past my waist and no tangles when using this as a shampoo! Gotta love a multi-use product! :D</li>

    <li> I know this is subjective, but I found the smell too sweet and perfumy.</li>
    <li> My allergy to sulfates is active internally, externally and eternally.  Since this wash was devoid of sulfate content, it seemed to fit my requirement.  It did.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I continue to order this body wash because I love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I buy the vanilla sugar with shea butter.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Definitely not harsh on the skin. Was not as fragrant as I expected it to be - but some people may prefer that.</li>
    <li> STINKS!! I HATE FAKE VANILLA SMELL. GAVE ME A HEADACHE FIRST SNIFF.</li>
    <li> We have two people with sensitive skin in our household. We also both love the scent of vanilla, but prefer it be as natural as possible. Too many vanilla products seem cloying or too chemically based. This body wash has none of the toxic ingredients found in too many personal care products, but it also delivers a good clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews on this product. What do you mean it smells nice? It smells like fake vanilla, and a lot, a lot of chemicals. I&#x27;m trying to finish using this as fast as I can, but the smell is really overwhelming. I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of body washes, some from the drugstore, hotels, others from Amazon, and some recommended by others, but this is probably the worst most chemical smelling one I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Not bad but not my favorite</li>
    <li> Being a man you are not supposed to smell like roses, flowers, etc... but I really enjoy the smell of this body wash. I wanted to get away from sulfate shampoo and body wash and came across this brand. Sulfate can really dry your skin out and I recently lost over 50lbs and was looking to find ways to tighten up my skin. Drying your skin out will do the opposite and prevent your skin from tightening. I have not used it long enough to know the full results there but it is a really nice product. Now if I could only find it cheaper as it is pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> I have these autoshipped so that right there says something.  The vanilla is a great scent but won&#x27;t compete with your perfume &#x3D; the scent is for the shower experience.  Lightly moisturing and I like that is doesn&#x27;t contain paraben.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The smell is simply delightful; if delicious had a smell, this is it! It is a strong smell i, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sweet and vanilla, it might not be the best option. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. You can&#x27;t really smell it on your body after the shower, however. But, that is fine for me since I wouldn&#x27;t want an over powering smell throughout the day. I just enjoy it for a good shower/bath experience!</li>
    <li> Another great vitabath product.  Great scent, leaves the skin smooth and soft.  Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out.</li>
    <li> This scent is perfect, not overpowering yet doesn&#x27;t blend into the background. I have been purchasing Vitabath products for several years now and do not plan on changing.</li>
    <li> I love to try different kinds of body wash and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It smells so good! I also love that the smell lingers a little while after I shower. Really good!</li>
    <li> I love the lather, the clean rinsing, the softness of my skin after using it and that it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my eczema.  The scent is lacking, though.  It reminds me very much of the fake vanilla smell of Bath and Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar. I don&#x27;t care for it- I prefer natural smelling vanilla and this scent is not that.</li>
    <li> I really like this shower gel, the only thing that would make it better if it was a creamy shower gel. My skin is super dry.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is nice, hubby likes it too.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a paraben free body wash and this one worked great!  Nice smell and lathers good too!</li>
    <li> What I expected, what I got. Not too much scent, just enough. Vanilla is the only fragrance which does not give me a headache. Am quite pleased with the way my skin feels after a shower.</li>
