      <li>The results for the first two are outstanding!</li>
      <li>So excited that my BRIOTECH is now available on Amazon!</li>
      <li>which any Mother or person with a strong sense of desiring sanitary conditions and alleviation of germs would desire.</li>
      <li>We first were introduced to it researching effective methods of killing Ebola.  </li>
      <li>cool thing about this is that it&#x27;s so safe to use.</li>
      <li>Help for healing breakouts and makes your skin fresh :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for too short a time to know if it&#x27;s the best product for a particular use (skin healing)</li>
      <li>I am SO excited that BRIOTECH is available on Amazon...</li>
      <li>I even use it in my eyes when my eyes get red and puffy from allergies, and it&#x27;s great to use as a quick substitute when I&#x27;ve run out of contact solution.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;ll love it that the pain cools, and the mild antibiotic right after injury can only be a good thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing AND all natural.</li>
      <li>This is amazing product that you can spray in your mouth in your eyes without irritation and with complete protection.</li>
      <li>I have been getting it straight from the factory for some time and this is so much more convenient to have it delivered to our house.  </li>
      <li>Cannot say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am amazed at the quick healing powers of Briotech and will always keep a bottle in my Medicine Cabinet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that there are no harsh chemicals!</li>
      <li>believe Briotech is well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>but Briotech is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>The scars are deeper, so I will be excited to see how much HOCL can help my body erase the incision scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Briotech came into my life at the beginning of my freshman year of college (right when I needed it).</li>
      <li>Positively Miraculous!</li>
      <li>I would recommend Briotech&#x27;s HOCL be added to anyone&#x27;s med or travel kit and to have it as readily available as the less effective alcohol based hand sanitizers.</li>
      <li>as a side effect, my new-found confidence may have gotten me more than a few dates : )</li>
      <li>Since finding Briotech I&#x27;ve used it to halt sunburn from causing my skin to peel, heal a rash on my Dog&#x27;s belly, reduce pain and itching from mosquito bites and aid in super fast healing.</li>
      <li>I am very high recommended this product!</li>
      <li>For absolutely everywhere you&#x27;ve got skin!</li>
      <li>There are so many multiple uses for it.</li>
      <li>However, we used it most often for simple day-to-day sanitizing tasks on hands and equipment as well as in hotel rooms, buses, and airplanes.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for many different thing.</li>
      <li>Briotech really does soothe irritated skin!</li>
      <li>Replaced first aid items like moist wipes, Neosporin, after sun care, wound cleaner and sting ease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am so glad we can finally get BRIOTECH on Amazon!</li>
      <li>The product is far more versatile and effective than ordinary hand sanitizer and is much easier on the skin.  </li>
      <li>What I learned later, resulting in a product that is part of our daily regimen, is that it is exceptional in killing bacteria that results in clogged pores and acne, expedient healing of cuts/burns/abrasions, etc. &#x27;</li>
      <li>Clears up acne, cuts &amp; scrapes, even grew back my husband&#x27;s finger in quick time when he chopped the end off of it on a mandoline grater!</li>
      <li>It really does wonders for my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>Our whole family uses Briotec for wound healing without infection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like giving myself a gentle exfoliation every time I use the product.</li>
      <li>Washing it with my gentle cleanser made it sting.</li>
      <li>Briotech has changed my life and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>but none has worked so fast &amp; efficient as HOCL water.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product last winter but never actually took the time to experience the magic this product seems to have until summer started.</li>
      <li>To top that off 2 weeks later you could barely tell I was severely burned.</li>
      <li>I used Briotech on the burn 3 to 4 times a day during treatment and felt little to no pain from the burn even as the burn became more intense.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t want to live without it!  </li>
      <li>I have used so many treatments such as different types of lotions &amp; ointments my doctors prescribed</li>
      <li>During the high allergy summer season here in Phoenix, I carry it with me to spray in my eyes and on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Before Briotech, I was facing a series of acne perscriptions with nasty side-effects and potential long-term damage to my sensitive skin. I was shy already and damaged skin made gave me really low self confidence. Briotech came into my life at the beginning of my freshman year of college (right when I needed it). Using Briotech regularly, I stopped breaking out. The perpetual redness in my cheeks was gone, and the keratosis pillaris (chicken skin) on my arms went away.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues all my life, but Briotech makes me confident that people are looking at me and not just my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a side effect, my new-found confidence may have gotten me more than a few dates : )</li>
    <li> So excited that my BRIOTECH is now available on Amazon! This product is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Briotech HOCL water is definitely a must-have! I was first introduced to this product last winter but never actually took the time to experience the magic this product seems to have until summer started. The heat of each day brings dryness to my skin &amp; my worst enemy, excema (itchy inflammation of the skin), is leaving it&#x27;s red marks &amp; scars all over my body, once again. For only 2 weeks now I&#x27;ve been spraying this water on my rashes- slowly but surely I&#x27;m noticing the scars &amp; itchiness going away. I am officially sold. I have used so many treatments such as different types of lotions &amp; ointments my doctors prescribed but none has worked so fast &amp; efficient as HOCL water. LOVE this product &amp; will continue to use this for the rest of my life, no doubt.</li>
    <li> Its a part of my daily routine, I spray my face with it every morning. Have recommended to everyone I know. Helps heal everything including athletes feet.</li>
    <li> I had a really bad sunburn and sprayed Briotech on it and the pain went away immediately.  Update- Now that we live in the brutal Texas sun, Briotech is a necessary part of our daily sling regime. I&#x27;ll be using this daily and hope they create a Briotech facial skin cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on a sunburn and other skin irritations and it really helped.  It was as helpful, if not more so, than using aloe vera gel.</li>
    <li> Positively Miraculous!</li>
    <li> THIS IS AMAZING STUFF. Clears up acne, cuts &amp; scrapes, even grew back my husband&#x27;s finger in quick time when he chopped the end off of it on a mandoline grater! I use it on my face for as a toner before I put on moisturizer. I even use it in my eyes when my eyes get red and puffy from allergies, and it&#x27;s great to use as a quick substitute when I&#x27;ve run out of contact solution. My whole family uses it. I even use it on my pug&#x27;s eyes to clear out any goop. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. There are so many multiple uses for it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, and I am so happy to see it here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some psoriasis and have used this product for 2 years. It really does wonders for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on my dog who had an allergy and it seemed to help with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to live without it!  This product was shared with me at the earliest stages as a germ or bacteria killer..... which any Mother or person with a strong sense of desiring sanitary conditions and alleviation of germs would desire. What I learned later, resulting in a product that is part of our daily regimen, is that it is exceptional in killing bacteria that results in clogged pores and acne, expedient healing of cuts/burns/abrasions, etc. &#x27;and&#x27; it is effective in stimulating collagen to help slow the aging process, while enhancing your youthful glow.  I use this product &#x27;daily&#x27; as part of my &#x27;absolutes&#x27; in my beauty regime.  From kids getting sunburns, sports abrasions and slivers in their feet to adults needing to heal cold sores, kill bacteria causing alignments and enhance their beauty regime...Briotech&#x27;s HOCL is the miracle spray that should be in every household.</li>
    <li> Briotech. It is the most amazing product I have ever used. I have used it for many different thing. I use it on my contact lenses about every 3 days. I use to only get about 3 weeks out of them. Now I get almost 8 weeks. I went night fishing I sprayed it all over My skin. I didn&#x27;t get one misquote bit. The misquotes  were all around me but never landed on me. Great for my skin. I have intudused it to many people and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Briotech as a topical spray to help with skin hydration and skin irritations. I use Briotech twice a day at a minimum and keep a bottle with me at all times. I love the product and have honestly noticed a tremendous difference in my skin! I also tested it on my hair to reduce the frizz and now use ¼ of a cup of Briotech as a finishing rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can’t get any better than that! An all-natural product vs. all those chemicals on my skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also suggested to me to use Briotech for burns. I went through a lengthy radiation treatment with severe burning during the treatment. I used Briotech on the burn 3 to 4 times a day during treatment and felt little to no pain from the burn even as the burn became more intense. To top that off 2 weeks later you could barely tell I was severely burned. I can’t tell you how pleased I am with Briotech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in the product enough to have purchased bottles for family members and friends to use for skin and hair hydration as well as summer burns.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used Briotech for a few years. It has minimized my need for several products, it helps my family heal and reduces unwanted chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;BACKPACKERS – on my last trip, my Briotech replaced hand and face cleanser.  I used it for bacteria killing as an all over body deodorizer. Sprayed spoons, cups and my overworked BOOTS. Replaced first aid items like moist wipes, Neosporin, after sun care, wound cleaner and sting ease.&lt;br /&gt;RASH PRONE PEOPLE –I like my Briotech as a multipurpose rash spray. With super sensitive skin I often don’t know what is causing me to present a rash.  It is sometimes clothing, lotions, heat, outdoors plants, animals and at times, a mystery but I have found the rashes don’t last as long or itch as much. When I had what I thought was a spider bite I immediately applied my Briotech It turned out to be shingles. It ran its course but the rash its self was relatively small and no pharmacy prescription needed.&lt;br /&gt;At the office: my keyboard, phone and mouse.&lt;br /&gt;At the gym: my tennis shoes, gloves and other gear.&lt;br /&gt;In the kitchen: my butcher block, cutting boards and sponge.&lt;br /&gt;And of course everywhere I have skin. Now that I apply daily to my face my acne is rare instead of a weekly occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;I believe Briotech is well worth the purchase. It can give you peace of mind that healing is happening and that you have eliminated chemicals and the need for more stuff!</li>
    <li> Have used this twice for pink eye by pouring a few drops from the bottle cap into the corner of my eye. Both times pink eye was literally gone in a little over an hour with two applications. Saved me a doctor copay and pharmacy bill. Very glad to be able to purchase online at amazon.  Cannot say enough good things about this stuff. Hand sanitizer, surface sanitizer, great for first aid kits and on cuts.</li>
    <li> Chances are very good I&#x27;ll be back with a 5-star rating. I&#x27;ve used the product for too short a time to know if it&#x27;s the best product for a particular use (skin healing) I&#x27;ve ever seen: that&#x27;s my standard for 5-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a month now, I&#x27;ve used HOCL on my face, the remnants of a bad skin infection, and two sizable surgery scars. The results for the first two are outstanding! My face is softer, and I am no spring chicken. I expect that the skin infection site will be invisible by next week. The scars are deeper, so I will be excited to see how much HOCL can help my body erase the incision scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when a little one gets an &amp;#34;owie,&amp;#34; just spritz with HOCL. She&#x27;ll love it that the pain cools, and the mild antibiotic right after injury can only be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
    <li> As a mother of two small babies, I started using Briotech as a sanitizer for when I&#x27;m on the go. The kids often drop their binkys or bottles and before I had Briotech I&#x27;d have to locate a restroom to rinse them off and the kids would start to get impatient. Now, I can spray them with Briotech and it&#x27;s safe and a lot quicker. I also use it as a hand sanitizer when I&#x27;m out. I love that there are no harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this wonderful spray on my psoriasis. It helped clear it up, without leaving a greasy gloss on my affected parts of my body. I took it to my dermatologist and asked her what she thought. She is going to use it on several patients and will let me know her feedback.... which I&#x27;ll report back on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard S</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Healed up my foot rash in two days.  Would recommend it everyone with rashes.</li>
    <li> My team has been operationally testing the Briotech HOCL product for over a year around the world in regions such as Africa and Central America.  We first were introduced to it researching effective methods of killing Ebola.  During that time we have had the opportunity to employ it in on a variety of wounds ranging from common abrasions and cuts to penetrating trauma wounds.  However, we used it most often for simple day-to-day sanitizing tasks on hands and equipment as well as in hotel rooms, buses, and airplanes.  To date, the product has produced zero side effects and no contraindications were observed.  The anti-microbial effects seem to be robust and no wounds experienced progressive infections.  In fact, when applied to a sterile dressing (saturated) and then left against a wound already showing signs of inflammation and infection, all patients exhibited markedly improved injury sites within a few hours.  The product is far more versatile and effective than ordinary hand sanitizer and is much easier on the skin.  It has been so handy, it now has a permanent place in my med bag.  I would recommend Briotech&#x27;s HOCL be added to anyone&#x27;s med or travel kit and to have it as readily available as the less effective alcohol based hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I find it works better than Noesporin.</li>
    <li> For absolutely everywhere you&#x27;ve got skin! This healed and rid me if cystic acne after years of failed attempts to clear up my skin using topical and oral medications including a very painful and fruitless round of Accutaine!!  Since finding Briotech I&#x27;ve used it to halt sunburn from causing my skin to peel, heal a rash on my Dog&#x27;s belly, reduce pain and itching from mosquito bites and aid in super fast healing. I&#x27;m a huge advocate and am so very happy with this amazing product not only for its effacy but also because it is so safe to use!!!</li>
    <li> Our whole family uses Briotec for wound healing without infection. We also use it for germ and virus protection when traveling in airports and our kids use it in school. This is amazing product that you can spray in your mouth in your eyes without irritation and with complete protection.</li>
    <li> I use this on everything - my face, my toothbrush, hair, abrasions.  It&#x27;s amazing AND all natural.</li>
    <li> I am very high recommended this product! Everyone should try and use it in frequently, especially for skin care. Briotech is very safe and perfect for any type of skin. Help for healing breakouts and makes your skin fresh :)</li>
    <li> I had a terrible rash on the inside and outside of my belly button, which I thought might be from my piercing. I used every possible product that I could to try and get rid of it. Nothing worked. I used Briotech a couple of times and it went away and has not come back! I have no clue how it works, but it does! Happy to see it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am SO excited that BRIOTECH is available on Amazon...I will be buying it by the caseloads!  My sister first introduced this to me for a weird rash on my son&#x27;s head that we had tried everything on, with no improvement whatsoever.  One week of BRIOTCH, the rash was gone, never to return.  After that, I was hooked.  I have used on everything from small cuts to major facial surgery and been amazed with what it can do.  I used it on my most recent facial surgery and now, two months later, you can barely tell there is a scar.  I have never experienced any adverse effects from using this product, if anything, it simply feels like a refreshing, cool mist.  I used to believe that a product had to burn or tingle to tell you it was working, not anymore!  This is my go-to for everything.  I cannot say enough about this product!</li>
    <li> As a Law Enforcement officer I handle ID&#x27;s and people all day. I quit using hand gel and switched to Briotech!!! It protects me so much better. I also use it as a diabetic. With any cut or scratch it would take forever to heal, not any more. You cannot go wrong with this product. I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the bomb! I use this product everyday; it is versatile and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for all sorts of things from athlete&#x27;s foot to acne. It is amazing and has cleared up all the issues.  My skin is clearer than ever.</li>
    <li> After turning 40, my skin decided to make me pay for having flawless skin as a teenager and I was diagnosed with adult onset acne.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from proven &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; and OTC topical products as well as prescription regiments suggested by my dermatologist.  My acne would leave dark spots as they healed.  Nothing I used helped alleviate the hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this summer, I had a reaction to the moisturizer with SPF that I have been using for the past two years.  My whole face was red, splotchy and highly irritated. Washing it with my gentle cleanser made it sting. Everything I put on my face irritated the skin, including the topical antibiotic prescribed by my dermatologist.  Through a friend, I was introduced to literature on Briotech.  I will admit I was skeptical because the instructions are, well, too simple: &amp;#34;Spray...daily on affected area&amp;#34;---but it IS that simple.  Since Day 1 of its arrival, I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 times a day: once after washing my face in the morning before makeup, midday as a pick-me-up, and once before going to bed.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything other than misting your face with water.  Within two days my irritated skin recovered---no more itchiness and redness.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and the hyperpigmentation from my scars is noticeably reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to my acne, I developed a hypersensitivity to sunlight exposure.  Even after applying sunscreen, after exposure, I will have raised areas of itchy, irritated and erythemic skin.  I would have to take antihistamines and/or antibiotics to help heal my skin, which would take up to two weeks.  I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago and broke out in a few patches.  I decided to try Briotech on them.  Although I was still itchy, the redness and irritation dissipated considerably by the next morning. Also worked great on the kids&#x27; sunburns because it doesn&#x27;t sting when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry it with me everywhere.  I just recently started spritzing down my yoga mats with it after class.  It&#x27;s not a harsh chemical so it won&#x27;t break down the material like the antibacterial sprays and wipes at the gym. I&#x27;m quite impressed with this product and will definitely keep purchasing it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Briotech for almost two years now and I just love it! I use it for almost everything. I&#x27;m a esthetician and have used lots of great products for my skin but Briotech is by far my favorite. I got into skincare because I&#x27;ve always had problematic skin, even in my 30&#x27;s I was still getting regular breakouts. Using Briotech as a daily toner I found my skin consistently clear for the first time in 15 years!&lt;br /&gt;I soon found more and more ways to use it... It has helped me with sunburns, rashes, styes, and because it kills off bacteria and is anti inflammatory it has been the perfect product to use on my clients after hair removal. Lots of my clients have even seen it help with ingrowns when added to their home regimen. So happy to now be able to get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a product you can&#x27;t live without.  As a frequent traveler, I am often surrounded by nasty bacteria and viruses and would constantly find myself getting sick. Briotech has helped keep me healthy by killing those harmful bacteria and viruses and I haven&#x27;t been sick in over a year! In addition to keeping me safe while I travel, I have also noticed an improvement in my skin. Briotech has changed my life and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Briotech really does soothe irritated skin! It works instantly, too. I&#x27;ve used it on contact dermatitis, mosquito bites, scrapes, and cuts, and also after epilating and shaving. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it on a piercing, but I sure don&#x27;t think it would hurt! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I started using this several years ago - Purchased directly from the factory. Very happy to see they are on Amazon now. It&#x27;s an amazing product. It&#x27;s like giving myself a gentle exfoliation every time I use the product. I usually put it on my face after washing it in the morning. I let it dry and then add a tiny bit of moisturizer. Same thing at bedtime. My skin looks amazing! Any pitting or scarring that I had is completely gone. I had surgery a few years back on my neck, and my neck scar is nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about this is that it&#x27;s so safe to use. During the high allergy summer season here in Phoenix, I carry it with me to spray in my eyes and on my face. My red eyes clear up and sneezing stops. I think we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg with this great product. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the quick healing powers of Briotech and will always keep a bottle in my Medicine Cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;So far Briotech has accelerated the recovery time for a couple of cuts and a 4&amp;#34;x 2&amp;#34; severe burn. I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product. Sandra King</li>
    <li> I am so glad we can finally get BRIOTECH on Amazon! I have been getting it straight from the factory for some time and this is so much more convenient to have it delivered to our house.  My husband uses it on cuts and scrapes and I use it as a facial toner. We love it!</li>
    <li> In one word, Briotech HOCL is AMAZING! I spray this on every sort of skin ailment that I have and the results are incredible. My first introduction to this product was when I had a bad claw mark (from my dear canine friend), on my ankle that refused to heal. Over a month went by and I wondered if this was ever going to heal! Three days of spraying it with Briotech and the healing began in earnest. After 7 days the scar was just a faint line and after two weeks it was completely gone. I am sold on this product and I just love that it contains no chemicals!</li>
