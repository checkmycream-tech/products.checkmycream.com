      <li>Best cap ever</li>
      <li>Great night bonnet!!</li>
      <li>they are excellent, the colors are good, the elastic band has a lot of stretch, the satin keeps the hair from getting messed up when sleeping</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>This is a good satin bonnet and stays on well through the night, however the title of &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; bonnet is deceiving.</li>
      <li>I just bought a light purple one of these from Duane Reade for 2.99 and I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
      <li>Good good good good.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice cap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well-made and kind of cute.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable with elastic around my edges.</li>
      <li>Found them to be very comfortable</li>
      <li>I love this thing</li>
      <li>Love these better than drawstrings.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT  </li>
      <li>If the band was just an inch bigger it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this bonnet, it works well and stays put but be sure to get it in your size,</li>
      <li>certainly sure it&#x27;s will better than this thousands of times</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to get more colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>all the people who are dealing with varying sizing,  the one i got has the product number listed in the top corner of the product image on this listing.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to keep any sort of head wrap, scarf, or bonnet on all night.</li>
      <li>I have never once been able to buy a woman&#x27;s hat from the store.</li>
      <li>I love the Bonnet.</li>
      <li>would probably be ok for a child.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>One more thing...</li>
      <li>I use this everynight it keeps my hair from drying out and it stays put on your head and love the color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put flexi rods in my hair and thought I&#x27;d be able to cover them......</li>
      <li>&amp; I had much better results.  </li>
      <li>I love the cap it does stay on</li>
      <li>I have micro link extensions and this has been the most comfortable sleep cap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for her, and fits my average sized head too (snugly but comfortably)</li>
      <li>Would be fine for kids.</li>
      <li>But this fit perfectly and isn&#x27;t too tight at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to cover your hair with satin before going to sleep, so I flip the bonnet inside out before going to bed.</li>
      <li>This works great after getting my hair done and next day my hair has kept its style.</li>
      <li>Also, the outside is indeed satin, which is great for hair.</li>
      <li>Honestly I felt like I paid too much for this.</li>
      <li>Who&#x27;s head are they expecting will fit into this?</li>
      <li>I had to forcefully stretch it out to make it fit comfortably.</li>
      <li>I thought if this stuff can soak a burnt pan clean it may lift out whatever is making that horrid smell.</li>
      <li>This product I suppose is cool.</li>
      <li>only good thing</li>
      <li>It falls off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty small head so this one is actually perfect for me.</li>
      <li>First off, I have a huge head.</li>
      <li>The large fit her well.</li>
      <li>I like this item though the shipping wasn&#x27;t really worth it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use it at all unless my hair is perfectly straight and rolled in a bun which is ironic since I bought it to keep my hair in tact when i wear it curly during the summer.  </li>
      <li>My 9 year old has a lot of fine curly hair.  </li>
      <li>this item just makes my life more different.</li>
      <li>Love that it stayed on my head all night, gave it 4 stars because I saw the same exact on at Walmart for $1.92.</li>
      <li>It is pretty comfy and stays in place almost all night through.</li>
      <li>It seems to be of good quality, but the band was not comfortable for me.</li>
      <li>This is kinda of small, it fits my 6 year old daughter snugly and probably wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for a large Afro or a large head.</li>
      <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call this large.  </li>
      <li>I ended up covering my hair with my large satin scarf.</li>
      <li>If you have a large head dont buy</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t all that large.</li>
      <li>Although it says large I know for a fact</li>
      <li>It would probable be just fine for someone with a smaller head.</li>
      <li>The large bonnet fits me very well and it doesn&#x27;t fall off my head because of the elastic satin band.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: I tried washing it in a gentle detergent and it did not get the smell out.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH</li>
      <li>This really helped keep hair</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t prefer to buy this thing at all&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Other than that, it was ok.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want to get my regular one full of campfire smoke.</li>
      <li>Since the outside of the cap is true satin, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all.</li>
      <li>It helps my curly hair to stay styled during night and it is very comfortable, the only problem is that it comes with different size every time I purchase one without &amp;</li>
      <li>Live and learn!</li>
      <li>I have a decent amount of hair</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>SO I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as large as needed - but I gave it to my 9 year old granddaughter.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it shipped very quickly and it wasn&#x27;t damaged.  </li>
      <li>Its is not really large just average size and the quality is not as good as the picture.</li>
      <li>and i often have to buy new ones which isnt the companys</li>
      <li>and I usually get it at Walmart for pretty cheap</li>
      <li>It fits a little tight, otherwise good quality material</li>
      <li>but after it dried it was 98% smell free.</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to perfume smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my natural hair journey</li>
      <li>The fabric is soft and the satin is like silk.</li>
      <li>the one i got was a bit too big but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t suck the moisture from your hair and leaves it shine and smooth.</li>
      <li>The package said LG but it fit like a small.</li>
      <li>The product says to be a large but it is so tight that I could not open it wide enough to place my hair in and be comfortable.</li>
      <li>Second off, I am a wild restless sleeper.</li>
      <li>none of these new satin head caps are like traditional satin but cheap thin polyester.</li>
      <li>This was pretty much a waste of time and money.</li>
      <li>This bonnet is *not* large enough for a full hair style and the band is tight...</li>
      <li>I bought the large and the band was a little snug</li>
      <li>This bonnet is described as being large, but it is not large enough for the average adult head.  </li>
      <li>I wish the size of the cap was made more clear because unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get much use out of it since it&#x27;s too small.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be made out of a more delicate, softer material, but in actual fact, the material is rough to the touch and it completely ruins the natural texture of my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product did not stay on and when I used it, it left black dye all over my bed. YUCK!</li>
    <li> The quality is not a nice as it appears in the photos. The outside is smoother than the inside. Also, the band is a bit tight &amp; gave me a headache each night. It falls off pretty easily.</li>
    <li> The package said LG but it fit like a small. I had to forcefully stretch it out to make it fit comfortably. You get what you pay for. Other than that, it shipped very quickly and it wasn&#x27;t damaged.  Edit (7/6/15): Not even two months after wearing it every night, it started to tear at the seams. It also gave me terrible headaches in the morning. Will not buy again. Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> This works great after getting my hair done and next day my hair has kept its style. My hair is only shoulder length and it stays on.</li>
    <li> One thing I like about this bonnet/cap is that it stays on. If you&#x27;re a rough sleeper like me, that&#x27;s a really big deal. Also, the outside is indeed satin, which is great for hair. Unfortunately the \\&quot;soft inside\\&quot; is not satin. I have fairly short, curly, type 3c and 4a African American hair. On multiple occasions, I noticed that I could feel my hair snagging on the inside of this cap when I took it off in the morning. I&#x27;d look inside the cap and see that strands had been ripped out during the night. Quite disheartening! Also, the black dye on the cap left ugly stains on my pillow cases and sheets.    One more thing...I decided to turn the cap inside-out &amp; I had much better results.  Since the outside of the cap is true satin, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all. Also, the elastic doesn&#x27;t eat away at my edges when wearing it like this.</li>
    <li> It fits perfectly and stays on all night. Although it says large I know for a fact I have a very small head. So keep in mind wh n ordering.</li>
    <li> The band is too tight.</li>
    <li> It fits a little tight, otherwise good quality material</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet, it works well and stays put but be sure to get it in your size, the one i got was a bit too big but other than that, it doesn&#x27;t suck the moisture from your hair and leaves it shine and smooth.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be larger. The one I have now is much larger. I like the design,but as my hair style is crunch and also wear a mask at night,it needs to larger.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it she likes that the hair thingy doesnt come off at night</li>
    <li> This really helped keep hair</li>
    <li> This bonnet stays on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair through the night. It&#x27;s well-made and kind of cute.  I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I like this item though the shipping wasn&#x27;t really worth it, I probably could have bought this in a beauty supply store and saved $4.  I wish the size of the cap was made more clear because unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get much use out of it since it&#x27;s too small.  Admittedly I have long (afro, 4a)hair, but it looks much bigger on the model then it does on my head.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use it at all unless my hair is perfectly straight and rolled in a bun which is ironic since I bought it to keep my hair in tact when i wear it curly during the summer.  Also the color is different than on the package. I personally prefer black, but it&#x27;s misleading.  All in all this is good if you have short or straight hair, but pretty useless for me &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to perfume smell this will give you a headache.  I am trying to wash the scent out. It is soaking in the sink as I write this, hope it works. I bought the large and the band was a little snug but I suppose I could get used to it. I guess my main issue is the nasty cheap perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried washing it in a gentle detergent and it did not get the smell out. Then I tried dawn liquid dish detergent for soaking dished in. I thought if this stuff can soak a burnt pan clean it may lift out whatever is making that horrid smell. Worked like a charm. I did soak it all day though but after it dried it was 98% smell free. I love the cap it does stay on and I move around a lot when I sleep.</li>
    <li> A little tight on the brain &amp; doesn&#x27;t keep the shape of hair as expected</li>
    <li> I ordered PINK. I received BLACK.</li>
    <li> i buy these bonnets alot a walmart but since i was ordering stuff from amazon i just decided too throw one in the cart i like these because they stay on at night the only thing i dislike is i always lose them all around my house and i often have to buy new ones which isnt the companys fault its mine lol</li>
    <li> stays on my head and this is the only one that stays on my head keeps my hair silky as well</li>
    <li> Not happy with this cap at all.  This bonnet is *not* large enough for a full hair style and the band is tight... what&#x27;s more,  it&#x27;s extremely thin and feels like nylon!  $6.75?  Why didn&#x27;t I just buy the bouffant, substantial, poly-satin version for 3.99 at the local drugstore?  Live and learn!</li>
    <li> This product I suppose is cool. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that I sleep weird, or if it&#x27;s the satin, but it tends to slip back either completely off my hair or halfway on my head.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call this a &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; &amp;#34;satin&amp;#34; bonnet. It&#x27;s rather small and the only &amp;#34;satin&amp;#34; part is what&#x27;s on the outside. It&#x27;s important to cover your hair with satin before going to sleep, so I flip the bonnet inside out before going to bed. I&#x27;m in the house anyway so no one would see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put flexi rods in my hair and thought I&#x27;d be able to cover them......well no. It didn&#x27;t happen like that. I couldn&#x27;t even put this &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; bonnet over them. Only half of my hair was covered. I ended up covering my hair with my large satin scarf. I tried using this bonnet with perm rods in my hair as well, it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I&#x27;d say about this product is that it stays on and never comes off. For that I give it 5 stars. I did purchase another one trying to get the pinkish color as shown in the picture and got something on the verge on goldfish yellow.</li>
    <li> Love that it stayed on my head all night, gave it 4 stars because I saw the same exact on at Walmart for $1.92.</li>
    <li> Cap stays on but at this point, I can&#x27;t say anything else about it. So, I gave it 3/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use this everynight it keeps my hair from drying out and it stays put on your head and love the color.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and I usually get it at Walmart for pretty cheap but I didn&#x27;t want to and I thought there were two but I only got one....My mistake? I guess but it&#x27;s still a nice cap. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my head and I&#x27;m a rough sleeper. SO I highly recommend it. But check Walmart or another hair shop for a cheaper one if you can.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money. Who&#x27;s head are they expecting will fit into this? Who&#x27;s hair is supposed to stay put after forcing it all past the tight elastic band? What a headache....literally.</li>
    <li> I just bought a light purple one of these from Duane Reade for 2.99 and I&#x27;m really impressed! First off, I have a huge head. I have never once been able to buy a woman&#x27;s hat from the store. But this fit perfectly and isn&#x27;t too tight at all. Second off, I am a wild restless sleeper. This stayed on all night and none of my curls came out! I have never been able to keep any sort of head wrap, scarf, or bonnet on all night. Ill add that there is no elastic band or scratchy section pulling out my hair like other reviewers have mentioned. Just a stretchy cloth headband attached to the satin bonnet part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the people who are dealing with varying sizing,  the one i got has the product number listed in the top corner of the product image on this listing. Mine doesnt specify large or small so i can only assume this company just has different product lines and some of you arent getting the item pictured.</li>
    <li> they are excellent, the colors are good, the elastic band has a lot of stretch, the satin keeps the hair from getting messed up when sleeping</li>
    <li> Its is not really large just average size and the quality is not as good as the picture. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I turn mine inside out for the smoother texture next to my hair. Stays on all night, meant for short hair, bonnet is small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a terrible sleeper but I find it doesn&#x27;t matter because these bonnets stay on.</li>
    <li> I like using these bonnets a lot. They stay on and work on my hair growth. Good good good good.</li>
    <li> A little tight but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> I have micro link extensions and this has been the most comfortable sleep cap. It also has enough room to swirl the hair inside so it doesnt kink over night and it hasnt fallen off yet while Im asleep!</li>
    <li> The band is way too tight. Ended up purchasing a silk scarf</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. One in pink and one in brown to wear camping. Didn&#x27;t want to get my regular one full of campfire smoke. Found them to be very comfortable so now I use this as my regular sleep cap. Some people have been remarking that this bonnet is too small. I have a pretty small head so this one is actually perfect for me. I&#x27;ve washed it a couple times and it seems to still hold up, stays on all night. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dye transferring from bonnet to my pillow case which is white. I have a decent amount of hair but I keep it in twists and pull it back at night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tight around my head and smells horrible.</li>
    <li> Not large at all and I had to wash it because it smelled horrible other than that its ok</li>
    <li> Best cap ever and it stays in place. I now have 2</li>
    <li> It is pretty comfy and stays in place almost all night through. It does its job. I don&#x27;t know that I love it and when I&#x27;m wearing it I feel like a weird looking chef, but I guess it protects my hair when needed.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected and hard to put on. The head opening was small</li>
    <li> I toss and turn all night, and I never could  find a sleep cap that stayed on my hair all night.  I used it over my braids and corn rolls and it remained in place all night.  However it slipped backward when I wore the cap over flat ironed hair.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t all that large.</li>
    <li> I love the Bonnet. I&#x27;m going to get more colors. I still use my silk scarf once in awhile but the bonnet stays on my head and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
    <li> this was really tight and uncomfortable...no room for hair.</li>
    <li> It seems to be of good quality, but the band was not comfortable for me.</li>
    <li> Not large as indicated. Runs very small</li>
    <li> bought it for my daughter who lives out of the country. she has lots of big fro and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> The band was way too tight, which I tried to solve by sewing in a gusset, which did not solve the problem.  I don&#x27;t remember the list of other problems, because I ended up by throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This item was just a little larger than the &#x27;normal&#x27; satin bonnet. It does not appear or function as advertised.</li>
    <li> I received a brown cap and the picture showed pink. No where does it state that a random color will be sent. I&#x27;m greatly disappointed with the color and have no idea how it fits because I really don&#x27;t even want to open it.</li>
    <li> It helps my curly hair to stay styled during night and it is very comfortable, the only problem is that it comes with different size every time I purchase one without &amp;#34;select size&amp;#34; option !</li>
    <li> This item is horrible. I was expecting it to be made out of a more delicate, softer material, but in actual fact, the material is rough to the touch and it completely ruins the natural texture of my hair. I am a curly girl, and let me tell you, that as a curly girl, I already have enough problems with frizz and this item just makes my life more different.</li>
    <li> Great night bonnet!! Not too big and not too tight. Very comfortable with elastic around my edges. I bought several for my daughters and for my mom who is a big fan of this bonnet.</li>
    <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call this large.  I have an average sized head and this cap was too tight to wear.  It would probable be just fine for someone with a smaller head.</li>
    <li> Love these better than drawstrings.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The fabric is soft and the satin is like silk. I&#x27;m on my natural hair journey and I do a lot of braid outs. It gave me no frizz, it saves my edges and protects my hair. I highly recommend this to anyone. Mind you the packaging says \\&quot;large\\&quot; if your head is bigger get a bigger bonnet. If your hair is longer; you might want to wrap your hair or do some flat twisting or braiding and then put it on. The large bonnet fits me very well and it doesn&#x27;t fall off my head because of the elastic satin band. Buy it! It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this and use it around the house but I bought it for sleeping and its too tight to sleep with it on my head without causing me a headache. If the band was just an inch bigger it would be perfect. Maybe I&#x27;ll cut it open and add a small piece of material to fix it but thats extra work.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as large as needed - but I gave it to my 9 year old granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t prefer to buy this thing at all&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to explain it to you&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s really bad&lt;br /&gt;If you buy a satin and sewing it by your self&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certainly sure it&#x27;s will better than this thousands of times</li>
    <li> Honestly I felt like I paid too much for this. Very basic.</li>
    <li> This was pretty much a waste of time and money. The product says to be a large but it is so tight that I could not open it wide enough to place my hair in and be comfortable. Not sure if it is an elastic band issue.&lt;br /&gt;This would probably be ok for a child.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use it. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. Might as well go to Sally&#x27;s or your local hair supply store and look at the product before you buy.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old has a lot of fine curly hair.  The large fit her well.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT  SO MUCH IT NEVER COMES OFF...</li>
    <li> It is way to tight around the band part and is extremly small not for hair past shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;And none of these new satin head caps are like traditional satin but cheap thin polyester.</li>
    <li> This is kinda of small, it fits my 6 year old daughter snugly and probably wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for a large Afro or a large head. She has curly 3b hair and it stays on all night. It&#x27;s perfect for her, and fits my average sized head too (snugly but comfortably)</li>
    <li> If you have a large head dont buy it will be a bit too tight.</li>
    <li> This is a good satin bonnet and stays on well through the night, however the title of &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; bonnet is deceiving. If you have on rollers or have an everage head size, then this isn&#x27;t for you. If you have a short hair cut or your hair is pinned closely to your head, than this make work well. I would resize this as a small to medium sized bonnet. Other than that, it was ok.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the product that I am writing about. It&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s the price that I am talking about.  I am all about saving if at all possible.&lt;br /&gt;For the price that Amazon charges for this item, I could get 2 at Walmart. (Sorry Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Walmart sells them for $1.62 each. Also this way there is no shipping charge. I am starting&lt;br /&gt;to do this with other products that Amazon sells. I research the price on Walmart or other stores&lt;br /&gt;and if it is cheaper at these other outlets, then I will go with them. Who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> This bonnet is described as being large, but it is not large enough for the average adult head.  I was unable to wear it at night because it was much too tight.</li>
    <li> Really small. Would be fine for kids.</li>
