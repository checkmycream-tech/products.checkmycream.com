      <li>I love this mask.</li>
      <li>My husband is also able to wear it.</li>
      <li>the med/large is more like a kid&#x27;s mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>--so many people who review this product just review this one.  </li>
      <li>I have to applaud the designers of Vogmask for making a product that looks better than most masks out on the market.  </li>

      <li>and our employees use it to reduce dust inhalation on job sites and are satisfied with it for light duty jobs.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to give it a proper test against pet dander but for everything else it has been great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s snug around my nose and easy to adjust.</li>
      <li>Pollen and fine particle filtering during yardwork.  </li>
      <li>When watering a friend&#x27;s houseplants, I kept getting sinusitis for about a week afterwards, so now I limit my exposure and also wear this mask, which is light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>One of them which seemed amusing if not frightening was someone who claimed to be the owner of a demolition company, who claimed to have bought these for workers and said that these masks were far more effective than the paper ones.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Turns out breathing is important.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;These masks fit well and are comfortable.  </li>
      <li>These are comfortable and I&#x27;m just trying to master my glasses not fogging up.</li>
      <li>At first, wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it and then realized how many different ways it can be put to good use:</li>

      <li>I feel protected in this mask, but as much as the ones I tried with a couple of more layers.  </li>
      <li>I got one of these masks and love how soft the material is, how light and stretchy</li>
      <li>Adequate.</li>
      <li>Other than the issues mentioned, it is very comfortable to wear, and very easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expect other ways to use this product will continue to present themselves, and that&#x27;s a beautiful thing, because most of the time I breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The first one I purchased just to see if it would work.  </li>
      <li>A lot of humidity builds up inside the mask, which is great when in a dry air situation and you want to humidify the air you are breathing (e.g. on an airplane or in the dry winter air)</li>
      <li>and i even ordered a large</li>
      <li>I bought two of these for my hubby who has very severe COPD.  </li>

      <li>Ordered and received my first Vogmask last week</li>
      <li>This is consistent, and I discovered it by accident one day but have repeated it on multiple occasions.  </li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference over previous experiences.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tight enough that no air comes through the top</li>
      <li>and I am completely stoked.</li>
      <li>I was hopeful since I ran out of the old style pleated, soft dust masks.  </li>
      <li>It makes a tremendous differeence in how much my allergies bother me -- very little this year.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a female with an average sized head and it works fine for me.</li>
      <li>These masks are so sleek and sexy they could be lingerie, and if you are like me and don&#x27;t wear lingerie on your head (usually), well then, this you simply must have.  </li>
      <li>--I had such high hopes.</li>
      <li>The mask is small, comfortable and does the job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;During my last visit to the area where I constantly have breathing issues, I wore the mask every time I had to be on the main streets, following buses and old cards, spewing smoke and gunk into the air.  </li>
      <li>more than two months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refused to wear the hospital-style masks as I tried them once during SARS times and found them to be miserably uncomfortable when trying to function in normal life.  </li>

<li> I did not find the dampness to be a problem in the winter unless I put a scarf over top of the mask, thus holding the damp cold mask against my face (I learned not to do that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought two of these for my hubby who has very severe COPD.  He can wear this over his cannula (hose for oxygen) when he is out in public, to help keep out offensive odors and germs.  I did have to wash them when they arrived because they have a scent to them.  I machine washed and dried them and was happy to know that they do not shrink.  My hubby is happy with this product and cannot wait to wear them.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful since I ran out of the old style pleated, soft dust masks.  This one collapses every time you take a breath--and the med/large is more like a kid&#x27;s mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad--I had such high hopes.</li>
    <li> Adequate. About what you&#x27;d expect. Does not filter very strong odors. or allergens. I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of things, and have a very strong sense of smell. Having said that, It does filter a lot of things, and makes life somewhat easier.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second mask tonight.  The first one I purchased just to see if it would work.  I spend a lot of time outside the USA in areas where street-level pollution is almost unbearable.  I found that I developed a cough and constant nasty \\&quot;phlegm\\&quot; depending on how long I had to be in certain locations.  The last cough (before the mask) lasted more than two months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refused to wear the hospital-style masks as I tried them once during SARS times and found them to be miserably uncomfortable when trying to function in normal life.  That is why I ordered this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that the part that covers your nose has something to keep the \\&quot;seal\\&quot; around your nose tight.  That was both a surprise and a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my last visit to the area where I constantly have breathing issues, I wore the mask every time I had to be on the main streets, following buses and old cards, spewing smoke and gunk into the air.  And yes, people do look at me funny at times, but it could be because I&#x27;m a stranger in their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;I breathe harder wearing the mask due to the filtering through the material.&lt;br /&gt;The harder I breathe often causes my glasses to fog up slightly.&lt;br /&gt;And the build-up of heat and sweat inside the mask makes my acne go crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NONE of those negatives are deal breakers, hence the order for the second (back-up) mask.  Other than the issues mentioned, it is very comfortable to wear, and very easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color, btw, was the most \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; I could find and didn&#x27;t stand out on my face like a pink bandana.</li>
    <li> Received this great item as a gift.  At first, wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it and then realized how many different ways it can be put to good use: Dust filtering while housecleaning (especially deep cleaning).  Pollen and fine particle filtering during yardwork.  Germ protection when travelling (planes, trains, and automobiles!!).  Smog filtration for biking in the city (imagine what it must be like biking in Beijing, Calcutta, or Mexico City . . . Zoiks!).  I expect other ways to use this product will continue to present themselves, and that&#x27;s a beautiful thing, because most of the time I breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself recommending VOGMASK to just about everyone I meet, and expect I will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out breathing is important.  Who knew?!!?</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and well made.  It look and feel great.  I think it helps to protect my husband from others germs.  He is on chemo, so he needs the extra protection.  Really nice.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> We like to go ATVing year-along. This mask is perfect for our high-desert climate that&#x27;s filled with dust. The mask fits perfectly. It&#x27;s snug around my nose and easy to adjust. It&#x27;s tight enough that no air comes through the top so my sunglasses don&#x27;t fog up. I&#x27;m a female with an average sized head and it works fine for me. My husband is also able to wear it. I hand wash it and let it air dry. It works great.</li>
    <li> These masks are so sleek and sexy they could be lingerie, and if you are like me and don&#x27;t wear lingerie on your head (usually), well then, this you simply must have.  I shape surfboards and so do my friends so we need good protection from the fiberglass, epoxy, and resin that swirls when we are shaping but we don&#x27;t want to look like factory workers when we do it and these masks have style for miles. I&#x27;m serious, they are really cool and versatile. Thanks whoever made these things, they are awesome! [[ASIN:B007Q2KGJA Vogmask Blue Flowers Microfiber Filtering Mask: Dust mask for germs, dust, smoke, ash, pollen, pollution, cycling, woodworking, or anonymity]]</li>
    <li> I feel protected in this mask, but as much as the ones I tried with a couple of more layers.  The mask is attractive, but definitely draws attention.  The adjustable fit was good.</li>
    <li> Wearing masks all day is a pain but a must.  These are comfortable and I&#x27;m just trying to master my glasses not fogging up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for protection against dust, dander, and airborne particles associated with yard work.  I haven&#x27;t been able to give it a proper test against pet dander but for everything else it has been great.  It makes a huge difference over previous experiences.</li>
    <li> It was too sweaty for us to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using these Vogmasks for sometime now.  They have helped to keep me from getting sick.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> It was all I expected and more</li>
    <li> Works well for wood dust, is washable. I&#x27;d rather hills out around my head than behind my ears. B R</li>
    <li> I got one of these masks and love how soft the material is, how light and stretchy and it&#x27;s nice looking-  I wear it to avoid getting sick when I sit in the waiting room at the doctor&#x27;s office!  Just going in for a check up or to get annual cholesterol check, I want to avoid getting whatever viruses or illnesses other people have.  You hear them coughing and think, \\&quot;will I get sick?\\&quot; but you won&#x27;t now!  The mask fits with little loops behind your ears so you don&#x27;t have that big ugly strap around the back.  Buy one of these- your life will be better not getting sick as much.  I also plan on using it when I am around dusty places or even high pollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Vogmask!</li>
    <li> I have been unable to go outside for more than 30 minutes during the past four years without incurring a severe breathing attack several hours after exposure.  This requires use of a rescue inhaler, steroids, etc. Medical intervention lasts a few weeks before I return to normal.  Wearing the non-woven microfiber Vogmask allows me to go outside for a walk and/or work in my yard without incurring medical side effects.  The mask is small, comfortable and does the job. Thank you Vogmask.</li>
    <li> Ordered and received my first Vogmask last week and I am completely stoked. It looks cool, feels good to wear, filters really well and has an amazing design on it that looks great. I know this is the best option out there for allergies masks. I will be a loyalist from her eon out! Thank you Vogmask!!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable for my husband. He wears it about 12 hrs a day due to cancer.  Its very nice</li>
    <li> I have to applaud the designers of Vogmask for making a product that looks better than most masks out on the market.  That, unfortunately is the only thing I can applaud them for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microfiber on these masks is very hard to breathe through.  Perhaps it would work well if it had exhalation valves.  It&#x27;s also not very practical--these masks can be reused but NOT washed.  If it starts getting a bit skanky, it is suggested that we sprinkle the mask with rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also skanky and questionable are some of the product reviews for this and similar masks--so many people who review this product just review this one.  One of them which seemed amusing if not frightening was someone who claimed to be the owner of a demolition company, who claimed to have bought these for workers and said that these masks were far more effective than the paper ones.  Um, hello, has this guy not heard of OSHA?  His workers should be wearing masks with a much higher filtration rating--likely with at least N95 (probably more like P100) filtering capacity.  Demolition is much dustier than other types of construction.</li>
    <li> Pricey for what it is, just a polyester piece of fabric.  It fits okay and our employees use it to reduce dust inhalation on job sites and are satisfied with it for light duty jobs.</li>
    <li> I Like this product especially when IM outside it was comfortable ,, but the problem is it was to small for me and i even ordered a large</li>
    <li> This mask worked well to keep out cigarette smoke for short periods of time. When watering a friend&#x27;s houseplants, I kept getting sinusitis for about a week afterwards, so now I limit my exposure and also wear this mask, which is light and easy to use. Glad to say that this kept problems at bay! Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> too hot and uncomfortable to wear; i would have returned it if i could.  Would not recommend buying this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wear this mask almost every time I go outside, year round, and daily during a nearly one mile each way walk to work.  It makes a tremendous differeence in how much my allergies bother me -- very little this year.  Despite the downside of this mask (and there are some, see below), I will continue to buy them and wear them year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks fit well and are comfortable.  They do not block 100% of outside particles from entering, but they do do a pretty good job most of the time.  So, for example, if you have to walk through a cloud of cigarette smoke you will still notice the smoke, but it will be nowhere near as strong as it would be without the mask.  Pollens and other similar small allergens are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has two significant downsides (they don&#x27;t stop be from wearing it, but they are important to note):  (1) when I wear it my pulse ox drops -- measurable using a pulse oximeter as a drop of a couple %-age points (e.g. 99% to 97%).  This is consistent, and I discovered it by accident one day but have repeated it on multiple occasions.  Your mileage may vary.  (2) A lot of humidity builds up inside the mask, which is great when in a dry air situation and you want to humidify the air you are breathing (e.g. on an airplane or in the dry winter air), however the consequence of it is that after several minutes the mask can become damp and after prolonged use the damp is verging on wet.  Never &amp;#34;dripping&amp;#34; wet or wet that transfers to other things, but noticeably damp, and the &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; of the fabric changes (softens).  As long as you are prepared for this, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal, and the filter properties still work (though I don&#x27;t know if they are reduced at all or not).  I did not find the dampness to be a problem in the winter unless I put a scarf over top of the mask, thus holding the damp cold mask against my face (I learned not to do that and so had no further problems -- the mask gives good warm humidified air on its own, just get good at loosely wrapping a scarf leaving a pocket of air gap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  be aware of the two downsides, and happily wear the mask everywhere anyway.  I love this mask.</li>
