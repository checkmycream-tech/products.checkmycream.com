      <li>it lathers nicely and does not strip your hair....</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I do not have a trader joe store in my area</li>
      <li>I liked the smell and everything</li>
      <li>The conditioner is excellent, very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR GOOD VEGAN PRODUCTS AND LOVE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.</li>
      <li>This stuff is just wonderful on natural hair.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love!</li>
      <li>kept me from being able to wear it this way most of the time because my hair would be frizzy, even with smoothing products.  </li>
      <li>Pennsylvania called Trader Joe&#x27;s.  :)  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>my hair looks so nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I will buy again for sure.</li>
      <li>I just love love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I love the way it cleans and conditions  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve  been getting many compliments since I have used this brand.</li>
      <li>When I received my order today the shampoo top was not screwed on .</li>
      <li>oh and one more thing</li>
      <li>Love how my hair feel after I use it.</li>
      <li>diggidy! :)  </li>
      <li>sure is shiney.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>The shampoo did not leave my hair feeling tangled after I rinsed it out, as so many shampoos do.  </li>
      <li>You will notice how much more your hair will lather on he&#x27;d.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I can even get 2nd day hair with equally as wonderful texture!  </li>
      <li>The conditioner was okay too</li>
      <li>While it has always been healthy, it has never had the volume or the spring that it does now.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair clean for more than a day!</li>
      <li>Again, the results after the conditioner was soft detangled hair and felt so good!  </li>
      <li>My hair was not soft and it did not experience any of the wonderful results everyone else raved about.</li>
      <li>I love strong scented shampoos</li>
      <li>I want so badly to love this product: it&#x27;s cruelty free, mostly organic and natural, smells nice, feels good in the shower and - most importantly - it does clean my hair nicely...</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural great stuff and affordable.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many sufate wheat free shampoos and its always hit or miss.</li>
      <li>SO if you have straight hair, this is probably a really good product for you, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, it kind of took the waves and sheen right out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I feel good using more natural products on my kids.</li>
      <li>Conversely, they clean while leaving my hair healthy and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the best conditioner that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair light and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>To some that may sound great but for my kinky curly hair type that means I have to over compensate with applying oil back into my hair to prevent breakage.  </li>
      <li>and my hair makes that not-so-lovely crunching sound</li>
      <li>Bought this product with free shipping.  </li>
      <li>For one, this shampoo smelled fabulous.</li>
      <li>is it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
      <li>I have not yet found a good shampoo and conditioner that are all natural, contain no parabens, and are moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Since I began using this pair a week ago, my hair has become more consistently textured and curly.  </li>
      <li>Im pretty sure it&#x27;s both of them together.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love how my hair feel after I use it. transitioning to natural was such a challenge but with the moisturizer it help</li>
    <li> After purchasing over 10 different pairs of hair cleansing &amp; conditioning products in the last year that claim to \\&quot;de-frizz,\\&quot; \\&quot;strengthen,\\&quot; \\&quot;protect,\\&quot; \\&quot;hydrate,\\&quot; etc. (well, you likely know the list of assertions by now) I have found my solution in a humble little store in Wayne, Pennsylvania called Trader Joe&#x27;s.  :)  After lurking on the NaturallyCurly forums one afternoon, I stumbled upon these as suggested by tons of fellow curly-haired members!  I had about given up on my 3b curls and was soon to cut them off, but I made the trip and tried these as a last resort.  I appreciate that these products are nearly organic.  (Nearly, because they do contain parabens.)  I had previously been working with a 100% vegan sulfate-free, paraben-free, AND silicon-free product, but that left something to be desired.  I don&#x27;t find that these products coat or weigh down my curls.  Conversely, they clean while leaving my hair healthy and bouncy.  Even in the shower, I can feel the effects of the conditioner doing its job.  My hair is super silky as I lather and rinse, and I feel the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; that lets me know my hair is actually absorbing.  The test for me is aftermath: diffusing and drying my curls.  Over the years, my hair has subjected me to an endless texture struggle.  In some periods of my life, my hair has actually grown out curly at the root and then straightened out (poker straight) for about 2-4 inches at the ends.  Stubborn to even the strongest of products, my hair spent most of its time in a ponytail.  As a college student in the sciences, I didn&#x27;t have 30-60 minutes each day to either straighten it completely or curl the ends, nor did I want to damage it with repeated heat exposure.  Blow-drying via a diffuser with my head upside-down made no mark other than to solidify my curly roots and make the difference even more noticeable.  Since I began using this pair a week ago, my hair has become more consistently textured and curly.  The ends don&#x27;t form dramatic spirals as they did when I was in middle school, but the curl is slowly returning with each use (every other or every two days wash, as appropriate).  When I diffuse, I get the best results.  It makes me wonder what my previous products were doing to my hair.  While it has always been healthy, it has never had the volume or the spring that it does now.  I can even get 2nd day hair with equally as wonderful texture!  I highly recommend this to all of my curly girls out there who struggle daily to achieve a soft but frizz-free look, yet I advise customers to purchase in-store, because online the prices are absurd!  At $2.99 a bottle (IN STORES), do you really have much to lose?</li>
    <li> I paid $16.00 for these, when I could have bought both shampoo and conditioner for $6.00 had I gone to Trader Joe&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I have been using the combination for a while now and am very happy. My hair is natural and most of the products sold for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; still have chemicals and still treat my hair like it is relaxed. You can&#x27;t beat the price at $2.99 a bottle. Not sure why it&#x27;s so expensive online?</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I hope you realize it is only $3.99 at TJ. If I couldn&#x27;t buy this I would get Giovanni Direct, they have  exactly the same ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am natural and I have heard and seen rave reviews about these products so I went on line and purchased it. My hair was not soft and it did not experience any of the wonderful results everyone else raved about. However just because it did not work for me does not mean that it is a bad product. It simply did not work for my hair. I have 4b hair.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This stuff is just wonderful on natural hair. I mix it with honey and it made my hair even softer. I would recommend this to anyone who is transitioning.</li>
    <li> This shampoo seemed harsh. Probably better for young folks that have more oil in their hair.  It really driied out my hair.</li>
    <li> Very drying. Gave me dandruff. I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my entire life. I actually resorted to using the dog shampoo I had in my shower the past couple of days instead since I couldn&#x27;t handle the flakes anymore, and my hair is back to normal.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair looks much healthier than before and it is great for natural and straight hair.  However, the product is much cheaper in stores than online.</li>
    <li> I have used every brand of supposedly all natural ingredients shampoos and conditioners but they still had chemicals in it and dried out my hair and a frizzy mess couldnt comb  or brush my hair,but  nothing can hold a candle to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair and allergic to  LAURETH SULFATE&lt;br /&gt;MYRETH SULFATE&lt;br /&gt;SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE&lt;br /&gt;BLEPHARITIS&lt;br /&gt; I break out  from my scalp down to to my toes whole body rash and itching (contact dermatitus) from these so called organic shampoos and conditioners&lt;br /&gt;This Trader Joes made my hair so soft,shiny and smell so yummy and not 1 ingedient is harmful to your hair or body.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!!! I just love love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, unrelaxed 3a/b/c hair mix, I&#x27;ve also set the left front side of my hair on fire a few times (that&#x27;s a whole other story) and after the last time it&#x27;s just refused to grow longer than a couple of inches, while the rest of my hair falls just about 4 maybe 5 inches below my shoulder blades. Because of that I wear extensions in the front of my hair because I refuse to cut it, but finding a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner that both my hair and the extensions can tolerate equitably was really hard because of the very slight difference in texture. I used Alterna, but at $18-$24 a bottle, it was getting pretty expensive because my hair is so long and the texture needs more conditioner than the norm. I actually stumbled onto this one night when I ran out of my Alterna, someone had given it to my mum and she didn&#x27;t care for it (for whatever reason) so it was just sitting in one of the bathroom cupboards. Let me tell you, after using this, I will never ever use anything else, the conditioner is so thick that I can use a very small amount and it completely coats and absorbs into my hair and leaves it so soft, manageable and frizz free, and it didn&#x27;t damage my extensions either and treated them just as well as it did my hair. Thank god there&#x27;s a Trader Joe&#x27;s five minutes up the street from me.</li>
    <li> Im pretty sure it&#x27;s both of them together. Hence the title \\&quot;trader joes nourish spa balance moisturizing shampoo AND conditioner.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve been reading and hearing about. I will defiantly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner. Have used daily for 2 years following a corrective color disaster- finally grown most of my hair back out in my natural color and this stuff is a miracle worker- and great for blondes (no sulfates). products are comprised mostly of the first 5 ingredients (and each ingredient is listed in order of quantity, fyi)- take a look at what&#x27;s in this stuff- amazing. However, at Trader Joe&#x27;s, they are 2.99 each, and that&#x27;s regular everyday price.</li>
    <li> Did not like this shampoo and conditioner for my hair at all.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff and not experience!</li>
    <li> First time ysing this set and I coated my hair with my aztec healing clay, when washed it left my hair soft then I proceeded to use the norish spa shampoo which left my hair feeling dried out until I proceeded with the conditioner and got my softness back. Its ok so far</li>
    <li> Smells good I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural great stuff and affordable. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> As always my orders were on time. For one, this shampoo smelled fabulous. The shampoo even made my hair tangle fee. The conditioner was as soothing as you can get.  My hair turned out SO soft and luxurious. The Shine was amazing.  I&#x27;ve  been getting many compliments since I have used this brand. This is definitely my new shampoo and creations!</li>
    <li> received items in a timely manner but the shampoo is quit drying to my curly hair.</li>
    <li> For all those who miss TJ&#x27;s old brand of shampoo and conditioner that had far less chemicals than the new ones, do not be fooled by the old picture displayed for this item. They send you the new shampoo and conditioner instead of the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;I went online looking for a chemical free shampoo and conditioner after TJ&#x27;s changed their product and came across this item with a picture of the old TJ&#x27;s bottles. I thought I would be receiving the old TJ&#x27;s bottle but they sent me the new chemical-loaded product instead :\&lt;br /&gt;Luckily amazon took the order back. I hear that Whole Foods has shampoo and conditioner that is chemical-free and not bad for the price..I am checking them out today.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your search!</li>
    <li> It smells great but I didn&#x27;t care for this shampoo.  It left my hair squeaky clean.  To some that may sound great but for my kinky curly hair type that means I have to over compensate with applying oil back into my hair to prevent breakage.  The conditioner was okay too I use it for my daughters hair they have a finer hair texture and it works great for them.  The smell is really nice.</li>
    <li> Found it in Trader Joe&#x27;s. Love it. Perfect for my oily wavy hair. Keeps my hair clean for more than a day! Smells good. I&#x27;m always looking for new shampoos, but always end up coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Dries out my scalp however if I just use the shampoo</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT GETS 5 STARS, BUT THE PRICE GETS 4. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR GOOD VEGAN PRODUCTS AND LOVE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER. GOOD SMELL. NOT TOO HEAVY, BUT STILL STRONG ENOUGH TO DETANGLE MY MOP.</li>
    <li> My hair is shiny and smoother than its been in five or six years. I am very pleased. I love the light scents, the neutral color bottles which add to the serene spa like environment I&#x27;m trying to creat in my bathroom, and the overall quality of the product. Keep I. Mind, as with every shampoo, you will get the best results by wash&amp;rinse twice with the shampoo -once to remove dirt and once to remove oil. You will notice how much more your hair will lather on he&#x27;d. We ons wash. Apply e conditioner after you wash twice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner works well and smells good, although the conditioner still leaves my ends very dry.  I have dry, curly hair and read a lot of good reviews about this product and curly hair, it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a 4 because my ends are still very dry and both products contain pathalates, which I found surprising from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice basic shampoo and conditioner. Nothing too special about it.Those  products cost 3$ each in trader joe! Don&#x27;t buy it here. And please, Amazon, be fair.</li>
    <li> These products are absolutely amazing on my hair African American natural hair! Shampoo did not leave my hair with hard coarse feeling like most shampoos that I&#x27;ve used. The conditioner? Let me just tell you.... Hands down, this is the best conditioner that I have ever used. My hair instantly responded to it. My hair was super soft and it was defining my curls as soon as I applied it. A little goes a long way with both products. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another product as long as this continues to work for me. Hope they don&#x27;t change the formula. Love, Love, Love!</li>
    <li> Decided to buy because of the good reviews, but once again I&#x27;m left disappointed. The very first thing I noticed about this stuff was to horrid old lady perfume smell. The smell lasts for hours and actually made my eyes water. I can&#x27;t believe anyone would like it. As for the conditioning, my hair felt drier than it did before and left a residue. Glad i only paid 6 bucks.</li>
    <li> So I decided to buy this shampoo because I have read many great things. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me. I liked the smell and everything but this shampoo and conditioner leaves unwanted residue on my hair. I wash my hair really thoroughly but in the mornings but when I try to brush and straighten my hair, I can still feel the shampoo or conditioner left on the lower portions of my hair. I don&#x27;t like the waste shampoo so I am trying to finish it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great products found at any Teader Joe&#x27;s. The price is $2.99 per item.</li>
    <li> The conditioner leaves your hair so soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I did not expect to like this. I have tried so many sufate wheat free shampoos and its always hit or miss. This one is a HIT! clean hair, no perfume smell. No fruity or sweet smell. Just clean hair. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisture, it really makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> These products left my hair feeling dry and straw-like. Despite being sulfate-free, I saw a lot of my color wash down the drain in shampoo foam.</li>
    <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s sells a wonderful hair product, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand why it is listed at this price here.  Are you guys aware that each bottle is only like 3 or 4 bucks at the store??? What  a rip off here!!!</li>
    <li> As a licensed professional, I have always been able to buy professional products at a huge discount, so that is what I usually purchased.  However, it is hard to find brands that are not tested on animals. (I am also an animal welfare author and only buy cruelty-free). I am picky about my hair products because I have highlights, naturally curly hair that I straighten with a blowdryer every day and so my hair tends to be very dry.  Most products that say they are for dry hair do not give me the moisture or shine that I need.  After reading many good reviews on this shampoo/conditioner duo from Trader Joe&#x27;s, I decided to give it a try.  I cannot say enough positive things about these products.  The list of ingredients impressed the heck out of me, too.  I made the switch from the Chi Enviro line to these after I saw how much smoother my hair was.  I got 3 compliments on my hair in a matter of days.  That also tells me that other people see a difference.  The shampoo did not leave my hair feeling tangled after I rinsed it out, as so many shampoos do.  I usually leave the conditioner in for about 10 minutes &amp; use a wide tooth conditioning comb before rinsing it out.  My hair will always start to wave or curl-up immediately...The only problem is, other brands I used kept me from being able to wear it this way most of the time because my hair would be frizzy, even with smoothing products.  After using these products, my hair dried much smoother (no hair dryer) and had that beachy, natural waves look vs. looking like a perm.  At that point, I was sold!  After the first use, I noticed that when I did use a round brush to straighten my hair, it straightened much easier than usual and had a lot more body.  Last week my Dad told me \\&quot;your hair sure is shiney.\\&quot;  Not knowing I had switched brands, my Mom said my hair looked \\&quot;really bouncy and smooth.\\&quot;  My fiance (who brought me home this duo from Trader Joe&#x27;s) remarked that he loved the way my hair smelled.  Which brings me to another point...At the store these products are only like $7 for the both of them.  I realize that not everyone lives near a Trader Joe&#x27;s, but I think charging people 2-3x&#x27;s what these products cost with high shipping is a bit much.  It would be cheaper to have a friend send it to them.  Just my opinion.  During my last hair appointment, my stylist noticed I did not have the split ends or dryness that I usually do.  I took these products with me and showed her the list of ingredients.  She said she could really notice a difference in the overall health and condition of my hair.  So if you are on the fence, for the price, I would certainly give it a try.other point...At the store these products are only like $7 for the both of them.

    <li> Bought this product with free shipping.  Works well for my daughters&#x27; long hair and I feel good using more natural products on my kids.</li>
    <li> Recently decided to switch to all natural hair products and tried this. Works well, my hair is nice and soft, and doesn&#x27;t get as oily as it used to. I wish it smelled a little more fragrant but I guess that&#x27;s the trade-off when you go chemical-free... I love strong scented shampoos but I&#x27;d rather have the all natural ingredients. Lathers up pretty nicely and leaves hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I have used. This is worth the price. I will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I am an African American male.  I have nice wavy (but thick) natural hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this for weeks now and will not buy the shampoo or conditioner again as it is not moisturizing enough.  Believe it or not, it kind of took the waves and sheen right out of my hair.  I bought this because I wanted a natural shampoo and conditioner but I wasn&#x27;t aware this contained parabens, which are basically chemical preservatives.  I have not yet found a good shampoo and conditioner that are all natural, contain no parabens, and are moisturizing.  This does smell great but that&#x27;s about it.  It dries your hair out, no matter how long you leave the conditioner in for.  Maybe this is great if you don&#x27;t have ethnic hair but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is excellent, very moisturizing.  The shampoo however; is very, drying.  This may be good for those whom have oily hair, I have dry hair so I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it.  They both smell good.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF LEAVES MY HAIR MOIST AND SOFT.  I AM NEWLY NATURAL AND I USE THIS ONCE A WEEK TO DEEP CONDITION. IT WORKS GREAT, A LITTLE PRICEY BUT WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving his 3 stars because I loved this shampoo / conditioner for the first month but then I noticed it was starting to really dry my hair out. I had to switch. Also it&#x27;s WAY cheaper at the Trader Joes stores.</li>
    <li> I heard about this shampoo and conditioner from a girlfriend and I dye my hair.  She told me is works great for our humid climate and she was right.  I love the way it cleans and conditions  It is mild enough for my dyed hair and smells clean not overpowering.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon as I do not have a trader joe store in my area</li>
    <li> One of the best organic duos i have tried.  My hair feels alive again.</li>
    <li> I want so badly to love this product: it&#x27;s cruelty free, mostly organic and natural, smells nice, feels good in the shower and - most importantly - it does clean my hair nicely... just, a little too nicely. As in, it&#x27;s totally dry and my hair makes that not-so-lovely crunching sound it doesn&#x27;t normally make except with a really strong product, and my leave-in conditioners and oils aren&#x27;t helping. I am trying to find a good s/c set that isn&#x27;t expensive because I don&#x27;t have that kind of budget, but after two tries this is not it. I&#x27;ve exhausted my attempts at a TJ s/c set - they all do this. I referred it to my sister (cosmetologist in training) and she says it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s too much citric. It does the job but there isn&#x27;t enough to replenish what it strips. My hair type (medium/fine, wavy, oily, mildly damaged on just the crown) happens to be effected quickly. I can&#x27;t say I hate it because TJ is trying to be good and so many need follow suit, but this product can be entirely damaging to certain hair types.</li>
    <li> I love this product I am using it on my teenage daughter&#x27;s natural hair!! Specially the conditioner it&#x27;s awesome her hair feel moisturized after she used it!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about Trader Joe&#x27;s and decided to give it a try.  I used the shampoo and conditioner about an hour ago, and let me tell you, it&#x27;s the bomb diggidy! :)  After the shampoo, I noticed that my hair was super clean, but not stripped of natural oils!  It was also soft, not dry feeling like with previous shampoos.  On to the conditioner...I have nothing but praise!  I have 3c/4a type hair and my little curls were dancing when I washed it out!  Smells great too, which is a bonus!  Again, the results after the conditioner was soft detangled hair and felt so good!  My hair loves this stuff, and sense I&#x27;m finally paying attention to what my hair likes, my conclusion is...I think this is the real thing, and I&#x27;ll be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Gentle, not loaded with chemicals, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy film , cleans without stripping the hair of vital oils. Leaves my hair light and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Please go to trader joes if you want to buy/try this out.. Its only 2.99! And they have a whole aisle of all natural beauty items and supplements thats also totally reasonably priced. This price is insulting espeacially for the shoppers like me who didnt/dont know any better.</li>
    <li> I used it when I was natural.  I&#x27;ve recently relaxed my hair and it works wonders on my relaxed hair as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure who decided I shouldn&#x27;t have sulfates or whatever it is in my shampoo, but after trying this (based on the high reviews it got----thanks for letting me down there, people!!), I&#x27;ll stick with that ingredient in my shampoo.  The first time I used it I thought it was pretty good, my hair seemed soft.  The scent is a little off-putting to me, it smells like a vaginal wash.  Not a bad smell, but not a great one either.  However, after the 2nd use, I noticed my hands were incredibly dry after my shower.  Then my head started to itch.  It&#x27;s just WAY too drying, and really after using a couple of times, my hair no longer felt soft, it felt dried out.  The only good think about it is it&#x27;s cheap.  I&#x27;ll be giving it away, though.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, so  different brands shampoos and (especially) conditioners tend to weigh it down. This is nice and light: lots of suds, and the conditioner is just enough to keep your hair from getting that ststic cling we tend to get in dry winter weather. I think this is my new hair combo.</li>
    <li> Love it!  A small amount makes lots of lather.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel great!</li>
    <li> Someone asked about the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a subtle citrus fragrance. I think it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampoo &amp; conditioner on my 4-day old permed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft, but it&#x27;s not for permed hair. The static electricity makes my hair fly around and into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit using it and gave it to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;He likes the smell and his hair is too short for static electricity problems. :)</li>
    <li> Hate the shampoo.....it dried my hair. Love the conditioner.....very moisturizing!!!! Will only purchase the conditioner next time!</li>
    <li> it sucked.  it seemed to work really well the first time i used it but the 2nd and subsequent times just made my hair dry out.  I wont buy from this seller again. Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Take the five stars with a grain of salt. Never tried the shampoo but the conditioner was my boo. I have thick curly hair. Then they went and changed the formula to include dimethicone which my hair HATES. THis product is no longer curly girl friendly so I don&#x27;t buy it anymore. Heartbroken curlies I feel your pain.</li>
    <li> First of all I have fine,incredibly frizzy,voluminous,butt length wavy/curly 2c hair and this stuff works really well for me.The shampoo is very gentle and mild...it lathers nicely and does not strip your hair....The conditioner however is the best part about this set.My hair tangles so easily and everytime i try to detangle my hair with most conditioners in the past they have made me want to cry in the shower...but this conditioner melts the tangles away and makes it so much easier on my arms lol...the scent is absoloutely delightful and it lingers in your hair all day...once I let my hair air dry its very light feeling and full of body and shine...my scalp is very moisturized and clear so if u suffer from seborrheic dermatitis like myself or just any scalp issues like simple dandruff or dryness this stuff will be very soothing...its been able to clear my scalp unlike any other dandruff products...if I could find one small issue to nit pick at its that it doesnt define my curls and waves as well as i would want it to but thats just me...nothing a little coconut oil cant fix...all the other pros out-weigh the cons :) oh and one more thing I dont live near a trader joe&#x27;s so it makes it really difficult to find these products online without it being overpriced :( luckily i can find it here on amazon but its still pretty expensive compared to the in store price which is like $2.99 a bottle..*sigh*</li>
    <li> Great to be able to get these products online as the closest TJ is a couple hours away!</li>
    <li> Today is wash day for me . I shampoo and condition every two weeks and cowash once a week with conditioners and oils. I am African American with relaxed hair that is stretched, I also have fine textured hair . When I received my order today the shampoo top was not screwed on . Shampoo was all over the packaging , which was tightly wrapped . Before I shampoo my hair I did the deep conditioner steam method with a towel then rinsed my hair to apply shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: shampoo is very light and lathers great . Conditioner is amazing , it makes your hair super soft after shampooing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: the shampoo made my hair feel very stripped , dry and tingled after one shampoo . Second shampoo I used a dime size amount with a quarter size of conditioner . It helped a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall: if I purchase this again I would only get the conditioner .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still on the hunt for a great shampoo and conditioner for relaxed hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo and condition are the best product I ever used. My hair is color treated and so frizzy with this products my hair looks so nice and smooth. No more frizz.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products....they are the only shampoo and conditioner I use.  They work perfectly for my hair, and the best part is that they are completely cruelty-free!</li>
    <li> the fragrance and feel of your hair after using this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> For mother she loves them</li>
    <li> I wanted so bad for this to work for me, especially after the great reviews it received from the majority of its consumers. However, I used the product once, and never again. Did not work at all on my curly hair because it deflated it - my hair became weird, wavy and flat BUT very smooth (if that makes any sense). I prefer products that promote volume and curl enhancement, this product did the exact opposite for me. SO if you have straight hair, this is probably a really good product for you, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.</li>
