      <li>this shampoo and conditioner is amazing.</li>
      <li>and I would like to just buy the shampoo on its own instead of having to spring for another set and get another bottle of the conditioner when I don&#x27;t need it</li>
      <li>BECAUSE IT IS A NICE SET</li>
      <li>My head no longer itches and my hair combs and lays nicely.</li>

      <li>I have natural hair that I wear in locks, and this Emu oil shampoo and leave in conditioner works real good for me.  </li>

      <li>The shampoo was slightly better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about when their products will arrive at my door step.</li>
      <li>So, I would have to say I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>the shampoo smells great, the conditioner not so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with these products</li>
      <li>but most of all the conditioner is much better.  </li>
      <li>Still using to see if it gets better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT,</li>
      <li>The more you use it, the better your hair becomes.</li>
      <li>Love this product, but have to use it sparingly.  </li>
      <li>I love how my hair feels and my hair is much more like it used to be when I was in  my 20s.  </li>
      <li>and I believe it aids in healing many scalp conditions...</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i have tried many shampoos.</li>
      <li>wish I had ordered more</li>
      <li>I think it works well if you&#x27;re consistent with it, it makes my hair feel really good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But as far as doing a great job, this product gets an A+ from me.</li>
      <li>While my hair still is tangled after using the shampoo, it does feel soft, which is great.  </li>
      <li>; definetly make your hair feel smooth and silky;body feel smooth and silky;deworth ordering some more</li>
      <li>My hair is damaged and tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>the record I have fairly fine hair</li>
      <li>I love their shampoo &amp; conditioner as well as their 2-pack golden emu oil.</li>
      <li>Says that he can go much longer without having to get his hair cut because the conditioner keeps it nice and in place.  </li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>I have used almost every shampoo and conditioner out there, and none leaves your hair feeling clean without the weight.</li>
      <li>My hair was clean without the stripped feeling.  </li>
      <li>the shampoo is too watery does not seem like your hair is clean</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I had to mix both products together to get the desired results of moisturizer clean hair.</li>
      <li>gets your hair clean</li>
      <li>After trying many different shampoos to try and contol my itchy scalp and hair loss problem (no dandruff, just scalp itch) I can honestly say this combo does the job.</li>
      <li>Well Right...~!~</li>
      <li>This is my 2nd order for this product because I know that the ingredients in it are good for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many different products and haven&#x27;t found anything that helps until now.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo was quite watery as it took a couple of washes before it gave adequate and reassuring suds.</li>
      <li>Spray on am very pleased with but should be in same size ounces as shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I am an old guy (66) with gray hair and plenty on top of my head.</li>
      <li>A different kind of product than am accustomed to.  </li>
      <li>Emu Oil shampoo and leave in conditioner would suit those who naturally have shiny and healthy hair.</li>
      <li>So, this brand seemed worth trying.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see all of the great reviews, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the product at all.</li>
      <li>The leave-in conditioner felt better taming my fine, dry and lacklustre hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast!</li>
      <li>I also use emu oil - all three together work very well!</li>
      <li>Fast!</li>
      <li>Koru Naturals is fast with their order fulfillment!</li>
      <li>Will definitely repurchase for five or six more months to see if it assists in desired regrowth.  </li>
      <li>Fast!</li>
      <li>so its kind of  a drag that they don&#x27;t sell the shampoo by itself ...</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair much softer and I can run a comb right through it without a bunch of tangles.</li>
      <li>If you are trying to stretch your relaxer and ensure strong healthy hair with extremely low hair breakage in the process of the roller setting and detangling of the hair than I would recommend you purchase this product (currently on my 10th week without relaxer).</li>
      <li>/&gt;And there are no instructions, so how much conditioner am I supposed to use exactly?</li>
      <li>I only use the conditioner on the top part of my hair and a &#x27;real&#x27; leave in conditioner for the roots since it doesn&#x27;t really help detangle.</li>
      <li>Instead of dry hair that sticks in every direction, after washing with this and using the conditioner, my hair stays soft and after drying it lays nicely.</li>
      <li>The leave in conditioner has so much alcohol in it, that you can easily smell it when you open the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>I just have to experiment on how much to use.  </li>
      <li>this one really helped my itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>If you use too much of the product, can leave a build up on the hair.  </li>
      <li>I read in another review that the shampoo and conditioner was very drying.</li>
      <li>so much hair after the birth of child</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I like it because the smell is wonderful and the oils are beneficial, plus my dandruff is gone and there is no oily residue left behind from the conditioner either I would recommend this.</li>
      <li>the shampoo gives my hair a deep cleaning while the leave- in conditioner leaves it soft and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing for my 3a - 3b natural hair.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo cleans my natural hair very well</li>
      <li>/&gt;He has no complaint , and stated he could see his hair looks fuller in areas...</li>
      <li>this is my last chance of getting back to full volume hair~</li>
      <li>It actually did nothing positive for me.  </li>
      <li>Emu oil seems to be absorbed fast into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky mess like most</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>have colored, natural curly hair and have tried alot of products and for me, this works.</li>
      <li>I buy this for my boyfriend who is into any and every thing natural.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast! Fast! Fast! Koru Naturals is fast with their order fulfillment! This goes great with their excellent products. I love their shampoo &amp; conditioner as well as their 2-pack golden emu oil. It works wonders for dealing with my psoriasis symptoms. I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about when their products will arrive at my door step.</li>
    <li> The Leave-in Conditioner method is great and more convenient.</li>
    <li> My hair was dry and brittle and didn&#x27;t have the softness I wanted. After using these products, my hair feels soft and moisturized. I am now wearing my hair in its natural state, which is  bushy curly, (if you understand my description), there is no frizz, just body, waves and curl.</li>
    <li> I really like it it makes my hair healthy and moisturized though the small not good but its not that bad i mean you can bear it atleast i can. definitely m going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Awesome period from naturalists. Leave hair soft and clean without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Ok. The shampoo cleans my natural hair very well</li>
    <li> well,  I read the reviews on this board and all the quality reviews on emu oil and I thought this product was going to help my hair.  It actually did nothing positive for me.  The leave in conditioner has so much alcohol in it, that you can easily smell it when you open the bottle.  My warning is not to buy this at all if you have naturally dry hair. This is not a moisturizer (You would expect that with the EMU oil label)  Made my hair brittle and weak.  I am throwing away the two bottles with about 3/4 left of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I think it works well if you&#x27;re consistent with it, it makes my hair feel really good. And I definitely noticed a lot less breakage and falling out . Hope this helps</li>
    <li> The wife and I both use this. I have always had trouble with a dry scalp. Almost all shampoos and conditioners leave my head itchy and my hair dry. But then I tried this stuff and it is amazing. Look at the list of ingredients and you won&#x27;t see the kinds of crappy ingredients the other brands have, like paraben. There is an EMU farm a few miles from our house and I have taken a tour of the farm and tried some EMU oil products and have become a fan of Emu oil. Emu oil seems to be absorbed fast into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky mess like most oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the local Emu farm sells a shampoo and it has some ingredients I do not like - like paraben - So, this brand seemed worth trying. The bottle of conditioner says you can leave the conditioner in your hair, but I prefer washing it out so that is the way I do it. The results are amazing to me. Instead of dry hair that sticks in every direction, after washing with this and using the conditioner, my hair stays soft and after drying it lays nicely. I am an old guy (66) with gray hair and plenty on top of my head. My head no longer itches and my hair combs and lays nicely. So, I would have to say I love this stuff. My only complaint is that I wish I could buy the items separately instead of in a set. I always run out of shampoo way before the conditioner is gone and I would like to just buy the shampoo on its own instead of having to spring for another set and get another bottle of the conditioner when I don&#x27;t need it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far as doing a great job, this product gets an A+ from me.</li>
    <li> I have 4a hair and this did nothing for it at all. Nor does it smell pleasant. Waist of money.</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner is amazing. i&#x27;ve been using it now for about 8 months.  the shampoo gives my hair a deep cleaning while the leave- in conditioner leaves it soft and easy to manage.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is growing!  I suggested to my children that they stop using their current shampoos and switch over to using this emu oil and leave-in conditioner.  Yes, i would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have very dry wavy/curly hair and I was looking for something moisturizing that would not completely dry my hair out. This product is working well for me. I like the leave in conditioner. Keeps my hair much softer and I can run a comb right through it without a bunch of tangles. Shampoo is not super lathery so I feel I need to use a little extra to get full coverage. All things considered though it has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> this feel so good;i wish I had ordered more; definetly make your hair feel smooth and silky;body feel smooth and silky;deworth ordering some more</li>
    <li> Love it. makes my hair so manageable and no frizzies.  have colored, natural curly hair and have tried alot of products and for me, this works.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my boyfriend who is into any and every thing natural.  He loves it.  Says that he can go much longer without having to get his hair cut because the conditioner keeps it nice and in place.  He doesn&#x27;t have to use any products after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and used it a couple of times. The conditioner leaves your hair weighted down. It&#x27;s like a combination of baby oil and moisturizing cream. I used a dime size amount as well. The shampoo was slightly better but once again leaves an oily resin in your hair. Not sure who these other reviewers are but as far as I am concerned I just waisted nearly $20 dollars.</li>
    <li> BECAUSE IT IS A NICE SET AND I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.  I LOVE IT,</li>
    <li> I have natural hair that I wear in locks, and this Emu oil shampoo and leave in conditioner works real good for me.  I mix the shampoo and conditioner together in a separate bottle until it is the consistency that I want it, and then wash my hair twice.  This is my 2nd order for this product because I know that the ingredients in it are good for my hair.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is too watery does not seem like your hair is clean</li>
    <li> A different kind of product than am accustomed to.  Purchased in hopes of hair regrowth, not yet.  Spray on am very pleased with but should be in same size ounces as shampoo.  Will definitely repurchase for five or six more months to see if it assists in desired regrowth.  After reading other reviews, have been applying shampoo to dry hair about 10 or 15 minutes prior to washing in hopes of positive outcome - we will see.</li>
    <li> The leave in and shampoo has the Emu oil in them...it makes my hair extremely manageable and soft. I&#x27;m in love with these products</li>
    <li> Shampoo seems to strip hair now leave it a bit coarse. Conditioner is a leave in setting style type... if you use too much it leaves hair thick n heavy... not soft not silky. Still using to see if it gets better. No real benefit noted thus far.</li>
    <li> The combination of these products is very good. The shampoo makes the hair soft. The leave in conditioner is an excellent detangler for roller setting hair. If you are trying to stretch your relaxer and ensure strong healthy hair with extremely low hair breakage in the process of the roller setting and detangling of the hair than I would recommend you purchase this product (currently on my 10th week without relaxer).</li>
    <li> TINGLE HAIR, MAKES IT DRY. Don&#x27;t like this product</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo I&#x27;ve used in many years ... doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all and I believe it aids in healing many scalp conditions... I&#x27;m not a Conditioner user plus it has some ingredients that do irritate my scalp ... so its kind of  a drag that they don&#x27;t sell the shampoo by itself ...</li>
    <li> Second time I ordered the product.  Shampoo lathers well but most of all the conditioner is much better.  Keeps hair soft and styles well if you have curls.  If you use too much of the product, can leave a build up on the hair.  Caution yourself no more than a quarter size for shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> it made my hair hard didn&#x27;t like that</li>
    <li> My hair is damaged and tangles easily.  I have tried many, many different products and haven&#x27;t found anything that helps until now.  While my hair still is tangled after using the shampoo, it does feel soft, which is great.  The leave in conditioner helps my comb glide through the tangles with ease. I highly recommend it and will likely purchase another set.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but have to use it sparingly.  I love how my hair feels and my hair is much more like it used to be when I was in  my 20s.  Great product</li>
    <li> i have tried many shampoos. this one really helped my itchy scalp. order came a day early.. so far so good</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the shampoo and conditioner.  There are no instructions label or mention of hair type or texture this product best suits. The shampoo was quite watery as it took a couple of washes before it gave adequate and reassuring suds. The leave-in conditioner felt better taming my fine, dry and lacklustre hair.  Emu Oil shampoo and leave in conditioner would suit those who naturally have shiny and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I read in another review that the shampoo and conditioner was very drying. A little goes a long way. I mixed a little of the shampoo with the conditioner and washed my hair. My hair was clean without the stripped feeling.  I will buy this product again. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I had to mix both products together to get the desired results of moisturizer clean hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so soft. and helps with that dryness.not a great deal but it helps. I&#x27;m still using it but I use it like it&#x27;s gold and don&#x27;t want to waste because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! The more you use it, the better your hair becomes.</li>
    <li> gets your hair clean but I do not know if it has helped my dry hair as of yet. only used it twice so far.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I can read alots of Good feed backs. so I can not wait to see the result...&lt;br /&gt;Lost so much hair after the birth of child so....this is my last chance of getting back to full volume hair~</li>
    <li> I have used almost every shampoo and conditioner out there, and none leaves your hair feeling clean without the weight.Emu shampoo is like using the mildest soap without leaving residue.  Great price for such a good product.  Also hard to find.</li>
    <li> I just got this, so i will update for results later. the shampoo smells great, the conditioner not so much. I only use the conditioner on the top part of my hair and a &#x27;real&#x27; leave in conditioner for the roots since it doesn&#x27;t really help detangle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has Nodular Prurigo in his scalp. Its the only shampoo and conditioner that has taken away the itch. He is extremely happy.</li>
    <li> Helps with my itchy scalp!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this Emu Oil shampoo/conditioner product. After trying many different shampoos to try and contol my itchy scalp and hair loss problem (no dandruff, just scalp itch) I can honestly say this combo does the job. A small amount of this gentle shampoo does indeed produce a generous lather. Since I have thining fine hair, I am not normally a fan of leave-in conditioners as they tend to weigh down my hair, however by using a small amount of this conditioner it seems to add a slight bit thickness. The product arrived promptly and as described, and though I had no need to contact the company, information was enclosed in case of questions and/or problems.&lt;br /&gt;This combo gets a 5 star rating from me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see all of the great reviews, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the product at all. First off the bottles are very small, so not a good buy ounce wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the scent is kind of what you&#x27;d expect from a clinical product not a shampoo or conditioner and the shampoo does not suds or lather up at all unless you use a LOT of product. Do not expect a spa-like experience at all. Definitely not what I&#x27;d call luxurious in feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are no instructions, so how much conditioner am I supposed to use exactly? Am I supposed to rinse it our or leave it in as the name suggests? I&#x27;ve tried doing it both ways. When I rinse it out my hair is dry and it&#x27;s hard to get a comb through it. When I leave it in my hair, then my hair feels flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I have fairly fine hair so it may work differently on frizzy or thick hair. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the Emu Oil for my skin and possibly to use with another oil for hair ,and Koru Naturals sent a comment to try this.  Even though I have my 2 shampoo and conditioner favorites { with my oils to mix with }  I figured I&#x27;ll get this for a  friend of mine to try..This has made his hair fuller looking every time he uses it or even with a different shampoo  { he said the leave in conditioner was stiff , lol.... I laughed told him he still has to comb it..Men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has no complaint , and stated he could see his hair looks fuller in areas...Bloody Well Right...~!~</li>
    <li> I like it because the smell is wonderful and the oils are beneficial, plus my dandruff is gone and there is no oily residue left behind from the conditioner either I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo.  The conditioner is good I just have to experiment on how much to use.  I have only used it twice.</li>
    <li> These two products were great!  Very moisturizing for my 3a - 3b natural hair.  I also use emu oil - all three together work very well!</li>
