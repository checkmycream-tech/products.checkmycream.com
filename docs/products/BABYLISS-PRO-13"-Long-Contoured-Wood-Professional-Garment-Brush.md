<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love everything about this brush. Versatile and multitasking ;) It is bigger than I thought but that&#x27;s great I guess.</li>
    <li> Works great on my felt hats, also works wonderfully on my wool blazers. Great brush, bristles have stayed intact, very well made.</li>
    <li> This brush cleans so much better than my old lint brush.  I use it to clean cat hair off of my clothes and furniture.  I think it is as good as the expensive garment brush that I bought for a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush.  Does the job, looks nice with its wooden handle.  Doesn&#x27;t always get 100% of hairs and things off - especially if the material is very staticy - need to combine it with a lint roller.  But over all it works well for a quick brush down, and I like having it out in my hall way, on the entrance table.</li>
    <li> What do you want out of a garment brush? This is a perfectly competent one and that&#x27;s about all you can ask for. I use this to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; my suits and take dust off ones that haven&#x27;t been worn in a while. This brush just works and the handle is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Too stiff to brush suits.. It is a barber&#x27;s brush to brush off hair.  Do NOT use it on your suit!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased a garment brush before, so it&#x27;s not possible for me to determine whether this works as well as other garment brushes, like the more expensive ones made in England. I especially use it on my black wool coats, and it brushes them pretty well, although it doesn&#x27;t get everything off, so I have to remove some lint by hand. Maybe that&#x27;s the best any garment brush can do. I also noticed a couple of times that tiny fibers were coming out of the coat when I was brushing it - not a lot, but I could see some (and no, it&#x27;s not because they are inexpensive coats). Based on all of the above, I would say the brush works pretty well, but since I have to take extra steps to remove lint from my coats after using the brush, I rate it as &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have a tan dog that sheds and wear a lot of black fleece and wool in the winter. I can&#x27;t stand the tape rollers, having to replace them, get them started, AHHHH! I tried this brush and it worked! I was shocked! Got my boyfriend one, too (from the dog, of course).</li>
    <li> When you use this Babybliss brush, it&#x27;s better to use gentle back and forth motion. The bristles are rather stiff and long. When I initially used it with swift down motion, it seems to roughen up the surface of the suit. It took me by surprise. I got much better results with gentler back and forth motion.</li>
    <li> This item is as listed. It comes in handy at the Barber Shop. It is a little rough on sweaters so better for pants and cotton shirts.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. Long and narrow with a curve and natural bristle. I use it on my wool/cashmere coats when putting them away. Takes lint hair etc. off and fluffs the finish. Also works great on sweaters. Best price by far and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> An essential was all 4 Season wardrobes. Great price and well worth it.  Not to hard on fine fabrics and better than a lint brush.</li>
    <li> Very well made.  Excellent price.  I bought one a few weeks back and liked it so much that I bight another for the car!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for coats and lint/hair removal.  I use it regularly.  I do have to be careful not to be too heavy handed with it on my finer coats to avoid scuffing up my wool.  But it really improves the appearance of clothes, especially coats, between dry cleaning.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have many wool/cashmere coats and they do collect a lot of lint.  This works much better than the sticky rollers and will last a lifetime.  The bristles on the brush are gentle on my coats.</li>
    <li> I had a garment brush that was very harsh on fabrics because the bristles were so stiff. I wanted a replacement that was of better quality, but not extremely expensive.  This brush is exactly what I was looking for.  I placed it in the coat closet for a quick brush up before leaving for the day.  It is great and looks nice too!</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to - just the right stiffness to brush suits without spoiling the material. The handle is a good fit for the hand. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> No more sticky rollers or tape in the refuse bin. This handy and gentle brush is just what my clothes have been asking for over the past few years. Lint, mold (made mistake of placing leather belt in closet), dry mud and pet hair come off easily without fiber damage to the fabric.</li>
    <li> after using this its really no different than a standard brush you get w/ a dustpan if you want to save some bucks. but the wood handle gives it a nice touch and you can hang in your closet</li>
    <li> Comfortable, non-slip natural wood handle.  Firm, but gentle brush that effectively removes hair, lint, etc.  I would purchase another should I misplace it.  I have a feeling that it will last my life time...</li>
    <li> It brushes the stuff off your hat so it don&#x27;t look bad with that.  It brushes the stuff off your hat so it don&#x27;t look bad with that.It brushes the stuff off your hat so it don&#x27;t look bad with that.It brushes the stuff off your hat so it don&#x27;t look bad with that.</li>
    <li> I needed a garment brush to get dirt off of my suits and coats between dry-cleaning, and it does the job. Perfect for dusting off sturdy fabric, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend on fine fabric.</li>
    <li> Works great so far.  Seems to be good quality.  A quick brush of your suit makes it look great.  Glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> it does what it promises to do. I love how easy it is to clean my coats with just a few swipes</li>
    <li> This brush removes any dog hair off my slacks very well.The dogs sometimes jump on my lap or I sit where they have been sitting (they are not supposed to  sit on the furniture bit they do when I am not in sight!). I purchased it primarily for this issue and it  does the job well. I always brush in the same direction.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is easy  and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas.  She is chuffed to bits with it.  It really works well  and didn&#x27;t cost the earth like some clothes brushes I saw.  I would recommend this item to anyone</li>
    <li> brush just works great!</li>
    <li> works well at removing cat hair and lint.  It&#x27;s large enough to be used as a main house Garment brush, but would fit easily in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have two dogs and I am tired of dog hair all over my clothes.  I bought these brush and it does the job. The handle is ergonomic and it really does the job!</li>
    <li> This is the best clothes brush that I&#x27;ve ever used in 45 years.  The excellent craftsmanship makes it easy to handle and use.  It gets the job done perfectly.  It&#x27;s the right balance, size, weight, and the bristles are outstanding quality.  I would strongly recommend this garment brush to anyone desiring to purchase an item of this nature.</li>
    <li> Good product at a nice price.  I use it on wool suits and sport coats.  It does a nice job of removing lint, dust, and pet hair (golden retriever).  Makes the wool nice and sharp again like it is just off the rack.</li>
    <li> I hunted all over the web looking for a reasonable priced clothes brush so I was very&lt;br /&gt;pleased to find one.</li>
    <li> It does the job, no more fuzz on my work shirts, construction is rugged, I feel this brush will be with me for a long time.</li>
    <li> I wear lots of dark clothing. Everything from tees to jeans to sued jackets. We have three doge and two of them shed at a rather amazing rate. You&#x27;d wonder why they aren&#x27;t bald by now. I guess I shed quite a bit too because &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; AM bald. Any way, this BABYLISS 13&amp;#34; clothes brush is great for a quick and thorough brushing off just before I go out to meet the world each day.</li>
    <li> After watching Downton Abbey, decided we needed a clothes brush to look polished and professional.  Nice design. Good quality.  Keeps you looking neat.</li>
    <li> This brush works well.  It handles well in the hand and moves nicely over my wool coats.  (A few more words were required for the review.)</li>
    <li> I BOUGH THIS BRUSH FOR MY CHILDREN WHEN THEY COME AS THEY ARE ALWAYS ASKING FOR ONE TO USE. IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ONE BUT I HAVE NOT HAD THE NEED TO USE IT BUT FULLER IS GOOD ANYHOW.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and ergonomically useful, this brush can clean your clothing easily, especially suits, without being harsh on them. Much neater and easier than a lint roller. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I was a bit surprised about the length but it does an excellent job. Bristles are not too hard and work on all material types. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was looking to burn $80 on a farm-to-table, sustainably produced, organically grown garment brush produced by fair wage workers, hand built in America, but then I remembered I&#x27;m poor and that machines probably put bristles in better than people and GMO wood is awesome and oh, paying more than $10.07 for a glorified lint roller would be pretty dumb. And so, with muted enthusiasm, I purchased the Babyliss 13\\&quot; Long Contoured Wood Professional Garment Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy am I glad I did. This thing is a life changer. Not only is it excellent at removing Fido&#x27;s hair from my clothes but also from pillow cases, comforters, and pretty much anywhere else. I wish every other cleaning item I owned worked this well. Now I don&#x27;t have to wake up with hair in my mouth. I just brush it all off the bed on to the floor and wait for someone else to deal with it.  This is how life should be. Hair Free.</li>
    <li> I love this fabric brush...so much classier than those sticky roller things. It works really great!</li>
    <li> I bought it for doghair on my sofa. It works perfectly. Sure beats the sticky tape. Very good quality and I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Needed a brush to get the surface dirt and dust off my suits before hanging them back up and this gets the job done.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive but worth the price. Does the job of brushing off hair, flakes, or soil. Finely made. Nicely stained grain of wood.</li>
    <li> This is the Best!&lt;br /&gt;shape, great for all things that need brushing!&lt;br /&gt;Very effective in removing , dog hair, lint everything.&lt;br /&gt;Just love it. Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as well as the much cheaper 3M lint brush. The 3M brush is far superior in performance, unfortunately. I am unable to remove lint or animal hair from my clothing with this brush.</li>
    <li> very effective for removing dust, dog hairs, bringing up the nap, removing white marks that sometimes come from closet paint. will pay for itself quickly by saving on dry cleaning fees. high quality. looks as if it will last a lifetime. short back and forth strokes are effective.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this for a long time since i cannot find my old one i have to have one. Saved my coats from looking shabby.</li>
    <li> It works really well at brushing dust off of clothes and it&#x27;s made from good, sturdy wood. Nice brush at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I have two of these and I use them daily.  One is at work and one is at home.  I haven&#x27;t shown up to even one meeting covered in Oreo crumbs since I bought these babies.  I&#x27;m pretty excited.  Who is Baby &#x27;Liss though?</li>
    <li> I use this brush to keep our microfiber suede couch looking nice.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, thank you!</li>
    <li> I started a suit business and give this to my clientele...they really like&lt;br /&gt;them and so do I...a must for anyone who wears fine clothing and&lt;br /&gt;even not so fine clothing....should be used after each wear of&lt;br /&gt;your clothing to get stuff out that you just don&#x27;t see that will ruin&lt;br /&gt;your clothes.</li>
    <li> Works well enough but doesn&#x27;t get all the lint off.  Like others have said, short strokes work.  i was hoping for tighter bristles similar to what you see them using in Downton Abbey.  Works well on suits but not poly/wool jackets.  Better than the tape as it leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> I love the dark upholstered couch in my office, but it shows lint and hair very quickly.  Like to always keep it kept fuzz and hair-free - the idea of my patients sitting on a dirty sofa is just...yech!  However, I shed my long hair like an angora cat, necessitating a quick and effective cleaning routine.  Tried a de-linting sponge, a mitt and tape - this garment brush beat them all to quickly and thoroughly remove the daily micro-debris and, of course, long hair.  I got another one for my husband&#x27;s suit jackets and he loves it.  With a little steaming and brushing, his jackets don&#x27;t have to go to the cleaners for pressing. Nice!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at good price point especially compared to Kent brushes. Would recommend for men wanting to take care of their suits.</li>
    <li> I used the brush on the suit that I wore to an event and found it to be excellent in its workmanship and application.</li>
    <li> This is no handcrafted, heirloom quality garment brush.  However it is a nice looking, high quality wooden brush that  I would bet removes lint and other crap just as well as the $40+ brushes elsewhere.  After about a week of use, I really couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> Every man should have a brush like this. Before going out, it takes a few swipes to get off any fuzz or realign fibers on a suit, and you&#x27;re looking crisp and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just for suits, though. It&#x27;s great for any sport coat, overcoat (especially wool), corduroy pants, jeans, wool pants, polo shirts, etc. Anything with any texture to it can benefit from a few brushes with this; it wakes up the fibers and cleans off anything that isn&#x27;t supposed to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s large, so you can cover a suit in three or four strokes. The bristles are stiff enough to do the job without being so stiff they damage the material. Nice addition to a wardrobe.</li>
    <li> This is ideal for giving your clothes a quick brush off. A very basic necessity for those who have pets at home. Well made and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have 2 small dogs that shed constantly. I got tired of using those tape rollers with minimal results. I love this brush. It does the job and gets the dog hair off of my clothes!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot more than a roller.  It is gentle on the clothes and will take lint and fibers off of your clothes.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, easy to grasp and well-balanced. Just right for the gentleman&#x27;s wardrobe maintenance--brushes everything from hats to socks!</li>
    <li> Nice looking brush and feels like a quality built piece.  Expect to get a lot of use out of it.</li>
