    <li> Great smell and very relaxing. Sometimes a bit strong.</li>
    <li> The title is Eucalyptus Spearmint as is the main display photo - the item delivered was the Lavender vanilla.  What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
    <li> Just received it today and I love the scent of this combination. It really helps you take a step back and appreciate the natural smells, alleviating at least a little stress off your mind. Personally, I&#x27;m putting it at all my vital spots before bed to be able to smell aroma all night - 2 in 1, relaxation &amp; sleep!</li>
    <li> Received fast. It works for my stress. I just put on and the smell is amazing. I asked get compliments on how fresh I smell. Better than perfumes. A must buy.</li>
    <li> I Love it. I got it for Christmas and I didn&#x27;t want to run out so I bought 2 more. For now.</li>
    <li> Thorough product packaging!  Love this lotion!  I have odor sensitivities (perfumes, candles, lotions, alcohol) and this is the only lotion I can tolerate!!!!</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.... rub it on my hands and then onto my pillow.....when I lay my face on my pillow it has a calming aroma</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased several different body washes &amp; lotions for Xmas for the Mrs. Put together a little gift basket type thing. If you price these out at the store they are much more expensive so Amazon pulls through with the great deal as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most guys I know next to nothing about this type of stuff except that it smells nice and makes the girl&#x27;s skin super smooth. I have however learned that the stuff Bath &amp; Body Works makes is top of the line stuff. My wife just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we both win; my wife loves the whole &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; type thing and is happy and I like the way she smells afterwards. In fact a good part of the house smells nice while she&#x27;s showering with the body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys do yourself a favor and pick up the lady in your life some of this skin treatment type stuff. If not this flavor then another. She will be happy and so will you.</li>
    <li> Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy &amp;#34;Stress Relief&amp;#34; has a very nice Eucalyptus Spearmint scent. It is ultra-rich, absorbs in quickly and is not greasy. It gives you a very &amp;#34;FRESH CLEAN FEELING&amp;#34;. and I suppose this is what helps in the stress relief effect. The product says &amp;#34; Clears your mind so you can relax.&amp;#34; and it does.</li>
    <li> this is awesome at night when your are trying to gear down, i do my hands and arms and watch tv. Love it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Very potent so a small amount goes a long way. I only use on my hands at the office for calming when I feel stressed or overwhelmed with work. It seems to help me refocus, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it is very easy to hold. Great for anyone with a disability or just want something easy to use. Very satisfied.</li>
