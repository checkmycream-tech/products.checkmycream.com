      <li>The color is great and application was smooth.</li>
      <li>But this is really nice lip stick</li>
      <li>but it is a good product when you add a light colours primer</li>
      <li>That worked, but if you&#x27;re looking for an easy one step lipstick, look elsewhere!</li>
      <li>I bought the L.A. Colors 342 bright blue lipstick and loved it!</li>
      <li>The product was OK.</li>
      <li>and it came out ok.</li>
      <li>Thank you! :)</li>
      <li>But I love this company.</li>
      <li>On the whole, a great product for both your lips and your wallet.</li>
      <li>and I love that it smells like chocolate</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how smooth the lipstick is and what a lovely color it produces.  </li>
      <li>I felt special!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to put on.</li>
      <li>The product is wonderful and it really DOES moisten your lips, leaving them soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick, It&#x27;s so smooth and true to the color</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lipstick, it&#x27;s very vibrant and rolls on very smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, goes with the color in the picture, and smells like vanilla.</li>
      <li>light like this shade here.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty light, so more than one application is needed.</li>
      <li>I hope L.A. Colors keeps the Bright Blue around for a while.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product two days ago (in bright blue), and already it is in my hands.</li>
      <li>I loved the blue lipstick trend during the summer</li>
      <li>it might be my absolute favorite</li>
      <li>I do have to say that you MUST use a primer and apply this product with a lip brush, otherwise it will not last or look good.</li>
      <li>I just shake my head, wonder why she wants to look like a corpse and then remind myself how glad I am that she isn&#x27;t into sex and drugs.</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to other pricier versions of this color lipstick.  </li>
      <li>its so smooth it smells nice its blue!</li>
      <li>I ordered the Bright Blue and didn&#x27;t think it applied very well.</li>
      <li>Yes, you have to apply a few coats for it to look opaque, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because it looked great.  </li>
      <li>For the price, it was worth the gamble.</li>
      <li>The lipstick goes on w/ full color and is also very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It shipped super fast.</li>
      <li>I only like it because I was able to mix it.</li>
      <li>Granted, I got a funny look or two, but that&#x27;s the point.  </li>
      <li>5 stars to this lovely shade of blue product.</li>
      <li>This is also good for mixing colors, I mixed this blue with red lipstick and my lips were a lovely shade of purple.</li>
      <li>Also, if you have a bright blue eyeliner that you don&#x27;t plan on using on your eyes anymore, use it as a lip liner and the color will last even longer than it already does.  </li>
      <li>and I bought it to mix with some pink I had to make a more purplish hue to it.  </li>
      <li>its not mat color very glossy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Was looking for a cute solid blue color, this lipstick is transparent.</li>
      <li>It is fun with some other bright clothes, like pink jeans or yellow tights.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants to try a blue lipstick (it&#x27;s a pretty turquoise color).</li>
      <li>I would have rated this product two stars, but I did appreciate how fast it got here (3 days early)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a nice shade of blue, not too dark</li>
      <li>it does live up to the moisture part of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I applied concealer down, and applied the lipstick, but it was still too see-through and glossy, so I ended up using some blue eye shadow to deepen the colour and give it a more matte finish.</li>
      <li>however, in this case you clearly get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>My fifteen year old requested this color and plans to use it in cosplay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for an hour or so, so I really haven&#x27;t gotten around to playing with it, but from what I can tell</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
      <li>It has a weird old-woman odor to it, and if you just apply it straight to your lips, it just looks like you&#x27;re catching hypothermia.</li>
      <li>I have to put a couple layers on to  make it more thick and not like a crayon on my lips.</li>
      <li>I bought this lipstick and wore it for the first time the week before Kei$ha was photographed wearing a similar blue lipstick.  </li>

<li> The blue was like a winter frost type color not bright clown blue.</li>
<li> Purchased to change some other lipstick colors, but so lipbalm like that I expect it will change the coverage effect of the other lipsticks.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> I put it on for a comic con costume and it made my lips look diseased.</li>

<li> Needless to say, this seller has the fastest shipping I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
<li> This product is crap.</li>
<li> Horrible color that doesn&#x27;t stay on at all.</li>

    <li> I loved the blue lipstick trend during the summer and I had to be part of it.  I bought this lipstick and wore it for the first time the week before Kei$ha was photographed wearing a similar blue lipstick.  Granted, I got a funny look or two, but that&#x27;s the point.  I absolutely love how smooth the lipstick is and what a lovely color it produces.  Yes, you have to apply a few coats for it to look opaque, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because it looked great.  It is fun with some other bright clothes, like pink jeans or yellow tights.  Also, if you have a bright blue eyeliner that you don&#x27;t plan on using on your eyes anymore, use it as a lip liner and the color will last even longer than it already does.  This is a great alternative to other pricier versions of this color lipstick.  I hope L.A. Colors keeps the Bright Blue around for a while.</li>
    <li> I bought the L.A. Colors 342 bright blue lipstick and loved it! The color is great and application was smooth. The color was a bit brighter than what the picture showed, but all in all I love it! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
    <li> I ordered \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipstick before this and the blue turned a florent pink-doesn&#x27;t work for a snowqueen costume, this lipstick does.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lipstick, it&#x27;s very vibrant and rolls on very smooth. I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants to try a blue lipstick (it&#x27;s a pretty turquoise color).</li>
    <li> I ordered this product two days ago (in bright blue), and already it is in my hands. Needless to say, this seller has the fastest shipping I&#x27;ve ever seen! The product is wonderful and it really DOES moisten your lips, leaving them soft and hydrated. I&#x27;ve only had it for an hour or so, so I really haven&#x27;t gotten around to playing with it, but from what I can tell, this is going to be a great product. I do have to say that you MUST use a primer and apply this product with a lip brush, otherwise it will not last or look good. On the whole, a great product for both your lips and your wallet.</li>
    <li> I like the color it&#x27;s a nice shade of blue, not too dark I like it light like this shade here.</li>
    <li> The product was OK. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but I mixed the color with something else and it came out ok. The product is not durable. I only like it because I was able to mix it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Bright Blue and didn&#x27;t think it applied very well. The coverage was uneven and splotchy. I ended up tossing it. For the price, it was worth the gamble.</li>
    <li> This Product Was Beautiful! The Texture, Color Pigmentation, Skin Tone Allied Is EVERYTHING... I Loved Everything, But The Smell, Lol♡</li>
    <li> I bought this for two of my nieces and the absolutely love it ! The lipstick goes on w/ full color and is also very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> its so smooth it smells nice its blue! it looks so good on me it might be my absolute favorite</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ever wear this by it&#x27;s self. But this is really nice lip stick and I bought it to mix with some pink I had to make a more purplish hue to it.  it does live up to the moisture part of it.</li>
    <li> Which is totally the point of buying blue lip stick! 5 stars to this lovely shade of blue product. huzzah!!</li>
    <li> The lipstick was blue as the description says. Not the false advertising mood lipstick crap. The blue was like a winter frost type color not bright clown blue. I have to put a couple layers on to  make it more thick and not like a crayon on my lips.</li>
    <li> My fifteen year old requested this color and plans to use it in cosplay. I just shake my head, wonder why she wants to look like a corpse and then remind myself how glad I am that she isn&#x27;t into sex and drugs.</li>
    <li> its not mat color very glossy but I like it go it last year and still have it. thank you</li>
    <li> We works great! Loved the product. It actually stayed on my lips and took a while to wear off!</li>
    <li> Not as saturated color as I hoped but it is a moisture lipstick so I can&#x27;t expect it to be totally opaque..</li>
    <li> Not exactly pigmented enough for my likings but it is a good product when you add a light colours primer and it works as a good primer itself and I love that it smells like chocolate</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and moisturizing. It smells and tastes good and it&#x27;s easy to put on. It needs 2 or 3 layers but the colour spreads well without leaving colour differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour is light but beautiful!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick, It&#x27;s so smooth and true to the color and the way it looks on the picture and it&#x27;s so soft it feels like butter on my lips</li>
    <li> Arrived and just as pictured.  Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Purchased to change some other lipstick colors, but so lipbalm like that I expect it will change the coverage effect of the other lipsticks. This does smell great and would be good winter ice queen  shade. I may end up wearing it to bed if nothing else!</li>
    <li> It shows blue, not like I wanted. But I love this company. It shipped super fast. They always leave a personal note thanking you for shopping with them. I felt special! lol I will always order from YONELAY! ❤️</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s smooth, goes with the color in the picture, and smells like vanilla. It&#x27;s pretty light, so more than one application is needed. This is also good for mixing colors, I mixed this blue with red lipstick and my lips were a lovely shade of purple. I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>

    <li> I would have rated this product two stars, but I did appreciate how fast it got here (3 days early) however, in this case you clearly get what you pay for. The product is basically costume make up. It has a weird old-woman odor to it, and if you just apply it straight to your lips, it just looks like you&#x27;re catching hypothermia. I applied concealer down, and applied the lipstick, but it was still too see-through and glossy, so I ended up using some blue eye shadow to deepen the colour and give it a more matte finish. That worked, but if you&#x27;re looking for an easy one step lipstick, look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> This product is crap. It doesn&#x27;t even show up on the lips at all and doesn&#x27;t look anything like how it does in the picture. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like play makeup. Moisture? NOPE. It doesn&#x27;t cover well either, you can see pink lips under it. It&#x27;s really not great.</li>
