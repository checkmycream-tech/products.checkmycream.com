      <li>This is a great starter kit</li>
      <li>Happy with my product.</li>
      <li>This is a great starter kit....</li>
      <li>The lashes were fabulous!</li>
      <li>I now have to go out and buy different flue (i am a student trying to get their certification, and this was the best price for all that you got).</li>
      <li>I really love this kit, I did think I would.</li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with the product!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an easy fix.  </li>
      <li>Cheap quality.</li>
      <li>but I will use it and right another review, but I am very happy with everything else that came in the kit, even the little pads that I place my glue on, It lasts so much longer with it!</li>
      <li>I would most certainly not buy again, just because i have to spend more money to fix what was in the kit.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this little kit!!</li>
      <li>One drop of glue does almost a whole set of extensions!</li>
      <li>I just wish they gave you more undereye gel pads or at least gave you an order for to buy more of the things that are included in your kit.  </li>
      <li>The lashes do not say if they are mink, real hair, or what your working with just the length.  </li>
      <li>And no one use the &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; it will just fling the lash no matter how gently you do it.</li>
      <li>But other hen that I did love what I got when it finally did get to me.</li>
      <li>I paid early in the week</li>
      <li>Glue remover would make it complete.</li>
      <li>The only thing that was worth the money was the actually lashes and tweezers.</li>
      <li>The case&#x27;s hardware came looking rusted, the quality is cheap, the lashes are hard and tacky looking.</li>
      <li>kit is very small and supplies seem cheap....</li>
      <li>This whole case was a complete waste of money !</li>

    <li> I am so happy with this little kit!! The lashes were fabulous! I haven&#x27;t tried the glue yet because I bought a trusted brand but I will use it and right another review, but I am very happy with everything else that came in the kit, even the little pads that I place my glue on, It lasts so much longer with it! One drop of glue does almost a whole set of extensions! This is a great starter kit and I recommend it to anyone doing lash extensions especially if you are just starting out!</li>
    <li> Was very happy with all products that are in this eyelash kit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommand anyone this. Cheap quality. I wouldnt use it on people. To practice yes. When I got it, the case came apart.</li>
    <li> I give this product 0 stars, when I received it, everything inside was pow and all over the box, I just wasted my money here, not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Does not come with training video</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The case&#x27;s hardware came looking rusted, the quality is cheap, the lashes are hard and tacky looking.</li>
    <li> The product appears larger than it actually is, I just wish it was bigger! Overall I am happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Came with no directions, the glue is awful.</li>
    <li> I really love this kit, I did think I would. I only had a problem with delivery. But it get the job done and pays for itself.</li>
    <li> Pretty case,yet small. No faux mink lashes came. No glue rings came. Eyelashes included are hard like plastic. It includes enough for beginners to practice. Quality of lashes too poor to apply to paying client</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANY INSTRUCTIONS</li>
    <li> I just received my kit ! No mink lashes are included . The lashes are hard and plastic, the glue was dried out. This whole case was a complete waste of money ! I feel scammed. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Case is a complete mess. Its broken and looks like coffee or somethi g had been dripped in it. The glue is horrible. It was half seized when i got it and the rest was too goopy to do anything with. The only thing that was worth the money was the actually lashes and tweezers. I now have to go out and buy different flue (i am a student trying to get their certification, and this was the best price for all that you got). And no one use the &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; it will just fling the lash no matter how gently you do it. Go buy a little mini hand held fan. I would most certainly not buy again, just because i have to spend more money to fix what was in the kit.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality products. Glue doesn&#x27;t hold and eye patches don&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I can say bad about this kit was that it took a long time for it to get to me. I paid early in the week so it could be shipped out by or before the end of the week and it took 3 weeks to get to me. But other hen that I did love what I got when it finally did get to me.</li>
    <li> Glue remover would make it complete.</li>
    <li> Happy with my product.</li>
    <li> The color of the box is horrible.</li>
    <li> Not what you think... kit is very small and supplies seem cheap.... going to use it as my practice supplies....</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit.... the glue is not fast drying so if you misplace it&#x27;s an easy fix.  Everything you need is in this kit I just wish they gave you more undereye gel pads or at least gave you an order for to buy more of the things that are included in your kit.  The lashes do not say if they are mink, real hair, or what your working with just the length.  The shortest is 8mm and the longest is 14mm... would like to see 7mm Included as well.</li>
