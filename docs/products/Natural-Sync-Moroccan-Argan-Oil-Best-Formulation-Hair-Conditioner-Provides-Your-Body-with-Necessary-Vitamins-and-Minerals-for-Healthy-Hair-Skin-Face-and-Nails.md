<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this after doing much review on argan oil and its benefits. But I wasn&#x27;t prepared for this smell. It smelled like burnt tires. And after I moisturized my face with the oil, my face started to tingle and not in a pleasant way.</li>
    <li> I received my Moroccan Argan Oil in perfect condition.  I started using it immediately on my hair and body.  I mix in essential oils of my liking and use that as a body lotion.  I never break out.  My skin is smooth.  It helps my dry skin feel and look moist.  It does not banish my dry skin but the oil makes my skin look and feel beautiful</li>
    <li> I use Argon oil for my hair and skin and it has tamed my very fine dry hair considerably.  In the past, I&#x27;ve had the oil with a pump and I found that it would sort of spit out in different directions -so the hydropower gives me better control on the amount needed as well as putting the oil where I want it.  I LOVE  The tips on use of argon oil that the seller sends - they are so helpful.</li>
    <li> I orginally bought this product because it was suggested for dry scalp, but started using it on my face. i was plesantly suprised that it didn;t leave my face oily which most creams do. My face feels baby soft. Thank You</li>
    <li> Although my skin was oily as a teenager, aging seems to have changed my skin to be dry and my hair is suddenly becoming brittle.  YUK!  This is why I ordered the Moroccan Argan Oil.  It is good quality and does not have a strong scent as other oils of this type seem to have. I am very pleased and seeing some improvement with use.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a  quick delivery of my stuff and also the important tips. The advert shows 3 bottles of argan oil. I received 2 argan oil bottles  for $37.94</li>
    <li> I love the oil. It doesn&#x27;t take much to make my skin and hair from dull to healthy. I will always order this. Thanks so much to Amazon and Natural Sync. I never imagined how much better my hair, nails and skin could be.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have used argon oil before but only on my hair and not this brand. I love this brand and the way it feels on my face and neck and it does not leave a greasy feeling..  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil amazing</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I can&#x27;t stop putting it all over myself. The smell isn&#x27;t too appealing but if you put it with something else...its fine.  You can use it alone too, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> This PURE ARGAN OIL works great! Not too oily, it&#x27;s light and give great shine. Makes hair feel and look amazing! My 11 year old loves it!</li>
    <li> Use it after swimming and it really helps keep the hair from drying a tangling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for my hair and skin.  I&#x27;ve used argan oil in the past and was very pleased to have a chance to try out this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  The first thing I always check with any personal care product is the fragrance, as I have sensitive skin and a number of allergy issues.  Very happy to say that this argan oil has no noticeable scent - even less fragrant than some other products I&#x27;ve used in the past that claim to be pure argan oil.  My favorite use for this Natural Sync argan oil is on my hair, which especially in this crazy cold winter weather tends to get crazy with frizz and flyaways.  I just put a few drops of argan oil on my hand and then smooth through my hair, followed by a brush or comb to evenly distribute.  It leave my fair feeling wonderfully soft and really helps prevent winter frizz all throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Buy as a gift was very good.</li>
    <li> I live in the mountains and the air is very dry. I like to use argan oil since it absorbs so well. I use it all over after shower to help retain the moisture. I absorbs well and helps my skin stay hydrated.  I can apply to my face and it doesnt clog pores, my makeup goes over well.  This oil works well for me.  It is a good value. UPDATE: I am still using this oil and find it to be beneficial. It absorbs well, does not cause my face to break out, and makeup applies over well.  It helps my dry hands in the acrid climate of the mountains.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product I will purchase it again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you seller</li>
    <li> I enjoy this oil. I used on my face every day cause after I wash my face it get really dry. My face is oily but in the winter it feels dry and argon oil works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received my order and so far I&#x27;m very well please. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair/my body and even on my grandson arms and legs. It&#x27;s great and  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great experience overall. The oil is a nice addition to my personal care.</li>
    <li> One of the best Argan oils that I have used!!! I use Argan oil every day on my hair and skin. Im so excited that I found this  brand to use!&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous for the skin, hair and face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil can do great wonders on the skin -Argan oil is rich in antioxidants so it has the ability to regress the signs of aging. Its restorative and ant- aging advantages have been the major reason of the increased demand of this product even though it is expensive. When applied to the skin, Argan oil can eliminate wrinkles and other skin degenerations. The presence of unsaturated fatty acids and Squalene on the Argan oil makes it&#x27;s very effective in fighting free radicals that causes skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil can cure many skin disorders -This is a great solution for dry skin. It helps freshen, soften and hydrate dry skin more than any other cosmetic products and creams. Argan oil has also the ability to diminish and eliminate stretch marks, acne scars and skin blemishes. Because of its anti-inflammatory properties, it has an effective treatment for acne, chicken pox and psoriasis. Just apply a generous amount of it on your body and face and you will eventually see how effective it is in improving your look and skin as well as in helping you achieve and healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenerates Damaged Hair Cells With Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure. Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair that&#x27;s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Lovely oil, very clean feeling, almost no scent.</li>
    <li> It is fine.  Good moisturizer but not sure that it lives up to any other suggested claimes.  Will continue to use to moisturize until gone.</li>
    <li> I started using it for a week and my skin feels soft and young! Good investment.</li>
    <li> It does really work and it is wonderful for my hair. I just love it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> when i ordered this product, i was excited to receive it and try it on. but for some reason, it smelled wrong. although it says it has a slight nutty smell, it smelled way too strong (maybe i have a heightened sense of smell) for me and caused a tingling sensation when i put it on my face. but the tingling sensation stopped after a few of days of use. i emailed them and let them know so i was sent a replacement. while i waited for the replacement i continued to use the one i had despite the strong smell, and i noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in my skin. my skin is more clear and brighter.this argan oil is great. i will buy again.  update: the replacement i was sent did not have the same strong smell. maybe it was just the firs bottle i received. nevertheless, the argan oil is great!</li>
    <li> Most impressed with this product! People began complimenting the look of my facial skin w/in 3 days after I began use. I noticed it too! So now I have offered to give few people some trial bottles, I will recommend they purchase from you for price and quality.</li>
    <li> As a guy I actually love this stuff, for my hair AND for my face as a moisturizer after a shower. I&#x27;ve also used it to treat sun burns here sunny Florida and it is amazing how good it works.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Fast shipping and friendly feedback. Everything is great!</li>
    <li> I love this 100% pure and organic argan oil.  I have been using argan oil for a long time so when given the chance to try some by a difference manufacturer and give my opinion I was, of course, excited about it.  I can never have enough argan oil.  I use it for everything...as a leave in conditioner for my hair, a cuticle conditioner, a bath oil, a moisturizer for my skin and as an an anti-aging product because of its powerful anti-oxidant properties and wonderful moisturizing ability.  It makes my skin feel wonderful.  I have oily skin so when I first heard about argan oil I was very hesitant...put OIL on my skin?!?!  But it is a dry oil so my skin drinks it right up and there is no oily residue.  It has even helped with my adult acne.  Argan oil is just one of those things that you should have on hand for all kinds of things.  I highly recommend it to everyone, especially those of you (like me) who like to have the latest and greatest skin care product.  Since this argan oil is 100% pure and organic it is going to be around for a long time.  You will love it and so will your skin!</li>
    <li> Contents was spilled all over box.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how actual product is.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry skin and hair</li>
    <li> I really like it so far.. have tried it on my hair and rubbed into my hands (they get really dry and irritated)  I have diabetes and will try it on my feet, also.  I just want to look up more information about this oil.  But so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I have found Argan oil to be good for my skin, nails and hair. It really is good for all skin types. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and it works well. The company even sent me an email on best ways to use it. I appreciate that. Great product!</li>
    <li> Big size and economical...Love the results as I blend it into my damp hair before blow drying and add a few drops mixed in with my styling cream.</li>
    <li> This has made such a difference in my naturally curly, thus naturally frustrating, hair.  I used the brand name Moroccan Oil for years and liked it, but the scent is strong, so that&#x27;s why I tried something else.  This is actually much better, and thankfully, less expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Softest skin ever!</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous I absolutely love it. Get 4 fluid ounces which is great for the price. It&#x27;s smooth silky and lovely on the skin and hair. I got it since I read it helps hair health, and it makes it ultra shiny. Has a subtle earthy scent, light and absorbs well. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this oil on my face for years and it&#x27;s the best ever!</li>
    <li> Argan Oil has many uses and is great for those of us who enjoy using natural products as moisturizers.  You can use Argan Oil to moisturize your hair after shampooing, as a lip quencher, and even as a facial oil.  This has only one ingredient, no harsh chemicals and no pore clogging Parabens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this time of year I often find my dry skin in need of hydration.  Argan Oil rubs in smoothly and does not leave any greasy residue on your skin.  It works great in lieu of a chap stick, and I find that it lasts longer and relieves chapped lips well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does not have a strong scent like other Argan Oils I have tried in the past.  The eye dropper included with the glass bottle makes for easy application to hair, lips and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received sample for testing.</li>
    <li> Heavy and greasy. I was hoping to use this on my hair as a replacement for the MoroccanOil brand product. I&#x27;ll use it on my skin and stick with MoroccanOil for hair.</li>
    <li> Love the drop applicator. Creates less and makes it easy to use on my scalp. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> dont know if it is argan oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive used argan oil for one year from different brand, and it is nothing like this one.  its so thik and smels nasty, but i tried it any way thinking may be its better then i had so i put it on as i always do before blowdring my hair, and my hair looked and felt like i have not washed it for months!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! maybe there is a special way of preparing it, or maybe its not refined i do not know, i know that im not able to use it for what i got. I thought may be there is somthing special about moroccan argan oil and i was wrong, glad its cheep, but will try to returen it. dont get this product if you getting it for hair. i do not think its the oil you want! I will stick with my previous one.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily hair oil for my hair. It does wonder. Stops frizzing and tames my ongoing growing hair.</li>
    <li> I think this product is good.  I&#x27;ve become a regular user of Argan Oil - it&#x27;s really improved the condition of my hands, nails and feet and I use it daily as a moisturizer. So, I love it. The only draw back is that I think it is a bit too expensive for such a small bottle. Not long time ago I bough one for lower price. Suggestion for the sellers - would be handy if bigger value size bottles were available. Overall a great product. This product was received for the purpose of testing and review.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, and for being 100% pure and organic, it is a great deal.  This stuff is great for skin/hair applications as it is non-comedogenic; personally I like to use it in DIY moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have the weird combo of oily yet dry skin on my face. I was skeptical to add even more oil as a moisturizer but I am glad I took the chance. It really does absorb quickly, leaving my skin hydrated with no additional oil! The company was also kind enough to send out an email with lots of different uses and I can&#x27;t wait to try out the lip scrub.</li>
    <li> Received my order just two days after ordering and started using it immediately. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for the winter when my hands get cracked.</li>
    <li> I like it so much that I immediately ordered a second bottle while it was on sale.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  My hair is always do dry and frizzy.  Well I should say was so dry and frizzy.  Not anymore! After just one use my hair started to feel my silky and I started to be able to manage it better. I can not wait to see what future uses will do!</li>
    <li> I have used Argan Oil for one year that I got from Morocco from the actual place where the women sit and grind the Argan nuts to form oil. it is a local brand and the most purest form of argan oil you can get. It is amazing what it does to your skin and hair. I finally finished that stock and since I had no intentions of going to Morocco I was desperately looking for a way to get this online. since this brand claims to be 100% pure argan oil. I ordered it and was very excited to receive it. But when I used it on my hair and skin I instantly figured this is not Argan oil. This is Olive oil. It smells and feels like olive oil. Absolutely not Argan oil, it left my hair greasy - as expected of olive oil, and it did not absorb on my skin like argan absorbs. it leaves a greasy layer on the hands just like olive oil. Very dissapointed!</li>
    <li> so far, it is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about argan oil for all over hair and body use, but this one caught my attention. It softens the skin and makes hair smell great. I&#x27;ve only used it on my scalp once, but I&#x27;ve put it on my face and entire body and it leaves a nice soft feeling. Will definitely buy again. Thanks for fast, secure shipping.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful Product for dry and damaged hair, and skin, Smooths out Wrinkles and lines on your face, Has a light fresh scent. Love how its 100% natural, the weather here is cold and the lips great Dried and chapped this is the 1st time trying something like this, and this year My lips are dry and chapped free love that, I also put some of this amazing product on my Nail beds, Seems my nails are looking much healthier , and less brittle Amazing  LOVE That</li>
    <li> First, I would like to mention that seller is very informative about the product giving you tips on how you can use argan oil. I have tried this on my dry and scaly scalp, putting argan oil to my scalp overnight and I am impressed with the result after 3 times of application. Now, I just apply argan oil wherever I spot some dry areas on my body even to my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this as a facial moisturizer!!! It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it leaves my skin soft and supple.  It even looks younger since I&#x27;ve been using it and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily at all.  I have combination skin with eczema in the winter and so far I have been using this for 2 weeks and no issues.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> First time using Moroccan Argan Oil and I Love, love, love this product. This does what it claim and then some. Love how it&#x27;s nourishing and hydrating. It feels so good on the skin and works amazing in my hair! Keeps my hair from getting all frizzy and gives it a beautiful super long lasting shine. This is a great product which I will be using for the remaining of my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I highly recommend this. I based this review with my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Finally! This product has made me ecstatic. I have fine, wavy, and dry hair and this has saved the day. Once I received this, I could not wait to try it. I massaged it through my hair before I went to bed, showered in the morning, and just wow. My hair was the softest it has ever been, no frizz, no splits. Just sleek, smooth, soft and shiny hair. Styling has also never been easier and effective. The finished results had me in front of the mirror for days just admiring what I have missed out on. I have not used this for its other properties, but I love what it can do for the hair. I will for sure get more once this bottle is finished and will recommend to others!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it daily on her hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I happened to order it while we were on vacation in Hawaii and it arrived at home before I did.</li>
    <li> Incredible Oil..  I&#x27;m just another returning, happy, satisfied customer.  I&#x27;m not sure how we go through so much Argan Oil around here, but I guess having 3 females in the house probably has a lot to do with it.. LOL... Very high quality, and a lot more affordable than the other brands out there.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Argan oil is a wonderful beauty product! Not only have I been using it on my skin, but I use it in my hair also. It is quickly absorbed by my dry, scaly looking skin, and leaves it soft, supple, and smooth! I mix a few drops in with my regular facial moisturizer for a little extra moisturizing power. I use it straight out of the bottle on my dry hands, feet, elbows, legs, etc.... anywhere I have dry skin. I read that it can be good for minimizing stretch marks, so I have begun using it on those, as well. I received mine in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am very pleased with this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice, light oil, that has no strong scent. It is quickly absorbed, and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, greasy, or sticky feeling. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, and looking more supple. In my hair, it is also pretty quickly absorbed, and leaves it looking shiny, and feeling really soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil you can use. I have thyroid issues an my skin is very dry all the time. I put this on my face, my hair an mix it in with my lotion an luv luv luv it. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs in quickly. Had a small zit on my face, put a dab of Argon oil before I went to bed, next morning I could hardly see it. It&#x27;s a fantastic oil. Highly recommend it. About the service, very fast, packaged well an they followed up to make sure I was a happy customer. I give them 5 stars...excellent service..</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have never used a product that makes my skin feel so soft and look so moisturized. It does not leave your skin feeling oily at all. I highly recommend you buy this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Nice oil for face . This is the best oil I have found. Great product!</li>
    <li> Best Argan oil! I have very dry skin, hair and nails and I have tried just about everything before trying this oil and they just seemed to sit on my skin and do nothing... but thank goodness  I was able to try this awesome oil for an honest review! Because it is winter and my skin was down and out! Now after only a week of using this oil, my dry skin is no more! The skin is actually recovering and looking much, much healthier! I use this daily on my face, arms, legs and nails! Love it!  It&#x27;s 100% pure which is very important to me. It&#x27;s good to know you can rebuild dry dead thinking skin, hair and nails after they have been damaged!  5 stars from me!</li>
