    <li> This was my first time using Essie nail polish, and it was great. Aside from that this is one of the most beautiful shades of green in nail polish that I&#x27;ve used. It goes on smoothly, and looks absolutely beautiful. I would recommend for one to purchase this nail polish. Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> I love this polish. It&#x27;s very thick so you don&#x27;t have to apply a multiple coats. It seems a little more &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; than in the picture. I believe the picture provided has a gloss top coat on it. Very beautiful shade of green!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty on its own or by shading too.&lt;br /&gt;Essie is a good brand but it tends to separate easily in time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy solution is shake them once in a while.</li>

    <li> I have a couple Essie products but because of the price and addicting shades, try to stay away from it as much as possible. However, when I tried this shade on at Target, I knew I was a goner. It is *perfect*. I can&#x27;t really describe it except it reminds me of summer, mermaids, and is a color not usually found in nail polish. The thickness was also perfect, unlike some other essie products I have.</li>
    <li> The prefect summer green!  Very pigmented just 2 light coats and your set to go. Very nice color. Not to green not to light.</li>
    <li> Great color, arrived on time and as pictured</li>
    <li> Essie products are so good! the polishes are exactly as shown the pictures, and with two coats is perfect! thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this color with Essie Fill the Gap. The color is great with just one coat and lasts for days. Great feedback from friends on the festive spring color.</li>
    <li> The color is a great vibrant color not too loutd but good for all seasons. Received alot of compliments on the color.</li>
    <li> I love this shade for summer.  It is exactly as shown in the picture.  It is a very unique shade!</li>
