    <li> I have tried other face cleaners, but this is still my favorite -- &amp; sometimes difficult to find. I even make them last twice as long, by cutting each cloth in half, as they are a generous size, &amp; I find that using only 1/2 is easily sufficient.</li>
    <li> I have been using the daily facial wash for ever and I love it because it takes off all your makeup really good and leaves your face feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> Use them all the time.  Great for cleansing and exfoliating daily.</li>
    <li> Very convenient cleansing pads.  Just add water and enjoy.  Generate lots of gentle bubbly soap.  I would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I use these hehn I need to clean my face after walking around in the dust and sand over her in Afghanistan. It cleans gently without overdrying my skin.</li>
    <li> Love these facial cleansing disposable sheets.  Simply apply a bit of warm water and wash your face.  They&#x27;re gentle and the soap doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. Even though I have normal skin, I also like the clothes for oily skin because they have a tiny bit of abrasive quality that helps to exfoliate while cleansing.  That&#x27;s a plus.  Simply throw it away after use.  No extra laundry.  Don&#x27;t flush these.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and service</li>
    <li> This is the best face cloth for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Wife has sensitive skin &amp; this product is a great help!  It&#x27;s mild, not harsh &amp; does the job!  Thank You Olay &amp; Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these facial cloths and have had difficulty finding them in the stores for a reasonable price.  Glad to have them!</li>
    <li> These facial cleansers are much better than the pre-moistened cleansers. You only need to use one to clean your face thoroughly, whereas, I find that it takes two pre-moistened towelettes to remove all makeup. Great product!</li>
    <li> I like these better than any facial cloths that I have used. They are great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday to wash my face. They work really well and your face feels nice and clean when you are done. Worth the money.</li>

    <li> These cloths have 2 sides to them. One for gentle cleansing and one for softly exfoliating your skin.  Neither is harsh. There&#x27;s also cleansing lather built into each cloth, all you do is wet the cloth and begin cleansing.  It does a great job.</li>

    <li> You wet the cloth and scrub it in your face or skin. Rinse and wipe. I feel fresh and clean after. I carry these in my travel kit all the time. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to feel human again with these little facial cloths.</li>
    <li> Cleans my face better than a wash cloth. Takes all my makeup off with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, love it.  Even my husband washes his face with the same Olay cloth.</li>
