      <li>After I have seen  a significant improvement in my skin, i suffer from acne rocesea, I bought strong manuka oil and eye cream  which</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Well worth the expense!    </li>
      <li>Most companies sale a mix 10% oil and 90% additives for the higher price then East Cape&#x27;s oil.</li>
      <li>It has a clean, soothing earthly smell to me.</li>
      <li>An amazing all-natural oil that will clear up acne, cuts, rashes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a mix of lavendar and tea tree oil</li>
      <li>The mark is disappearing with amazing speed i am hoping it will fade away completely.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t really prepared for the overwhelming smell.  </li>
      <li>but I like having that nice natural glow.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is 3/4 full still by using 2 to 3 drops at a time.</li>
      <li>I love this, heals skin very well.  </li>
      <li>It has a pretty strong burning sensation..</li>
      <li>It smells pretty strong, but it dissipates in 15 minutes or so.</li>

      <li>and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This stuff it strong and the real deal.</li>
      <li>The first night I was pain-free from \\&quot;sore toe\\&quot;!  </li>
      <li>I never wrote any review in my life, but i really like this manuka oil, I am on my way for getting acne free skin.</li>

      <li>Dries out blemish fast but has a pretty strong odor</li>
      <li>It also works quite well as an antiseptic first aid oil; it keeps minor cuts and scrapes from becoming infected -- and it keeps infections at bay much better than antibiotic ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works very well, but please NOTE that the smell is really strong if you are sensitive to the smell.</li>
    <li> Got an excellent product at a fair price.  I will continue to do busness with this company in the future.  I utilize  essential oils from many different vendors and I appreciate honesty and and fairness when I purchase products.  Thank you natural solutions.</li>
    <li> After years of dealing with athletes foot and yucky toenails and after trying everything on the shelf, a friend recommended this.  After 2 weeks, I see a noticeable difference in the toenails and the patch of athletes foot is gone!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as I&#x27;d like, but seems to work quite nicely on my skin. Some essential oils give me skin irritation but this doesn&#x27;t do that. I hope that it works for a stubborn possibly fungal infection on my stomach. Will update the review once I&#x27;ve  got more experience with the product .</li>
    <li> just started will update</li>
    <li> This product is extra virgin, pure and fresh. I have done a lot of research before I bought this product. Most companies sale a mix 10% oil and 90% additives for the higher price then East Cape&#x27;s oil. Great product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter was plagued by constant acne. The Manuka Oil (twice daily) has cleared her up entirely. You say, is it the oil or coincidence? It&#x27;s definitely this product, because as soon as she quits using it the acne begins to reappear. Why does she quit using it then? Well, she&#x27;s stubborn, and...    I would love to give this a 5. It&#x27;s definitely a 5 for efficacy. However, it smells horrid. The smell should not be obvious to others, but it can be a chore to put this on your face. For those with consistent acne and breakouts, the smell is worth the confidence of radiant skin.</li>
    <li> I first heard about manuka oil on the Dr. Oz show.  I purchased some to try it on toenail fungus.  The first night I was pain-free from \\&quot;sore toe\\&quot;!  It seems to have cleared it up and I&#x27;ll keep using it daily on and under the nail until the nail grows out completely.  I&#x27;ll try it now on another body area where I have a spot of eczema.  I hope there&#x27;s an increase in the awareness of this wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> I discovered this remedy for rashes, cuts and insect bites while in New Zealand. It is healing for all the aforementioned sometimes overnite. I have used it for close to a year and have not had any adverse action. Requires only small amounts and the bottle last forever. Well worth the expense!    LMcL</li>
    <li> I love this, heals skin very well.  Ordered additional to ensure the product was available whenever and wherever necessary.  Recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Hi All,    I am a 24 year old girl, i have been suffering from acne , since the time i came to USA, which i assume was due to change in water or food. It has been chronic for 2 years.. i read about manuka oil, while i was browsing for natural remedies for acne.   So, i bought east cape manuka oil, and YES, it worked for me.  Initially i thought i was getting much more acne, due to this oil, but eventually with in a Month, they cleared out.  Like, you can tell the very night u apply manuka oil over night. the next day you can see visible difference in your acne. I never wrote any review in my life, but i really like this manuka oil, I am on my way for getting acne free skin. Its just been a month that I have been using this item. Also, i suggest drink lots of water, which will purify the skin from its toxins, also there is one Ayurvedic Medicinal powder called \\&quot;Triphala Churna\\&quot; which is all herbal.  It can be taken everyday ..in the night mixed with water some 2 spoons of it. It helps clear your stomach, and thus helps get rid of all toxins.   Please use Manuka oil externally on acne...and internally take water and \\&quot;triphala churna\\&quot; everyday. I am very sure you can see loads of improvement in couple of weeks.   I really hope this review/Suggestion helps.</li>
    <li> Great for lightening acne scars.</li>
    <li> The only thing this little miracle doesn&#x27;t do for me is clear up my acne; that&#x27;s because my acne isn&#x27;t normal acne, but is caused by Rosacea, which is worsened by any type of essential oil.  For my acne, [[ASIN:B0011DI9D0 Manuka Oil Cream East Cape 1.8 oz]] works very well.  Except for my super-sensitive face, this oil works on almost any other rash on any other part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what else does East Cape Manuka Oil do for me?  It works wonderfully as a natural deodorant/antiperspirant when preceded by [[ASIN:B00028QA72 Deodorant-Rock - 3 oz -]]!  It works well on athlete&#x27;s feet, yeast infection, eczema, heat rash.  It also works quite well as an antiseptic first aid oil; it keeps minor cuts and scrapes from becoming infected -- and it keeps infections at bay much better than antibiotic ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep at least two bottles of this miracle in a bottle at home.  That way, if I misplace one, I&#x27;m not up the proverbial creek without a paddle.</li>
    <li> I love it.  This is a must for the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This little magic bottle works great for my skin issues! Made a difference after a week using it. This is the second bottle that I ordered!</li>
    <li> Manuka oil is an excellent product and this particular one is a quality product. Why? Well, EAST CAPE, New Zealand, manuka oil is the very best quality one can get.</li>
    <li> Nice product! Smell is earthy and woodsy. It smells pretty strong, but it dissipates in 15 minutes or so. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I use Manuka Oil to clean, numb and quickly heal minor wounds as well as a spot treatment for adult acne and fungal infections. The oil is amazingly effective at treating these problems; I had results in less than an hour! For best results, you may want to wash your skin first with [[ASIN:B000V96R1G Manuka Honey Propolis Soap]]. If you find direct application of the oil too strong for some reason, you can try diluting it by placing just a few drops in a little water and/or witch hazel, mixing, and then dabbing it on the area to be treated with a clean cloth. You should still get good results with the diluted version (and your bottle will last longer) but mine were not as dramatic as from direct application. I only tried the diluted version because some sites say using the oil directly is not recommended. However, once I switched to direct application, my results got much better much faster. I can literally say Manuka Oil changed my life for the better. Use it at least once or twice daily to fight acne or 3-4 times a day to help heal wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a strong medicinal odor (but not awful) so don&#x27;t put it on if you are going out soon afterward or expecting company (especially the romantic kind). This is a small price to pay for such a miraculous oil, however. It works fast and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also consider trying [[ASIN:B001R7VT7S East Cape New Zealand Manuka Honey Active UMF 20+]]; you can use it for acne spot treatment as well as honey masks (apply to face after washing and leave on for 30-60 minutes). When eaten, Manuka honey has two other benefits: it boosts your immune system and coats your gastro-intestinal tract (take a tablespoon of it about 20 minutes before meals). This is great if you suffer from IBS or other chronic gut/stomach upset, cramping, bloating, etc. Make sure you get UMF-certified Manuka Honey because others are not pure and will give you only a fraction of the true healing power of UMF honey. I would not get anything less than UMF 15+ because I don&#x27;t think it will be a strong enough concentration. I prefer 20+ or 25+. The higher the UMF rating, the stronger it is.</li>
    <li> This is definately not a product that I would recommend. I was turned onto the manuka honey and the wonders it did for me internally and thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea to try a product like this on my face.  To begin with I do not have acne prone skin but I like having that nice natural glow.  Honey is known to do that.  I have been very disappointed as in the short while I have used it I find that my skin has become much more drier than it use to be.  I find myself looking for a good moisturizer now that will take the dryness away.  If you have acne prone skin and want relief from oily skin maybe this is the one for you, but if you&#x27;re like me with average type skin stay away.</li>
    <li> Manukau oil is amazing</li>
    <li> This stuff it strong and the real deal. It has a horrible smell but if you are looking to buy this then you already know that.</li>
    <li> seemed to stop working after just a few weeks. Has a very strong smell but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> This tiny bottle still has not cleared the acne on my face. I have been using it for six weeks now and still get breakouts. The bottle is 3/4 full still by using 2 to 3 drops at a time. The smell is strong so put it on a while before you plan to be around people. When this bottle run out I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy another bottle. I purchased it based on reviews that it will clear acne. Since it has yet to do this I probably will not because of the price.</li>
    <li> Acne prone, combination skin. Dries out blemish fast but has a pretty strong odor so I don&#x27;t use it during the day unless I&#x27;m staying home.</li>
    <li> This manuka oil is a great product. High quality. Def will buy this brand of oil again. Thank you Natural Solutions.</li>
    <li> Greasy but will definitely clear up your face without harsh chemicals. I use it overnight to avoid the greasy look. It will however work faster and prevent more breakout when used twice a day. It also has a strong herbal scent.Great price on amazon.</li>
    <li> The oil absorbs well and seemed to be working out ok on my skin but the smell is so awful that my husband complained every night that I smelled like some kind of animal.  And it did linger on the skin for a while so I had to smell it too so switched to something else.  If you can get over the smell, it seems like it is good for the complexion.</li>
    <li> I use this Manuka oil to get rid of toe fungus and it worked perfectly and quickly applying it 2 time a day, morning and evening sparingly. Everything thats claimed to work on it does. Rashes, insect bite and skin abrasions and irritations, a miracle product. Just be sure to get the 100% Manuka Oil. A good product to have in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this product and applied it to my problem areas of acne on my face.. It has a pretty strong burning sensation.. Is that normal?</li>
    <li> Healing aroma, helps with respiratory ailments. Can&#x27;t wait to use in other DIY recipes.  Practical and versatile oil for anyone&#x27;s home medicine chest.</li>
    <li> ITS WORKING REALLY GOOD</li>
    <li> smells bad, but seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Great for healing wounds.  Antifungal for toe nails.  I love it.  It was my second purchase from the same vendor.</li>
    <li> I have been using Manuka oil for about 6 months now, I put it on a toe suffering from fungus.  I could not get rid of the fungus with the prescription drugs or any of the topical&#x27;s you find in the store.  I have tried other oils including tea tree tamanu oil.  I was about to give up and have my toenail removed when I read about this oil.  I decided to try it out.  Since trying it out, my toenail has slowly cleared up and now I have about 1/4th of a clear nail at the bottom.  That being said, I did not do it twice a day like it suggests, but only once.  I am sure it would have worked better twice a day.  I will continue to have this in my medicine cabinet until the day I die due to its excellent qualities.</li>
    <li> I use this in a home made rinse that i made, and make it when I am clarifying or doing a monthy or bi-monthly removal of products or debris that is imbedded in my scalp.  It is great as an antifungal rinse to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, speedy delivery, packaged well. I am a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders for skin infections.  It has healed a pimple, an ingrown toenail, a tick bite &amp; toenail fungus (it took a long time but it is completely gone).  I wouldn&#x27;t be without this inexpensive, reliable &amp; handy cure.</li>
    <li> An amazing all-natural oil that will clear up acne, cuts, rashes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a mix of lavendar and tea tree oil (i.e. it is a strong, refreshing smell, in my opinion) and is perfect to put on&lt;br /&gt;right before bed.  It did sting a tiny bit when I put it on a cut, but you can dilute it with a little vegetable oil if you have sensitive skin. Definitely a must have item for anyone looking for a cure-all natural oil!</li>
    <li> When I received the Manuka Oil I was surprised how similar it is  to Melaleuca Oil. I am not sure if the benefits of this oil warrants the price difference between the two comparable oils.     I will keep both oils in my medicine cabinet for future use and evaluation. At this time I believe Manuka Oil is over priced.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this order, fast and as described</li>
    <li> The product itself is wonderful.  The shipping was so far out of line that Amazon should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> No real opinion at this time about the product.. Not sure if tea tree is equally beneficial for the money.</li>
    <li> Very good and pure. It does seem like this oil is what it advertises and I would buy it again.  It is similar to tea tree oil in odor and it does seem strong enough to add to a carrier oil. I bought it for a ringworm problem which I used with other natural remedies or sometimes I just used it straight. I believe it helped.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Use on my face daily</li>
    <li> great price for hard to find item</li>
    <li> Perhaps I am impatient, but this didn&#x27;t do anything but dry my skin out and make me smell bad.  I prefer tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how the product is very capable of all the functions written in the instruction. I have applied it on acnes and other parts of my body but have not experienced anything different. Maybe it is just me. Anyhow, the smell is very strong and it is hard for me to take it. I am not sure if I will repurchase it after this one.</li>
    <li> I knew the Manuka Oil would be stinky but I wasn&#x27;t really prepared for the overwhelming smell.  I do feel that it works on the face for acne with inflammation and minimizing the duration of a cystic pimple.  It&#x27;s not a one stop shop cure all but it helps.  I did put it on a bug bite on my leg and the itching was gone.  Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s made for but it worked!</li>
    <li> I mix  this with Tamanu oil each night and use as a moisturizer. Each morning I definitely see my skin is a little better but my acne isn&#x27;t gone. Slow and steady wins the race? We&#x27;ll see. It certainly hasn&#x27;t made my breakouts worse!</li>
    <li> Purchased several bottles of this product but did not help eliminate Ringworm at all.&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest you seek better method for control of this fungus.</li>
    <li> So did not meet my expectations ...&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells horrible</li>
    <li> Just received my Manuka oil today after super fast shipping.  About the smell, it&#x27;s a bit stronger than Melaleuca&#x27;s tea tree oil.  It&#x27;s kind of weird, but I like the smell.  I would much rather use a product that is all natural and not created in test tubes comprised of chemicals.  I purchased this for occasional bouts of acne so I&#x27;m hopeful that it will help.  Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I mix this with my facial mask.</li>
    <li> This is really effective for acne/oily skin.  But the smell is quite strong.  Wish there was a &amp;#34;less scented&amp;#34; version.</li>
    <li> Company was interested in our feedback, on the product, which was nice, but we found the oil too difficult to use (the bottle and the way it comes out makes no sense to us, and often resulted in either nothing coming out, or a big spill in our hands).  It didn&#x27;t seem to be any different than other oils we had around the house, Company seems nice, but oil was just another oil, to us.</li>
    <li> I use this as aromatherapy in ceramic bowl of water and 1-2 drop is all I need of this very potent Manuka Oil to cleanse the room for days. I place the bowl underneath my bed and to peaceful sleep I go. Repeat weekly &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Put some on at night and could not get to sleep because of the smell which is awful.  But the product is good and works well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hands but not the product&#x27;s fault. I have a very intense case of eczema on my hands but have yet to find a medicine or natural solution to  work.</li>
    <li> This product does not have as strong of a smell as tea tree oil, but it&#x27;s much more powerful. For those with sensitive skin, be warned: please dilute this oil before using it. I found out in the middle of the night how strong this oil can be, with an intense burning sensation, but that&#x27;s how I knew it was working, and sure enough, It cured a fungal rash in a matter of two weeks. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see drastic improvements, maybe that&#x27;s because my acne on my face is so bad, or rather, complicated. I&#x27;m a redhead with dry, super sensitive skin and cystic acne, meh . I heard good things about manuka honey, I even use the +15 uf? On my face overnight sometimes. One thing I can say for sure is, it stinks, somewhere between medicine and B.O. Not good. For the first couple of days, I thought the awful smell was coming from my roommate, poor thing, turned out to be me, but. I&#x27;m giving it a month to be fair, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Manuka oil is a wonder oil. I keep it on hand to treat infections and various skin problems. Koru Naturals produces a pure oil that does a great job at treating a variety of problems.</li>
    <li> This manuka oil works great as a spot treatment for those random blemishes and/or whiteheads. Depending on how big the offending blemish is, they can go away from as little as one day to about 2 or 3 days later by simply dabbing a bit of manuka oil on the blemish with a Q-tip in the morning and then at night before bed. It dries up whiteheads fast, and then they simply just scab up and flake away. The only downside of this product is the extremely strong smell, which isn&#x27;t noticeable aside after a few minutes aside from a few times when I had a bad breakout and needed to use a lot at one time. The oil can also run very easily if you use too much, so less is definitely more when using it. If your face is full of acne and blemishes then this probably won&#x27;t do the trick because you&#x27;d be slathering the oil all over your face, which might actually cause more problems. However, if you just have random pimples or blemishes here and there, this stuff will definitely do the trick. I&#x27;m sure it also works great for other things too; if it can dry up the bacteria in a pimple I&#x27;m sure it can help in the healing process superficial infections and wounds as well.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Very strong smelling. However it dried out my face pretty good. I only use it as a spot treatment and that&#x27;s why I am only giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  heals blemishes and boo boos incredibly fast</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  My daughter gets fungal infections in the heat of a Texas summer.  It did nothing to it.  I also tried it on a yeast infection of the scalp and it did not work on that either.</li>
    <li> The smell I couldn&#x27;t stand. Wouldnt buy again.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment and the oil smells wonderful, a little like Tea Tree - but not as harsh smelling. Looking forward to using it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Just a touch on my acne spot is all that&#x27;s needed. It&#x27;s better than tea tree oil. A number of people have complained about the smell. It has a clean, soothing earthly smell to me. The more you use what Mother Nature gives us, the more you are turned off of the synthetic ingredients used in conventional personal care products.</li>
    <li> Ok guys, I just had to share this with other people who are debating if they should buy manuka honey products. I started my purchase first with manuka cream and manuka honey. After I have seen  a significant improvement in my skin, i suffer from acne rocesea, I bought strong manuka oil and eye cream  which I am very happy with. A few days ago I had a nasty spider bite, first day it was swollen as hell and than it started to turn dark and thats when I start to be really worried about it, it appeared to be a brown recluse bite. I start applying oil and honey on the bite and it is almost gone now. It has been about 7 days. I also used some tamanu oil but i have notice as soon as i stop using manuka honey or oil the mark would not fade away as effectively as when i use manuka. The mark is disappearing with amazing speed i am hoping it will fade away completely. Whatever it was that was a nasty bite and manuka honey and oil totally got rid off it. After this experience, I ordered 100% manuka oil. This is definately something you want to keep in your medicine cabinet. It is truly a miracle oil. I buy all my manuka products by east cape, it seems to be the best when it comes to manuka oil stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this on acne, and when the bottle had run out I still wasn&#x27;t sure if it had helped at all. :/</li>
    <li> This is the genuine Manuka oil from New Zealand which is often described as a miracle healing product and cannot be found anywhere else</li>
    <li> I have been ordering from this company for about three years now and they provide a great product. I usually dilute the manuka oil with castor oil and olive oil and apply it to my face at night for an overnight acne treatment and it works very well. I have also used a similar concoction on my mothers skin when she was suffering from what seemed to be a fungal skin issue and this cleared it right up. Smells awful but works very well. I usually put a few drops of lavender essential oil to cover up the smell.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend. Worked on Mom&#x27;s injury</li>
    <li> I liked the properties of this but turned out I&#x27;m severely allergic to it had to toss it :(</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it promotes i recommend this oil as a first aid staple there are so many uses</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my mom. She really liked the oil!</li>
    <li> Our 13 yr. old daughter developed cystic acne on her upper back and shoulder area.  I purchased this product as an alternative to  mainstream medicine acne treatments.  I would estimate she saw about an 80% improvement within 2 weeks of beginning Manuka Oil therapy.  WOW!</li>
    <li> I had never use this product before it was the best oil for pain just by rubbing it on and I will buy this again&lt;br /&gt;very soon best money spend I love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil to put in mrsa wounds, they come to a head faster, drain faster and close faster applying one or two drops of this oil directly (be careful not to contaminate all the oil jar) on the infected area.  Then cover with gauze or band aid. Twice a day.  Very pleased with the results, you still have to take lots of garlic internally such as allicin pills, allisure 23 c are my favorites, expensive but much less than ending at the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;God bless all people dealing with this infection of today&#x27;s world we are living in.</li>
    <li> We use this for mosquito bites rashes etc. As soon as we are bitten by a mosquito, we put this oil on the bite and  most of the time we do not have to add a cream.  We might have to add more a few hours later or sometimes we add this oil and the regular 1 percent anti-itch cream that you get from the drug store. We keep this oil on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is something that you get used to as some family members do not like it while others do so it depends on the person.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this on a rash that I&#x27;ve been told is psoriasis (another guess by a doctor). I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it&#x27;s helping, but this stuff was packaged so well that a truck could have run over the package and the bottle would have survived intact. Well, maybe not a truck, but it WAS packaged well and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The smell is atrocious, but this oil is amazing.  It is a non-greasy astringent that works fast on acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Have toe nail fungus???  This stuff is great!!! Takes patience and vigilance in its twice a day application but after about 2 weeks all of a sudden it&#x27;s going away. And if you happen to have athlete feet it&#x27;s gone. Drys it up. Smell you&#x27;ll get use to.</li>
    <li> This works so well on cuts, athlete&#x27;s foot, rashes, etc.  We call it a miracle in a bottle.  Great service from the shipper...family run business...nice to support them.</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing about it&#x27;s magical healing and anti acneic properties.  I have been using it on my face for a few months now, morning and night, and I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  The smell is unpleasant.  Not dissimilar to tea tree oil, maybe a little less extreme, but it doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as the tea tree does.  My son leaned in for a kiss and said &amp;#34;What is that awful smell????&amp;#34;.  I said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s my facial oil, don&#x27;t I look beautiful and radiant?&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not seeing any results that are inspiring me to buy another bottle when the second runs out.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to the tea tree as it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive...</li>
    <li> On it&#x27;s own, this products odor is not at all pleasant.  Moreover, it&#x27;s most unpleasant, even putrid, but which can be subsided to a less noticeable point if blended with other products, particularly scented essential oils.  It does seem to have some medicinal qualities.  But considering costs vs amount of product received, personally, I can&#x27;t justify purchasing this product again.</li>
