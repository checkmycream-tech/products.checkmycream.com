      <li>The best for a customer that wants a solution to dirty hands during travel.  </li>
      <li>if you toss a few in the freezer to have a nice cool-off towel</li>
      <li>We ordered these towels for a wedding where barbecue was being served and they were not only very useful</li>
      <li>, I ordered more and tried some of the other scents that are offered.</li>
      <li>throw them in an ice chest, put them in a oven or microwave and an instant warm wet wipe.</li>
      <li>I pack these in my carry on, stuff them in my purse, put them in my car and camper and highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I opened one up to find it is truly fabric.  </li>

    <li> These towel are real cotton towel and they are delicious!</li>
    <li> I pack these in my carry on, stuff them in my purse, put them in my car and camper and highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Nice, compact, convenient. Purchased for gift baskets and I&#x27;m sure they will be great.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  Especially nice if you toss a few in the freezer to have a nice cool-off towel</li>
    <li> I got these to take on a trip.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened one up to find it is truly fabric.  They smell wonderful and just enough moisture.  I will be saving them and washing to use to make kitchen cleaning clothes.  These are not the throw away wipes you usually get.  They take up a little more space but will be very handy.</li>
    <li> My wife was given these while in the hospital and she really liked them. Once she got home I ordered a case of them for her to use to freshen up until she was able to take a shower. I heated them in the microwave oven for a refreshing mini bath for her on a daily basis. I like them because they are actually cloth and can be washed and reused for a variety of things. She also carries them in her purse as a quick hand wash when needed. I would recommend them for their quality, use and they smell very nice to boot. Nice product.</li>
    <li> awesome will order again</li>
    <li> What a lovely product! Using a &#x27;real&#x27; towel is so much better than a paper towelette. Best part is it can be reused! These may excellent wash cloths or for quick clean ups, etc. I&#x27;ll purchase more.</li>
    <li> I use these in my clinic for my patients to use to freshen up. I am often asked where I got them as they are so cool and refreshing. The fact that they are fabric and can be washed and reused for other purposes is also Eco-friendly. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and the terry cloth and will definitely order again! A++++  Mmmmmmm!  Lavender is delicious:))  Our grandchildren are more willing to use these towels because they love the smell:))</li>
    <li> Awesome.  The best scent for the smell of clean(maybe a little girly but not to strong).  The best for a customer that wants a solution to dirty hands during travel.

    <li> Great product. Good price.</li>
    <li> I had gotten one of these at a dr office.........and loved it...was happy to find on amazon prime...  I plan to keep some for myself and give the others as gifts....</li>
    <li> Love these!! Perfect for Arizona summer golf. Took one out on a plane to wipe my hands and everyone wanted one.</li>
    <li> Love these handy little cloths and the scent is wonderful. Reusable and great for a refreshing cleanup, makeup, travel, etc.</li>
    <li> This product meets its purpose. Our clients are thrilled to have a hot moist lavender towel at the end of the dental procedure. It adds to our bottom line.</li>
    <li> Holy Cow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome!  Very aromatic! The wipe itself is an actual fabric cloth!  The size of it is better than the Herbal Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had other essential oils.....  Tea Tree?  Just a hope!</li>
    <li> If you are traveling and your hands are dirty good luck getting this open!</li>
    <li> These are best moist and sturdy towel for freshening up on the fly. I  really like the lavender scent. I have shared them with family members to try and they liked them too.

    <li> Omg. These are wonderful.  The best quality too. Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great soothing fragrance on a woven, cotton towlette for purse, car or office.  Don&#x27;t throw it away!  Each cloth is now an important part of our daily cleaning cloths</li>
    <li> We ordered these towels for a wedding where barbecue was being served and they were not only very useful but many people asked where I got them since they smelled nice and did the trick with sticky sauce!  I would order these again with no hesitation.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great towelettes! Quick ship!</li>
    <li> These are terrycloth washcloth-type wipes, not of paper. That are very moist, smell like lavender and clean off things like sticky candy or chocolate off of a face or hands. 50 of them for about 12 dollars. I keep a handful of them in my purse. You never can predict when something messy can happen. It&#x27;s always good to have a handy wipe with you too!</li>
