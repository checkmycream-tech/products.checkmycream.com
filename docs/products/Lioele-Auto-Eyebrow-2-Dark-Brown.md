      <li>I was really happy with thish eyebrow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This one was amazing!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>This is a great pencil, and the angled tip makes application really easy.</li>
      <li>I really liked this pencil , I had been using eyeshadow brow kits and this pencil</li>
      <li>It was worth the wait!!!</li>
      <li>Only good thing about this product is the eyebrow brush on the end is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>What sold me the most about this brow pencil is the color.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how to describe it.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s angled</li>
      <li>I have tried many, including powders, and this one takes the cake.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this pencil.</li>
      <li>The pencil itself is very easy to use because of the shape of the tip that&#x27;s great for creating a natural look.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smear and looks natural and beautiful.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best I ever had arrived promptly and does a great job at looking gorgeous natural and long lasting</li>
      <li>Perfect color for those with dark brown/black hair.</li>
      <li>The dark brown color isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair and this shade was perfect for me!</li>
      <li>I gave it to my mother who likes to dye her hair black and it matches perfectly.</li>
      <li>Works well and spreads smoothly.</li>
      <li>Too light for my hair color  </li>
      <li>I love the pencil and am going to buy a few more of them to make sure I am never out of stock! :)</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>but the wait is worth it!</li>
      <li>NOT disappointing!</li>
      <li>will definitely order many more!</li>
      <li>but this is even better~&lt;br /&gt;The cut angle on the pencil is good since it makes more natural strokes when you gently brush across the brow.</li>
      <li>This is definitely true to color.  </li>
      <li>Also the angle of the pencil is a great feature, there&#x27;s always a sharp side and a blunt side.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>When it gets low just twist, its so easy :).  </li>
      <li>No red undertones which is nice.</li>
      <li>The angled tip makes application so easy and the result is very natural.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t usually use an eyebrow pencil, I use dolly wink eyebrow cake or a brown eye shadow and wax pencil, all works great</li>
      <li>I love the dual sides it serves, on one side you have your actual brown pencil that&#x27;s already slanted for good results to line your brows and then on the other side you have the brush side for you to blend your brown liner into your brows.</li>
      <li>Pencil too soft -- and not enough...breaks easily</li>
      <li>A first time use for me.</li>
      <li>There is definitely a learning curve due to the shape, but this is by far the best eyebrow tool I have ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also comes with a spoolie on one end, very handy and durable as long as you take care to put the cap back</li>
      <li>Oh, and the hardness is very nice, you use less product that way and never worry about some sort of eyebrow hairs clumping together from too much soft pencil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried plenty of brow products and this by far tops the budget friendly list.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product, and it should last a while even if you use it every day.</li>
      <li>The grey black actually works better for me and looks the most natural, but both are good pencils.  </li>
      <li>The dark brown color is nice.</li>
      <li>Finally I can get my eyebrows right!!</li>
      <li>The formula doesn&#x27;t glide on easily and it totally looks like eyebrow pencil instead of blending in with your eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The spooly brush on the other end is handy and the color of the pencil matches my natural hair color pretty well</li>
      <li>So after being a huge etude eyebrow pencil fan I recently decided to try this</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast</li>
      <li>It blends really well with the NYX taupe brow powder I use.</li>
      <li>No sharpener required and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>, I hope they come out with more shades soon, for people who have a red or blonde shades of hair, they&#x27;ll make more money, especially if I dye my hair.</li>
      <li>The first one was fine except one of the caps was loose</li>
      <li>Specially if your looking for a very natural color and a application that gives it a natural look</li>
      <li>In actuality it&#x27;s a perfect shade of a natural dark brown but a small shade</li>
      <li>The brow pencil is a harder forumula, but the wax in the formula makes it easy to use and blend.</li>
      <li>, your eyebrows will have that soft  look after gently brushing out your brows after the application.  </li>
      <li>I also received a few free samples in my shipment!</li>
      <li>I may order a few more so that I never run out.</li>
      <li>Personally of the two colors, the dark brown is more suitable for me since my hair color is about two shades warmer from black.</li>
      <li>I ordered a #2 and the color is a very natural brown.</li>
      <li>so it helps the drawing brows look very natural.</li>
      <li>Very natural and cute!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very natural.</li>
      <li>I have Asian hair (dark black brown) and this dark brown works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>and I can draw heavy and light lines.</li>
      <li>Well......where has this been all my adult life?</li>
      <li>The tapered tip is so helpful at application since it mimics the natural hair shape (thicker and then thinner)</li>
      <li>I have dark brown hair and black eyebrows and the dark brown pencil is great.</li>
      <li>The spooly on the other end is very helpful too!</li>
      <li>So it took forever to get here because apparently it came from Seoul Korea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll only sharpen my pencils when some of the wood parts start poking my skin or eyes, that&#x27;s how bad it is lol.  </li>
      <li>but nothing some swipes on the back of my hand can&#x27;t fix so other than that I highly recommend this pencil over the others.</li>

<li> It seems to be on the hard wax side (not sure if it&#x27;s wax, but seems that way), so it gave me more flexibility to draw or fill in my brows with out worry about brushing out a harsh line.  </li>
<li> Also, unlike other products, this shade does not run on the red side which is a plus.</li>
<li> Yes took a very long time to receive it</li>

<li> The product is very dry</li>

<li> not what I expected.  </li>
<li> The Grey Black was too ashy and</li>
<li> I like the sharp edge for shaping and the blunt side for filling.  </li>
<li> I like that it has a brush on one side and a pencil on the other -- practical.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this! I got the dark brown color and it matches my natural color well. I love that it&#x27;s angled so it&#x27;s super easy to apply. The other side is also an eyebrow brush! It helps me comb some of my eyebrow hairs to place before drawing. I also received a few free samples in my shipment!</li>
    <li> This is a great pencil, and the angled tip makes application really easy.It blends really well with the NYX taupe brow powder I use.</li>
    <li> So after being a huge etude eyebrow pencil fan I recently decided to try this and I instantly became hooked. I ordered a #2 and the color is a very natural brown. No red undertones which is nice. I want to give this product 5 stars but I think my pencil is a little dried out but nothing some swipes on the back of my hand can&#x27;t fix so other than that I highly recommend this pencil over the others. Specially if your looking for a very natural color and a application that gives it a natural look</li>
    <li> I really liked this pencil , I had been using eyeshadow brow kits and this pencil is really great !</li>
    <li> Need nothing else. A little drying, just remember to screw it down all the way and cap is firmly on.</li>
    <li> very good at filling in your eyebrows. This is the second time I have ordered it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  There is definitely a learning curve due to the shape, but this is by far the best eyebrow tool I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Finally an eyebrow pencil for brunettes without the red in it.  No sharpener required and reasonably priced.  Going back to buy another one to have in reserve.!</li>
    <li> So it took forever to get here because apparently it came from Seoul Korea. Well......where has this been all my adult life? I&#x27;m LOVING it!! Finally I can get my eyebrows right!! It was worth the wait!!! Yeessss!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect color for those with dark brown/black hair. Very natural. Will be purchasing again and came with samples of BB cream!</li>
    <li> Too light for my hair color  not what I expected.  Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I bought this pencil and the grey black one later on.  The grey black actually works better for me and looks the most natural, but both are good pencils.  The grey black one was broken when I got it, but I popped it back into the case and it works fine.  The pencil itself is very easy to use because of the shape of the tip that&#x27;s great for creating a natural look.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this product! I found out about it on youtube where one of the beauty bloggers was raving about this. Yes took a very long time to receive it but the wait is worth it! I have dark brown hair and this shade was perfect for me! The product is very dry so it helps the drawing brows look very natural. The spooly on the other end is very helpful too! I am in love with this pencil. Prior to this I have been using NYX Brow Cake powder. I love the pencil and am going to buy a few more of them to make sure I am never out of stock! :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this eye brow pencil it&#x27;s the best I ever had arrived promptly and does a great job at looking gorgeous natural and long lasting will definitely order many more!</li>
    <li> A first time use for me. I will purchase again. The dark brown color is nice. I like that it has a brush on one side and a pencil on the other -- practical.</li>
    <li> I have tried plenty of brow products and this by far tops the budget friendly list. The brow pencil is a harder forumula, but the wax in the formula makes it easy to use and blend. What sold me the most about this brow pencil is the color. I purchased this product in Dark Brown and Gray Black. Personally of the two colors, the dark brown is more suitable for me since my hair color is about two shades warmer from black. Also, unlike other products, this shade does not run on the red side which is a plus. The Grey Black was too ashy and over emphasized on my warmer dark hair. I gave it to my mother who likes to dye her hair black and it matches perfectly. I would highly recommend the grey black shade to any women with black hair and the dark brown to any Asian women looking for a natural dark brown brow pencil.</li>
    <li> Like the shape of the pencil a lot. Spooley works well to soften the look. Has paraben though so I knock off one star.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I dread when it comes time to sharpen my makeup pencils, but I do.  I&#x27;ll only sharpen my pencils when some of the wood parts start poking my skin or eyes, that&#x27;s how bad it is lol.  But that is not an issue with this eyebrow pencil.  When it gets low just twist, its so easy :).  Also the angle of the pencil is a great feature, there&#x27;s always a sharp side and a blunt side.  I like the sharp edge for shaping and the blunt side for filling.  You can&#x27;t get that with a regular pencil.</li>
    <li> It works great, and for 6 dollars-price I think is excellent.</li>
    <li> Works well and spreads smoothly. Arrived earlier then I expected, which, was a plus! Definitely something that I would invest in again when I run out of the product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eyebrow pencil out there.  I have tried many, including powders, and this one takes the cake.  The angled tip makes application so easy and the result is very natural.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  I have dark brown hair and black eyebrows and the dark brown pencil is great.</li>
    <li> I love this. Didn&#x27;t smear and looks natural and beautiful. Thanks</li>
    <li> This was so good for my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Pencil too soft -- and not enough...breaks easily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different kinds of eyebrow pencils and powders, and this one is one of my favorites. The tapered tip is so helpful at application since it mimics the natural hair shape (thicker and then thinner) and I can draw heavy and light lines. The spooly brush on the other end is handy and the color of the pencil matches my natural hair color pretty well (dark brown). Overall a good product, and it should last a while even if you use it every day.</li>
    <li> It breaks, the colour is unnatural, the angle is actual awkward to use and also makes it difficult to make thin strokes with the pencil... I definitely regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> The dark brown color isn&#x27;t the best. It&#x27;s rather blackish rather than dark brown. The formula doesn&#x27;t glide on easily and it totally looks like eyebrow pencil instead of blending in with your eyebrows. Only good thing about this product is the eyebrow brush on the end is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> ....NOT disappointing! I was really happy with thish eyebrow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually use an eyebrow pencil, I use dolly wink eyebrow cake or a brown eye shadow and wax pencil, all works great but this is even better~&lt;br /&gt;The cut angle on the pencil is good since it makes more natural strokes when you gently brush across the brow. I have naturally dark brown hair, so I obviously chose dark brown. In picture it looks odd with a green/yellow brown hue. In actuality it&#x27;s a perfect shade of a natural dark brown but a small shade lighter(since your eyebrows are supposed to be coloured in a shade lighter than your hair). So its great! Oh, and the hardness is very nice, you use less product that way and never worry about some sort of eyebrow hairs clumping together from too much soft pencil.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a spoolie on one end, very handy and durable as long as you take care to put the cap back on!&lt;br /&gt;In result, your eyebrows will have that soft  look after gently brushing out your brows after the application.  Very natural and cute!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again, I hope they come out with more shades soon, for people who have a red or blonde shades of hair, they&#x27;ll make more money, especially if I dye my hair. ):</li>
    <li> Took forever for this to arrive as I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from over seas but this brow pencil is perfect.  I love the dual sides it serves, on one side you have your actual brown pencil that&#x27;s already slanted for good results to line your brows and then on the other side you have the brush side for you to blend your brown liner into your brows. I may order a few more so that I never run out.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this at first, since most of the brow pencils I&#x27;ve bought in the past tends to...give off too much product (created harsh lines).  This one was amazing!  I&#x27;m not even sure how to describe it.  It seems to be on the hard wax side (not sure if it&#x27;s wax, but seems that way), so it gave me more flexibility to draw or fill in my brows with out worry about brushing out a harsh line.  This is definitely true to color.  I have Asian hair (dark black brown) and this dark brown works perfectly.  Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I order. The first one was fine except one of the caps was loose it kept falling off, and the second one was broken by the time it got to me :(</li>
