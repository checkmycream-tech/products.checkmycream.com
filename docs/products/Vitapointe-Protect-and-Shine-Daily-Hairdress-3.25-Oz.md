      <li>Better distributor</li>
      <li>wish there was more in the bottle.</li>
      <li>That Vitapointe is better product.  </li>
      <li>If you put a dab on your palm without evenly distributing it throughout your hands, and if you start to put a blob on the top of your head, Vitapointe will make your hair look greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many, many years when my brother-in-law was a V.P. with&lt;br</li>

      <li>It us great for ny scalp and give my white hair a lovely shine.</li>
      <li>but this is a completely new formulation and not as good.</li>

      <li>I have used this product for a long time and it is a great &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; conditioner for hair.</li>
      <li>Great product for dry, damaged or colored hair.</li>
      <li>Using Vitapointe makes my hair look more vibrant and</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and then could no longer find it in local stores.  </li>
      <li>It is nice that you can purchase it on Amazon, it is harder to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
      <li>this was the large jars.  </li>
      <li>and I would not recommend this for anyone who wants to not feel this on their hair after it is applied.  </li>
      <li>It is designed, very well I might say, for women whose hair tends to be frizzy.  </li>
      <li>The ends of your hair tend to be older and dryer than the rest of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Recommended by high end stylist.  </li>
      <li>Then you can rub it on your hair, FIRST starting at the ends of the hair.  </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s applied with a little finesse, you will see the desired results, and it is very well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting the old Vitapointe</li>
      <li>This one seems quite heavy and not the light touch it used to have.  </li>
      <li>Vitapointe leaves my naturally curly hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>but I will have to continue looking for a replacement for the old Vitapointe.</li>
      <li>I feel that Vitapointe is worth every penny I spent on it!</li>
      <li>It is better than any other product that you can buy on the market and costs a lot less.</li>
      <li>I have seen some reviews in general about Vitapointe saying that the product is too greasy.  </li>
      <li>Product isn&#x27;t exactly the same as that that comes in the pink and blue squeeze tube from UK/Europe.</li>
      <li>This apparently is the american (?) issue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have seen some reviews in general about Vitapointe saying that the product is too greasy.  My sister also feels it is too greasy.  In fact, yes, it can be too greasy.  I think it can down right make your hair look dirty.  Yet, I give it 5 stars.  Why would I do that?  Because, it is the way we apply the product that determines how it makes our hair look.  Like a lot of products such as hair products or even make up products, technique is imperative.  You have to dab about a dime size, per the instructions, on your palm.  Then rub it on both sides of your hands, palm and backs, like you would a lotion.  Then you can rub it on your hair, FIRST starting at the ends of the hair.  The ends of your hair tend to be older and dryer than the rest of your hair.  If you put a dab on your palm without evenly distributing it throughout your hands, and if you start to put a blob on the top of your head, Vitapointe will make your hair look greasy.  It is designed, very well I might say, for women whose hair tends to be frizzy.  If it&#x27;s applied with a little finesse, you will see the desired results, and it is very well worth it.  I have tried many products. I have tried coconut oil, eggs, mayonnaise, olive oil, baking soda, many over the counter products, but this works the best.  No scent and some nice results.</li>
    <li> Product terrific and current date  this was the large jars.  Better distributor</li>
    <li> Vitapointe leaves my naturally curly hair soft and shiny.  It also controlls frizz and dryness.  I have tried many other products, but keep returning to Vitapointe as it does the best job for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 7 years and loved it. I have spent lots of money triying different brands in hair products but nothing worked. Once I tried this product, never stop using it why? This is the best product ever. The only sad part is that it was removed from local drugstores :(&gt; But wait there is hope....Amazon will find it for me :)Great news!!!I can&#x27;t wait to get it, my hair is thirsty:0</li>

    <li> Best hairdressing  cream.. I recommended it to my barber as well. Used by both men and women!</li>
    <li> Recommended by high end stylist.  A dab&#x27;ll do ya!  (Ok, so it&#x27;s not Brylcreem).  Will last forever.  The only problem I found is, that the cream might separate from the oil...I knead the tube a bit before dispensing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It makes my hair grow healthy, it shines and it is very to easy to manage! I feel that Vitapointe is worth every penny I spent on it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used for years but can no longer get in  a store so I am glad they have them available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many, many years when my brother-in-law was a V.P. with&lt;br /&gt;Clairol.....it was then I started along with their hair color.  My hair is wavy and thick and has a&lt;br /&gt;tendency to be course looking.  Using Vitapointe makes my hair look more vibrant and alive.&lt;br /&gt;The shine on my hair gets me compliments of &amp;#34;what do you do to get that shine?&amp;#34;  The stores&lt;br /&gt;in my area do not carry this product any more so I have to order it online in quanity.  Actually,&lt;br /&gt;it is more convenient this way.  I&#x27;ve tried other brand name products but they either have a&lt;br /&gt;fragrance that&#x27;s overpowering or weighs my hair down and not shiney.  I actually cut the tube&lt;br /&gt;in half and scoop out the inside to the last drop.  That&#x27;s how good it is!</li>
    <li> You cannot find this product in the stores and I swear by it.  It is better than any other product that you can buy on the market and costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> GIFT FOR MY SISTER;  VITAPOINTE ONLY HAIRDRESS  SHE LIKES; HAS BEEN USING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS</li>
    <li> use several times a week - no more dry hair/scalp</li>
    <li> I was expecting the old Vitapointe but this is a completely new formulation and not as good. This one seems quite heavy and not the light touch it used to have.  Sorry, but I will have to continue looking for a replacement for the old Vitapointe.</li>
    <li> I have used this product ever since it was a Clairol hairdressing. It is the only product that makes my over-processed hair shine. Yes, my straw-like hair actually shines. I am becoming more and more worried that this product will no longer be available. All it takes is just a little dab to make my hair look like hair again.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry, damaged or colored hair. Been using for years!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab every morning before showering1!</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my hair really shine !!</li>
