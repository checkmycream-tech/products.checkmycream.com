      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and feminine, and of a very high quality.  </li>
      <li>I liked the first one so much that I bought the second \\&quot;just in case.\\</li>
      <li>It is a pretty design and holds hair well</li>
      <li>When it happened to the first one, I thought one of my kids had accidentally done it.  </li>
      <li>Very feminine indeed!</li>
      <li>I wish they made it in a ton of different colors because I&#x27;d buy all of them! :)</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and packaged pretty well.</li>
      <li>This clip is pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite pretty and seems to be well made.</li>
      <li>This clip holds all or it up, although I always slide a long bobby pin just be be sure.  </li>
      <li>I really like this pretty clip because it can hold a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>(my hair is fine, but not super fine).</li>
      <li>One clip holds all of my hair back in a twist easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough grip to hold a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>it starts to fall out on the open side because the clip does not have a strong clamp.</li>
      <li>I work in an office, so don&#x27;t jump around much.</li>
      <li>The plastic it&#x27;s made from isn&#x27;t flimsy, the quality is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that much hair that it would cause a strain, so</li>
      <li>Lasts forever and really grips your hair without pulling or tangling.</li>
      <li>The clip looks good and works well even with thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>It clasps differently as the teeth fit differently; highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This hair clip is not only pretty, but holds my long, thick hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and most clips are too heavy or too big.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product-</li>
      <li>I have normal hair, but a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>I love this clip especially for long hair.</li>
      <li>I french twisted my hair up and tucked my ends in put this clip in and my hair looked great all even.  </li>
      <li>It works better for me only pulling the top half of my hair in, and leaving the bottom half down.</li>
      <li>This one is just the right size (I have somewhat long thick hair) and is extremely comfortable.</li>
      <li>It is impossible to find this type of jaw clip in my area anymore, so I was so happy to find it here.</li>
      <li>hair is just above the shoulder, straight, thin and fine.</li>
      <li>I have fairly long hair, not thick.</li>
      <li>The plastic is soft enough not to snap.</li>
      <li>I have thick and smooth hair.</li>
      <li>The cute little floral design makes it feel a little fancy.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t do much with this clip other than do a half-up-half-down style.  </li>
      <li>If you like a simple yet delicate design this would fit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It should last a long time with normal use.</li>
      <li>This clip lies flat enough that I barely realize it&#x27;s there.</li>

<li> I am a big fan of the flat bear claw, and it is pretty hard to find them.</li>
<li> thin, fine hair, I wondered if this clip would hold as there are no teeth on the &#x27;jaws&#x27; of it, but I wore it for several hours with no issues like slipping or falling out.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have medium-thick hair past my shoulders &amp; can wear it curly or straight.  </li>

<li> Larger than expected.</li>
<li> I was looking for this since long time.</li>

<li> If your hair is very thick and/or long, say, mid back, this may not work for you.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair very well, and the flowers on it are poorly done and ugly as sin.  </li>
<li> and the other day it broke while it was still in my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One clip holds all of my hair back in a twist easily. They have a matte finish. They look to be medium brown color in the photo, the ones I received were a bit darker brown. So if they had been just a shade lighter to match my medium blonde hair I&#x27;d have given them a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I really like this pretty clip because it can hold a lot of hair. Not all my hair, but a lot of it.</li>
    <li> A very sturdy, attractive, sideways clip. The plastic it&#x27;s made from isn&#x27;t flimsy, the quality is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Having thin, fine hair, I wondered if this clip would hold as there are no teeth on the &#x27;jaws&#x27; of it, but I wore it for several hours with no issues like slipping or falling out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just above the shoulder, straight, thin and fine. If your hair is very thick and/or long, say, mid back, this may not work for you. The teeth/jaws of the clip are shallow; if you twist a lot of hair or hair that is very thick, the bulk of your hair will prevent the clip from closing tightly.&lt;br /&gt;It should last a long time with normal use. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s somewhat flat. This is a godsend when you&#x27;re driving and you rest your head on the headrest! If you&#x27;ve ever tried that with a regular jaw clip, you know what I mean; those can hurt if you lean against them. This clip lies flat enough that I barely realize it&#x27;s there. Makes a nice, simple gift as it has an elegant design.</li>
    <li> Excellent grip and looks lovely.</li>
    <li> i missed the part about it being matte in design. Had it been gloss it would have been prettier but it is as advertised. very pretty, well made, strong,</li>
    <li> Great. I was looking for this since long time.</li>
    <li> I love this clip especially for long hair. I go thru lots of hair clips during a year but this one is really great. It clasps differently as the teeth fit differently; highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use. Has a medium hold ability. Very delicate art work and I use this almost each day. It clips without pulling. I love hair clips for both while drying my hair and for an added charm if I wear it out and clip parts of my hair up or away from my face. This clip is priced great and not fragile. I would buy again. I have fairly long hair, not thick. Arrived on time and packaged pretty well. If you like a simple yet delicate design this would fit. Very feminine indeed!</li>
    <li> Nicely designed hair clip and versatile in how it might be used depending on the hair style.  Longer hair needed, for which I am waiting!</li>
    <li> I love this hairclip. Its very pretty. It clips my thick hair with no problem. I wish I would have ordered more than one.</li>
    <li> I have normal hair, but a lot of it.  I can&#x27;t do much with this clip other than do a half-up-half-down style.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough grip to hold a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite hair clip. I have 10 of them all stashed away so that if they ever go out of stock, I will still have one.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty and subtle hair clip. I am a big fan of the flat bear claw, and it is pretty hard to find them. This one is just the right size (I have somewhat long thick hair) and is extremely comfortable. Not too heavy, but sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is a great clip, the perfect size for me.</li>
    <li> This clip is pretty. I have very thick hair. The clip does not hold all my hair- it starts to fall out on the open side because the clip does not have a strong clamp. I was trying to do an updo with it. It works better for me only pulling the top half of my hair in, and leaving the bottom half down.</li>
    <li> Lovely little hairclip and a great style for those who want a quick pin up of their long hair.  The clip itself is flat so you can lean back in them without getting poked in the head.</li>
    <li> Beautifull clip! I loved this hair clip so much the first time I wore it that I ordered another one the same night!  I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s past my shoulders. This clip holds all or it up, although I always slide a long bobby pin just be be sure.  It&#x27;s very pretty and feminine, and of a very high quality.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The clip looks good and works well even with thick curly hair. It&#x27;s nice to have a decorative clip that doesn&#x27;t damage curly hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would find one here! I have thick and smooth hair. Most hair items slip out within hours. This clip is amazing. I purchased one in Singapore and didn&#x27;t think I could find one again. So happy Amazon has this!</li>
    <li> These are observations after receiving it today. I haven&#x27;t used it  as a hair clip yet. The clip pictured is prettier then the one I received. The flower on mine is on the very edge, cutting off part of it. And the edges of the flower are peeling. I was very disappointed to turn over the packaging and see a big &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; sticker. I&#x27;m hoping it makes up for its&#x27; aesthetic flaws by being a great  clip.</li>
    <li> I have super thick/wavy/shoulder length hair, and this holds my hair beautifully!  I like the matte finish.  The cute little floral design makes it feel a little fancy.  The spring must be really tough, because I use it at least 3x/week and my teenagers love to open/close/open/close a hundred times when it&#x27;s sitting next to the couch!</li>
    <li> I would recommend if to friends. It&#x27;s quite pretty and seems to be well made. I&#x27;ve had it for  a few weeks now and find it is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this clip - it keeps my hair under control and looks nice. Whish it came in black too.</li>
    <li> Clips hair back. Larger than expected. Would double check size before purchasing</li>
    <li> This hair clip is not only pretty, but holds my long, thick hair perfectly. It is impossible to find this type of jaw clip in my area anymore, so I was so happy to find it here. This is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered, just in case they become extinct!</li>
    <li> it feels solid but looks smaller than I expect. it&#x27;s better to buy this kind of things with actual pictures on hair.</li>
    <li> I have bought at least 6 of these. Never want to be without one!  I wear it almost everyday.  Works well on medium to thin hair. I only had one break on me - but it was not product defect.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice clip.  I really liked this one the little flower on it is lovely and perfect for a night out on the town.  This worked well on my very thick hair and also held my Granddaughters thin hair.  I wore it last night.  I french twisted my hair up and tucked my ends in put this clip in and my hair looked great all even.  Don&#x27;t know how to do a french twist just do a search and there are dozens of demo&#x27;s on how to do french twist or braid your hair.  I often braid my hair and them put it in a bun and use a clip like this to lock it all in place.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these claws in the last two years. I liked the first one so much that I bought the second \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot;  It is a pretty design and holds hair well (my hair is fine, but not super fine). Unfortunately, the plastic eventually gives way and the clip breaks along the top \\&quot;fork.\\&quot;  When it happened to the first one, I thought one of my kids had accidentally done it.  I wore my spare off and on for 6 months or so and the other day it broke while it was still in my hair.  I hadn&#x27;t bumped my head or done anything to cause the break. In fact, I still don&#x27;t know when it happened--just reached up and noticed it was broken. I don&#x27;t have that much hair that it would cause a strain, so I don&#x27;t know how it happened.  Seems like Karina could reinforce the plastic with a metal somehow and the clip would be perfect.  I gave it 3 stars for esthetic and functional design. It it were stronger, I would have given it 5 stars. [[ASIN:B00662ZVGO Matte Tort with Flower Bear Claw Clip]]</li>
    <li> Not anything to totally wow over,but all together ok!! It&#x27;s as cute as it looks and has a decent hold!! But for ten dollars? Not to be cheap,but I would have thought if I saw it in person,maybe no more than five? Cute though?!</li>
    <li> I want 10 of these in different colors, or ten of the same. I don&#x27;t care which, they&#x27;re great. I have thick ethnic hair, and it holds well.</li>
    <li> Lovely. Wish it were a little bigger for my needs. That&#x27;s ok I ordered two!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and most clips are too heavy or too big.  This one is just right.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and attractive. Lasts forever and really grips your hair without pulling or tangling. I highly recommend this product- I bought four in case I lose mine. These are also hardy- I&#x27;ve been throwing mine into my bag and they come out fine every time. The plastic is soft enough not to snap.Tempted to buy more!</li>
    <li> I love this. It holds my thick hair all day. I work in an office, so don&#x27;t jump around much. Still, some hair clips fall out after a short time, or at least by the end of the day. This clip holds, and is so comfortable all day, I almost forget to remove it to go to sleep! This is now one of my most favorite hot-weather hair clips.</li>
    <li> This clip is AMAZING! I have medium-thick hair past my shoulders &amp; can wear it curly or straight.  This clip is perfect because it&#x27;s not big or bulky @ all &amp; it fits all of my hair.  I wish they made it in a ton of different colors because I&#x27;d buy all of them! :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my fine hair very well, and the flowers on it are poorly done and ugly as sin.  Goody&#x27;s Updo Claw is much better.</li>
    <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite hair clip now.</li>
