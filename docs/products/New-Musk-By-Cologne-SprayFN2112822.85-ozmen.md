### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I think this is perfect for this age.</li>
      <li>This was just perfect.</li>
      <li>Love it!!!</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>lol  </li>
      <li>Seems like a good all season type to use.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a cologne that you need to spray a ton to smell good.</li>
      <li>I always get compliments from ladies of how good I smell.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very strong, pleasant musk.</li>
      <li>I feel like going into this kind of business</li>
      <li>I always seem to get compliments on the nice smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cologne that my girlfriend of 4 years really liked when we started dating.</li>
      <li>This smells nice, I get people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing quite often...</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>I love this...</li>
      <li>I love it on him.</li>
      <li>and well let me just say I have more girls asking what do you have on it</li>
      <li>this is definitely my favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>You have to use way more than you should.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and no matter when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was more avalible in stores.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much, lasts a good 8+ hours.</li>
      <li>it is that good thanks</li>
      <li>Item is very affordable and has good quality.</li>
      <li>PRICE CHEAP SCENT</li>
      <li>Many different people I&#x27;ve met have liked this and my girlfriend does compliment it to this day</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for something strong, powerful, in your face...this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>If a lot of ladies love it, highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t seem to find a Cologne that is worth a damn anymore.</li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s a success with women too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is probably the largest size you can buy.</li>
      <li>Good scent but very light and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>My son like this cologne very much</li>
      <li>I have used this colonge since it first came out, or since I first heard about it.</li>
      <li>The first time I got it was in a gift set with Bod Spray products.  </li>
      <li>I definitely have ceased to purchase any more cologne trash from Amazon</li>
      <li>I will order more later</li>
      <li>Turns out this is EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I decided to go in search of it again and was lucky enough to find it available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clean, straightforward musk with a vanilla minor note.</li>
      <li>It does give you a positive feel when you wear it</li>
      <li>The scent is strong enough to hold pretty much all day</li>
      <li>Really goo deal for the price.</li>
      <li>With that in mind, New Musk for men fits the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, if you want just enough of a smell for people to enjoy (especially the ladies), then give this one a try.</li>
      <li>This is a fragrance you would smell on a 65+ year old woman.</li>
      <li>My approach to cologne is to use enough where it stays on you, but not so much that you bath in it or</li>
      <li>I completely recommend it.</li>
      <li>I like this for a low priced daily use type cologne, light, not a thick heavy sort of smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and even the expensive ones I buy from other designers don&#x27;t get as many compliments as this one!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is nothing else I can say other than, if you like to smell ok for a few short seconds, then go ahead and purchase this toilet water.</li>
      <li>A bottle lasts me around half a year, not wearing it every day but very often.</li>

<li> All have been nothing but a waste of money and time.</li>
<li> One is Dior Fahrenheit, so absurdly expensive that I only buy it in duty-free shops, and the other is this.</li>
<li> Obviously your mileage may vary, cologne melds with your natural scent and wearing it as a substitute for bathing makes you smell terrible, but for the price there is no other scent on the market</li>

<li> This used to be ridiculously hard to find.</li>

<li> a spray or two of this cologne, it is impossible to overpower anyone, unless they have an extreme sensitivity.</li>
<li> I  don&#x27;t know if it  was bad  or even tampered with.  !  -- ]</li>
<li> WORST SCENT EVER INVENTED!!</li>

    <li> I love this cologne. Item arrived on time. Item is very affordable and has good quality.</li>
    <li> As a Wo,en this smell is hypnotic 😉</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!!!!</li>
    <li> My approach to cologne is to use enough where it stays on you, but not so much that you bath in it or the smell continues to linger long after you&#x27;ve left the room. With that in mind, New Musk for men fits the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a spray or two of this cologne, it is impossible to overpower anyone, unless they have an extreme sensitivity. My wife absolutely loves the smell of it, and was sorely disappointed when I ran out years ago.

    <li> have to give this a 10 not a 5 star I have been out of this for a long time I resev it put it on and well let me just say I have more girls asking what do you have on it is damn good.just wish it come in a little last it dose work I will order more later it is out of this world.yes it is that good thanks wlj florida</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a cologne that you need to spray a ton to smell good. It&#x27;s a very strong, pleasant musk. I think it&#x27;s one of the biggest bangs for your buck. I completely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was just perfect. I was given a pack of cologne that had three sample bottles. They were small, but it included BOD, something else, and new musk for men. It&#x27;s a cologne that my girlfriend of 4 years really liked when we started dating. So for prom I took a gamble and ordered it. Turns out this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I get lots of complements from everyone whenever I wear it, and it&#x27;s long lasting. I did the 2-3 day shipping and it was here the day before prom.</li>
    <li> I prefer this cologne and it has been my daily fragrance for the past year so I had to get another bottle of it. I am in the mid 20s and I think this is perfect for this age. The scent is strong enough to hold pretty much all day and it is vitalizing with a hint of freshness to it. It does give you a positive feel when you wear it but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. Many different people I&#x27;ve met have liked this and my girlfriend does compliment it to this day so I think it&#x27;s a success with women too.</li>
    <li> This smells nice, I get people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing quite often...</li>
    <li> I like this for a low priced daily use type cologne, light, not a thick heavy sort of smell. Seems like a good all season type to use.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Clean, straightforward musk with a vanilla minor note. My wife loves it, and she&#x27;s picky. Folks at work commented too. Doesn&#x27;t take much, lasts a good 8+ hours. Really goo deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The first time I got it was in a gift set with Bod Spray products.  I always get compliments from ladies of how good I smell. lol  If a lot of ladies love it, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This used to be ridiculously hard to find. I only knew of one online dealer, and otherwise could only find it in holiday sampler packs bundled with a couple others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two colognes I&#x27;ve worn which have resulted in random people coming up to me on the street and asking what it is. One is Dior Fahrenheit, so absurdly expensive that I only buy it in duty-free shops, and the other is this. Obviously your mileage may vary, cologne melds with your natural scent and wearing it as a substitute for bathing makes you smell terrible, but for the price there is no other scent on the market I&#x27;d ever think of wearing. If this stuff were $100 a bottle, I&#x27;d still buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is probably the largest size you can buy. A bottle lasts me around half a year, not wearing it every day but very often.</li>
    <li> WORST SCENT EVER INVENTED!! YOU DEFINITELY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS COLOGNE!!&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP PRICE CHEAP SCENT THAT  MADE MY STOMACH TURN. SO GROSSED OUT STILL!!</li>
    <li> My son like this cologne very much</li>
    <li> this is definitely my favorite cologne. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This should not be called a mens cologne. This is a fragrance you would smell on a 65+ year old woman.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is not a musk, it&#x27;s a perfume. You can&#x27;t return this stuff either, I understand. They should rename this stuff, El Toilette of eck.</li>
    <li> I love this... just wish it was sold in stores again</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to find a Cologne that is worth a damn anymore. What are these retailers selling? Smelly Water? That is all I seem to be getting from these wanna be colognes. All have been nothing but a waste of money and time. I feel like going into this kind of business, you know, throw some smelly scent into water, bottle it, give it a name \\&quot;MUSK\\&quot;, and sell it to the public. I definitely have ceased to purchase any more cologne trash from Amazon that&#x27;s for damn sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing else I can say other than, if you like to smell ok for a few short seconds, then go ahead and purchase this toilet water. Otherwise, I would suggest be weary, because this sucks.</li>
    <li> Ive used the After shave*.. before .~~ But the bottle of cologne spray I recv-ed:&lt;br /&gt; smells like skunk .  I  don&#x27;t know if it  was bad  or even tampered with.  !  -- ]</li>
    <li> I have used this colonge since it first came out, or since I first heard about it. I love the smell and no matter when I wear it. I always seem to get compliments on the nice smell. I am a female and this is a males colonge but they can never tell. Shhhhhhhhh. lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and even the expensive ones I buy from other designers don&#x27;t get as many compliments as this one!!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably order again in future.</li>
    <li> Good scent but very light and doesn&#x27;t last very long. You have to use way more than you should.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this. I love it on him. I just wish it was more avalible in stores. i have to get this online all the time.</li>
