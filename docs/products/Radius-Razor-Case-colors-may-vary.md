      <li>Other than that; it&#x27;s very good.</li>
      <li>This makes keeping personal products safe in a very cute and convenient way.</li>
      <li>The case material is made of high quality plastic and has nice quality feel.</li>
      <li>I was also very happy to get a very blue one - Cookie Monster blue, for lack of a better term.  </li>
      <li>It keeps your razor clean and prevents damage to the blades.</li>
      <li>So once again good enough product for what it&#x27;s going to be used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got one and it came in PINK. So what? I travel a lot and have been looking everywhere for some kind of a plastic container for my razor, especially while packing and unpacking in a different hotel every night. I was wrapping it in a ziplock bag or taking out the blade every day until the next destination.  This container does the job WELL, cost is very reasonable. (Price of ONE blade). What is there to think too much about??</li>
    <li> Perfect for my gym bag and travel supplies.</li>
    <li> Two times that I have ordered it this I have received pink which I don&#x27;t care for.  I would have liked to order a color. This product is, however, perfect for my Gilette Fusion Power razor.</li>
    <li> very hard to close, do not lock and always opens. A crap</li>
    <li> This razor holder is great for using in the shower or when traveling. I wish we could choose the color when ordering this product. I received the pink razor holder. Oh well.  Anyway, I recommend this product very much.</li>
    <li> Needed a travel case for my Fusion razor.  This does the trick.  Great size, easy open &amp; close.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> does just what it is supposed to do.  I use it for a Gillette Mach 3 razor.</li>
    <li> Got the pink one.  You all suck.</li>
    <li> Mine came as black. Perfect case for my razor when I travel. Fits my Dorco 5 blade easily. Looks as if it&#x27;ll fit pretty much every men&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I have the double edge safety razor Edwin Jagger De86bl Faux Ebony. This DE does not fit inside the case when assembled, but it still works when you disassemble it. The item is okay, but the company needs a way for its customer to pick the color. I&#x27;m not much of a pink man, but I received the color in pink.Overall its a good buy if you travel a lot and want to protect your razor.</li>
    <li> This case fits my venus razor perfectly!  It is durable -- I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and does not show signs of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> Came in a flaming bright pink--maybe they should check the purchaser&#x27;s name to see if it is being ordered by a male, who may not enjoy having his shaving kit contain a sparkly pink razor case. Further, it did not close properly. Item has two button-snap style protrusions for clicking shut. One worked, one did not. Very annoying.</li>
    <li> These are great little razor cases...compact and easy to use.  Much better than using the Ziploc bag that I&#x27;ve always used. ;-)  The razor stays dry and away from my other items in my suitcase.  What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> Case worked perfectly for my gym bag.  Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Good enough product for carrying my Gillette Mach3. One of the pins on the clamp didn&#x27;t line up with the hole, but still worked. So once again good enough product for what it&#x27;s going to be used.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! It Contains my Gillette Pro Glide!  Fortunately, mine came in black!...</li>
    <li> This item fits the [[ASIN:B003983HRI Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor]]. It keeps your razor clean and prevents damage to the blades. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> One of the plastic pieces that keeps it closed doesn&#x27;t click.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad shipment, because I got mine and it just feels cheap. It doesn&#x27;t close right, that&#x27;s the biggest issue. When I first got it it seemed like a huge waste of money, but it&#x27;s only like 2 bucks so whatever. It does the job. I use it to store my DE safety razors, I have a Merkur Slant 37C which is a short handled and bulkier razor so it feels kind of awkward. But for other regular DE razors or standard cartridge razor it&#x27;ll work fine. Again not much to say/expect for 2-3 dollars right?</li>
    <li> My razor fits perfect in it, it is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  I got the pink one and really like it.</li>
    <li> I really like this relatively small, quite sturdy, carrying case.  Allows me to carry a quality razor when I travel and not worry about plastic slip on covers.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for for my Gillette mach 5.  It fits in nice and securely, there is a little rattle when you close the lid, but nothing that i&#x27;d anticipate would ruin the blades.  I&#x27;ve been using it constantly for 4 months now and haven&#x27;t problem.  The construction is durable and I don&#x27;t anticipate that it will ever need to be replaced.</li>
    <li> This case is the perfect fit for the Fusion Pro Glide Power razor - razor with the battery in the handle.  The case material is made of high quality plastic and has nice quality feel.</li>
    <li> I love having these cases for holding our razors in our travel bathroom bags. However, they don&#x27;t seem to close tight enough.</li>
    <li> This is actually a case for a Radius Tooth Brush. NOT a razor case. This is a fraudulent advertisement!!!! I regret purchasing.</li>
    <li> The way it opens is a little difficult; you have to pull kind of hard. Other than that; it&#x27;s very good. It fits the razor nicely and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> One thing I hate about throwing my razor in the kit for a trip is when I get there it always seems the head falls off the razor and is floating around in the bag somewhere.  This solves the problem.  The case is quality and it serves its purpose.  Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> I used to hate having the blade come apart from the razor in my suitcase. Now I don&#x27;t have that problem. This hard plastic case is big enough to hold a razor and an extra blade. I can throw it in the zippered sections of the suitcase and it keeps everything together. Great product.</li>
    <li> The case is too shallow and does not fit my Merkur 34C safety razor well. A deeper case design with ridges on both the top and bottom would fit double edge razors better. The hard plastic case is sturdy but the two plastic notches on the latch do not close well and seem like they would wear out after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Nice case., Very good when traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I could find these travel cases. It seems like they no longer sell them in stores!</li>
    <li> like that i don&#x27;t have to worry about the coating on my razor getting all over my shower caddy but i dont like that i didnt get to choose a color...not a fan of pink.  It fit my venus razor perfectly</li>
    <li> Get a Razorpouch instead.  It fits  all brands of venus and gillette and it allows for ventilation and ease of mounting in the bathroom with suction cups and magnets.</li>
    <li> this came in a 2 pack and is inexpensive and works well.</li>
    <li> The case itself is as described.  The case is actually hard to open and close.  I find that as a good thing though.  After opening up one of my cases twice, one of the holes where it is to close is already a bit worn down.  I&#x27;m not sure how long these cases are going to hold up from opening and closing.  The plastic is very thin that holds the two covers together.  The case easily holds a Mach Pro 3, however it will rattle around the inside of the case as there is nothing to hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside with the product and why I rated it only 3 stars is because you cannot pick the color.  I emailed the supplier immediately after purchasing this with my amazon order number and they said that they could not help me.  I ordered two and received a pink and a purple, even though I have a manly name....</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually had a chance to try it on a trip yet, but I put my Merkur Double Edged Safety Razor in, and it fits nice and snug. No moving around once it&#x27;s in the case. Offers protection for both my razor and me reaching into my kit bag.</li>
    <li> I shave at the gym in the shower. I also wet shave with a DE razor. For all the boys out their look it up. This bad boy hold my DE nicely in place when traveling to and from the gym.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of leaving a razor in my toiletry bag uncovered and, while digging through my bag, cut several of my fingers very badly. Needless to say, this case provides me with some much needed peace of mind now when carrying my razor in a travel bag! It fits my razor and a couple of cartridges perfectly. It&#x27;s al little tough to open, but that&#x27;s ok because I know for sure it won&#x27;t ever accidentally open in my bag.</li>
    <li> I have the black and I don&#x27;t really like the color but it fits almost any razor. I like the way it locks closed it does not come open in your cosmetic bag. Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel as it keeps a damp razor from leaving moisture strip goo all over everything in your bag.  Plus, I never lose my razor in my bag now.</li>
    <li> It works nice really nice</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this - a case for my razor to throw in my gym bag! It&#x27;s great, exactly what I wanted, fits my fancy Schick curvy razor no problem!</li>
    <li> This case works great for the Venus Embrace razor. Perfect fit and works wonderfully for travel. Radius makes great products.</li>
    <li> Very good product by Radius - I bought this for my wife. I can tell my wife is is very happy with the product. These products are of the highest quality. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. I sometimes use one for travel and one for home use. They work great for the Fusion Proglide with five blades. I&#x27;m not certain if they work with the power model. It&#x27;s best to check as the battery section increases the size.</li>
    <li> The case is a perfect fit for my Harry&#x27;s razors, whose blades can get bent when I carry them loose in a bag with my shaving cream, etc. But I shave in the shower, so the razor goes back into the case wet. had to drill holes myself to let water out and air in -- you&#x27;d think the manufacturer would have figured out that sealing a wet metal razor in a tight plastic case was a poor idea. If these came with pre-drilled holes I&#x27;d give it a 5. For now I&#x27;ll buy more and keep my drill handy.</li>
    <li> I love my razor case. Now the blades last longer. It also keeps things clean which is great. I definitely recommend it if you travel a lot.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of them, one for me and one each for two of my sons.  Mine is black and excellent for its purpose.  The other two are a HOT PINK color.  You do not have any choice of colors and I cannot return the pink ones.  I am sure neither of my two grown sons would want to usw a pink one although the company does tell you that you have no choice in ordering a specific color.</li>
    <li> very handy in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Great razor case for travelling, couldn&#x27;t find one in any of the travel stores including the airport</li>
    <li> Great travel case.  Durable plastic and fits every razor I have.</li>
    <li> Very good for travel. Fits my Venus razor. Only gripe is that you can&#x27;t choose your colour. I got a black one which is okay but would have preferred something else</li>
    <li> Like the fact it keeps your razor apart from everything else.  The way it closes is there are two little plastic nubs that are pushed into these two little holes, so hope the nubs don&#x27;t break off, otherwise, the case won&#x27;t close.</li>
    <li> Shipped in a timely manner. Perfect for my venus razor.</li>
    <li> works well. no more cutting my hand reaching into bags</li>
    <li> These guys work quite well, they&#x27;ll fit even a bulky generic razor. I wish that they were a little bit smaller along the stem of the razor. Doing this would make the product a little bit smaller and would stop the stem from bouncing around quite so much (not that this is a huge deal). It would also be good for there to be some sort of moisture vent on this product to allow residual moisture to evaporate out on those days when you have to check first thing in the morning. Other than those small quips this is a great product so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Get over yourself people. It&#x27;s a razor travel case. You put your razor in it. You put it in your luggage. You travel. So what if it&#x27;s pink. Are you that insecure in your manhood that you&#x27;re afraid of the color of a piece of plastic? If it&#x27;s that big of an issue for you; only travel in October. Then you can say you&#x27;re supporting breast cancer awareness and you won&#x27;t have to worry about the color of a piece of plastic shriveling your little b@||$.</li>
    <li> I drilled a few holes in it to keep the razor dry and it works great.</li>
    <li> keeps my razor nice and clean so ima happy camper. yup yup i would tell anyone to get it. really a great case</li>
    <li> Compact carrying case for razor.  Good for travel.</li>
    <li> I can tell this product won&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;m sure after opening the case a few times  it will break apart.  It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Exactly what I was looking for! Keeps the razor completely protected and securely locked and safe. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months to hold the razor in my gym bag. It is opened about once a week at the most and the closure has failed.</li>
    <li> solid product. seems expensive though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars BC I purchased this item thinking it would come in a standard color &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;. Since there&#x27;s no option to choose from or did dot specified the color and received a pink one. Yea, had to pass it on to the wife. I really need one to use my razor at the gym. I don&#x27;t like carrying it on a bag with other things in it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for both mine and my husbands razors.  He likes to keep one in his gym bag and travel bag.  The first one we got only one of the tabs clicked in properly, but Amazon was quick to send a replacement and a prepaid label to return the one that didn&#x27;t work.  The next one was perfect.  No more worrying about reaching into the gym bag and getting cut by the razor or worrying about the dog getting into it and getting cut.  I ordered 2 of these total and then figured out that I could go directly to the radiustoothbrush.com website and order the same product.  I had to pay shipping but the cost of the product was so much less that it was still a better deal and I ordered 2 of them so it was a great deal because the shipping didn&#x27;t increase from ordering just one.  Even better I got to choose the colors I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I have been trying to find a razor case in stores with no luck.  the new 5 blade fancy razors fit into it.</li>
    <li> I bought this case for my razor that I received from DollarShaveClub. It fit the Executive razor perfectly. It latches securely and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my travel bag. It also fit my Gillette Mach 3 Turbo fine. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Works great. Only complaint is not being able to choose color. I&#x27;m stuck with pink. Seems well made. Overall happy.</li>
    <li> Good. Only wish I could choose the color of the razor case I want.</li>
    <li> I have a Dollar Shave Club razor and this fits perfectly for when I travel.</li>
    <li> Great razor case, fits my Venus razor.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to open, and I wish it had holes for ventilation.  I&#x27;ve been leaving it open until my razor dries off.  Also, I got a pink one, and I didn&#x27;t want pink, so I&#x27;m buying a kit with several cases by Radius in the color I want (including the razor case).  The price on this one doesn&#x27;t make it worth returning, and it&#x27;s also not worth buying again to try to get a different color.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, but it looks like it should work well.  I have a little bit of trouble with the clasp, but it&#x27;s for my husband and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll have the same problems I have.  Hopefully it will protect his razor when it&#x27;s banging about in his toiletries bag on our constant road trips.  I was also very happy to get a very blue one - Cookie Monster blue, for lack of a better term.  I know it was coincidence, and he would have used a pink one just as happily, but it was a good coincidence.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the random color part...</li>
    <li> Perfect travel case for a razor. Bought this as a gift but have decided to get one for myself too.</li>
    <li> Bought a few of these for my wife and daughters.  Unfortunately, most of the lady razors are pretty large and do not fit in the case.  Does fit the average men&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I paid $5.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a pink razor case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning it costs $5.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were a girl, I&#x27;d like it, but I&#x27;m not. In the trash it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why call your company Details for Men if your going to ship pink razor cases? Scam.</li>
    <li> I have cut myself one too many times on my razor by reaching blindly into my travel bag, so this fit the bill.  I have a Venus razor and it fits perfectly inside.  I got a clear one (it said it mails &amp;#34;various colors&amp;#34;, which was fine with me.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Good protection. Easy to open and close; they work well. I received a black and magenta set. No problems.</li>
    <li> I got a green one. that s very nice and convenient. I took it for my trip. Good quality good color!</li>
    <li> This item met my needs. Not an expensive item and good qualty plastic for the money. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Taking a trip to the beach in less than two weeks and I figured it would be smart to get a Radius razor case. I live close to the factory but don&#x27;t have the time to stop by the factory store due to its closing time. Sure, buying at full retail price isn&#x27;t ideal but buying online is convenient. I emailed the seller to see if I could request a color (I want to coordinate with my Source/average toothbrush case in &amp;quot;celery&amp;quot;) but I was told what I already knew I probably can&#x27;t change, color is absolutely random. So of course they sent me a pink one. Good thing I&#x27;m a girl! Reading all the complaints from guys who got pink is pretty funny... It&#x27;s just a plastic case. Mine is not defective or anything and worked just fine. The case is sturdy plastic, the hinges are strong although some people don&#x27;t like the snap latch. It specifically has no vent holes, but all you have to do is leave it cracked open to ventilate. It fits my Up&amp;amp;Up generic Schick Extreme 3 disposable and has a lot of room. I love everything Radius stands for and all their quality products. Their factory is solar powered, energy efficient, they recycle and utilize plant-based plastics.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking that what I would get would be the clear case as shown in the photo. My fault for not reading the fine print, you get a random color. From my experience and the experience of the other reviewers here, RANDOM more times than not means that they are going to push onto you the UGLY colors that they can&#x27;t sell in their stores, in this case pink. Sorry but I&#x27;m a man and PINK doesn&#x27;t cut it for my travel accessories. I contacted them when I received the item, but do they care? NO THEY DO NOT. When I asked for another color they said sorry but its RANDOM. Its a terrible thing to take advantage of people in this way and waste peoples time without offering to fix it, if I was in front of you in your store I can guarantee you would think twice before pulling this kind of thing.</li>
    <li> I stuffed this razor case in a stocking for Christmas as gift.  It was very much appreciated, since previous to this, the razor was just wrapped in a towel with the potential to unravel and sustain cutting when reaching in.  The case is sturdy and easy to clean.  Immediately upon ordering, I sent the seller a message requesting a color and received my request.  Great service.  Thank you kindly.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find travel cases for Venus razors.  This case fits perfectly and is easy to carry.  Every female that has seen it wants to know where to find one!</li>
    <li> This sure beats carrying around my razor in a plastic baggie. Very nice design, functional, clean lines, no leakage!</li>
    <li> Price was good, S and H cost was out of line. Afraid the plastic on the back side will soon crack. It is only used when traveling so hope it lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> Case was a little small for my razor.</li>
    <li> This is just a piece of plastic so don&#x27;t pay too much.  The hinge is just plastic so after so many openings it will break. No real draining so make sure contents are dry when stored or else it gets moldy. Good for the price at under $2</li>
    <li> This makes keeping personal products safe in a very cute and convenient way. I love the colors and it is neat.</li>
    <li> greet product holds my razor just fine</li>
    <li> I just received the case and I am pleased. My Gillette Fusion Proglide fits perfectly (with the blade installed). I drilled a few holes in it as soon as I received it, anticipating that moisture would not dissipate because it closes tightly.</li>
