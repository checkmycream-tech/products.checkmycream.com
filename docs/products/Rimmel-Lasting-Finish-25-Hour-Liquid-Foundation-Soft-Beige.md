      <li>I recommend it for someone who describes their complexion as warm-</li>
      <li>This foundation has a very strong, almost floral scent to it.</li>
      <li>So far this is the best liquid foundation I can find.</li>
      <li>My search for a good coverage, oil free foundation continues...</li>
      <li>I picked it up in a drugstore out of shear desperation one day and was so impressed I have been coming back to it.</li>
      <li>Since my longtime favorite, Max Factor Pan-Stik, was discontinued, I&#x27;ve been displeased with brands I&#x27;ve tried--</li>
      <li>more than 25 hours w/ or w/out setting powder   </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I just think that with the dryness, my wrinkles show more.</li>
      <li>Okay, so here are the highlights:   </li>
      <li>I think the Rimmel foundation might have slightly better coverage.</li>
      <li>Also, I love the way this foundation feels on my face.</li>
      <li>,I have been using this for more than a year but don&#x27;t know this time it is breaking out my skin</li>
      <li>What more could a girl want?</li>
      <li>mine is more neutral</li>
      <li>I wear a medium biege in most foundations.  </li>
      <li>and I get a very nice color that matches my skin very well by mixing the two.</li>
      <li>Keeps my face from becoming too shiny.  </li>
      <li>This is just as good as others I&#x27;ve tried that cost 10x as much.</li>
      <li>no sunscreen - and I freckle easily).</li>
      <li>- Blends easily   - Lasts</li>
      <li>(I tend to burn easy - after about an hour in the sun w/</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably cheap and does last a good while on the face!</li>
      <li>Liquid Foundation is just fine for me, feels great on my skin and seems to last all day.</li>
      <li>Rimmels liquid foundation is the best I&#x27;ve found so far (as far as liquid makeups go).</li>
      <li>oil free</li>
      <li>So when I saw that this stuff was light weight, sweat, and water proof, I had to try it.</li>
      <li>And my skin tone is light</li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with my choice</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and it looks fresh all day!</li>
      <li>I use clean fingers...and sometimes set it w/ powder.</li>
      <li>This is the most awesome long lasting liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Good price,  long lasting and covers great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a special way of putting on the makeup...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores here, so I&#x27;m really happy to find it on Amazon!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>First I ordered Ivory which was WAY too light for me.  </li>
      <li>however, it keeps my dry skin hydrated all day and doesn&#x27;t sink in at all, &amp; when i do have those occasional zits, it covers them up perfectly.</li>
      <li>All in all, this foundation has performed nicely for me, I just wish it had a little bit better coverage.</li>
      <li>- The color looks darker in the bottle than it really is (remember, I have light skin)   </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I love that I&#x27;m getting a high quality product for a very affordable price.</li>
      <li>Again, not the products fault the color wasn&#x27;t right for me</li>
      <li>Using the matte finish first covers them</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and have been satisfied with the coverage it provides.</li>
      <li>need to use more of this product than I do my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks for this one!</li>
      <li>Thanks Rimmel!     </li>
      <li>Then I ordered Soft Beige which was still too light.  </li>
      <li>- Be careful with application - it can easily look cakey   - Not that many shades to choose from     Overall, an amazing product especially for the price.</li>
      <li>After searching for a full coverage liquid foundation, I purchased the Rimmel 25 hour in soft beige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how little you need of this and gives full coverage.</li>
      <li>My skin tends to be on the very dry side, but fortunately I rarely break out &amp; don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet,</li>
      <li>This is a nice foundation, not quite as much coverage as I would like, however, it really makes up for the slight lack in coverage by not getting greasy and not sliding off my face in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the Double Wear Light.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>but I found it to be very yellowy.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t see it on your skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really bummed because I really like everything else about this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Double Wear Light, which I really like, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up very well in humidity.</li>
      <li>I only wear a light layer of foundation to even out my skin tone and this went on splotchy no matter how I tried to apply it.</li>
      <li>That is really saying something in my case.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I think I may try one/two shades up or one with a bit more pink in it for balance.</li>
      <li>have very oily skin</li>
      <li>And this foundation (which is extremely affordable) is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great foundation for a lot less than other leading brands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is in my opinion the best coverage I have ever had in an inexpensive foundation. Feels good, looks good, isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation for use in the winter.  It&#x27;s a thicker coverage and feels a bit tacky until it drys completely, but looks great when all is said and done and it&#x27;s awesome in photos.  It&#x27;s way too heavy for summer wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I panicked because all the previous reviews said the colors were too dark.  I wear a medium biege in most foundations.  First I ordered Ivory which was WAY too light for me.  Then I ordered Soft Beige which was still too light.  I ended up with Nude and it was perfect.  So the color descriptions were spot on for me.</li>
    <li> I love how little you need of this and gives full coverage. lol i got my wrong skin tone but i made it work blending into the neck c:.&lt;br /&gt;just don&#x27;t put too much as with any liquid.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;ll get cakey later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;but a light coat appears flawless x3.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it ;D.</li>
    <li> This foundation is very good!!! And last a long time but the bottle is so small! I&#x27;ll probably go threw it in less than two weeks</li>
    <li> I have probably tried every foundation on the market; everything from Covergirl to Clinique to Bare Escenutals. And this foundation (which is extremely affordable) is by far my favorite! I picked it up in a drugstore out of shear desperation one day and was so impressed I have been coming back to it. First, a few things about my skin. My skin tends to be a combo of oily and dry (the typical teenage t-zone even though I am close to 30). I don&#x27;t have any major lines or wrinkles (yet...thank God). And my skin tone is light (I tend to burn easy - after about an hour in the sun w/ no sunscreen - and I freckle easily). Also, I don&#x27;t have acne but I do occasionally get a few small pimples along my chin. I don&#x27;t have a special way of putting on the makeup...I use clean fingers...and sometimes set it w/ powder. That just depends on what I will be doing for the day and the weather (if it&#x27;s humid, I&#x27;m gonna set it).     Okay, so here are the highlights:   - Medium to full coverage (the coverage can be lightened if you mix a little product with your moisturizer)   - Blends easily   - Lasts more than 25 hours w/ or w/out setting powder   - Lasts in humid weather (soupy Midwest summers) and dry heat (Vegas dry heat)   - The color looks darker in the bottle than it really is (remember, I have light skin)   - The bottle lasts me usually 2-3 months and I wear makeup probably 5-7 days a week     And, here are the downfalls:   - Be careful with application - it can easily look cakey   - Not that many shades to choose from     Overall, an amazing product especially for the price. Thanks Rimmel!     Hopefully this review has helped you out!</li>
    <li> One of the best retail discount foundations I&#x27;ve ever bought. It actually stays on all day! I own the Rimmel Matt finish and use it as the base before I put the 25 hour on. I have a few acne scars that are diminishing but are evident. Using the matte finish first covers them and I finish my look with the 25 hour foundation. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just bought the foundation in-store. It was very dark in the bottle, I mean in comparison to how it appears on your skin. I am a fair-skinned Afro-American &amp; picked up the soft beige. I definitely like the feel of this Mineral Enriched formula a lot. The tone seemed nice &amp; I didn&#x27;t have problems blending it in but I found it to be very yellowy. I recommend it for someone who describes their complexion as warm- mine is more neutral so I think I may try one/two shades up or one with a bit more pink in it for balance.</li>
    <li> This foundation is absolutely amazing. I never, &amp; I mean NEVER, write reviews on things, but I had to with this product. I am beyond picky with my makeup - i like that very natural, dewy glow and have a hard time finding it. This foundation had all of that, plus lasted all day &amp; was a perfect color match to my skin - I have slightly tan skin with yellow undertones. It goes on so smooth &amp; looks flawless when you&#x27;re finished. My skin tends to be on the very dry side, but fortunately I rarely break out &amp; don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles yet, however, it keeps my dry skin hydrated all day and doesn&#x27;t sink in at all, &amp; when i do have those occasional zits, it covers them up perfectly. My mom, who has a few fine lines, swears by it as well! seriously, you NEED to try this product. Once you do, you will never use anything else. &amp; it&#x27;s so affordable!!! I will use this as long as they keep it on the market and don&#x27;t change anything about it. it&#x27;s awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> wayyy lighter than lead to believe.</li>
    <li> Since my longtime favorite, Max Factor Pan-Stik, was discontinued, I&#x27;ve been displeased with brands I&#x27;ve tried-- either too dry for my skin...too expensive...lousy, uneven coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rimmel Liquid Foundation is just fine for me, feels great on my skin and seems to last all day. And the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product five gold stars despite my gripe that the foundation is hard to apply.  Sometimes it takes a hefty squeeze to work up liquid from half-empty container and it suddenly propels too fast out of the tube!  And, be careful!  If you get this on clothing you might have a hard time removing it. I forgive you, Rimmel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the companion Fix &amp; Perfect foundation primer.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation ,I have been using this for more than a year but don&#x27;t know this time it is breaking out my skin :-( but I cant find whether its this product since i am using this for  a long time ,but I haven&#x27;t changed anything else either ,might be they changed the composition in it don&#x27;t know so confused.</li>
    <li> I am not sure I will repurchase.  This is a good product and covers well.  However, I find it drying on my mature skin.  Need to add moisturizer with it.  (more than usual for me)  Does wear well.  All day as a matter of fact.  I just think that with the dryness, my wrinkles show more.</li>
    <li> I only wear a light layer of foundation to even out my skin tone and this went on splotchy no matter how I tried to apply it.</li>
    <li> This is the longest lasting foundation that I have found.</li>
    <li> LOVE this foundation - it lasts through at least 12 hours of heat and humidity in South Florida sun. I even wear it to the gym and it stays put through tons of sweat. I have tried so many expensive brands, but this one by far surpasses anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores here, so I&#x27;m really happy to find it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> PERHAPS THIS WOULD WORK FOR SOMEONE WITH EXTREMELY DRY SKIN. IT JUST MELTED OFF MY OILY SKIN</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Good price,  long lasting and covers great.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome long lasting liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever used! By the end of the day, you still have your makeup on!</li>
    <li> I am always searching for a foundation to wear under my mineral makeup and this is the most awesome stuff ever. Rimmels liquid foundation is the best I&#x27;ve found so far (as far as liquid makeups go). I highly recommend this, although we all have different skin types, so take that into consideration as well, when looking for a new or different foundation.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for...thank goodness for AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and have been satisfied with the coverage it provides. It is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and lets my skin breathe. Now I found it cheaper online than in the store! What more could a girl want?</li>
    <li> Doesnt stay put as indicated for the 25 hours but what does? Rubs off on clothes and is REALLY thick.</li>
    <li> This is a nice foundation, not quite as much coverage as I would like, however, it really makes up for the slight lack in coverage by not getting greasy and not sliding off my face in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a foundation that works for me. Usually by the afternoon I have nothing but a greasy face and no foundation left on my skin. I was very pleasantly surprised the first day I used this and in the afternoon my skin still looked relatively matte. That is really saying something in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two different colors so I could mix them and I get a very nice color that matches my skin very well by mixing the two. All in all, this foundation has performed nicely for me, I just wish it had a little bit better coverage.</li>
    <li> This is just as good as others I&#x27;ve tried that cost 10x as much. You really can&#x27;t see it on your skin but it has great coverage. I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim at Target. I&#x27;ve been using Double Wear Light, which I really like, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up very well in humidity. So when I saw that this stuff was light weight, sweat, and water proof, I had to try it. I purchased this is 200 Soft Beige. The color match was great. In fact, when I put it next to my Double Wear Light Intensity 2, I couldn&#x27;t tell which was which. In fact, I would say that the Rimmel Lasting Finish could almost be called a dupe for Double Wear Light. The texture and coverage are very similar to the the Double Wear Light. I think the Rimmel foundation might have slightly better coverage. So you are probably wondering why I rated this so low. Well, the reason is that I&#x27;m allergic to something in it. I have extremely allergy-prone skin. As soon as I applied this, my skin started burning and became very red and irritated. This is the only change I&#x27;ve made in my beauty routine, so it had to be this. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I&#x27;m reacting to, but I suspect it&#x27;s either the butylene Glycol, which is second in the ingredient list (I did a google search and learned that butylene glycol  is used as a preservative in cosmetics)  or the fragrance. This foundation has a very strong, almost floral scent to it. My skin tends not to do very well with products that have a heavy fragrance. Ironically, I also purchased the Rimmel Stay Matte foundation and didn&#x27;t have any reaction to that. But that product doesn&#x27;t contain the butylene glycol or the heavy frangrance of this one. I&#x27;m really bummed because I really like everything else about this product. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than the Double Wear Light. But that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and this one does. Obviously, I&#x27;m not going to use something that I&#x27;m allergic to. If you have extremely sensitive/allergy prone skin, I would recommend skipping this product. Otherwise, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> love that it stays on all day, even in rain and windy conditions!  excellent product.  thanks for this one! thanks</li>
    <li> Again, not the products fault the color wasn&#x27;t right for me</li>
    <li> So far this is the best liquid foundation I can find. It&#x27;s reasonably cheap and does last a good while on the face! Great face coverage, I love it. I can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new foundation as my current brand is pricey ($35-40 / bottle). After searching for a full coverage liquid foundation, I purchased the Rimmel 25 hour in soft beige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Right color&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Long coverage&lt;br /&gt;small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;not oil free (that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault; I knew that when purchasing), leaving me quite oily by the end of a work shift&lt;br /&gt;Feels difficult to wash off, like I need to wash my face twice at night&lt;br /&gt;I need to use more of this product than I do my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;ll keep it as a back up or travel foundation. My search for a good coverage, oil free foundation continues...</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage and color.  Keeps my face from becoming too shiny.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation I&#x27;ve every used! I have oily skin and it looks fresh all day! -- Esther Nixon</li>
    <li> Overall I am happy with my choice but I think the color I picked is a little off.  It does have good coverage and not too drying.</li>
    <li> The coverage is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year. I love it! It&#x27;s a great foundation for a lot less than other leading brands. Great coverage and it was cheaper at Amazon than in stores. I will definitely continue to buy this product from here!</li>
    <li> This is the only foundation I&#x27;ll use now. It really is the perfect combination of everything. I have combination skin, sometimes it&#x27;s oily, sometimes it&#x27;s dry. This foundation is perfect for both. It provides a good amount of coverage, without being &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; or looking like you have a lot of makeup on. Best of all, this specific shade matches my skin perfectly (yellow/olive) and that has been extremely hard for me to do. This line offers a lot of different color varieties for others, too. I love that I&#x27;m getting a high quality product for a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to order this online, without knowing which shade I would need, but I hit the nail on the head and selected a great match for my skin color. Also, I love the way this foundation feels on my face. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering a shade darker to mix with the current shade I selected, to give my face a little darker glow.</li>
