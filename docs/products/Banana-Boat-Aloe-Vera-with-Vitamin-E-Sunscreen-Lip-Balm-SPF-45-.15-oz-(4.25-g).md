### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product does a great job, so you can keep playing!</li>
      <li>lip balm, for daytime, is truly excellent.  </li>
      <li>Some are very good, some irritate the skin, some are just ineffective.  </li>
      <li>Does the job, works great</li>
      <li>:o).  </li>
      <li>why do companies have to ruin a good thing?</li>
      <li>Good price for pack of 3</li>
      <li>it made my lips feel good without making me feel like i&#x27;m eating gum.  </li>
      <li>She was very pleased.      </li>
      <li>After a eight days in Antigua our lips were happy and burn free!</li>
      <li>Turns out I LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>kind of like lime.  </li>
      <li>An effective sun protection product that is non-irritating, and inexpensive, and has no qualities that will offend your sensibilities.</li>
      <li>the SPF 30 BB lip balm used to be my SUPER-FAVORITE lip balm because of its smooth texture, good staying power, and lack of flavoring.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive lips and they get burned easily in the sun, I like this as a sunscreen for my lips, not the best moisturizing lip balm though.</li>
      <li>Go to Walmart or Target, it&#x27;s a better buy...</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the taste of it...</li>
      <li>however, if you like saccharin, you&#x27;ll probably love this product.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or waxy or anything.</li>
      <li>I am sure the SPF on this works, but it is too sweet.</li>
      <li>This product does moisturize, it also has sunscreen in and since I live in sunny San Diego, that is good for me.</li>
      <li>so when both my two old tubes ran out, i happily bought a new one...sort of.</li>
      <li>Decent consistency (smooth, not too waxy) but just too sweet.</li>
      <li>a deserted island\\&quot; it would have to be lip balm, lotion, and toilet paper would be nice</li>
      <li>It does need to warm to your lips as you&#x27;re applying it, but it doesn&#x27;t drag across your lips either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth stocking up if you go through as much of it as I do.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product when I went on spring break.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift and my niece absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>It really helps to protect your lips.</li>
      <li>I spend a lot of time outdoors and this really helps protect from wind/sun-burned lips.</li>
      <li>my old tubes (which i kept), do not taste sweet and do not list saccharin as an ingredient like the new tubes do.</li>
      <li>I tried this years ago as I was traveling in a dry area and had summer dry chapped lips something I never did before, this works very good and the protection seems to last all day</li>
      <li>Love the product, but not worth the shipping costs.</li>
      <li>i sunk into a deep depression when i tasted the bizarre super sweetness that i had not encountered in my previous 6 yrs of using the SPF 30 BB lip balm.</li>
      <li>i will stop using this product, and my brand loyalty will have to find a new brand.  </li>
      <li>So much so I went to walgreens a few days later and bought more.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak in too quickly and leave your lips feeling dryer like some other products.     </li>
      <li>has used the 15 SPF in the past and worked just fine</li>
      <li>but this one is very itchy on my lips, need to remove it right away :/</li>
      <li>Rehydrates cracked, dry lips as fast as anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

<li> strangely, they only make SPF 45 and 50 now, but</li>
<li> it gets two stars because the texture is still good, but senselessly changing a good product and potentially ticking off your current customer base is just a stupid thing to do.</li>
<li> if you use it excessively it can make your lips feel funny, a little different texture.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought this brand chapstick for a long time.</li>
<li> It works, but its gummy feeling and it took way too long to get here.</li>
<li> Exactly as expected and current date</li>
<li> That problem will last less than 24 hours if you back off it a bit.</li>
<li> Anytime I can&#x27;t get to the local store to purchase it or they&#x27;re out, I try other brands.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t stand dry lips.  </li>
<li> I gave it to her because she was complaining her lips were dry.  </li>
<li> active sunscreen ingredients are synthetic, which means you must apply the product 20 minutes before exposure to the sun.  </li>
<li> The only complaint I have</li>
<li> Very few stores around here carry it.</li>
<li> it is Hard to get rid of it.</li>
<li> Use it everyday!!</li>
<li> not sure what&#x27;s wrong</li>
<li> and then your stuck with this horrible taste in your mouth that is very Yuck!!!!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
<li> You might as well be eating a pack of artificial sweetener.</li>
<li> If you are a sun person and get cold sores or sun blister this is for you.  </li>
<li> too bad.</li>
<li> I hate a product that doesn&#x27;t moisturize but just coats your lips.  </li>
<li> there&#x27;s no flavor, just artificial sweetness that is disgusting.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed that it has a terrible chemical?</li>
<li> Its disgusting</li>
<li> , It has this VERY nasty flavor to it</li>
<li> totally disgusting.</li>
<li> It is so annoying!!!</li>

    <li> After a eight days in Antigua our lips were happy and burn free! This product does a great job, so you can keep playing!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and current date</li>
    <li> I am sure the SPF on this works, but it is too sweet. You might as well be eating a pack of artificial sweetener. Yuck. Decent consistency (smooth, not too waxy) but just too sweet.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has SPF45 &amp; because it&#x27;s made by Banana Boat, a name brand.  I was disappointed that it has a terrible chemical? taste.  It&#x27;s not a flavoring they added.  It&#x27;s a taste they should have added flavoring to to cover it up!    I threw my tube away.</li>
    <li> I got my sister hooked on this lip balm when she came out to visit me last. I gave it to her because she was complaining her lips were dry.  When she ran out of that tube, She emailed me asking me if I could buy it for her out where I am (San Diego) because she could not find it anywhere in her area (upstate NY). I knew Amazon had it so I just sent her a box of 10.  She was very pleased.      I must have lip balm.  I can&#x27;t stand dry lips.  I have always said in answer to what ever variation of \\&quot;what would you take with you if you were going to exiled on a deserted island\\&quot; it would have to be lip balm, lotion, and toilet paper would be nice :o).  I hate a product that doesn&#x27;t moisturize but just coats your lips.  This product does moisturize, it also has sunscreen in and since I live in sunny San Diego, that is good for me. It doesn&#x27;t soak in too quickly and leave your lips feeling dryer like some other products.     The only complaint I have if you use it excessively it can make your lips feel funny, a little different texture. That problem will last less than 24 hours if you back off it a bit. Yeah I found that out because I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when I went on spring break.  Before I left I bought some tan lotion and a tube of the lip balm came with it.  I am a chapstick girl and figured I wouldn&#x27;t like this.  Turns out I LOVE it!  So much so I went to walgreens a few days later and bought more.  I love the smell and the taste of it...kind of like lime.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> OmG i never used this product before until today!!! Its disgusting, It has this VERY nasty flavor to it and then your stuck with this horrible taste in your mouth that is very Yuck!!!!&lt;br /&gt;and it is Hard to get rid of it. I brushed my teeth to get rid of it, but that did not work at all. I ate a breath mint and that did not work i drank alot of water and juices and that did not work...The after taste lingers for hours. It is so annoying!!! never ever i would buy that i am going to throw it away after just one use. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> If you are a sun person and get cold sores or sun blister this is for you.  It really helps to protect your lips. Use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this brand chapstick for a long time. Anytime I can&#x27;t get to the local store to purchase it or they&#x27;re out, I try other brands. Very few stores around here carry it. This one is not waxy, doesn&#x27;t look like teeny bopper lip gloss or feel sticky. I spend a lot of time outdoors and this really helps protect from wind/sun-burned lips. Buying from this seller, Onlinedrugstore, even including shipping costs, saved me money compared to local prices so it&#x27;s worth stocking up if you go through as much of it as I do.</li>
    <li> This is the only Chapstick my husband will use. I looked at Walmart and target and couldn&#x27;t find it. Good price for pack of 3</li>
    <li> Does the job, works great</li>
    <li> This (or the 30 SPF version) is the only stuff I use now. Goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or waxy or anything. Rehydrates cracked, dry lips as fast as anything I&#x27;ve tried. Protects me against sun-triggered fever blisters.&lt;br /&gt;Downsides? My girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like how it tastes.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat products are a mixed bag.  Some are very good, some irritate the skin, some are just ineffective.  They&#x27;re just like every skin care company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm, for daytime, is truly excellent.  It is a bit waxy-feeling, meaning when you apply it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s sticking to your lips.  It does need to warm to your lips as you&#x27;re applying it, but it doesn&#x27;t drag across your lips either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label say it contains flavor - YUCK!  But I can&#x27;t taste it.  Hallelujah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active sunscreen ingredients are synthetic, which means you must apply the product 20 minutes before exposure to the sun.  And if you are allergic to avobenzone, octocrylene, or oxybenzone, you need to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  An effective sun protection product that is non-irritating, and inexpensive, and has no qualities that will offend your sensibilities.</li>
    <li> why do companies have to ruin a good thing? the SPF 30 BB lip balm used to be my SUPER-FAVORITE lip balm because of its smooth texture, good staying power, and lack of flavoring. it made my lips feel good without making me feel like i&#x27;m eating gum.  so when both my two old tubes ran out, i happily bought a new one...sort of. strangely, they only make SPF 45 and 50 now, but whatever. i bought it. i applied it. i sunk into a deep depression when i tasted the bizarre super sweetness that i had not encountered in my previous 6 yrs of using the SPF 30 BB lip balm. there&#x27;s no flavor, just artificial sweetness that is disgusting.  totally disgusting. every time your tongue touches your lips, you&#x27;ll taste it--chemical sweetness. i checked the SPF 50 packaging in hopes it had not yet been tainted, but it has saccharin, too. my old tubes (which i kept), do not taste sweet and do not list saccharin as an ingredient like the new tubes do. i will stop using this product, and my brand loyalty will have to find a new brand.  too bad. it gets two stars because the texture is still good, but senselessly changing a good product and potentially ticking off your current customer base is just a stupid thing to do. however, if you like saccharin, you&#x27;ll probably love this product.</li>
    <li> It works, but its gummy feeling and it took way too long to get here.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive lips and they get burned easily in the sun, I like this as a sunscreen for my lips, not the best moisturizing lip balm though.</li>
    <li> Sunblock for your lips!</li>
    <li> I tried this years ago as I was traveling in a dry area and had summer dry chapped lips something I never did before, this works very good and the protection seems to last all day, it works equally as well for me in the winter. I had been using the other big name lip balm I used for years in the winter before purchasing this purely out of necessity as this was only brand they had and haven&#x27;t used the other since.</li>
    <li> has used the 15 SPF in the past and worked just fine but this one is very itchy on my lips, need to remove it right away :/ not sure what&#x27;s wrong</li>
    <li> Love the product, but not worth the shipping costs. Go to Walmart or Target, it&#x27;s a better buy...</li>
    <li> This was a gift and my niece absolutely loves it.</li>
