    <li> I use mousse on my roots before blowdrying to get volume where I need it to be. This product was perfect for that. The hold was decent for my hair and lasted throughout the day. My hair is wavy and thick to begin with, the weight of my hair can overtake some volume products but this one holds up. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product.  Fekkai makes great products - but this shampoo and conditioner are excellent.  My color treated hair  stays cleaner longer.  The fragrance is pleasant and light and the best thing is you need very little product to get a great lather going.  I found a new favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Was excited about receiving this product, since people had alot of good to say about it. It&#x27;s a reputable name in hair care, but it did not do the job for me.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and loved it.  This bottle must be something different.  Instead of being a mousse, it is thin and runny and makes my hair flat.  If this is a new formula, I hope they change it back.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this mousse works. As a product junkie, I&#x27;ve tried a million different brands and types of mousse. This mousse has a clean apple fragrance, and works like a charm. It works both for naturally styled air as well as that full blow-out. If you&#x27;re looking to add root-to-end volume, without adding too much product to your hair, this product is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Read about this in Better Homes and garden.  Like the smell and find that it helps my hair.  Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Based on having read several reviews of this product I decided to order. Most of the reviewers indicated fine limp hair, which is the reason I was shopping for a product which adds volume. Having been a Fekkai customer on many of their products I thought it worth a try.  However, it was a complete failure, instead of volume I have silky limp hair, worse than usual.  The texture would be like having applied conditioner twice.. It has a coated feeling which weighs it down.. Having had this head of hair for a long time .&lt;br /&gt;I have had to be an expert in styling  or I could not leave the house. No Kidding. My most recent success has been an ABBA product called: Volume Gel, Proquinoa Complex for fine limp hair.( Amazon does not carry this exact one however) I have to purchase it at a beauty supply. I apply this product to dry clean hair and blow dry. After which I look like Phyllis Diller, then I comb through gently and put in hot roller for no longer than 2 minutes or regular rollers for 15 minutes.(I have all one length at jawline) Voila!!! Ready for work, spray with Big &amp; Sexy hairspray, called Play harder.  I am set for the whole day into evening. Hair moves but style remains.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product layered with their other setting gels for curly hair.  I like all of the Fekkai products that I have used!</li>
    <li> I have very,very fine hair.  This styling product along with the shampoo makes me feel like I styling someone else&#x27;s hair.  Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, this actually feels like additional thickness and not just goo.  I will be taking this to my hairdresser for him to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Through the years, my hair has gone from fine but very thick to very fine and a lot thinner.  I have used Fekkai Advanced Full Blown Volume Styling Whip for a number of years and I love it.  I have tried other products that promise you the moon so to speak, but always come back to my Fekkai.  I have short hair, so I shake the container and then use just a little dab and rub it through my damp hair after shampooing,  I then blow dry my hair in the style I am going to wear and you are good to go.  My hair shines and is  beautiful and manageable.  You do not have that &amp;#34;fried hair look&amp;#34;  when using, and it does not dry your hair.</li>
    <li> This moose seems to work pretty well, and is easy to apply. I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and I&#x27;d consider it better than most. Not sticky.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s definitely not worth it.  This product gives no more volume than less expensive products.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I used a few times and it didn&#x27;t seem to do any better adding volume than the mouse I already use at less than half the cost.  I don&#x27;t feel it was worth over $20.</li>
    <li> I have tried every volume moose I could find and finally I found Fekkai Advanced Full Blown Volume Styling Whip.  It exceeded my expectations and does everything it promises to do.  Fuller hair and longer lasting style. Bravo to Fekkai!</li>
    <li> One of the best styling products I have ever used.  Adds volume as promised, and not too much needed to achieve good results.</li>
