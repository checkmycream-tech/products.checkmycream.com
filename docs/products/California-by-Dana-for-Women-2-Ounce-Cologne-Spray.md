      <li>I love ordering from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Have used this cologne for years &amp; love it.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this perfume.</li>
      <li>My wife was happy that we found it so reasonable.</li>
      <li>I was THRILLED to discover that Dana has apparently purchased the formula and is continuing to manufacture this great</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a great buy.</li>
      <li>It is not anything like the original California.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;California&#x27; is full of sweet undertones.  </li>
      <li>If heavy, overpowering perfumes leave you reluctant to wear a scent, try &#x27;California&#x27; - its fresh, clean, blossom-tinged scent may pleasantly surprise you.</li>
      <li>(this was a product I always purchased from Rite Aid or one of the better stores in the Riverside/San Bernardino area but living in Big Bear</li>
      <li>California is the only cologne I have ever been able to use that has not turned to something on the order of &amp;#34;Raid&amp;#34; when I wear it and this cologne does not smell like California going on</li>
      <li>I really believed that what I was purchasing was legitimate California perfume.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s twice as much here than it was at K-Mart-</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t think that I did ...</li>
      <li>I really hope that they start making it again.</li>
      <li>It is a romantic and rare scent and one that never fails to bring compliments.  </li>
      <li>This scent is reminiscent of Los Angeles in the 1930s, a time when plush backyards were filled with the multiple scents of orange and lemon tree blossoms and flowering jasmine and mimosa bushes.  </li>
      <li>but I have been using this cologne for the past ten or more years and</li>
      <li>It was old and didn&#x27;t smell the same.  </li>
      <li>Was hard to find the spray for several months but now is available.  </li>

    <li> I thought I was ordering California by Jaclyn Smith but the is not the same.......don&#x27;t like it at all!!!</li>
    <li> This was the best deal on the internet, for the cost of it. My wife was happy that we found it so reasonable. Thank you for such a great buy.</li>
    <li> This scent is reminiscent of Los Angeles in the 1930s, a time when plush backyards were filled with the multiple scents of orange and lemon tree blossoms and flowering jasmine and mimosa bushes.  &#x27;California&#x27; is full of sweet undertones.  It is a romantic and rare scent and one that never fails to bring compliments.  A tiny mist is all that is needed.  If heavy, overpowering perfumes leave you reluctant to wear a scent, try &#x27;California&#x27; - its fresh, clean, blossom-tinged scent may pleasantly surprise you.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT-Can&#x27;t believe K-Mart stopped carrying it!!! It&#x27;s twice as much here than it was at K-Mart- but I love the perfume!!</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> this is the only cologne I wear for years and you cant find it in the stores , it has always been my favoret , every one asked me what I was wearing  I told them what it was</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume and can no longer find it in any store.... I believe this might be the last purchase for her, since this was the only place I could locate... What a shame......</li>
    <li> my grandma has been looking for this perfume everywhere, and finally found it online, she tells me its not 100% what she remembered but she still loves it</li>
    <li> Love it as it smell just perfect not toooooo strong as every time I hug people as they said what so good smell and asked for what kind... Not understand why stores stop selling ... Glad that Amazon sells</li>
    <li> California by Dana is one of my favorite fragrances. I wear it often. My husband says he loves to get close so he can smell my cologne. I also receive compliments from friends often when I wear it.  I&#x27;m happy to say I give California by Dana five stars!    I would also like to add..I love ordering from Amazon. I like the prices and I always receive my merchandise in perfect condition and on schedule.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume. I have been buying it since it came on the market. I really hope that they start making it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that I got the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; California by Dana ... I am sorry but I have been using this cologne for the past ten or more years and the cologne that I received does not smell anything like the cologne I have always used.  California is the only cologne I have ever been able to use that has not turned to something on the order of &amp;#34;Raid&amp;#34; when I wear it and this cologne does not smell like California going on and it turns almost immediately to something other than what was purchased.  I am very disappointed in the product and had I had any sense I would have only purchased one bottle as a &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; purchase, but I really believed that what I was purchasing was legitimate California perfume.  Since I cannot locate this product any longer in stores I have to find another product that works for me (this was a product I always purchased from Rite Aid or one of the better stores in the Riverside/San Bernardino area but living in Big Bear the access was completed non-existent).  I wish I had gotten what I paid for but I really don&#x27;t think that I did ... I will not recommend any of my friends to the site for this type of product/purchase again.  Sign me very disappointed in the perfume products I received; especially when I paid over a hundred dollars for two bottles!</li>
    <li> Have used this cologne for years &amp; love it.  Was hard to find the spray for several months but now is available.  It is a light scent &amp; often when someone gives me a hug they comment on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> It is not a good smell.  It is not anything like the original California.  I was really disappointed.  $39.00 wasted.</li>
    <li> my order and product arrived timely - I was well pleased with my experience. I would recommend using this vendor</li>
    <li> Having used this scent for years, this purchase seemed &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; this time, like it turned.  Perhaps there is a shelf-life issue here.</li>
    <li> just wasn&#x27;t the same.  It was old and didn&#x27;t smell the same.  I really liked California but won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I was heart broken when K-Mart stopped carrying this as a Jaclyn Smith product.  I was THRILLED to discover that Dana has apparently purchased the formula and is continuing to manufacture this great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells just as I remember it.  It is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent for all occasions.  I hardly wear anything else.</li>
    <li> This is Gr8. it just would have been nice to have been able to make this purchase @ this price without having to purchase the 1 oz. for the same price, first.&lt;br /&gt;The Prices stated here are incorrect...BOTH sizes came out to be the price of approx. $22</li>
