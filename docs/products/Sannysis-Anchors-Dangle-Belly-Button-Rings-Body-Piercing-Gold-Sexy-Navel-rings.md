    <li> Pretty can&#x27;t wait to wear it on vacation</li>
    <li> Cute, but the first belly ring to give me an infection :( Looks a little cheap too... Probably it because it is lol. Couldn&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> This belly ring arrived pretty much exactly as described. It was a nice shiny gold and holds tight once on. The reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because after wearing it for maybe a week, the gold started to completely tarnish. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s turned completely bronze. But you get what you pay for, and I&#x27;d say for the price it was a good buy. Another plus, shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Cute belly ring for a good price</li>
    <li> Got this item in the mail and I wore it for like 2 to 3 weeks and it was already rusting away.</li>
    <li> very cheap stones fall out during mailing process</li>
    <li> Horrible product.. got in mail early.. but after a day of use the color came off completely and looked metal..</li>
    <li> Love it! Came in slow, but was amazing when I got got it so cute and bling. No diamonds have fallen off.</li>
    <li> I like the belly ring and how it shines. But the metal seems kinda chinsey but you get what you pay for. So overall im pleased.</li>
    <li> The material&#x27;s a tad cheaper than I had hoped but defiantly worth the price!</li>
    <li> I wore it after 2 days and it snapped like in half</li>
    <li> When It came in the gems where falling off</li>
    <li> Love it thank you recommend this seller</li>
    <li> When I finally got this ring it was broken in half and smashed</li>
