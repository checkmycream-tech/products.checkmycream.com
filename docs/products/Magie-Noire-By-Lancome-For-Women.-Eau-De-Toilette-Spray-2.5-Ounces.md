      <li>Have worn it for many years.</li>
      <li>Men love it ----</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Magie.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten more compliments on the fragrance, from both men and women.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and a great price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve known it for more than 20 years, and every time that I can I purchase it for my wife.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>I always buy more than one bottle if I can get it.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The service was OK, could have been faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; implemented and like so many things, it&#x27;s been ruined.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more.</li>
      <li>I am running out of my original bottle of Magic Noir, so I ordered this product from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It is, by far, their best fragrance, and to do away with it would be doing an injustice to those of us women who love it and wear it daily.</li>
      <li>It was advertised as 52.99 with free shipping.</li>
      <li>I bought this expecting the genuine Magie Noire by Lancome....</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this perfume that I had worn in the eighties.</li>
      <li>in which the fully revealed fragrance curves into a surprising change, reverses direction, so that the it would go back to where it started.</li>
      <li>I wear Chanel #5 during the day and save my Magic Noir for special occasions, so I have an actual original bottle of Magic Noir from about 12 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the more exotic, and I actually prefer some mens&#x27; fragrances over women&#x27;s for that reason.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be going off to the mall to select a new favorite evening perfume</li>
      <li>I bought it for my mother who is a very classy amazing lady with a very refined sense of smell</li>
      <li>product is fresh and powerful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent lingers at just the right level throughout the work day.  </li>
      <li>My husband noticed it immeadiately and that told me a lot right there.</li>
      <li>This is the first for a good reason and that is to warn other buyers.</li>
      <li>All that was special about this particular fragrance has been taken away.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>This difficult to find fragrance is a wonderful woodsy/oriental.  </li>
      <li>Now what better advertisement for a product than a human, walking fragrance machine.</li>
      <li>Here is a 24 hour fragrance that is instantly recognizable and distinctive.  </li>
      <li>Going through Amazon I was able to find it and it made for a terrific birthday.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast on this one!</li>
      <li>I used to wear only L&#x27;air du Temps, which is still a favorite, but Magie took over the No. 1 spot for me.</li>
      <li>It is getting hard to find and nice to see that it is available at Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is my absolute favorite female fragrance.</li>
      <li>Given what the new stuff smells like, I&#x27;m not really surprised it&#x27;s considered hazardous.  </li>
      <li>Immediately I contacted the seller and I have yet to hear a single word as to why I was charged almost 10 dollars more.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and its hard to at any price, but the price was reasonable, and it was shipped in aa secure box.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I really hope that is not the case.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>but soon I couldn&#x27;t feel much of a difference.</li>
      <li>She loved it since at least where I live it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
      <li>This perfume has been my mother many years, a few months ago</li>
      <li>When they phased it out I did seek out a new one.</li>
      <li>had posted rave reviews on the Lancome page of this product before receiving this new order.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as fresh and clear as European one</li>
      <li>One thing that I noticed after the first use of Magie Noire from Amazon is that it was slightly different from one I tried in Europe.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Magie Noire, means &#x60;black magic&#x27; in French, is a classic fragrance from the house of Lancome, launched in 1978.</li>
      <li>I purchased it as a gift for a friend of mine and she strongly believes it is not original.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sniff compared the old and new bottles side by side</li>
      <li>We understand that it may have changed a little over time but we still live it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for keeping it available.</li>
      <li>The fragrance has been changed completely if you can still call it a fragrance - there seems to be none of it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft, yet long-lasting fragrance and people do ask what your wearing.  </li>
      <li>Magie Noire has been one of the fragrances i alternate since the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>However, it has changed so much in the past few years that it diesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original.  </li>

    <li> It is not a new fragrance for me. I&#x27;ve known it for more than 20 years, and every time that I can I purchase it for my wife. It Does honor to its name because enchants!</li>
    <li> I have been a Magie Noire wearer for years and unfortunately, the Seller sold an already expiring bottle of cologne.  I was very disappointed and had to purchase another bottle elsewhere that was not expired.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and its hard to at any price, but the price was reasonable, and it was shipped in aa secure box.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom as a present for her birthday. She loved it since at least where I live it&#x27;s been discontinued. Shipped fast. Had no problem with the order.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  It smells so good!  I would recommend it to family and friends.  It was well packaged.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Has been using it for a very long time. Fast shipping and a great price. Will purchase this again. It is getting hard to find and nice to see that it is available at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting Magie Noire for a long time.  Our local Belk used to sell this and then stopped about 2 yrs ago.  This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume, so I started looking on the internet for the best price and found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a soft, yet long-lasting fragrance and people do ask what your wearing.  It comes in several different sizes but I got the best deal with the 2.5 ounce.  Delivery was fast on this one!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for a friend who likes &#x27;spicy, oriental&#x27; perfumes and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for 30 years. When they phased it out I did seek out a new one. But I love this one still. hard to find any place else. It&#x27;s a good deal too!</li>
    <li> The is one truly amazing scents that Lancome has ever created.  Will have to purchase more before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. Service was excellent, and we got it really quick. Happy Hollydays! I hope you will have a wonderful Christmas! :)</li>
    <li> This is my grandma&#x27;s signature smell. When she ran out, I was asked to find it for her online because it&#x27;s since been discontinued in stores. Did what I always do and knew I could find it online. Great price and exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for 35yrs and then it was taken off the market. Going through Amazon I was able to find it and it made for a terrific birthday. Tks</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. I have worn this since 1980. However, it has changed so much in the past few years that it diesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original.  When they first made the changes a few years ago it was different yet the same if that can be. Something was missing but not so much that it changed the basic fragrance.  Now, it is clearly not the same perfume.  My husband noticed it immeadiately and that told me a lot right there. Sadly I will be looking for a new scent.</li>
    <li> My wife has liked this fragrance for years. We understand that it may have changed a little over time but we still live it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for keeping it available.</li>
    <li> Women in my family have been using Magie Noire for decades. Unfortunately, Lancome decided to discontinue the entire line, leaving only this rather poorly designed bottle of EDT. It&#x27;s the same great fragrance, but my wife will greatly miss the parfum.</li>
    <li> My mom has ordered this perfume for 25 years and always bought it at Belk.  They no longer offer this perfume at Belk.  Last year at Christmas I took a chance and looked on Amazon and found the item.  This is the second year I have ordered this for her and she absolutely loves it.  Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she loved it. Of course she told me which one to get. :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this perfume that I had worn in the eighties. It was advertised as 52.99 with free shipping. I had ordered two other fragrances at the same time and received those way before the Magie Noire. Since it was taking longer I looked at the order again and noticed that I had been charged 61.17 NOT the advertised price! Immediately I contacted the seller and I have yet to hear a single word as to why I was charged almost 10 dollars more. Needless to say because it is perfume I am STUCK with it. I say stuck because when I finally did open it the perfume smelled NOTHING like that of the eighties. It is appalling to know that this seller can jack up the price which is dishonest and on top of that sell a &amp;#34;named brand perfume&amp;#34; that is actually NOT the perfume you think you are getting and totally get away with it which is why the seller continues to do it. He KNOWS you cannot return it! If he gave a crap about his customers he would at the very LEAST answer his emails! Unprofessional, dishonest and fake product. I wish I had read the other reviews as they are indeed the truth! I have NEVER left a review and I purchase ALOT from amazon. This is the first for a good reason and that is to warn other buyers. This whole transaction from start to finish was questionable. BUYERS BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume about two months ago, in Europe, and loved it. I like to wear it in colder weather, so it doesn&#x27;t feel overpowering but comforting, and I use at any time a day, not just for evening charm. The fragrance may work differently depending on individuals but even in my family, three women with very different aroma preferences, can (and want) use Magie Noire! This is quite a magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a description from Fragrantica: \\&quot;Magie Noire, means &#x60;black magic&#x27; in French, is a classic fragrance from the house of Lancome, launched in 1978. Magie Noir has a unique composition; which doesn&#x27;t follow the classical top note, middle note and base note development. It resembles a figure eight; it opens and fully revelas its character while the direction of its development suddenly changes, it stars to move in reverse direction. in which the fully revealed fragrance curves into a surprising change, reverses direction, so that the it would go back to where it started. It is one of the most bewitching oriental fragrances. This exoctic bouquet starts with Bulgarian rose blackcurrant buds. Its heart the jasmine flame burns blended with ylang-ylang, amber and incense. The nose behind this fragrance is Gerard Coupy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance holds for a long time compare to other brands, such as Bvlgari Eau de Parfum II, for example. One thing that I noticed after the first use of Magie Noire from Amazon is that it was slightly different from one I tried in Europe. It wasn&#x27;t as fresh and clear as European one but soon I couldn&#x27;t feel much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have just received my order of Magie Noire (from Lancome USA) which had been out of stock for a few months now.  I have used this product for 25years and know it well.  The fragrance has been changed completely if you can still call it a fragrance - there seems to be none of it.  It used to be very distinct, very subtle.  A message to Lancome Paris - the product was good.  In fact, it was great to begin with.  Then, it was changed.  Now again it has been changed and all seems to be lost.  All that was special about this particular fragrance has been taken away.  It&#x27;s too bad.&lt;br /&gt;I had posted rave reviews on the Lancome page of this product before receiving this new order.  Now, I am unable to post a second review or a revision.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d now rate this item with no stars but it won&#x27;t let me.</li>
    <li> Currently this not a very easy perfume to find, and that is because for some reason Lancome disconntinued it at Macys, Sephora does not carry it, etc ...........I was SOO happy to find it on Amazon.  I bought it for my mother who is a very classy amazing lady with a very refined sense of smell, she has been wearing this perfume for 20 something years!!!!! not kidding, so she was sad when she could not find it any longer --- and when I told her I have found it and ordered it for her she was so happy it made my heart smile, therefore I will Always keep buying this for my mother from Amazon</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Magie Noire for quite a number of years. It is my absolute favorite female fragrance. I used to wear only L&#x27;air du Temps, which is still a favorite, but Magie took over the No. 1 spot for me. I don&#x27;t care for flowery female fragrances, even the other Lancome fragrances. I prefer the more exotic, and I actually prefer some mens&#x27; fragrances over women&#x27;s for that reason.  I had heard that Lancome would be doing away with Magie Noire. I really hope that is not the case. It is, by far, their best fragrance, and to do away with it would be doing an injustice to those of us women who love it and wear it daily. I have gotten more compliments on the fragrance, from both men and women. I was standing in line at a salad bar one day and the gentleman behind me wanted to know what fragrance I was wearing.  I told him and he said that he was going to buy it for his girlfriend. Now what better advertisement for a product than a human, walking fragrance machine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for a friend who loves this specific Lancome perfume as a treat to herself.  She was very pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> As Lancôme is not making this perfume anymore, it was good to find this.  I ordered it, came in a few days.  Was given as a gift and recipient loved it.  Glad I found this great perfume!</li>
    <li> It does not last. I purchased it as a gift for a friend of mine and she strongly believes it is not original. I would not recommend it to someone else.</li>
    <li> This difficult to find fragrance is a wonderful woodsy/oriental.  Do not have to re-apply during the day.  The scent lingers at just the right level throughout the work day.  Men love it ---- it is sexy and warm</li>
    <li> The service was OK, could have been faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is fresh and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is my favorit spray. I wanted the cream and found the spray. I get compamented about the fragrance soft smell, long lasting.</li>
    <li> I would tell everyone it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Buy  it if you can find it. I always buy more than one bottle if I can get it.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting the genuine Magie Noire by Lancome....it can&#x27;t be...smells like soap. It&#x27;s not the same color either which tipped me off when I took it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could return it! Too much money to waste!</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this prrfume, it smells awesome. I would recommend this Magie Noir to all. I love it</li>
    <li> Magie Noire has been one of the fragrances i alternate since the early 80&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very disappointed that it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, &amp; dread the day the product on ebay starts smelling wrong....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the bottle of Magie Noire i received...got here quickly, &amp; the product is great!</li>
    <li> I wear Chanel #5 during the day and save my Magic Noir for special occasions, so I have an actual original bottle of Magic Noir from about 12 years ago.  I am running out of my original bottle of Magic Noir, so I ordered this product from Amazon.  This NEW bottle doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original stuff - it&#x27;s got a sharp nasty chemical smell.  I&#x27;ve sniff compared the old and new bottles side by side and it&#x27;s not even close.  It seems like there might have been some \\&quot;cost reduction\\&quot; implemented and like so many things, it&#x27;s been ruined.  Furthermore, it is listed as a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; not eligible for return - so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  Given what the new stuff smells like, I&#x27;m not really surprised it&#x27;s considered hazardous.  I guess I&#x27;ll be going off to the mall to select a new favorite evening perfume and when I find it, I&#x27;m going to stock up.</li>
    <li> The stores&lt;br /&gt; said it was discontinued so I looked for this perfume on amazon.com and there it was  made me very happy as I have been using this for years</li>
    <li> Received this immediately. I love this perfume. I wore it for a number of years (20+ and counting) and still receive numerous compliments. However, Lancome foolishly discontinued it recently. Hopefully something this subtle will pop up again soon.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Magie.  Have worn it for many years. Was disappointed when i went to department store to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to have found it on Amazon.  What will a girl do when they stop making this!</li>
    <li> You cant go wrong, with Magie Noire, I have used  Lancome  for as long as I can remember.  I love this fragrance, and hope its around forever!</li>
    <li> Eau De Toilette came in record time and especially in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and can&#x27;t find it in Mall stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;So glad you had it!</li>
    <li> Here is a 24 hour fragrance that is instantly recognizable and distinctive.  You won&#x27;t smell it on everone but its sophistication is amazing.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been my mother many years, a few months ago and I have not asked her to give her one if I succeed. Thank you I got it and now she is very happy to have him back.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in my area. Please keep it in stock, a good buy. I will buy more.</li>
