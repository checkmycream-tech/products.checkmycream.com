      <li>Amazing and true.</li>

      <li>I Highly Recommend Virgin Hair Fertlizer And A Healthy Nutritious Diet To Maintain Healthy Hair !</li>
      <li>Honestly, after the first application I have not had one flake.</li>
      <li>The scent is kind of strong straight out of the tube.</li>
      <li>I know I probably sound like an info-mercial but this item truly works</li>
      <li>The tube is cheap and packaged in Nigeria.</li>
      <li>I noticed the texture of my naturalhair is nice, soft and more  manageable</li>
      <li>Awesome product, my mom loves it!!I am ready to place my next order....</li>
      <li>I Also Take Multi Vitamin Supplements ( Containing B Vitamins ) , Foods Rich In Protein ( Eggs , Poultry , Etc . )</li>
      <li>Originally I had used it with Hairfinity.</li>
      <li>but it works pretty well, just not as good as the old one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come to realize that there isn&#x27;t just one product that will give you long beautiful hair rather than your own personal up keep of your hair.</li>
      <li>I was horrified just looking at my edges because imagine having a hair full of locs with no edges...</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s nothing cool about that.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
      <li>This is my second time using the product, I was satified with it 8 years ago and even more satisfied with the results today.</li>
      <li>shipment came in quick..</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>and she had to just cut it off and go bold.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much this!!</li>
      <li>Did exactly what I needed it to do!</li>
      <li>I have natural, mostly 4a hair just below BSL.</li>
      <li>I Am Mindful Of What A Healthy Nutritious Diet Has Played As A Vital Role</li>
      <li>I think the smell is definitely worth the results.</li>
      <li>it is very obvious that this stuff has some kind of sulfur in it.</li>
      <li>I wear my natural hair in a ponytail or braided under a wig because its more than I want to handle right now.</li>
      <li>so right</li>
      <li>, that is what I can&#x27;t recall right now</li>
      <li>so right</li>
      <li>There will not be much longer before I have a full hair line again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product! There is a very strong smell &amp; sensation but if you want your hair to grow then it&#x27;s worth it. The tingly sensation only lasts a few minutes &amp; you get used to the smell. I&#x27;ve been using this product ever since I shaved my head bald &amp; now my hair is past my shoulders with all my edges intact. I won&#x27;t stop till it&#x27;s down my back!</li>
    <li> Its OK, only thing I don&#x27;t like is after putting it on my hair it makes my hair stiff and sticky. Other than that its OK.</li>
    <li> I purchased and used on my daughters edges and her hair started growing back so I came back and ordered more.</li>
    <li> i have not seen any improvement yet but i like the strong scent it calms my itchy scalp down.still using so will update how it worked for me in future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to realize that there isn&#x27;t just one product that will give you long beautiful hair rather than your own personal up keep of your hair. I must admit that the smell isn&#x27;t the best, and a true turn off. I was consistent with the product and the only difference I saw was that after a month my hair seemed and appeared to be thicker but not longer. At any rate , it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not a MUST HAVE item</li>
    <li> Good morning!!!!  I recently bought your product back in November and I just want to say that I was very satisfied with my order!  It arrived in a timely manner and the Virgin Hair Fertilizer was exactly what I expected!  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from you again very soon.  You&#x27;ve earned me as a permanent customer!!!</li>
    <li> When you order this product make sure its the actual Virgin fertilizer and not Virgo. My friend ordered this and got Virgo and her hair became way too oily and it started falling off in like 2 days and she had to just cut it off and go bold. Im not sure if Virgo is a newer version of the virgin fertilizer I would just recommend you stick to the old one instead of VIRGO</li>
    <li> !!!!! Notice the exclamation marks? Well let me tell you! I absolutely love this product OMG! I can&#x27;t say this enough you must buy the AFRICAN HAIR FERTILIZER! if you would love to see results for your HAIRLINE GROWTH. I ordered this after a friend recommended it to me after using it on her teen daughters hair line. I saw the results and was absolutely amazed but I was still skeptical because I tried so many products before to try to grow my edges back. One of the things that I&#x27;ve used before is the black castor oil, that is what I can&#x27;t recall right now but just know that I have tried everything. So when I received it in the mail it was packaged well... it was just in a box and then the tube. The tube is aluminum (or some kind of alloy), I&#x27;m assuming this is because it is made of sulfur and some other powerful ingredients. The scent is kind of strong straight out of the tube. You wouldn&#x27;t want to get it on your hands or clothes before going somewhere but I can&#x27;t smell it after I put it on my head. After I put it on my scalp I go work out and do whatever I want to do and I don&#x27;t smell the sulphur anymore so to me I think the smell is definitely worth the results. When I tell you my hairline was slap bald, I mean it was bald. My hair came out from braids, sew ins, etc Yes, I did it all to my hair in my younger days when I didn&#x27;t know any better. So when I went natural and then went from just my natural fro to my dreads I was horrified just looking at my edges because imagine having a hair full of locs with no edges... there&#x27;s nothing cool about that. I started using this product morning and night just rubbing it in with my fingers and I did notice a little more growth but I thought I was tripping (u know, wanting to see results realty badly). Then I got the real results when I used the Derma Roller that I ordered here on Amazon with it. Wow! Hair started sprouting from everywhere,  that&#x27;s when other people actually started noticing it. The only thing I will warn you about is if you&#x27;re going to use the Derma Roller you&#x27;re probably need to take breaks. I used it constantly and it did make my head a little sore, maybe not sore but tender so right now I&#x27;m on my off season, if I should say, from using the Derma Roller but I am using the African Hair Fertilizer. There will not be much longer before I have a full hair line again. Thank you so much this!!about is if you&#x27;re going to use the Derma Roller you&#x27;re probably need to take breaks. I used it constantly and it did make my head a little sore, maybe not sore but tender so right now I&#x27;m on my off season, if I should say, from using the Derma Roller but I am using the African Hair Fertilizer. There will not be much longer before I have a full hair line again. Thank you so much this!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough (3 weeks) but I can say I do have new growth and it&#x27;s TOUGH. This stuff smells great to me. It freezes my scalp all through the night though which I find to be bad since I&#x27;m constantly cold anyway. Still I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after two more months. Also It does make my hair slightly crispy.</li>
    <li> I wear my natural hair in a ponytail or braided under a wig because its more than I want to handle right now. Before using this product I had terrible issues with having a dry scalp. I would wash my hair and as soon as it dried my scalp was white and flaking. Even after scratching the flakes out they would only reappear later that day or the following day. I am so glad that I tried this product because it actually works! I was so shocked because I spent a lot of money on hair products claiming to work and NOTHING has ever worked for me until now. I know I probably sound like an info-mercial but this item truly works and I will definitely purchase more. Honestly, after the first application I have not had one flake. I used it once a day for 2 weeks and there was not one flake or dry patch in my head. I now only apply it twice a week and still have not problems. If you do not like the smell of peppermint and you do not want greasy hair for a while this is not the product for you. I actually love the smell but you have to be careful when laying on pillows or on a couch with cloth like material as it will stain them. Oh yea, also be careful when squeezing the tube. Mine opened from the bottom so now I never have to unscrew the top.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and I can really see it is working for me. Good choice for someone had some experinced chemical burn.</li>
    <li> Great! Product! Helps hair grow and feel refreshed after putting it on your scalp!</li>
    <li> It is apart of my hair growth regimen now always. I can&#x27;t be without it! I had bald edges but my hair is coming back! Yes!!!! Thanks to this product. Doesn&#x27;t smell great but who cares! It works as a growth aid! I love the tingling sensation on my scalp. Makes me feel like it&#x27;s really working! Try it! You will love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Be sure to use it as directed to see results. It has a strong scent.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever made, love the way it feels on my scalp and fast it has made my edges grow</li>
    <li> Ummm I ordered VIRGIN BUT I GOT VIRGO!! I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF ITS THE SAME HAIR FERTILIZER I&#x27;M HOPING IT IS &amp; THE NAME JUS CHANGED CUZ VIRGIN GREW MY HAIR LOT IN 2 MONTHS SO WISH ME LUCK WITH VIRGO! IF IT DOESN&#x27;T I&#x27;M GOIN 2 BE HIGHLY PISSED OFF</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it for a week I noticed the texture of my naturalhair is nice, soft and more  manageable</li>
    <li> Helps control flakiness and itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works or not bc it makes my hair itch real bad unfortunately I stop using it bc of that :-(</li>
    <li> I love it. I can see a difference in my edges. More fuller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product. Makes my natural african American hair grow fast. I&#x27;m growing out my replacer and was told I had another 6 months. After using this product all my replacer is gone. Its only been 1 month. My hair is soft. A little bit goes a long way, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet...</li>
    <li> They took the main thing out that causes the growth. I just purchased and looked at the ingredients and realized they took out the key ingredient &amp;#34; SULFUR&amp;#34;. Do not buy it!</li>
    <li> Have purchased a total of 12 tubes. love the smell. have rated this product previously. Have  purchased enough to last for maybe 1 year.</li>
    <li> IT STATES WHEN ORDERING THAT IT IS \\&quot;2 ct\\&quot; per Case but you only get one tube.  After checking, this was usually sole for $5.00 per tube so when the charge was $10.50 ($14+) with shipping, I thought I would received two. Just be sure you know how many your are getting for your money.</li>
    <li> Great product, worth buying, great for the price.  It really works.  This is my second time ordering it.  It was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> When I recieved the tub the bottom was busted. I refused to use something that was mailed to me open. Will not buy again .</li>
    <li> I like the tingling feeling.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! My mom used to use it on both of our hair in the 90s and it is still just as good!!! It&#x27;s very, very pricey on here though it&#x27;s better to try to find it at your local beauty supply where it will be like $4.99</li>
    <li> I began using the fertilizer one month ago and I believe my hair is longer and stronger already. I can&#x27;t wait  to see the texture by summer&#x27;s end.</li>
    <li> The smell is like a herbal minty &amp; is thick .  I have fine hair which made it look greasy &amp; since I hate the greasy look I washed my hair and just applied it to my crown. I experienced a lot of itching and I looked today and my hair has grown a little bit..I will continue to use it until I see better results.Thanks Again...</li>
    <li> So many people talk about how good this product works I had to purchase and try for my self. Amazing and true. Help with dandruff and help stimulate scalp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for the past week under my crochet braids, along with Manetabolism hair vitamins. Every time I apply it, my itching stops immediately! The peppermint oil in it also makes my scalp tingle. The smell is strong, but I love it. I&#x27;ll update this in about 4 weeks with my results once I take my protective style out, but so far I like it!</li>
    <li> been using it for a very short while and hair has begun to grow in spots that were completely bald!</li>
    <li> You can just feel it working.... My scalp has an organism eveytimes I put it on! Especially after I shampoo and condition my hair!!! This is definitely going to be part of my hair regimen along with a glass of wine afterwards!!!</li>
    <li> I picked this up at a local beauty supply store for $ 7.99 plus tax and I really liked the results it grew my hair over an inch in about a months time. But even greater I found a better way to use it. Two weeks ago I ordered Sulu Max Gro and when I received it I noticed that it has a lot of sulfur on the bottom that you have to shake really hard. When I applied it , my hair became dry and hard, so this morning I took my virgin, mixed the Sulu Max grow and applied that to my scalp. Now maybe I will see double growth with the combined two. I will keep you guys posted on my results.</li>
    <li> Gr8 for especially soft and scanty hair. Repairs hair breakage just be consistent in using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product about 4 months ago,  right after  the purchase I started wearing micro braids,yet continue to use the producet in the areas where my hair had broke off, Once I took out my micro briads, my stylist was surpised in how much my hair grew in three months, not only how it grew but how much fuller my hair has become. This is my second time using the product, I was satified with it 8 years ago and even more satisfied with the results today.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, my mom loves it!!I am ready to place my next order....unbelievable results!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  If you are loving hair, hard to manage this is a product that you don&#x27;t want to pass.  For the price considering if you have tried expensive hair product please give this inexpensive product a chance.  This is a great name for this product, fertilizer.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but absolutely had to on this product! The reason I purchased it was to soothe my itchy scalp because coconut oil just didn&#x27;t do it for me any more. Instant results! I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair getting thicker and slightly longer so that&#x27;s a plus. Many have mentioned that the new version is missing one or two ingredients from the original years ago. I have no complaints with new version because I&#x27;ve had positive results in just a few weeks. I have natural, mostly 4a hair just below BSL. I apply 2x weekly to my scalp only and massage it in well. My first application is right after I wash my hair. This is the best time since the scalp is clean and you can really feel the tingling sensation from the peppermint sinking in. I then apply the second application a few days later. I recommend applying at night so some of the smell can wear off by the morning...it&#x27;s pretty strong. I wear my hair in a protective bun most of the time so I&#x27;m not concerned with it weighing my hair down. It leaves my scalp nourished for days and i love that a little goes a long way! I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve come across this product and will continue to use it as a part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> It has stopped my itching the moment I applied it.. Very soothing... The smell isn&#x27;t that bad to me but I will say it&#x27;s a little strong at first.. I try to apply it on 3 times a week.. I only rated a 3 star because I just started using it .. I will be back and rate again.. I&#x27;m hoping to gain some length by my next review next month..</li>
    <li> Virgin Hair Fertilizer is a great product that truly lives up to its description.  With this particular company, it seemed to be a lenghty delay with the shipping of the order.  I have it in hand now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely seeing results using this product the smell at first is a big strong but dies down quickly, Good Product.</li>
    <li> shipment came in quick.. the product is good too.. give you tingling feeling on your scalp</li>
    <li> I wanted the old brand not the new one but it works pretty well, just not as good as the old one. The new one is missing an important ingredient that I believe makes it work much faster. Over all its okay but I could have gotten it from the store for less. Actually I already had this brand, wanted the original! :(</li>
    <li> Did exactly what I needed it to do! Great for myself and my daughters! Little tingling and smell but it was expected!</li>
    <li> It Has Been 6 Months Since I Started Using Virgin Hair Fertilizer .  I Love What I Have Seen And The Progress In Hair Growth That I Continue To See With This Awesome Product !  From My Personal Experience Over Many Years I Am Mindful Of What A Healthy Nutritious Diet Has Played As A Vital Role In My Having A Healthy Scalp And Hair . In Other Words Hair Haves To Be Fed From Within . I Also Take Multi Vitamin Supplements ( Containing B Vitamins ) , Foods Rich In Protein ( Eggs , Poultry , Etc . ) And Hair Vitamins With Biotin .  Using Virgin Hair Fertilizer Is An Added Assett Which Helps To Further Promote The Desired Results In Hair Growth .  From Someone Who Is A Grandma And A Senior Citizen I Highly Recommend Virgin Hair Fertlizer And A Healthy Nutritious Diet To Maintain Healthy Hair ! Together They Will Achieve Truly Desired Results ;-) .</li>
    <li> Love it when I am twisting my hair. Good consistency also. Not too greasy for 4 a, b, c hair types.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend of mine who said it had really worked for her. I don&#x27;t like it because the smell is so strong and you have to use it is so often. It interferes with the products I have to use on my scalp. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My mom used to use it on my hair when I was a little girl and I loved the smell! At first that was the reason I was looking for it. Then when I found out it grows your hair I wanted more! Originally I had used it with Hairfinity. Anyone who has taken Hairfinity knows that itchy scalp was a BIG side effect. When I started to put Virgin on my scalp along with Hairfinity, not only did the itching stop immediently, but my hair grew 3 inches in 1 month! I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the seller sent me the wrong brand or what. But the name on the box &amp; tube is spelled VIRGO, not Virgin. So I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered. The color of the box is the same as Virgin Hair Fertilizer. The reason I am giving it 2 stars is b/c of the deceptive in the description b/c it is very obvious that this stuff has some kind of sulfur in it. I do not apply it all over my hair &amp; scalp, but on the thin places and when my scalp gets warm I can really smell this and it smells just like Sulfur 8, just not quite as strong. HORRIBLE ODOR!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered  3 of them and when I received the merchandise it was not the same thing I saw on the website very unsatisfied I saw the one you see on the web site  which was the old version that you see in the yellow white box that is what I wanted and I received the new version the reason I say I am notsatisfied is because I know the difference and both products I haven&#x27;t used the old product before years ago before they changed it to the new version and the old version works very well tremendously well on my hair they had some type of fall out with another company I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s behind the ingredients that was in it but they changed one of the ingregients that was in the old which is a yellow and white box from the new one which is the red and white box how I know this is because I have a old box from the old version and I bought a new one and I use the new one it did not grow my hair like the old did in the old one I saw results in 3 to 4 weeks in the new one I use it  for 2 months and saw no results so that&#x27;s why I give the new version the grades that I did one star I&#x27;ve talked to other people where I live that has used the old version  and tried the new version and they say the same thing if there&#x27;s anyone out there that knows where I came by the old products the old version in the yellow and white box please I repeat please let me know here is my email address jn3cher@hotmail.com.</li>
    <li> The smell is really really strong but it works. I have had dry scalp all of my life. I used this product once a week and saw results after the first use. I am happy with my purchase.... again, the smell is REALLY strong.</li>
    <li> I only used it twice but can&#x27;t stand the strong sulfur smell. Even after shampooing multiple times the smell won&#x27;t go away. Also the name on the tube I got is different: it&#x27;s VIRGO not virgen. The tube is cheap and packaged in Nigeria. I wonder if is the same product. I&#x27;m not going to use it again, everyone around me complains about the smell</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is suppose to do....I did not see a difference.</li>
    <li> I brought this product on the 1st I just recieved it on the 10th. I&#x27;m not sure that I brought the true thing the labeling is very off. I will update on the use of the product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and the texture is kind of icky. A little bit goes a long way so the tube will last you for years. All you need is a small dab. As big as a pea or even smaller because anything more than that, and your hair will get all oily and gooped and it&#x27;ll feel disgusting. It has a strange smell so it&#x27;s best to use at night so by the time morning comes, the smell will have faded. I use with another hair grow concoction with it called Blue Magic and my hair has indeed grown about 5 inches in the 5 months of using it. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle with this product. There&#x27;s no such thing as a hair product that makes your hair grow several inches over night. So I would say, give it a try. I like it.</li>
    <li> works great. it smells though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product  for a week and my hair has grown alot since then. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this works as I&#x27;m having a hard time getting beyond the smell, so I&#x27;ve only used it 2x. The smell  is awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna try it w some essential oils added nd hope for not only growth, but that I can actually go out in public w this thing in my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works it thickens grows and fill in lost edges I highly recommend this product I luv it</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product and very difficult to find everywhere else, it was delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I haven&#x27;t encountered any itching or dandruff since first use. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> It makes tour scalp tingle. It feels like the pores are actually opened. Although I have only used one tube haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet. It have peppermint instead of the sulfur I hear people talking about. Will be getting second tube to see what the results will be.</li>
    <li> I feel this product works really good on edges, it does however have a strong scent and I suggest applying at night.</li>
    <li> I Love This Product! It is greasy but it makes my hair soft and I can see some growth.</li>
    <li> I am seeing some results in one area where i was told no hair would probably grow but very slow</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t use it often, because it works so well.  I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this product had to get rid of it because of the smell. I can not stand to smell sulfur for days it probably will make the hair grow but the smell.</li>
    <li> This product surprisingly made styling exceptionally easy.  Did not weigh hair down and curls lasted longer than ususal.  The scent is a little strong, but does fade.  Overall this is a superior black hair care product.</li>
