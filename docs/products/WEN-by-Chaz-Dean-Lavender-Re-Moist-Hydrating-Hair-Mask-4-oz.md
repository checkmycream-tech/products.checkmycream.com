      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>I love all the WEN products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I need 9 more words to say that.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied that in fact the contents amount was correct.</li>
      <li>Love it&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Im sure</li>
      <li>My hair is so healthy now since using WEN products.  </li>
      <li>I love Wen products.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and I need more moisture than the cleansing conditioner provides</li>
      <li>I love the almond mint and love the smell of lavendar</li>
      <li>, I will try it again though using more and see</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love WEN products and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>I have used it once, and I did like the Smell lovely (</li>
      <li>i love the product i love the scent..</li>
      <li>My hair smelled great and was so soft after using the product once.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its truly for all hair types or what type of hair it is best on, but its works great with my hair and I would recommend trying the hair mask even if you don&#x27;t want to use the whole system.</li>
      <li>I tried the hair oil as a scalp treatment, but the scent was too strong for me.</li>
      <li>am glad I did not pay full price</li>
      <li>You do pay more, but it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Love it makes my hair very soft and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>Instead, I make my own scalp treatment oil with the same oils found in the WEN hair oil sans the overly strong perfumy stuff.</li>
      <li>that is, if you like the smell of lavender (and its pretty strong).</li>
      <li>but NEVER gotten 5* worthy hair.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t recommend enough - your hair will feel so healthy!</li>
      <li>but I honestly expected more from this having read such great reviews.</li>
      <li>(note I did not enter worth your while).</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m looking for another scent to try.  </li>
      <li>Good product but not worth the price.  </li>
      <li>So while the re-moist hydrating hair mask is good, it is not worth the price for the results it gives.</li>
      <li>Initially wasn&#x27;t sure about the amount in the jar or the packaging because I had never ordered this product.  </li>
      <li>many factors such as level of hair damage, length , texture are all factors .Sadly</li>
      <li>Most likely will not buy again.</li>
      <li>A lot of hair dryness especially on the top section of my head.</li>
      <li>The next day, I rinsed it out, and my hair has NEVER felt so smooth and silky!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t complain .. came fast from the shipper i chose \\&quot;our shop\\&quot; and i used it right away...</li>
      <li>Of note, I have only used it twice, so I can&#x27;t really make a sound judgement right now.</li>
      <li>I had extremely  dry after highlights and after wen i just love my hair and the lavender aroma</li>
      <li>and sometimes you just have got to give things a try to really find out for yourself,  </li>
      <li>and I did not notice much difference.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>This hydrating mask really improves my hair after a coloring.  </li>
      <li>The system works very well for my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>Good, but not amazing.</li>
      <li>I used this for many months, when it comes to my dry course color treated hair I will be willing to pay a little more to help my hair.</li>
      <li>(I have the type of hair that cannot be washed daily!), and my hair was shiny, smooth, and felt so light that I will continue to use this product for as long as they keep making it.</li>
      <li>This particular Wen product might not be the real thing.</li>
      <li>and yes I felt at first it did leave my hair shiny  and soft</li>
      <li>and I had vibrant, separate curls with body at the top of my head too even though my hair is down to my chest in length.  </li>
      <li>I am a new curly convert and chose this line to set foot in the door.</li>
      <li>Please understand that I am talking about the regular conditioner as well, but the first night I put this on around 7pm, put my hair in a bun, woke up, washed it out,</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine, very dry and frizzy, type 3b hair and have been using this every 5-7 days for the last month.</li>
      <li>Moist Hydrating Hair Mask that I have at home, which came directly from Chaz Dean.</li>
      <li>Smells and get your hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>my hair felt much softer after only one use .. i would recommend</li>
      <li>I just happened to have this imposter product and the real thing (ordered from qvc) arrive on the same day.</li>
      <li>Doubt would puchase again as have yet to get WOW results.</li>
      <li>Recommended use is once a week, not everyday as I&#x27;ve read in some of the reviews.</li>
      <li>Since my scalp is sensitive, I keep it away from my skin.</li>
      <li>I am 3/4 through the liter bottle of matching cleansing conditioner and nearly finished this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price, especially when it leaves your hair feeling like you just got a deep conditioning treatment at a salon!</li>
      <li>I have fine highlighted blonde hair and often masks and treatments way my hair down and give me that greasy look</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes for the Mask</li>
      <li>and this really makes the $$ felt by lasting only as long as the cleansing conditioner or little more.</li>
      <li>It is yellow in color (the real product is white) and does not smell anything close to lavender.</li>
      <li>I originally got this as a gift a few years ago and used it through the winter dry months.</li>
      <li>I twist my natural hair and even though I leave the product in for over 40 minutes, I am not getting enough moisture from mid to end of hair.</li>
      <li>Makes it shiny and not dry looking.</li>
      <li>It not only becomes soft, it really takes out the little frizzies and the split ends are improved.  </li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super frizzy to begin with - but this really works without making my hair feel weighed down or oily (something I usually have a problem with when I use deep conditioners).  </li>
      <li>I feel any monies saved are not worth wondering if the product it real or not.</li>
      <li>My hair is normally very very fine, thin and curly/frizzy but Chaz, you da&#x27; man!</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair and have switched to everything WEN.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I twist my natural hair and even though I leave the product in for over 40 minutes, I am not getting enough moisture from mid to end of hair. A lot of hair dryness especially on the top section of my head. Of note, I have only used it twice, so I can&#x27;t really make a sound judgement right now. Texture of hair.......fine to medium</li>
    <li> Good product but not worth the price.  The Wen cleansing conditioner works just as well, if not better, as a deep conditioner and I have found that my hair comes out softer and well detangled just with the conditioner alone.  So while the re-moist hydrating hair mask is good, it is not worth the price for the results it gives.</li>
    <li> I am a new curly convert and chose this line to set foot in the door. I have lots of fine, very dry and frizzy, type 3b hair and have been using this every 5-7 days for the last month. I am 3/4 through the liter bottle of matching cleansing conditioner and nearly finished this but NEVER gotten 5* worthy hair. Some days worse than others but consistently frizzy and generally stringy.    Acceptable softness when paired with a cap and lo heat for 30 mins. I even tried mixing with water in a spray bottle to revive 2nd/3rd day curls but results form initial co-wash are so frizzy and stringy even that is hard for this to achieve, though when used in this manner after maching oil and styling creme might get semi-decent results.     I find the line TOO expensive for the results obtained and this really makes the $$ felt by lasting only as long as the cleansing conditioner or little more. Matching oil and styling creme seem to last enough to make the $$ blow less painful IF AND ONLY IF they work at least decently for you (note I did not enter worth your while). Otherwise, save the cash and look elsewhere. Doubt would puchase again as have yet to get WOW results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It&#x27;s well worth the price, especially when it leaves your hair feeling like you just got a deep conditioning treatment at a salon! I tend to have coarse hair, being Native American, and so I cleansed my hair with the Wen Cleansing Conditioner, rinsed, then applied this liberally to my hair while it was still wet. I wrapped my hair in a bun, placed a swimming/shower cap over my head, and slept with it in my hair all night. The next day, I rinsed it out, and my hair has NEVER felt so smooth and silky! The effect lasted over a week, as I continued to use the regular Wen Cleansing Conditioner every other day (I have the type of hair that cannot be washed daily!), and my hair was shiny, smooth, and felt so light that I will continue to use this product for as long as they keep making it. I might look for another scent as well, to change it up a little. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and this stuff smells terrible.  I have curly freeze hair and it did nothing like it said it would do.  We have to remember they have professionals showing these products.</li>
    <li> I love what this does with my hair!!! I originally got this as a gift a few years ago and used it through the winter dry months. So now it&#x27;s my regular thing for beating the dry hair in the winter</li>
    <li> Great Product; leaves my scalp moisturized, and my hair shiny and healthy looking. I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and have switched to everything WEN.  I use the lavender re-moist every month (and especially every other month immediately after I color my hair) and the softness achieved is crazy.  I love how my hair feels after using this product!  It not only becomes soft, it really takes out the little frizzies and the split ends are improved.  My hair isn&#x27;t super frizzy to begin with - but this really works without making my hair feel weighed down or oily (something I usually have a problem with when I use deep conditioners).  Can&#x27;t recommend enough - your hair will feel so healthy!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I like the smell and I like how it makes my hair shine.  Use it a lot.</li>
    <li> i love the product i love the scent..can&#x27;t complain .. came fast from the shipper i chose \\&quot;our shop\\&quot; and i used it right away... once a week is really plenty and a little goes a long way .. my hair felt much softer after only one use .. i would recommend</li>
    <li> Love this product. When my hair is dry or too stressed out I use wen and its like hair nutrition. Honestly-one if the best products ever made.</li>
    <li> I love the almond mint and love the smell of lavendar so I thought this would be great. It is just meh. Buy the other fragrance.</li>
    <li> So I thought I would try the Re Moist. It&#x27;s good, makes my hair softer and does give a bit of moister. Good, but not amazing.</li>
    <li> I love all the WEN products. You do pay more, but it is worth it.  My hair is so healthy now since using WEN products.  I have very few split ends anymore and my hair is growing longer.👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I used this for many months, when it comes to my dry course color treated hair I will be willing to pay a little more to help my hair. after using for many months, I did not notice a change in the dryness, when i washed it and styled it was good. but overall if not just washed not much difference. I am into repairing not masking the problem.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of lavender this hair mask is great!  My hair smelled great and was so soft after using the product once.  I washed and kept it in for the night then rinsed in the morning.  My hair has never been happier</li>
    <li> Please understand that I am talking about the regular conditioner as well, but the first night I put this on around 7pm, put my hair in a bun, woke up, washed it out, didn&#x27;t even comb it just let it shake dry and I had vibrant, separate curls with body at the top of my head too even though my hair is down to my chest in length.  I love love love it!  Right now I&#x27;m looking for another scent to try.  My hair is normally very very fine, thin and curly/frizzy but Chaz, you da&#x27; man!</li>
    <li> I liked it from the 1st I used I can feel alot diffident ., .,,,, you should try ,., wish the price cheaper so everyone can afford</li>
    <li> Love this!!! So good for your hair! Brings back body and shine and strengthens your hair! Great shine! Would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I don&#x27;t always use the WEN shampoo when I wash my hair but the Re-Moist Hydrating Hair Mask is awesome!! I have Lavender and it makes my head tingle and feel rejuvenated. Its smells great, that is, if you like the smell of lavender (and its pretty strong). When I wash the product out and dry my hair, my hair feels silky and bouncy. My hair can sometimes be dry and brittle so I use this product to decrease breakage and split ends. Recommended use is once a week, not everyday as I&#x27;ve read in some of the reviews. I&#x27;m not sure if its truly for all hair types or what type of hair it is best on, but its works great with my hair and I would recommend trying the hair mask even if you don&#x27;t want to use the whole system.</li>
    <li> Initially wasn&#x27;t sure about the amount in the jar or the packaging because I had never ordered this product.  However, upon clarification from the seller.  I am satisfied that in fact the contents amount was correct. This is a follow up feedback and since my initial did not contain information regarding the use of the product, I have since used it once and got immediate results.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! After using the product my hair is shinny, manageable, and healthy! I recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I like Wen products.  This hydrating mask really improves my hair after a coloring.  Makes it shiny and not dry looking.</li>
    <li> Wen mask is totally ineffective. I have very dry treated hair and I need more moisture than the cleansing conditioner provides so I tried the mask it did nothing. Wen six thirteen provides the moisture t need.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products. Makes me hair look beautiful. I have been using Wen for serval moths.&lt;br /&gt;I have told others about it. Some folks felt the Wen products were too pricy.</li>
    <li> This hydrating hair mask does work great.  Smells and get your hair soft and manageable. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I just happened to have this imposter product and the real thing (ordered from qvc) arrive on the same day. The imposter product was purchased for a friend as a birthday present. It is yellow in color (the real product is white) and does not smell anything close to lavender. I feel any monies saved are not worth wondering if the product it real or not. I will be ordering all WEN from QVC from now on. I love WEN! All their products are amazing and do as they claim. This is such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I love WEN products and this is no exception. As described, it moisturizes dry hair. Even using cleansing conditioner, my hair is quite dry. This fixes that problem. Since my scalp is sensitive, I keep it away from my skin. With this precaution, I don&#x27;t have any trouble like I did with all the cleansing conditioners except WEN for Kids. Now I use WEN kids strawberry cleansing conditioner, lavender hair mask, lavender styling cream, and lavender volumizing treatment. I tried the hair oil as a scalp treatment, but the scent was too strong for me. Instead, I make my own scalp treatment oil with the same oils found in the WEN hair oil sans the overly strong perfumy stuff. The system works very well for my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel moisturized at all!</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for the Mask I have used it once, and I did like the Smell lovely (if you like lavender) and yes I felt at first it did leave my hair shiny  and soft but I found my ends still were dry? I am not sure if perhaps I did not apply enough? I have fine highlighted blonde hair and often masks and treatments way my hair down and give me that greasy look so I went slow with it  perhaps not applying enough mask , I will try it again though using more and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did not pay full price also it is a little pricey , I think you are either going to love this or hate it, everyone will  have different results Im sure many factors such as level of hair damage, length , texture are all factors .Sadly I was not impressed and this of course is just my opinion and sometimes you just have got to give things a try to really find out for yourself,  but I honestly expected more from this having read such great reviews. Most likely will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This particular Wen product might not be the real thing. The packaging, printing and ingredient list are all different than the Wen by Chaz Dean Lavender Re Moist Hydrating Hair Mask that I have at home, which came directly from Chaz Dean. This container and the contents inside do not look anything like my Wen.</li>
    <li> &#x27;nuff said. It is always advisable to keep one&#x27;s spouse happy. I don&#x27;t know why I need 9 more words to say that.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my hair very soft and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt; I had extremely  dry after highlights and after wen i just love my hair and the lavender aroma is the cherry in the cake</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this product because I have been using the Lavender Cleansing Con.  I have very curly hair and I did not notice much difference.  It made my hair smell nice.</li>
