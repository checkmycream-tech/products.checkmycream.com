### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My best friend to manage my wavy frizzy hair</li>
      <li>This mousse is the best solution for my half-straight and half-wavy layered hair.  </li>
      <li>so I basically mix it with a great Matrix volumizing foam.  </li>
      <li>Good hold mouse for the price</li>
      <li>It has a good smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is the best cheap mousse I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It works great and it is so cheap, so</li>
      <li>It gives nice touchable volume without the stiffness that a lot of mousses will.</li>
      <li>I usually never write reviews on products, but I have to say, this is one of the BEST volumizing mousses I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I won&#x27;t say this stuff reeks, but I swear it has his a cat pee odor too.  </li>
      <li>I love this mousse and have no problems with the smell.  </li>
      <li>but when i uethis makes it look so much better</li>
      <li>This works better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Glad to see it&#x27;s not just me.  </li>
      <li>Since I love the suave hairspray and it works just as well as some of the salon sprays that I love -</li>
      <li>I liked this mousse at first.</li>
      <li>smells good , price is good compare to other name brands.my hair is thinning</li>
      <li>The smell was almost nice at first.</li>
      <li>Wow, I thought I&#x27;d give this mousse a try because it said it&#x27;s just as good as my Matrix.</li>
      <li>I am glad I paid around $2.5 for it in store and am not out much!</li>
      <li>Ok ladies,if you have got thin hair...then this is great for you!!</li>
      <li>I think this is a great product for the small price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice any smell to it in my hair, nor any stickiness (which is actually why I love this mousse).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m not the only one who had issue with the smell.  </li>
      <li>My favorite has always been the Tre Semme 24 Hour Body mousse, and I&#x27;d recommend that if you&#x27;re (like me) currently not in a position to get the fancy stuff.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair VERY crispy at first.</li>
      <li>I have short fine thinning hair and this mousse does create volume.</li>
      <li>I also really like Suave Touchable Finish Hairspray.</li>
      <li>I really like this mousse.  </li>
      <li>It stunk to high heaven!</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like the shape and volume I get from this mousse.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth spending a few bucs to find out :)</li>
      <li>if I put in the perfect amount, and blow dry my hair up-side-down without giving my back a break the whole time, the small voluminous effect has a half-life of the time it takes to run a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;But, can I really complain?</li>
      <li>It is a bit hard the first day but usually by the second day (after I&#x27;ve slept on it ) they style is at its best.</li>
      <li>I have long fine hair, but lots of it, with just a tiny bit of natural wave in it.</li>
      <li>but the huge turnoff was how it would rub onto my skin and leave my clothes, shoulders, arms and back a hot sticky messy.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft to the touch--not crunchy.</li>
      <li>I once had thick hair but 12 years as a type one diabetic have wrecked some havic on my once full main.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a cheap formula that even my hands feel a little offended for having it rubbed all over.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>I like this brand because its cheap and I have to use allot of mouse in my very thick very curly hair.</li>
      <li>I generally like suave products - not this one!</li>
      <li>This mousse is mildly better than using nothing in my hair at all, but it&#x27;s not good, and I&#x27;ll definitely be tossing it immediately for something worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>The smell was nice, consistency weird</li>
      <li>Perfect for wavy thin hair, Gives the shine and hold without waying it down nore making hard.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers state, if you use too much it&#x27;s way too greasy.  </li>
      <li>I use it 3-4 times per week, and my hair is very healthy--it does not dry out my ends like some other products would.</li>
      <li>but ONLY if you use more than a very small amount!</li>
      <li>The effect is long, natural looking, accentuated waves.</li>
      <li>is the difference for me between a bad and good hair day.</li>

<li> Unlike the rich, billowy mousses you can get for the same price, this just disintegrates and leaves an unsatisfying stickiness behind.</li>
<li> My hair is fine and thin and half wavy half straight.  </li>
<li> BUT you learn after putting it in the first time to only use a very small amount.</li>
<li> I have tried other much more expensive mousses, but I have found that this one performs just as well, and costs a fraction of the price.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why there are reviews saying this stuff smells bad, it smells fine just like normal hair product.</li>
<li> I simply put in on when my hair is wet</li>
<li> It does give a little more volume to my thin hair, although it doesn&#x27;t make it look as sleek as some other products do.</li>
<li> I scrunch the mousse into my towel dried hair and then let it dry naturally.</li>
<li> Put in too little and it&#x27;ll be a waste of time, put in too much</li>
<li> dry and</li>
<li> I use it both when I let my hair air dry and go wavy</li>
<li> Now that my hair is dry, it&#x27;s still sticky when I touch it!</li>
<li> I guess I tend not to use enough because my hair just turns into a static-fly-away mess.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this mousse for more than a year now, and I&#x27;ve never had issues with bad odor.</li>
<li> I like the ones in the pink bottles as well.  </li>
<li> But I will certainly never purchase is product again.  </li>
<li> and it does not make my scalp flaky like the other one&#x27;s i tried.</li>
<li> As the other reviewers have previosuly stated, it DOES stink.</li>
<li> /&gt;Its EXTREMELY sticky.</li>
<li> Maybe my Suave volumizing mousse has a different formula, but I have no complaints about the smell or the texture of my hair after I use it - other than I need to brush or comb it through once my hair has dried or my hair is stiff.  </li>
<li> You need less than the recomended amount</li>
<li> a little bit before you let it air dry as it can get a little stiff, but not more so than any other product I have tried.  </li>
<li> Not sure what the issues with the smells are</li>
<li> I can hardly detect any odor to the product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> I&#x27;m trying to at least use what I paid for</li>
<li> money&#x27;s too tight to buy Living Proof or other Sephora products, I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by the affordable stuff like Herbal Essences, John Frieda, Aussie, and Tre Semme, But this doesn&#x27;t stand to those products at all.</li>
<li> The price didn&#x27;t lie, and at the very least, it was legitimately mousse that came out of it.</li>
<li> I have very thick, wavy hair, so it takes a lot for a product to lift my hair.  </li>
<li> It is very sticky and smells horrible.</li>
<li> frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed this crap out of my hair and my hair stayed dry and crunchy for like 2 days AFTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> this stuff is useless.  </li>
<li> This stuff stinks (literally).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m telling you, for $2 and some change, you cannot go wrong with this!  </li>
<li> Very wrong.</li>
<li> I have never had an issue with it smelling bad, and I have purchased this 3 times in a row.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not even going to give it away because I wouldn&#x27;t wish this crap on anyone.</li>
<li> /&gt;Horrible Horrible product Suave.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff stinks (literally).  It smells like a \\&quot;cat corner\\&quot; - my husband agrees. I generally like suave products - not this one!</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews on products, but I have to say, this is one of the BEST volumizing mousses I have ever tried.  For get the $20 brands, this works like a charm!  I have very thick, wavy hair, so it takes a lot for a product to lift my hair.  I have never had an issue with it smelling bad, and I have purchased this 3 times in a row.  You do need to brush/comb your hair a little bit before you let it air dry as it can get a little stiff, but not more so than any other product I have tried.  I&#x27;m telling you, for $2 and some change, you cannot go wrong with this!  I use it both when I let my hair air dry and go wavy or when I blow it out.</li>
    <li> I have baby-soft, jet-straight, flat-across-my-scalp brown hair that cries despairingly for some volume. Being without any product in it at all makes me feel naked. This mousse is mildly better than using nothing in my hair at all, but it&#x27;s not good, and I&#x27;ll definitely be tossing it immediately for something worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;When money&#x27;s too tight to buy Living Proof or other Sephora products, I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by the affordable stuff like Herbal Essences, John Frieda, Aussie, and Tre Semme, But this doesn&#x27;t stand to those products at all. Unlike the rich, billowy mousses you can get for the same price, this just disintegrates and leaves an unsatisfying stickiness behind. Put in too little and it&#x27;ll be a waste of time, put in too much and you&#x27;ll be a greaseball by the end of the workday. It&#x27;s such a cheap formula that even my hands feel a little offended for having it rubbed all over.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I put in the perfect amount, and blow dry my hair up-side-down without giving my back a break the whole time, the small voluminous effect has a half-life of the time it takes to run a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;But, can I really complain? The price didn&#x27;t lie, and at the very least, it was legitimately mousse that came out of it. In short, I obviously wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. My favorite has always been the Tre Semme 24 Hour Body mousse, and I&#x27;d recommend that if you&#x27;re (like me) currently not in a position to get the fancy stuff.</li>
    <li> Since I love the suave hairspray and it works just as well as some of the salon sprays that I love - I was hoping this would be similar. Very wrong. It is very sticky and smells horrible. I am glad I paid around $2.5 for it in store and am not out much! Would NOT recommend to others to try.</li>
    <li> I really like this mousse.  I have curly hair and actually like the Suave brand.  I like the ones in the pink bottles as well.  Not sure what the issues with the smells are but there are chemicals in this brand so I expect that, but I&#x27;ve never smelled cat urine. I like this brand because its cheap and I have to use allot of mouse in my very thick very curly hair. It is a bit hard the first day but usually by the second day (after I&#x27;ve slept on it ) they style is at its best.</li>
    <li> Wow, I thought I&#x27;d give this mousse a try because it said it&#x27;s just as good as my Matrix. The smell was almost nice at first. Then, I dispensed the golf ball size into my hand and put it in my hair. Big mistake! It stunk to high heaven! Ew[...] And as I tried to style my hair, it got sticky. Now that my hair is dry, it&#x27;s still sticky when I touch it! I&#x27;m washing it out immediately and throwing this away. I&#x27;m not even going to give it away because I wouldn&#x27;t wish this crap on anyone. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Maybe my Suave volumizing mousse has a different formula, but I have no complaints about the smell or the texture of my hair after I use it - other than I need to brush or comb it through once my hair has dried or my hair is stiff.  This mousse is the best solution for my half-straight and half-wavy layered hair.  I simply put in on when my hair is wet and I am done with styling.  I can hardly detect any odor to the product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the difference for me between a bad and good hair day.</li>
    <li> I really like the shape and volume I get from this mousse. I have long fine hair, but lots of it, with just a tiny bit of natural wave in it. I scrunch the mousse into my towel dried hair and then let it dry naturally. Once it dries, I finger comb it with my head upside-down. The effect is long, natural looking, accentuated waves. It leaves my hair soft to the touch--not crunchy. I have tried other much more expensive mousses, but I have found that this one performs just as well, and costs a fraction of the price. I use it 3-4 times per week, and my hair is very healthy--it does not dry out my ends like some other products would.</li>
    <li> Perfect for wavy thin hair, Gives the shine and hold without waying it down nore making hard. My best friend to manage my wavy frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Good hold mouse for the price</li>
    <li> I have used this mousse for over a year and I really like it. I have short fine thinning hair and this mousse does create volume. It does NOT stink like some reviewers have said. It has a good smell or I wouldn&#x27;t use it. It doesn&#x27;t have an oily/ greasy feel. It&#x27;s light/ airy. It&#x27;s $2.88 at Walmart. I also really like Suave Touchable Finish Hairspray.</li>
    <li> I liked this mousse at first. The smell was nice, consistency weird but the huge turnoff was how it would rub onto my skin and leave my clothes, shoulders, arms and back a hot sticky messy.</li>
    <li> smells good , price is good compare to other name brands.my hair is thinning but when i uethis makes it look so much better and it does not make my scalp flaky like the other one&#x27;s i tried.</li>
    <li> As the other reviewers have previosuly stated, it DOES stink. It kinda smells like body odor, or armpit sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its EXTREMELY sticky. It makes your hair VERY crispy at first. And then it makes your hair frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s their definition of \\&quot;volume\\&quot;...dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed this crap out of my hair and my hair stayed dry and crunchy for like 2 days AFTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible Horrible product Suave. I wish I could give it NO stars...</li>
    <li> Ok ladies,if you have got thin hair...then this is great for you!! I try almost anything to help my thinning hair. I once had thick hair but 12 years as a type one diabetic have wrecked some havic on my once full main.  s it sticky...well, yeah but ONLY if you use more than a very small amount! BUT you learn after putting it in the first time to only use a very small amount. You need less than the recomended amount and then it will actually work. I have no issues with stickiness. ANd my hair smells great,like my shampoo! Every time I use it I get compliments on my hair.  It works great and it is so cheap, so it&#x27;s worth spending a few bucs to find out :)</li>
    <li> I love this mousse and have no problems with the smell.  My hair is fine and thin and half wavy half straight.  This works better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mousse for more than a year now, and I&#x27;ve never had issues with bad odor. I don&#x27;t notice any smell to it in my hair, nor any stickiness (which is actually why I love this mousse). I use a ball of it when my hair is damp and then blow-dry and straighten. It does give a little more volume to my thin hair, although it doesn&#x27;t make it look as sleek as some other products do. Shining spray fixes that though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best cheap mousse I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Okay, I won&#x27;t say this stuff reeks, but I swear it has his a cat pee odor too.  Glad to see it&#x27;s not just me.  I wouldn&#x27;t give it such a low rating for just the smell ...this stuff is useless.  As other reviewers state, if you use too much it&#x27;s way too greasy.  I guess I tend not to use enough because my hair just turns into a static-fly-away mess.  I&#x27;m trying to at least use what I paid for so I basically mix it with a great Matrix volumizing foam.  But I will certainly never purchase is product again.  In this case, I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are reviews saying this stuff smells bad, it smells fine just like normal hair product. I think this is a great product for the small price. It gives nice touchable volume without the stiffness that a lot of mousses will. I say give it a go. Can&#x27;t beat the price at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m not the only one who had issue with the smell.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with the performance of the product though.  However, since the smell reminds me of a sweaty armpit it&#x27;s not going to be a product I recommend or buy again.</li>
