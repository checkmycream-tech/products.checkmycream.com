      <li>Was very pleased with the product and how speedy the arrival was.</li>
      <li>So I came to know about this amazing product from my friend who is a Dermatologist, and decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>At night, I do an oil cleanse method with castor oil to remove makeup, apply a warm, moist face cloth and leave on just until it cools, then apply the Sebamed Foam Cleanser.  </li>
      <li>but it is effective.</li>
      <li>Best product I have ever tried for an amazing price - I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Great Product, Works Incredibly quickly and effectively</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m love it.</li>
      <li>My niece and I love this foam.</li>
      <li>Will order again for sure</li>
      <li>I have always had breakouts and acne and this is the only product I have been able to use for an extended time and have been genuinely impressed by.</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s more for the summer months however. :)</li>
      <li>But be sure to follow the directions and let it sit for 5 min before rinsing.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer works better than the $90 moisturizer that I was using.</li>
      <li>I simply love it, it is great,&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
      <li>so i can&#x27;t attribute my now clear and balanced skin just to this face wash, but it is a really great find for someone who has tried every product under the sun (even was on accutane at one point).</li>
      <li>Active ingredient uses a coconut derivative and works great!</li>
      <li>I feel like my face is actually clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>I bought thisvin high hopes of seeing some results for some mild acne, but after using it for  the last 2 weeks, it seems to have been causing more break outs, i wanted tovstick to one month, but it&#x27;s doing more damage than good.</li>
      <li>that woman was right!</li>
      <li>Cannot say enough good things about Seba Med.</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t like to use it because you have to let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes, but to me, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>With my acne prone skin, I wasn&#x27;t even sure, whether I could dream of a clear skin.</li>
      <li>I have heard other people complain that it is a good product</li>
      <li>This was my first time using the product.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>- I have used the foam daily twice( morning and night) and each time, have let it remain in my face for 5min or more, before washing it of. -</li>
      <li>with one use it makes my skin clear up significantly.</li>
      <li>I use both of these products now and add in an exfoliator to get rid of dead skin cells and my skin has never been better!  </li>
      <li>It smells fantastic - clean, light, not overpowering, subtle floral coconut but not like a pina colada.</li>
      <li>it really works.</li>
      <li>(it was really</li>
      <li>Sharing my thoughts about the product - It is lightly scented, and each press gives enough amount of foam for one use.</li>
      <li>Ever since I started using it, my face has been clear!!!</li>
      <li>Sebamed Clear Face Antibacterial Cleansing Foam is an effective cleanser for skin with active acne.  </li>
      <li>Some acne products, even those designed for adult acne, can irritate my sensitive skin and further inflame my skin, causing more breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I had been using Retin-A on that particular pimple for 4 weeks and there was no improvement.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend all Seba Med products.&lt;br /&gt;Has improved my skin drastically.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>You should able to see a difference in a few weeks.</li>
      <li>Red face and ance filled, it was just constantly appearing on my skin no matter how I wash it or take care of it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Sebamed if you are looking for a clear complexion.</li>
      <li>I have hormonal acne with very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I had stop medication for 7 years now and my face remains clear!</li>
      <li>I have clear my skin and kept acne at bay!</li>
      <li>It takes no more time or effort than any other cleanser, but is so gentle and effective.  </li>
      <li>My face has never been clear of pimples unless I&#x27;m on birth control.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use it before, but I want to try it with Seba Clear Face Care Gel</li>
      <li>Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam came to my rescue.  </li>
      <li>I am an adult acne sufferer.</li>
      <li>Please pair up with the SEBAMED sensitive skin moisturizer or the Clear Face moisturizing gel</li>
      <li>the breakouts have reduced considerably just with this even without any anti acne treamment</li>
      <li>There is NO skin miracle as such, it is the dedication and continuously effort put in, that would help to achieve a clear SKIN.</li>
      <li>His complexion immediately cleared up and continues to be clear, three years later.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s keeping my skin clear after I finally renounced Proactiv.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was walking in my local supermarket and a sales promoter saw my face and promoted Sebemed Clear Face Cleansing Foam</li>
      <li>This definitely keeps my skin clear.</li>
      <li>, I was skeptical about her since she was just a promoter for her own product</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally write review on Amazon or any other websites but this product was the saviour for my acne prone skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like the way it smells and I think it&#x27;s keeping my skin clear after I finally renounced Proactiv. It&#x27;s even simpler to use, I leave it on for long periods of time even. I still get zits here and there though, so it&#x27;s not a miracle cure either.</li>
    <li> Not the same product as earlier purchased in Germany</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write review on Amazon or any other websites but this product was the saviour for my acne prone skin. It all started during my teens and my face was really bad. Red face and ance filled, it was just constantly appearing on my skin no matter how I wash it or take care of it. It was so embrassing even to walk out of my house. I had seen the doctor that prescribed me with medication and my face cleared up but once I stop the medication, it reappears again (it was really expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was walking in my local supermarket and a sales promoter saw my face and promoted Sebemed Clear Face Cleansing Foam, I was skeptical about her since she was just a promoter for her own product but my face was really bad so there was no harm trying it. MAN! that woman was right! it does alot of good to my skin! I had stop medication for 7 years now and my face remains clear! outbreaks still comes along but I just let the Foam stay longer on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Works Incredibly quickly and effectively</li>
    <li> I am an adult acne sufferer. This product is not a miracle but has definitely helped me.</li>
    <li> Sebamed Clear Face Antibacterial Cleansing Foam is an effective cleanser for skin with active acne.  I have hormonal acne with very sensitive skin.  Some acne products, even those designed for adult acne, can irritate my sensitive skin and further inflame my skin, causing more breakouts.  This cleanser is a thin liquid in a foamer bottle.  I use one pump of cleanser on my skin in the morning, during my shower, and two at night.  In the morning, I leave it on while  washing my body, shaving, hair conditioning, etc. and rinse just prior to leaving the shower.  At night, I do an oil cleanse method with castor oil to remove makeup, apply a warm, moist face cloth and leave on just until it cools, then apply the Sebamed Foam Cleanser.  With the foam on, I then brush &amp; floss my teeth (this takes 3 minutes).  As the suggested contact time on skin for this product is 3 minutes, I rinse my face just after doing my teeth, and therefore no time is wasted &amp;#34;waiting around&amp;#34; for the foam to be on my skin.  It takes no more time or effort than any other cleanser, but is so gentle and effective.  Sebamed products are all excellent, and this one is no exception.  I wish it were not  so expensive ($25/bottle), but it is effective.</li>
    <li> This seriously works, I have oily skin and always break out. My face has never been clear of pimples unless I&#x27;m on birth control. Ever since I started using it, my face has been clear!!! Not one single bump!! Give it a try, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it before, but I want to try it with Seba Clear Face Care Gel .&lt;br /&gt;The price is good and shipping is great.</li>
    <li> I had to wait minimum one month before posting my review. So I came to know about this amazing product from my friend who is a Dermatologist, and decided to give it a try.My face is oily, and had experienced issues with break outs all the time. With my acne prone skin, I wasn&#x27;t even sure, whether I could dream of a clear skin. This is were Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam came to my rescue.  Sharing my thoughts about the product - It is lightly scented, and each press gives enough amount of foam for one use. - I have used the foam daily twice( morning and night) and each time, have let it remain in my face for 5min or more, before washing it of. - At the start I had acne, and lot of acne scars, but gradually I noticed very less break outs happening. And the scars starting diminishing- now I have to look carefully to see faint signs of scars. - In the product description itself, it&#x27;s mentioned, that Sebamed foam would help in brightening the complexion, and hurray!!! it really works. I do have a lighter complexion now. - Spending 5 mins morning and night( though it is mentioned 3 mins in the cover, I leave the foam on my face for 5 mins) is totally worth it. And this product has exceeded my expectation. Extremely happy with the purchase.  Be faithful to the product, and the product would definitely keep up to it&#x27;s promises. There is NO skin miracle as such, it is the dedication and continuously effort put in, that would help to achieve a clear SKIN.</li>
    <li> My niece and I love this foam. It has eased her acne problems. Foam is so lightweight ...can&#x27;t feel it. I use it after my make-up cleanser since it does not remove make up.</li>
    <li> I have always had breakouts and acne and this is the only product I have been able to use for an extended time and have been genuinely impressed by. I have heard other people complain that it is a good product but they don&#x27;t like to use it because you have to let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes, but to me, it is worth it. I wet my face and rub only one pump of foam onto my face and neck, then I brush my teeth and floss and all that other stuff in my routine before I rinse it off to utilize the 5 minutes, so for me it is not a problem. It needs to sit on your skin for 5 minutes or else the antibacterial ingredients won&#x27;t do anything, you will just wash them away and you will think the product doesn&#x27;t work like you thought it would. It smells fantastic - clean, light, not overpowering, subtle floral coconut but not like a pina colada. My skin can be oily, broken out, red, and irritated and with one use it makes my skin clear up significantly. I follow the face wash with another product (not sebamed) so i can&#x27;t attribute my now clear and balanced skin just to this face wash, but it is a really great find for someone who has tried every product under the sun (even was on accutane at one point). Best product I have ever tried for an amazing price - I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Active ingredient uses a coconut derivative and works great! The foam works well and my girlfriend tells me this improves her complex. All of my sebamed products never disappoint!</li>
    <li> I have difficult combination skin with occasional cystic acne. Caused whiteheads on my chin. Made forehead oily.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about Seba Med. This is great face wash! Highly recommend all Seba Med products.&lt;br /&gt;Has improved my skin drastically.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 mths and haven&#x27;t seen a change or difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I simply love it, it is great,&lt;br /&gt;buy it since it will meet your expectations, and the needs,&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I found this too cumbersome due to the amount of time I had to leave it on my face.  I did leave it on the recommended time a few time, far too long other times, or too short b/c I forgot it has to stay on, lol.  Did not notice any reduction in my chin acne - but perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not dutiful enough to follow the procedure every day.</li>
    <li> i love this product, it feels great on my skin and is a beautiful regimen before sleep,lovely packaging too, thank u</li>
    <li> I bought thisvin high hopes of seeing some results for some mild acne, but after using it for  the last 2 weeks, it seems to have been causing more break outs, i wanted tovstick to one month, but it&#x27;s doing more damage than good. Going to try the regular sebamed facewash. Hopefully that clears things up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2years now. It never makes my skin excessive dry or flaky like other salicylic based face washes and has reduced acne.</li>
    <li> Does not have any affect on the Acne problem.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the product and how speedy the arrival was.</li>
    <li> I bought this because after going off the bc pill my acne is horrible. I feel like my face is actually clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> as the title said, it works well for me!!! ( asian skin, men) very recommended to those who have mediocre acne like me</li>
    <li> This definitely keeps my skin clear. But be sure to follow the directions and let it sit for 5 min before rinsing. You should able to see a difference in a few weeks. Please pair up with the SEBAMED sensitive skin moisturizer or the Clear Face moisturizing gel, that&#x27;s more for the summer months however. :)</li>
    <li> great for pimple prone and acne prone skin ! the breakouts have reduced considerably just with this even without any anti acne treamment</li>
    <li> Sebamed was prescribed for my son by a doctor when we were living in Costa Rica. His complexion immediately cleared up and continues to be clear, three years later. I wish I had known about Sebamed when my other children went through their teen years.&lt;br /&gt;Since returning to the U.S., the only place I can find this product is on Amazon. I highly recommend Sebamed if you are looking for a clear complexion.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the product. I have been using it for about one month and NO acne flares!!! I&#x27;m love it. I will recommend this to anyone who have problematic acne. I have clear my skin and kept acne at bay!</li>
    <li> I have always had acne in my chin area. I have tried all types of washes and prescription medication. After having my baby, my chin area broke out so badly with cystic acne and I found this product and decided to give it a try. I noticed a difference after the first use. I felt like I could feel it penetrating my pores. When I got out of the shower I noticed that all of my stubborn blackheads were gone. With in a week, the one cystic pimple that I had for 4 weeks was gone. I had been using Retin-A on that particular pimple for 4 weeks and there was no improvement. After using this product for a week, it was gone. I also purchased the moisturizing cream with the wash. I typically have dry, red, and flaky skin. This moisturizer works better than the $90 moisturizer that I was using. I use both of these products now and add in an exfoliator to get rid of dead skin cells and my skin has never been better!  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Will order again for sure</li>
