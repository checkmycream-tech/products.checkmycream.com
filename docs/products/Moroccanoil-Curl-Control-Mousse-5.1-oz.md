      <li>I just love they way</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>love the curl defining cream</li>
      <li>, I guess they are called Botticelli curls, and this stuff whips those things into tip top luxurious shape.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived on time in perfect condition as expected.</li>
      <li>Styles easily without a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I would NOT buy this again, the smell is so strong.</li>

      <li>I have lots of fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have several Moroccan items and they work great.</li>
      <li>This mousse is fantastic as all the moroccan products.</li>
      <li>But overall, works great and the smell is a plus for me.</li>
      <li>This is great for me on days when I want to blown my hair straight and want it to stay straight.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product since it hit the market for sell, I love it very much and it does straighten the hair as it says.</li>
      <li>It is also very drying, so my curly frizzy hair got more frizzy with this product.</li>
      <li>I use the whole Moroccanoil line and just LOVE the scent.</li>
      <li>These product its perfect when you use the hair dryer and the difusorfor curly air, looks very natural, and without the hair dyer look like super wet and grasy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but enough product to hold a nice curl.  </li>
      <li>I tried this product for the first time and it has an amazing smell and your hair stays so soft.</li>
      <li>He spends a lot of time testing the products to see if they are worth it.  </li>
      <li>in fact, my daughter&#x27;s curls were softer and moved around more naturally than when I used the gel.  </li>
      <li>This product smells great and helps define my curls without feeling overly stiff.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and worth the price.</li>
      <li>My natural curl is more a wavey curl, but these two products define the curls and manage everything really well.  </li>
      <li>Dries easily and curls are soft</li>
      <li>The product was very light, more like the texture of mousse, which surprised me since I thought that dry curly hair (being a non-curly person myself) needed a heavier product to lock in moisture to keep away the frizz.  </li>
      <li>hairspray and you are ready for the day!  </li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s more a foam than a mousse, which takes some getting used.</li>
      <li>This curl control mousse does exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I used this with the Moroccan oil and it works very well!</li>
      <li>This mousse with Argan Oil really holds and defines my curly locks!</li>
      <li>Buyers be aware-</li>
      <li>There are other, cheaper, more natural products out there that work a lot better for my curls.</li>
      <li>( I am natural) significantly.</li>
      <li>I just love this moroccanoil, especially with having such fine straight</li>
      <li>Moroccanoil does expire and is less effective when it is expired.  </li>
      <li>After using the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream, I apply this product as directed on the package and my hair looks VERY healthy and tame.  </li>
      <li>and this tames it and makes into nicely shaped curls with just a little scrunching and blow drying or air during.  </li>
      <li>I found it here on Amazon so much cheaper and they shipped it fast and the delivery was extremely fast as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This product works really well on curly hair - will be purchasing this again</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I combine the Moroccanoil curl defining mousse with the Moroccanoil intense curl creme.  </li>
      <li>In addition to the curl control mousse, and so as to prevent product build up, I swap in and out with Moroccan Oil Curl Defining cream and Moroccan Oil Intense curl cream.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t define my curls well, using too much makes hair feel sticky.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>I do use curling iron on very humid days and this seems to protect the ends as well.  </li>
      <li>Really works well on wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>I am much happier with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>and the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>love their other products</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just love this moroccanoil, especially with having such fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair some body and makes it easier to style!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely something I make sure I have enough in stock!&lt;br /&gt;Good Stuff!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser loves the Moroccan oil product line and is slowly integrating the entire line it into his salon. He doesn&#x27;t just buy what is trendy. He spends a lot of time testing the products to see if they are worth it.  So every time I see him, we try out a new product on my fussy curly hair.  This curl control mousse does exactly as advertised. Keeps the curls tamed and shiny.  I have, I guess they are called Botticelli curls, and this stuff whips those things into tip top luxurious shape.  I highly recommend Moroccan oil line to anyone with curly hair.  In addition to the curl control mousse, and so as to prevent product build up, I swap in and out with Moroccan Oil Curl Defining cream and Moroccan Oil Intense curl cream.  All three are great.</li>
    <li> Enjoy this product great for the hair.  WOuld recommend it to.  Like the way it controls your hair not dry</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, then this is a have to have product. I have been purchasing this from the hair salon I go to for $22.00. I found it here on Amazon so much cheaper and they shipped it fast and the delivery was extremely fast as well. Great Argon Oil product. I just love they way it defines my naturally curly hair and looks so shinny too!</li>
    <li> My results were extra curl on my naturally curly hair on back of my head but nothing on wavy hair on top and front of my head.</li>
    <li> I am not so happy about the results. Plus, this product can be opened and anyone can put whatever they want inside. I don&#x27;t get why someone would do a hair product that doesn&#x27;t come sealed.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Even if you only have slight wave to your hair this will make it look like you have great curlly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this mousse!  I have lots of fine, curly hair.  This product is light enough yet strong enough to plump up my curls without weighing down each fine hair.  My girlfriend gave it to me because she didn&#x27;t like it.  She has fuller, thicker curly hair.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product. It smells oh so good and the price was reasonable. It seals the moisture in my hair with the assistance of defining my curl. It is lightweight and does not cake up in your hair. I am very happy. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I combine the Moroccanoil curl defining mousse with the Moroccanoil intense curl creme.  They work very well together to create definition in your curl pattern, especially if you flat twist hair and let air dry and take loose to shape.</li>
    <li> I love all Moroccan oil products.  These products smell great, work efficiently and provide a good deal of moisture to your hair.  During the summer I wear my hair curly and I would not go without using this product.  I have several Moroccan items and they work great.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Moroccan Oil line but this mousse did not meet previously purchased product standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair dry and dull, no fullness or volume.  Did not do a good job of separating and holding curls and waves.  Left my hair a frizzball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and helps define my curls without feeling overly stiff.  I use the whole Moroccanoil line and just LOVE the scent. I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this mousse.  Hold is great</li>
    <li> The best hair product for naturally curly hair. Love it. Styles easily without a blow dryer. Dries easily and curls are soft</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist. Contrary to my fear, it does not leave an oily/greasy feel in your hair. It does the job defining curls and leaves your hair soft and touchable. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s more a foam than a mousse, which takes some getting used. But overall, works great and the smell is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very humid where I live and my curly hair does it&#x27;s own thing here in this climate.  This is great for me on days when I want to blown my hair straight and want it to stay straight.  It definitely does help me control the curl.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for my curly hair I EVER used. Highly recommended! My hair stay soft and curls are perfectly shaped.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is so overpowering, I actually had to rinse it out of my hair. It is also very drying, so my curly frizzy hair got more frizzy with this product. The only way I can use up the bottle that I can&#x27;t return is to use my old product Redken 01 Outshine Anti-Frizz Polishing Milk Styling Hair Styling Serums, then apply a little bit of this Morracan oil product to add extra hold. I would NOT buy this again, the smell is so strong.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every mousse on the planet! I have naturally curly blonde hair that of course I get highlights in so it does get a little wild. This mousse with Argan Oil really holds and defines my curly locks! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time in perfect condition as expected. No problems with product or service. I would order it again when i need it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product.  I have relatively short wavy hair.  A little foam&lt;br /&gt;and my hair is read to go for the day.  It gives fullness in the back.  I am traveling and it&lt;br /&gt;is wonderful not to have to spend a lot of time on your hair--just apply the mousse,&lt;br /&gt;use hairspray and you are ready for the day!  A blessing...  My husband likes the smell&lt;br /&gt;and likes the fulness it gives my hair.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil is just over priced for what it is. This mousse was very liquidy and not very effective. My hair was still frizzy after use, and this product didn&#x27;t hold my curl well. There are other, cheaper, more natural products out there that work a lot better for my curls.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time and it has an amazing smell and your hair stays so soft. Not hard and yucky.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  I will continueto use this product.</li>
    <li> This product is a fraud. It is not moroccan oil. It is a completely different smell, texture+ formula than what I purchased at a beauty salon. It feels like I am applting shampoo to my hair b/c it bubbles when applied. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> it is so wonderful to find this product for a discount price.  even with postage it cost less than the salon price.&lt;br /&gt;very restorative for my hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t define my curls well, using too much makes hair feel sticky. I am much happier with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by another curly haired adult after I mentioned that the gel that I was using on my daughter&#x27;s hair to get her curls to set without frizzing was leaving a white reside after her hair dried and she touched her hair or scratched her scalp, etc.  The product was very light, more like the texture of mousse, which surprised me since I thought that dry curly hair (being a non-curly person myself) needed a heavier product to lock in moisture to keep away the frizz.  But I am glad to say that I was wrong in my assumption and this product locks in the curl while retaining moisture and does not leave any visible residue in the hair.  in fact, my daughter&#x27;s curls were softer and moved around more naturally than when I used the gel.  It is pricey but a little goes a long way.  I think our first bottle lasted about 6 months with daily use.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and smells sensational!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mousse there is and this is the best.  I hope they always make it.  It&#x27;s light but enough product to hold a nice curl.  I have very curly hair and this tames it and makes into nicely shaped curls with just a little scrunching and blow drying or air during.  I do use curling iron on very humid days and this seems to protect the ends as well.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought the mouse because my hair dresser recommended it.  I have natural hair and wanted something to apply similar to what I&#x27;ve been using paul mitchel foaming pomade.  I like Moroccan curl defining mousse however it does not leave a shine like Paul Mitchel.  You definitely have to use a moisturizer along with it to get the same affect.  For the most part I like the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since it hit the market for sell, I love it very much and it does straighten the hair as it says. I am a African American women who wears her hair very short, and like it straight. If u are in my shoes give this wonderful product a go. I did!!!</li>
    <li> Love how well it works! It doesn&#x27;t make my curls hard like most curl control products do. It was exactly what I was looking for and worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product smells awesome on my hair and works well with my curly/wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and practically nothing works. I used this with the Moroccan oil and it works very well! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  After using the Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream, I apply this product as directed on the package and my hair looks VERY healthy and tame.  My natural curl is more a wavey curl, but these two products define the curls and manage everything really well.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The mousse has a very strong odor.  Not pleasant  at all.</li>
    <li> So glad my hairdresser recommended this awesome product - I have tried them all but this is the winner for me.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome. I&#x27;ve been using this for year but not for curl control but for a little volume on my straight hair.</li>
    <li> moroccanoil brand products rock anyway. this one is perfect for curly and wavy hair. it gives you that extra hold, reduces frizz, doesn&#x27;t get hard to the touch, smells good.</li>
    <li> I dont like this product at all .... It is the first mousse I have used that has left my hair greasy and it is heavily perfumed.  YUCK&lt;br /&gt;I love their other products but this one was a miss.</li>
    <li> This product works really well on curly hair - will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> The product seemed to work well. Unfortunately it turns out that I don&#x27;t like the smell of moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> it was okay ! i probably would not purchase it again. I did define my curls slightly but it also shrink my fro ( I am natural) significantly. i also felt like it dried my hair after it dried.it not for me</li>
    <li> My daughters and I love this product! Received it as expected and will order it again.  I recommend this for others.</li>
    <li> I have tightly coiled curls (4 something not sure exactly which type) and this mouse defined the curls and reduced the frizz. I was skeptical about the outcome when It became sudsy while applying. After finger smoothing the product in my hair the curls really popped and I am very pleased. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products for my thick, curly hair. It lasts for quite some time and has a great smell!</li>
    <li> I live at the beach in the summer and let my naturally curly hair go wild. Moroccan Oil Mousse gives my curls a nice shine and keeps them under control, limiting fizziness in the humid air. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, though; a squirt or two should do it.</li>
    <li> Ok leaves ny hair a little oily</li>
    <li> Really works well on wavy/curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s lightweight</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls curly and keeps the frizzy away! Leaves a lightweight feel to my hair too...</li>
    <li> These product its perfect when you use the hair dryer and the difusorfor curly air, looks very natural, and without the hair dyer look like super wet and grasy</li>
    <li> This mousse is fantastic as all the moroccan products. I&#x27;m using during chemotherapy treatment and my curls got beautiful again.</li>
    <li> This is too heavy for my hair. I think it is meant for very curly dry hair. I am giving it to my granddaughter who has this type of hair.</li>
    <li> awesome product. superquick delivery. great packaging</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this product. Wondering if it&#x27;s expired. It has no positive fragrance like other products from this manufacturer, and the mouse still allows hair to frizz just as much as it did before. :-/ I&#x27;ll stick with Kenra extra volume mousse firm hold for my super curls when I need a mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the curl defining cream so thought I would try this, but bad purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is always good.</li>
    <li> This product is EXPIRED and the company rubbed off the expiration date on the side.  They also rubbed off the little thing you can scan with an app to view the product.  I feel this is EXTREMELY dishonest of them to sell a product that is expired.  The listing does not state it was expired.  Buyers be aware- you are not getting the product that you paid for.  Moroccanoil does expire and is less effective when it is expired.  Buy from honest sellers somewhere else!</li>
