      <li>Take your favorite fragrance with you where ever you go.</li>
      <li>I have already filled it and that was very easy.  </li>

      <li>I travel lots for business and streamlining my luggage is important to me.</li>
      <li>they didn&#x27;t think it was a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is well built and very practical to use. I have two of them that i use in different travel carry-ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for a 3-5 day trip!</li>
    <li> This is an okay product.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t leak, yet.  I&#x27;ve only used it on one airline trip so far, double bagged - just in case.  It is somewhat awkward to load the perfume, can be some movement, which will cause spillage.  Also, I unscrewed the bottom once-to check for leaking-when fully loaded, and perfume came pouring out.  I assume this has something to do with a vapor lock or something.  So my advice, once it is loaded, do not unscrew until you have to reload.  I liked the Travalo much better, ease of usage, no spillage when filling, and so far no leaking either.  The Omega one LEAKED constantly! Beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree with other reviewers that this one is bulky in size as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/2014 This has held up very well, no leaks (still double bag - hey, you never know).  I still recommend to NOT open the atomizer unless filling, it will leak perfume at that time only, from the bottom reservoir.  I also still stand by my original go to travel perfume atomizer, the Travalo.  It ROCKS, no spillage at all! Just challenging getting the hole lined up to fill from stem of perfume bottle.  [[ASIN:B002FQKKCK Travalo Pink Refillable Spray Mini Perfume Bottle, 0.13-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> it is easy to fill and convienent to spary, however,&lt;br /&gt;it is less than my rxpectation in terms of materials,, it is already scratched within the first month.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend, not had feedback from her but it arrived in good time and I already owned one and have been very satisfied</li>
    <li> its good and not leak anything</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than I expected, but it is easy to fill and the spray mechanism works well.  I selected this atomizer because you can refill it from any bottle; I use it for the sample perfumes that come in little glass bottles without spray tops.</li>
    <li> I give 2 stars, and let me explain,  1. Bit too big - compare to other that i also currently own.  2. Chrome finishing - very much susceptible to scratches. I would rather to have it as brushed finishing instead.  3. The method of refilling i don&#x27;t fine it any easy to use really. I would prefer bottom-direct nozzle-pumping.  4. Little bit on the pricey side to be honest.  5. I hate its rigidly hard plastic packaging. Be careful with your finger when you try to retrieve from the packaging.</li>
    <li> Other than having a pretty good refilling \\&quot;mechanism,\\&quot; this atomizer is pretty useless.  The pump is so weak that it doesn&#x27;t really spray the liquid like a mist, rather it squirts like a 10 cent water gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated April 2012 - Received replacement unit and it works perfectly.  I must have received a bad unit.  Thanks to Amazon for the quick exchange!</li>
    <li> This is really cool.  I have bottles of perfume that I have to dab instead of just spray.  I have already filled it and that was very easy.  Sprays great.  Once it is empty I can clean it and use it over and over.  Even if I have a spray perfume I can refill that too.  This is a small atomizer meant for my purse.  Would be great for a gift.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works great. I travel quite a bit so wanted something that I can bring with me through TSA. This was perfect. Easy to setup and use.</li>
    <li> But Rogaine gives me a head ache so discontinued use that said did what it said it would. How ever i filled it with some of my cologne and  put it in my seems that this seeps a little from time to time that is why 4 stars not 5. Its not a big deal its just that you pull it out of the central storage box in the car and go eww whats this dried up stuff on the outside. Ohh must have seeped some.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a dude and like to have my cologne with me if i need freshen up in my car. so you untwist the bottom, spray or pour your cologne in, twice bottom back on and you&#x27;re good to go. The mist is good too, not just dribbling waste. it works. there&#x27;s a glass top, so you know when you&#x27;re low on cologne. Kind of wish the price was a bit lower, but hey it works and i&#x27;m happy. if you&#x27;re a guy, don&#x27;t second guess your decision, this thing works. Stick it in your toiletry kit or glove box like i do. No spills, airtight, works.</li>
    <li> Was messy to fill and wasted perfume, but not excessively so. Does not atomize perfume - sprays in a stream. I guess it&#x27;s better than lugging around a full size glass bottle, but the design still needs major work.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WNP1Z6KUZZYT]]No more having to use messy funnels on traditional atomizers.  Now, you can simply spray directly into the Flo atomizer to prevent waste.  Adaptable with any fragrance bottle.  Flo has a clear glass vial for optimal performance.  Don&#x27;t store your high-end fragrance in plastic when you can store it in glass.  Airline Approved.  Take your favorite fragrance with you where ever you go.</li>
    <li> I love this atomizer! It is so much lighter and saves so much more space than my actual \\&quot;travel\\&quot; perfume bottle, I just can&#x27;t tell you how much I love it! It is SO easy to fill, it is SO sleek, and it weighs NOTHING! I highly recommend it to anyone who travels or likes to reapply her fragrance throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Excellent for frequent travellers.  Easy to refil with your favourite smelly.  If you need 5 day capacity, go for the 12 ml spray in another review</li>
    <li> This is great for travel.  It holds a good amount and is easy to fill.  However, when I went back to fill it the second time. I couldn&#x27;t remember how.  I ended up getting perfume all over my hands.  I&#x27;d recommend keeping the instructions until you&#x27;ve filled it a few times and get the hang of it.  The initial filling using the instructions was a breeze.  Great for cologne too and it now comes in black which is very sleek looking. I&#x27;ve bought several more as gifts.</li>
    <li> my 4th time buying this for travel light</li>
    <li> I have been using Agadir argan (great product) oil and getting too much in my hair so I ordered this to be able to spray the oil on my hair.  The oil is too thick so I added Hask Placenta (another great product) to the atomizer until it was thin enough to spray.  Now I can spray it on my brush and it helps control the amount that I put on my hair.  Really love it and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this one to everyone, not just the ladies!  I accidentally dropped it and broke the nozzle and they sent me a complimentary one!!  Great service!</li>
    <li> I had always believed that the contents of an atomizer could not be easily, if at all, transfered to a portable delivery system.  The Flo refillable perfume atomizer gives 2 or 3 ways to fill the container, and the construction of the system makes it small, light, rugged, and extremely leakproof!  I will never use the store atomizer again!</li>
    <li> I needed something so I can bring my cologne traveling with me.  The sizes and shapes of the &#x27;travel&#x27; ones that Calvin Klein have are sort of a cruel joke for cray on optimization.  This thing is perfect and small and super easy to fill.  No mess and sprays great, just a little less than what a normal bottle sprays so I think its more 2 sprays &#x3D; 1 spray from a normal bottle.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes to travel and still smell good!  Cannot beat the price either</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN  ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE PERFECT FOR WHAT I DO.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS NATURAL COSMETICS</li>
    <li> I travel once a week and finally i can now leave my cologne home. I ordered 2 of these maybe get 2 more..as I can never decide what smell i wanna spray..so small best of doesn&#x27;t leak..</li>
    <li> Totally impracticle for refilling. Buy a unit where the refilling can be done by direct injection</li>
    <li> This was super easy to fill from my atomizer full-size perfume,  and it sprays really well. No leaks. A great little product.</li>
    <li> The Flo refillable is not actually an \\&quot;atomizer\\&quot; as advertised. It has a spray top, but the Flo doesn&#x27;t give you the dispersed fine spray as from a perfume atomizer. The perfume comes out in big drops (big for perfume) and the spray doesn&#x27;t evenly cover a circle. The nozzle tends to spray more out of the upper part of the nozzle and some at the bottom, not much in the middle. It&#x27;ll do in a pinch but it won&#x27;t create a perfume mist. Because of the sprayer, the perfume application is not much different from having a dab-on perfume bottle. By comparison, the Travalo refillable has a finer spray that is distributed in a circle. If you use only spray-bottle perfume, consider the Travalo product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flo was easy to fill from a pour bottle, but like another reviewer said, it can spill while you&#x27;re pouring because there&#x27;s no special stand or funnel for it.  I couldn&#x27;t completely fill the Flo from a spray bottle, because both bottles need to be kept tilted to do that. The Travalo refillable perfume bottle only fills from a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flo refillable is large. It&#x27;s as big around as a handful of 8 #2 yellow pencils and it&#x27;s a little over 3 inches long. This is too large to be considered \\&quot;purse size\\&quot; but it&#x27;s fine for travel.  The Travalo, by comparison, is about as big around as 4 #2 yellow pencils, and is the same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I were going to travel on a plane with it, I guess it might be safer to fill it as full as possible prior to travel, to keep the air inside from pressurizing the container. And double bag it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flo product I received was in a crushed box, so it wasn&#x27;t clear it was new, and there was one slight scratch on the container. I could smell a spicy scent around the plastic base but not inside the container. Strange. Are they reusing parts from returns?  I saw another review where someone said the packaging was so messed up they didn&#x27;t think it was a genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A glass container like the FloRefillable would be the best for fine perfume but if I had to make the choice, I&#x27;d go with a high quality plastic to get the size down to purse-size, and get a better atomizer spray. The Travalo might be the better trade-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the questionable box, large size, and lackluster spray, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Flo again except for one thing. The Flo takes a pour perfume, and the spray head is a handy tool for filling a Travalo with pour perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product. I no longer need to pack my super-sized glass perfume bottle. Instead, I just take 2 minutes to fill this atomizer, and it&#x27;s locked into place and well-protected.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty small, and pretty easy to fill.  I don&#x27;t think it has leaked on me yet, and I&#x27;ve carried it in a variety of bags, as well as in the summer heat for 2 hours at a time.  It&#x27;s sturdy and won&#x27;t break or crack easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the CAPACITY, not the # of sprays - this will give you a good idea of how often you will need to refill it.  Since this is so small, each spray gives out very little perfume.  I would say 2-3 sprays &#x3D; 1 spray from the original fragrance bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good product overall.</li>
    <li> I had ordered 2 Flo Atomizers - 1 in pink and 1 in silver. This silver atomizer works like a charm even after months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the pink atomizer was leaking from the first day itself. The leak is from the area where the glass and the metal meet. I have tried even super glue to fix the problem but to no avail.</li>
    <li> I sorta hate filling this one up because I can&#x27;t just pump the perfume in through the nozzle, I have to spray it onto the atomizer. However, overall, I really love this product because I can just pop this in my makeup bag and it blends in with my lipsticks (though its slightly bulkier than them).</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel. Dont have to take the whole bottle. Screw it down tight, and no loss will occur. I have two in black and silver. I travel a lot.</li>
    <li> This little thing is very handy, with a built in funnel that makes it easy to fill from whatever container.  It has been in my purse for awhile now and not a hint of leakage.  The spray is even - no drips.  My only suggestion would be that they add a window that makes it a little easier to see how full it is getting while you are filling it.</li>
    <li> Filled the little thing up and took on my first trip.  Perfect is the word.  It didn&#x27;t leak and was a great travel size and I didn&#x27;t have to lug around my whole bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product recently and it is defective because it leaks. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the quality that this product offers</li>
    <li> I received this in a very shady looking packet. The moment I saw the packet I doubted if it was a genuine Flo product. The logo, packet insert and the actual atomizer all looked like the real deal though.&lt;br /&gt;Filling it was not easy, and spills occurred. However, the biggest issue was the spray nozzle. It wouldn&#x27;t spray consistently, and either stream perfume, or not spray at all. I got the Travalo instead and returned this.</li>
    <li> Filled the atomizer as per the instructions. That was easy, but when it came to the spray pump, it didn&#x27;t work.  Tried it a couple of times.  Tried it for a few days.  Nothing came out...now I won&#x27;t even return it because its filled with my Chanel No. 5.  Bottom line.  The Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer did not work as it should.</li>
    <li> I have tried other atomizers and none of them are as versatile as this one,  This one is easy to fill no matter what type of top your perfume has, Can&#x27;t wait til I get my next shipment so I can give them as gifts to my friends and family</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a week ago and have to say I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it. Totally cute design and extremely useful. Their special nozzle makes filling really easy and I just throw it inmy bag so I have my perfume with me all day. Going to buy the other colors so I can have one for each ofmy perfumes. Love it!  Great gift idea too.[[ASIN:B004V928GA Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer, 1.10 Ounce]][[ASIN:B004T19R3W Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer, 1.1 Ounce[[ASIN:B004V904J8 Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer, 1.10 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love this product. I travel lots for business and streamlining my luggage is important to me. Instead of taking a big perfume bottle I fill this up with my favourite fragrance, stick it in my wash bag and off I go.     I will continue using it and advise anyone to but it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. SInce I accidentally dropped the original bottle and broke the spray pump,  I&#x27;m glad to have this so the perfume didn&#x27;t have to go to waste!</li>
    <li> Very Cool Product.  It&#x27;s fine for travel. But it&#x27;s a little bit bigger than I expected, but it is easy to fill and the spray mechanism works well.</li>
    <li> Probably the best atomizer on the market. I was very impressed with this device.  The most innovative part of this atomizer is the silicone opening on the bottom. This lets your directly spray perfume from the bottle into the Flo atomizer. There is no need to unscrew any tricky perfume bottles and pour (though you certainly still can if needed).  Sleek, small design.  Why do you need an atomizer? Besides letting you cary small amounts of perfume with you on a trip, I find the spray action \\&quot;opens up\\&quot; some perfumes - kind of like decanting a fine wine.  Highly recommended.  Pros:  Sleek, small design  Glass bottle avoids plastic chemicals entering your perfume  Silicone opening moulds to your perfume bottle so you can refill without unscrewing anything!  Cons:  None to speak of!</li>
    <li> Very fine spray, easily loaded, very silver!</li>
    <li> It does not keep the cologne/perfume from losing its scent. No, I never left it in the heat. It was always in my briefcase under the AC. However, after many trial and errors and money spent, I finally found one that works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Needed one to refill the bad spray nozzle on my spray. Very good use travel sized spray, nothing to complain about! Everything is like advertised.</li>
    <li> Good sprayer, easy to fill, fits all kinds of bottles. No leaks in normal usage. Have three. If they came in more colors, I&#x27;d get more.</li>
    <li> Fuctionality wise great, Look wise so so.&lt;br /&gt;Fades in months and looks cheap in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for functionality\&lt;br /&gt;5 star in looks, for first couple of months&lt;br /&gt;2 star in looks for 2 months later look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man wanting a travel size cologne to carry around.  Since all the \\&quot;travel-size\\&quot; versions of cologne are still bulky, I thought I would give this a go.  It works great!  All you have to do is open up one end and spray cologne in it, close it, and it&#x27;s ready to go!  I&#x27;m really glad I got this, and it&#x27;s saving a lot of room in my toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. It spilled all over the bottle and my hand. The amount of perfume that I spilled was way more than the amount that I filled into the atomizer. I just got it today and I&#x27;m returning it today. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought Taylor Swift&#x27;s perfume a couple of months ago and one day it began spraying pure liquid instead of atomizing it into a perfume, and the make of the bottle made it impossible to remove the top. I did some searching and I found this little guy. I put the nozzle directly into the rubber bottom and began spraying the liquid into the atomizer. It&#x27;s honestly like magic, my perfume smells exactly the same even after being transferred to the FLO. If your perfume breaks don&#x27;t throw it out, just use this and you&#x27;ll be all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m not sure if this is the perfume itself or the atomizer, but when it reached the bottom of the perfume it smelled a little too much like alcohol. I refilled it straight from the perfume bottle and it returned to its normal smell. Just something to keep in mind.</li>
    <li> It does not leak and allows me to take my favorite scent with me. Arrived as described. You can even use perfume samples to fill it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this after reading the leaky reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, mine didn&#x27;t leak.  And it&#x27;s cute.</li>
    <li> This works great, is easy to fill, small enough to tuck into my purse and DOESN&#x27;T LEAK!! Worth the money for people who travel since TSA makes traveling with fragrance nearly impossible.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly like picture. Out side is some sort of metal chromed like picture, in side was plastic with a very soft rubber seals so i hope it will work a long time with out leaking or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do plan on getting another one for a gift and i would suggest and recommend it to others,</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is great to have a small spray bottle of cologne when you are out of the house instead of lugging around a large bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through two of these, thinking that the first one I bought was defective, but after having the same experience with the second one, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s an overall design flaw. I purchased this because I wanted something that I could fill up, keep in my purse, and not have to think about until I need it, but the contents will slowly leak until it&#x27;s gone after only a few days. The inside of my bag smells wonderful, but I wanted a perfume atomizer, not an air freshener for my bag. Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> purchased for my husband who is always traveling via air....&lt;br /&gt;item leaked all over the first trip. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying&lt;br /&gt;it. I tried to ignore the reviews hoping I&#x27;d be a lucky one that&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t leak. boo hoo</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift at Christmas for someone that travels a lot.  Would recommend this product to frequent travelers.</li>
    <li> Great Product, worked great!!</li>
    <li> It good for travel...but not what I intended for...I needed a bottle to put my expensive bottle of perfume in because the pump was broken...but it wasn&#x27;t large enough to hold the remainder of my perfume from the original bottle.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of filling it, it&#x27;s a perfect atomizer. Fits well in the purse, too.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this atomizer. She uses it for an aromatic room spray. She travels frequently for work and loves having this to freshen up the hotel room. It&#x27;s very easy to fill and doesn&#x27;t require funnels. You open the bottom and spray your perfume directly into the base. It has a rubber piece that your put the sprayer up to. This is especially nice if you wear a perfume that has a bottle that can&#x27;t be opened. This sprayer has never leaked in the 15 business trips my wife has taken it on.</li>
    <li> After several failed attempts, finally an atomizer that works. I originally bought an &amp;#34;easy fill&amp;#34; style that is supposed to let you quickly pump the perfume in from &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; bottle of perfume, and I quickly learned that my pump style perfume bottle was not comparable. So I went back to the old school method and it works great. Just traveled with it and no leaks. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fancy quick fills as they don&#x27;t always work with your perfume or cologne bottle.</li>
    <li> I used to carry those for travelling on airplanes, which I did in a weekly bases, and it did an excellent job. I used Travalo but unfortunately the silicon hole that is used for refilling also allowed for the perfume to evaporate and it does it FAST in the air due to the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;This can waste a bit when spraying in from the original bottle but overall it still is a much better product.</li>
    <li> I have had this for two months and have had zero problems. I use it solely for travel and have had to refill it twice so far. It seals up tight with no leaking. I have been on two domestic flights and a long range international flight. It even outlasted an exploded travel size shaving cream can. I just rinsed if off and it was as good as new. No shaving cream got under the cap or anything. Now I know why TSA requires all the liquids in a sealable bag... Product is small, light, and easy to use, though it does take two pumps to get the atomizer to really spray properly.</li>
    <li> Good product, thanks!</li>
    <li> i purchased this item but its seemed much better built quality in pictures than in hand .. its plastic with painting job on in not very good quality in hand as i thought. even when u spray it sprays smaller amount of perfume then the real bottle so i had to spray more to get to the amount of perfume i need which makes it end up early. anyhow in short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantage:&lt;br /&gt;- good to keep in pocket&lt;br /&gt;- easy to fill&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage:&lt;br /&gt;- cheap built quality considering the price&lt;br /&gt;- spray is not always reliable&lt;br /&gt;- it spills a considerable amount</li>
    <li> it is not as well made as others. It is a glass bottle and one arrived broken which they took care of.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as advertised and exactly what I was looking for.  It could only be better if it were clear and larger but does what I need.</li>
    <li> I really loved this. It was so extremely easy to fill and I loved that I was able to bring along some of my expensive perfume and not bring the entire bottle from home. I now use this in my purse as well and not just when we are traveling. Love it!</li>
    <li> Just the right size and easy to fill.  Useful for travel ( packed in checked bag).  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister, she loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought my first one because of the ability to pour fill it but in the back of my mind I thought the travelo would be a better unit. I was so wrong, I purchased a Tavelo  and the Flo works so much better. It sprays better, the fill system is just as easy and quite a bit more versatile than the Travelo. I highly recommend the Flo.</li>
    <li> I bought this product base on the average good reviews. I have found that is not really efficient, you fill it with more cologne that you can get back, maybe 30% loss or more. I have to mention also that I fill it with an atomizer bottle and not by pouring liquid on it, not sure if this has an impact. Also it doesn&#x27;t atomize, rather it just sprays with little power and in one straight shot. I&#x27;m not quite sure if there are other options out there. Also I&#x27;m not 100% about this but I have the impression that when carried in flights, it slightly leaks due to the pressure, please someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, this might not happen with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; use. In the overall I guess it&#x27;s fine, I still use it, but if I get to know about something better than this I will definitely replace it.</li>
    <li> saw an atomizer at the mall and it seemed extremely useful for my vacation, i found this on amazon and when I first used it, it worked like it supposed to, although it was a real pain to get spray cologne in it since it got all over the place even it that silicone thing. but i had left it in my car for an hour or two in the Arizona summer sun, and completely fell apart, apparently its all attached by cheap glue that breaks down with a little heat and did not last me for more than two months, if you want something that you could stick with you for a while, look elsewhere, but if you want a $10 disposable atomizer, you got this!</li>
    <li> This is a way better idea than other atomizers I&#x27;ve seen where you have to use a funnel and risk spilling expensive perfume.  The design isn&#x27;t flawless, though.  The seal where you fill the atomizer is not perfect, and I lost a little bit of perfume during filling (but just a very minor amount).  Otherwise, works perfect!</li>
    <li> this thing is a piece of crap. It is impossible to refil. Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you try to fill it, all it does is spill all over the place because they didn&#x27;t design a way for air to move out as liquids displace it.</li>
    <li> Nice little atomizer for the price; recommend</li>
    <li> Great for travel -- doesn&#x27;t leak and doesn&#x27;t take much room in my bag.  After receiving one as a gift, I purchased several for friends and family who travel.</li>
    <li> Sleek, doesn&#x27;t leak, sprays well, easy to fill. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love this as I use it for when I travel on the airlines.  Not sure what other reviewers were talking about when they say there was waste when filling this, it works perfect and no waste whatsoever.  Love the sleek design and purchased a black one and a pink one for my wife too!</li>
    <li> And after one day of use, one of them is still working but for how long who knows? One is already malfunctioning as I press down on the nozzle and it becomes stuck in the down position. I would definitely not take another chance. Buy something else.</li>
    <li> This product and the mirrors - I bought from the manufacturer itself and they suck.Leaking and unable too add perfumes. The mirror light is dead. Please don&#x27;t buy them. I paid 12 pounds for each not just dollars.</li>
    <li> It leaks!  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works well, perfect travel size, easy to fill. Perfect gift for someone who likes to keep cologne or perfume in their bag or car.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!!!! As you read the product info, you always wonder if products like this are what they describe them as.  This one is.</li>
    <li> I have been so glad that I  purchased this atomizer to take along with me in my purse, or bag.  I have used it many times.  It does not leak and it is easy to fill.</li>
