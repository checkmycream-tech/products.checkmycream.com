### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>For best results, it says to apply twice per day.</li>
      <li>I still have to fill in areas to make the perfect brow...who doesn&#x27;t at age 49?</li>
      <li>One of the best decisions EVER.</li>
      <li>AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKED BEST.</li>
      <li>hope for the best</li>
      <li>Thank you for the great serum!!</li>
      <li>I probably have the best brows I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still happy with it!</li>
      <li>Very good purchase.</li>
      <li>Amazing product and smells great too!</li>
      <li>Product may be great.  </li>
      <li>soooo incredibly happy</li>
      <li>Dont hesistate to trust purchasing this, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>I am not someone who ever writes reviews on products but this product is so amazing that I felt the need to write one!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and can honestly say: I have seen improvement!</li>
      <li>it works good.</li>
      <li>Loved this product.  </li>
      <li>but i have no problems with this product at all, and when I told them I hadn&#x27;t yet recieved it in the mail they VERY kindly sent me another one FREE OF CHARGE!</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve paid more if I&#x27;d known how effective it was!</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t get an arch anymore unless I tweeze even more and make them thinner!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The product seems okay, but the applicator does not work!  </li>
      <li>I have been using for 3 months and have amazing result.</li>
      <li>This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing</li>
      <li>So so nice.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Faithfully used for 5 months twice a day, no change of any kind.  </li>
      <li>I got this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I am older (74) and also my eyebrows are very fair and skimpy from plucking years ago when that was the style.  </li>
      <li>I suppose I should have paid more attention to the reviews here, which look great at first glance</li>
      <li>Now I feel that they just look better.</li>
      <li>Lots thicker and much more hair growth.  </li>
      <li>I will be reordering and perhaps more products from by this company.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>yayyyyy :)</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m glad</li>
      <li>Grande Brow works 100% better.</li>
      <li>I love your serum</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t know exactly what it does, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.</li>
      <li>Between my thyroid condition and the tattoo I may not be able to have return growth  with any product.  </li>
      <li>I can confidently say that I no longer use eyebrow powder to draw in my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I hope in another 6-12 weeks I will see even more growth and fuller brows.  </li>
      <li>But so far so good!</li>
      <li>but I will probably never buy again there is a product on joyus that sounds pretty good</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve struggled for years with eyebrow envy, plucking, waxing, filling them in, and- most importantly- failing to be able to grow them out.</li>
      <li>I am happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>Now I know why it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the good stuff.</li>
      <li>I was so thrilled when I got your Eyebrows SERUM Growth Accelerator that I started using your serum right away</li>
      <li>I am so excited that by the summer I will be able to have nicer, fuller eyebrows for my birthday.</li>
      <li>but the application is easy.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>just has a strong smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad some people are having success.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate their kindness and amazing service.</li>
      <li>The serum is light and not too sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face, even after a fully day.</li>
      <li>I have used serums before on my eyelashes with great results and should have stuck with the same product but for eyebrows (Rapid).</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say I got tweezer happy one day and the hair didn&#x27;t grow back for YEARS.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>This product works very well, easy to apply and my brows look MUCH better.</li>
      <li>and you get exactly what you expect :)</li>
      <li>After using the serum for about 3 months, I have noticed a significant difference in my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant, similar to a bag of bird seed or thistle.</li>
      <li>It seems to be getting results but need to use it longer to be more positive</li>
      <li>Guess it doesn&#x27;t matter much for me though since it didn&#x27;t work to make any more hair grow.</li>
      <li>I will continue using the serum until my eyebrows are full.</li>
      <li>Nothing happened after using up two full wands of this product, I could not tell one bit of difference.</li>
      <li>THIS REALLY WORKS, I HAVE TRIED MANY EYEBROW SERUMS</li>
      <li>Finished really quickly</li>
      <li>The oil seems to be for on going maintenance rather than quick growth.</li>
      <li>I never write reviews so this is legit, I&#x27;ll try to make this quick</li>
      <li>Luckily, I came across this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>The smell is s bit funky, but it fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product, I will be buying more if it runs out since I use SO much for each application!</li>
      <li>that one was worth about $20, but after reading the reviews for this i decided what the heck.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now mostly twice a day</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually quite nice for someone who enjoys that scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye brow accelerators to try and find the best one for my money, and this was truly disappointing for me.</li>
      <li>it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a product</li>
      <li>I have tried over 10 products with virtually no success, but Perfect Brows actually works.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how much my eyebrows have filled in since using this about three weeks ago!</li>
      <li>I would say that if you have become sensitive to your current product and need to find another, this would be good to try.</li>
      <li>Really work!</li>
      <li>I did have to adjust to the smell of the serum at first.</li>
      <li>The oils in the ingredients are meant to simply condition the hairs, which I&#x27;ve noticed are indeed shinier and lay better.</li>
      <li>Real review!</li>
      <li>Yeah, I&#x27;m one of those people who over-plucked their eyebrows until it couldn&#x27;t grow back any more.</li>
      <li>using it pretty faithfully for about 3 weeks...</li>
      <li>way too much product comes out at once!</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t even been using it as consistently as I should.</li>
      <li>With this serum, my brows are getting thicker and I&#x27;m finally seeing more exactly where I want it,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural and cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update soon since I&#x27;m starting to use it 3-4 times a day and let you know of any better results.</li>
      <li>I will more than likely reorder another supply.</li>
      <li>Though I do also eat healthy and exercise daily so that may also contribute.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say I got tweezer happy one day and the hair didn&#x27;t grow back for YEARS. I&#x27;m starting to see hair growth where no hair was before! This product is working slowly but surely, I&#x27;m using the product as recommended (2 times a day). I like the progress so far and will continue to use the remaining product. I, like many other people want immediate results or I&#x27;ll toss it with all the other &amp;#34;eyebrow growth&amp;#34; products. I&#x27;m liking what I&#x27;m seeing and will be patient to see its full potential. Take a chance like I did, you&#x27;ll be surprised and you get your money back guaranteed so you&#x27;re not really losing out on anything !</li>
    <li> I never write reviews so this is legit, I&#x27;ll try to make this quick, a few years ago I got my eyebrows waxed...they put the wax on my face too hot and a hole was left in the middle of my eyebrows for years and the other eyebrow they overwaxed and I permanently lost the tail of my eyebrow so stuck without a hole in one eyebrow and no half a eyebrow on the other side I was miserable...ok long story short this stuff has filled that hole with hair and given me back the tail of the other brow giving me back 2 FULL eyebrows. 5 stars 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work.  I used it for about a month, and no changes.  I couldn&#x27;t give it any longer to work because the smell was absolutely unbearable.  I wound up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> It goes on easy and does not irritate my skin.Just started so will have to wait for results.</li>
    <li> yes this product works. My eyebrows have grown back and are getting thick again. Please do not be on the fence to buy this product it really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised this product worked so well! It&#x27;s been about 2 1/2 weeks but I haven&#x27;t even been using it as consistently as I should. There&#x27;ve been times I&#x27;ve gone two days forgetting. Yet I still see a visible difference. My brows are definitely darker and thicker. Hope I remember to keep going as there was a time when my brows were so thick they covered my moles, would love to see if they can be restored to even half that much.</li>
    <li> I am seeing growth in eyebrows already. Amazing product and smells great too!</li>
    <li> Came repackaged and appeared to be rescaled. Returning.</li>
    <li> Using for a couple of weeks, no change yet. Grande Brow works 100% better.</li>
    <li> it works good. I will continue using the serum until my eyebrows are full.</li>
    <li> Used daily for 3 weeks, didn&#x27;t notice any new growth</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I applied it twice a day for a month. I have naturally thin eyebrows, so maybe it will work if your problem was overplucking.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and notice a huge difference. I had recently noticed a thinning of my eyebrows and a little bald spot in the middle of one that was driving me crazy. I was skeptical but figured based on the reviews it was worth a try. I&#x27;ve been using it like it recommends twice a day every day, and in the short time I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of growth. I don&#x27;t have the little bald spot anymore and they are filling in in areas I didn&#x27;t&#x27; think would....highly recommend this product! People I&#x27;m around daily have noticed and started purchasing this product too because I had such good results. Thank yoU!</li>
    <li> This product increase the length of my brow within 3 months.  It is gradually filling in a scar on my eyebrow but only due to increased length, not because of new growth. I&#x27;m still happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have been using for 3 months and have amazing result. Only i wonder if i quit using it, would my newly grown brows fall off? I guess we live and learn..</li>
    <li> Really work! Smells like made out of ginseng.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it claimed. At least not for me.</li>
    <li> Faithfully used for 5 months twice a day, no change of any kind.  I contact them and they replaced it along with another product.  After several months of using both twice a day, no change whatsoever.  Would never buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works, This is the 3th lube I have used</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really much of a differenceat this time, will keep using.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin eyebrows. Menopause has not helped. I was skeptical, but decided to try this.  I don&#x27;t always remember to use it consistently, but I definitely have growth where there has been none for years. I&#x27;m actually having to pluck stray hairs again. The smell is s bit funky, but it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  My brows are very thin and I saw results within days.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Got new brow hairs, but extememly sparse and unnoticible, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is working. It has been a month or so,  and while there might be a slight sign of growth, I think the results have been minimal.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, easy to apply and my brows look MUCH better.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve struggled for years with eyebrow envy, plucking, waxing, filling them in, and- most importantly- failing to be able to grow them out. I decided to fork over the $30 in hopes this product would work as everyone claimed it did. I would&#x27;ve paid more if I&#x27;d known how effective it was! Within a week I noticed hairs sprouting in, and 5 weeks later the difference is drastically incredible.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again and recommend!</li>
    <li> Sorry, doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Nothing happened after using up two full wands of this product, I could not tell one bit of difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased this is on March 1st &amp; have been using it twice daily since it arrived a couple of days later.&lt;br /&gt;If you have no eyebrows or are looking for a quick fix, I am not sure anything short of medical assistance (hair transplant, eyebrow weave, etc) is going to fix your problem.&lt;br /&gt;I started tweezing my eyebrows in the early 1990s and it got pretty crazy  - I don&#x27;t know if teenage anxiety, obsessiveness or what made me get so nuts with it, but I almost tweezed them off entirely at one point.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 25 years, and now the trend is fuller, bushier eyebrows, &amp; after years of keeping my brows lean, I am surely no Cara Delevingne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to see if it would help undo the sins of my early teen past, and I went in with low expectations as the whole product is just botanicals &amp; a form of retinol, and for around thirty bucks, you get what you pay for, so I was not going in with huge, life changing expecations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used it  twice a day for just under 6 weeks now, I have noticed there has been some growth.  My eyebrows themselves are a little (but&lt;br /&gt;noticeably) thicker, and I&#x27;m getting root &amp; hair sprouts in areas I haven&#x27;t had growth in at least 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is is a miracle worker?  No.  That&#x27;s a little strong, but if you&#x27;re looking for some oomph for your eyebrows and can commit to brushing this on twice a day, with a little time &amp; patience, it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind, you&#x27;re trying to regrow hair - that in and of itself takes time. There&#x27;s no quick fix.  There&#x27;s also no control as to where the hair wants to sprout.  I actually think I&#x27;ve regrown about twice as much eyebrow hair than I notice, because errant hairs under my brown bone &amp; outside of the ideal brow area have to be tweezed (I want stronger brows, but I am not trying to look like a crazy person or like I don&#x27;t maintain.)&lt;br /&gt;I am also trying to keep the changes subtle &amp; even between both brows; my right is taking to the growthserum better than my left, so I am careful to keep them even &amp; in check.&lt;br /&gt;The retinol component has caused me to break out a little bit in the areas I am repeatedly applying product to; nothing crazy, just a little redness/pore inflamation as hair follicles are growing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s working.  It&#x27;s not a quick fix, it&#x27;s certainly not an overnight success, and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference for about a month or so of use, but I am going to keep using it based on the benefits I have seen, &amp; I hope in another 6-12 weeks I will see even more growth and fuller brows.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any change as of yet.  Not sure if there really is a miracle solution... but gotta keep looking.</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when I got your Eyebrows SERUM Growth Accelerator that I started using your serum right away and I have noticed after even a few weeks that hair is starting to grow in. I love your serum and I will be re-ordering it again. I got this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen improvement in my brows, but I will continue and see if any improvement</li>
    <li> 3 weeks and it totally works!</li>
    <li> This works.I reordered.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have not noticed any affect on my eyebrow growth after using this product.  Perhaps it works well for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Actually does what it says! My eyebrows were very sparse. Especially the corners closest to the eyes (where it should be the fullest). It took a couple of weeks, but damn if it didn&#x27;t start filling in! Much easier to put the eye brow makeup on because there is hair there and it blends in easier.</li>
    <li> The product seems okay, but the applicator does not work!  Nothing comes out after turning numerous times, or way too much product comes out at once!</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORKS, I HAVE TRIED MANY EYEBROW SERUMS AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKED BEST.</li>
    <li> I have super thin browns due to over plucking as a teen.  I&#x27;ve curretly just finished my first tube and waiting on my second to arrive.  I could tell a big difference after a week. Lots thicker and much more hair growth.  My only con is it doesn&#x27;t last very long but a little will go a long way.  Other then that, I give this stuff and A -.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how much my eyebrows have filled in since using this about three weeks ago! IT WORKS. I just wish I had taken before and after pics to show. I went from having to pencil in most of my eyebrow, to now just swiping it a few times and blending it in with my natural brows! Awesome product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Simply doesn&#x27;t work at all. There was absolutely ZERO new growth. I didn&#x27;t pluck my brows for 4.5 weeks but I did trim a few that grew too long (pictured)</li>
    <li> This stuff started working within a week for me. I&#x27;m an esthetician and very picky about my products. I will be reordering and perhaps more products from by this company.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and can honestly say: I have seen improvement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil twice daily for one month now. The oil seems to be for on going maintenance rather than quick growth. The oils in the ingredients are meant to simply condition the hairs, which I&#x27;ve noticed are indeed shinier and lay better. Other reviews claim that there is a weird smell to the product, but it&#x27;s not weird at all. It smells pleasant, similar to a bag of bird seed or thistle. It&#x27;s actually quite nice for someone who enjoys that scent. Because this is just a small blend of basic conditioning oil, $29 seems to be an overpriced cost. If the price came down to a reasonable cost, I may be more inclined to continue usage. I&#x27;m still on the fence about whether or not I&#x27;m going to keep using the product, but since it&#x27;s only been one month and the tube is not yet empty, I will finish out the oil and see how I feel about reordering then.</li>
    <li> I love it! This really works.  I have to use it twice a day and  in just 2 or 3 weeks after using this Serum I noticed hair growth.  I don&#x27;t have to use much eyebrow liner much at all anymore.</li>
    <li> I am not someone who ever writes reviews on products but this product is so amazing that I felt the need to write one! I purchased this about 2 months ago and about half a month ago I purchased another one...my eyebrows have been growing so nicely and so much to the point where I don&#x27;t need to use the product everyday! This product is amazing and I definetly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. you have to be patient as it takes about a month to see results and you have to use it every day but it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this stuff. I have used serums before on my eyelashes with great results and should have stuck with the same product but for eyebrows (Rapid). I have been applying this religiously morning and evening for a month with no effect whatsoever. I suppose I should have paid more attention to the reviews here, which look great at first glance but if you read carefully you will see a lot of repeat rave reviews which are identical and posted under different names. Such a shame because I really believed this product would work. I will keep trying for another couple of weeks and report back if I notice any change. So far though, this seems to have been a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> After nearly 3 weeks of using am starting to see some growth - hope it continues.  Easy to use and if you have sparse eyebrows give this product a try.  I will more than likely reorder another supply.</li>
    <li> using it pretty faithfully for about 3 weeks...(no change yet).... gonna keep trying....  hope for the best</li>
    <li> After years of sparse brows (that I thought would never grow in) this product actually worked for me.</li>
    <li> It seems to be getting results but need to use it longer to be more positive</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now mostly twice a day and I&#x27;ve seen very little hair growth if any it is too late to return I will continue to use product until gone but I will probably never buy again there is a product on joyus that sounds pretty good I&#x27;ll probly buy next time.</li>
    <li> I do think it&#x27;s helping. I have been using this about just over a month maybe? And I have had a few more hair growths :) I think this product helps speed up the process, because one day I will see one hair just sprouting, and then a day later it will be noticibly MUCH longer already! Though I do also eat healthy and exercise daily so that may also contribute. but i have no problems with this product at all, and when I told them I hadn&#x27;t yet recieved it in the mail they VERY kindly sent me another one FREE OF CHARGE! So so nice. I really appreciate their kindness and amazing service. Dont hesistate to trust purchasing this, it&#x27;s a great product and you get exactly what you expect :)</li>
    <li> Argghh gave me cystic pimples along my brows.. not good product :-(</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this serum really does work. This is not a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; review. I have been using this twice daily for two and a half months. I have noticed that my eyebrow hair has become longer and thicker. There has also been new growth! I still have to fill in areas to make the perfect brow...who doesn&#x27;t at age 49? Now I feel that they just look better. I have taken pictures before and after. The serum has allowed me to pluck, trim and give my brows some real shape. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> These products give my really bad red bumps in my eyebrows, they burn and irritated my whole eyebrows.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i didn&#x27;t get any result.. At all.😖</li>
    <li> Thought this product would be better than the other type I use.  It wasn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ve begun using my old stuff.  I would say that if you have become sensitive to your current product and need to find another, this would be good to try.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am seeing the results. I combined this with the brow enhancer by Anastasia and I am seeing the results!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell, have been using for two weeks. Seems to be filling in. Will have to update.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for us - tried for over 60 days.</li>
    <li> I just started using it but the application is easy.  For best results, it says to apply twice per day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye brow accelerators to try and find the best one for my money, and this was truly disappointing for me. I was so hoping that it would work good because of the money that I&#x27;d be saving compared to others, but the expensive stuff indeed is worth it compared to spending $30 for no results. I put this on twice/day and never saw much difference at all?  The applicator looks cool, but makes it difficult to place in a fine line and not get in areas you may not want to grow hair. Guess it doesn&#x27;t matter much for me though since it didn&#x27;t work to make any more hair grow.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing, and I don’t usually write reviews on products that I buy. I was eagerly looking for a product which would contain only natural ingredients and would be very efficient at the same time. I tried many different products, expensive and not expensive one. After just first few applications, I noticed a difference immediately, and my eyebrows have been feeling more moisturized than ever before.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long, but the formula and application process is just as I expected.  Takes a few minutes for the solution to dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a month now and I have not seen any results, my eyebrows are the same they have not gotten any thicker at all.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrendous.</li>
    <li> Been using faithfully in hopes of some growth.  Product may be great.  Between my thyroid condition and the tattoo I may not be able to have return growth  with any product.  Will continue trying</li>
    <li> The fact that it is natural and soothing on the eyebrows is just so lovely, I cannot live without it. It’s growing back more naturally and healthier than before. The serum is light and not too sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face, even after a fully day. Actually as a matter of fact, it actually soaks into my skin underneath my eyebrow, moisturizing it and recharging the cell. Although I don&#x27;t know exactly what it does, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen an improvement</li>
    <li> No effect. Just used one or two week, and then no serum comes out.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work for me :/</li>
    <li> Finished really quickly and I did not notice a difference unfortunately at all... Totally not worth the price packaging looks very generic like it was made it home</li>
    <li> it is broken and the brush is loose and i cannot apply the serum to my eyebrows because the brush is hiden in the tube and there is no way I can get the serum unless i shake it like really hard and use the little serum left on the end of the tube！but it is not supposed to work that way and it costs 35，i am very disappointed to this product and to Amazon！</li>
    <li> I tried it, I waited and nothing happened. I am asian with relatively thin eyebrow hair, if that helps anyone with their purchase.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all for my naturally thin brows.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow serum does not work for me. It didn&#x27;t give me any eyebrow growth whatsoever. I found that it made me break out in my eyebrows. I have only used one other eyebrow serum in the past - Revitabrow which made my eyebrow hairs longer but didn&#x27;t give me more eyebrow hairs which was what I was looking for. I will have to see what else is out there.</li>
    <li> I started using it 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m noticing hair growth just now, gotta be patient. It definitely will take some time. I have also tried Rapid Lash serum, it took forever &amp; hairs grew in different directions for some reason. With this serum, my brows are getting thicker and I&#x27;m finally seeing more exactly where I want it, right in the middle. Also, both of them did grow out longer. I am hoping it will get nice and thick just like in my teens, before I ruined them. But so far so good! Thank you for the great serum!!</li>
    <li> I just received mine and the serum may work, haven&#x27;t had enough time to use it, but the dispenser is a different story. You have to turn the clicker at least 5 times before anything comes out, then it won&#x27;t stop until and there is a bunch of wasted product. I will be returning and trying the other version.</li>
    <li> really works, use it everyday have seen growth very satified</li>
    <li> Only 2 days in so I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but the scent is really strong and pretty bad. If you are sensitive to smells beware!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Now I know why it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m one of those people who over-plucked their eyebrows until it couldn&#x27;t grow back any more. In fact, I plucked them super thin because it was the &#x27;thing&#x27; to do back in the 90&#x27;s. When I decided to grow out my eyebrows.. well, it was too late. I went a year without plucking my eyebrows and nothing grew back. NADA. ZIP. ZERO. So I looked online for things to do to help my eyebrows grow. I tried the whole &#x27;castor oil&#x27; thing and gave up after a month. I did not like the upper part of my face being oily and having to wash my pillowcases more frequently because the oil would rub off of my face. Luckily, I came across this product and decided to give it a try. Within 2 weeks of religiously using this product, I saw results. I can confidently say that I no longer use eyebrow powder to draw in my eyebrows. I suspect that within a few more weeks while using this product, I can probably reshape my eyebrows (which is my main goal). Anyways, if you need a product that can guarantee eyebrow hair growth, you&#x27;ve got to get this product! THIS WORKS! Of course, I&#x27;d recommend that you apply as directed (twice a day) and you must continue doing this until you achieve your results. I&#x27;ve attached my 2 month progress on this product in my review for you to see. Thanks Green Touch Beauty!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, after using it religiously for three weeks, I saw no improvement whatsoever.  Sending back.</li>
    <li> It started helping my brows until I bought a second bottle, which was packaged differently and the ingredient list became four times longer. I think the product changed. It appeared to be a different in thickness and color. I didn&#x27;t get the same results as the first bottle. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I cannot rate because so far I have seen no result</li>
    <li> Seems to be making a real difference.</li>
    <li> This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I had such terrible, crooked brows that I used to even pencil my brows before going to sleep. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things to try to stimulate some growth to my eyebrows and nothing. I randomly came across this product and I just thought why not? One of the best decisions EVER. After using the serum for about 3 months, I have noticed a significant difference in my eyebrows. The brow that was pretty much half missing has grown in to the point where I&#x27;m comfortable enough to go outside without having to do my eyebrows. Also, this product is a lot. I keep expecting to run out with the amount I&#x27;ve been using, but this little bottle continues to serve me well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey, but definitely helps with the growth.  i have bought it several times, as i always mess up my eyebrows and need to grow them back in.  it&#x27;s not harsh or anything, as i have sensitive skin.  i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Come on it&#x27;s so obvious most of these reviews are FAKE! Take a look at the names. What a joke. I didn&#x27;t buy this stuff but I bet it&#x27;s crap. Use some castor oil. It&#x27;s natural and cheap.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are the same and it smells weird.</li>
    <li> This does seem to work after a period of time.  Tried it a few weeks and saw no difference but after advice from someone, tried it again for 30 days and seems to be working on my thin light blond eyebrows.  They are darker and growing in thicker.</li>
    <li> I am so frustrated!  This was delivered to me in a timely fashion but it does not pump any contents to the brush!  I finally was able to get a very small amount out after turning no less than fifty times.  A big disappointment.....</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product yet. Will know in a couple of weeks when or if eyebrows get thicker</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I can hardly believe that I actually have eyebrows growing.  I have tried over 10 products with virtually no success, but Perfect Brows actually works.  I am older (74) and also my eyebrows are very fair and skimpy from plucking years ago when that was the style.  I probably have the best brows I have ever had.  TRY IT!.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my eyebrows growing and are darker than normal so I am assuming it works. I am happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really notice anything yet....</li>
    <li> A definite improvement, my eyebrows look fuller.</li>
    <li> In just a couple of weeks, the serum has strengthened the hairs of my brows. I use it twice a day and am seeing some positive changes in my eyebrows. I did have to adjust to the smell of the serum at first.</li>
    <li> Have to twist to get product sometimes 5-6 times.  Not noticing any difference in brow at all.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> The product has a displeasing odor.  Not sure.  Maybe I got an out of date product.  Checking with the seller.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever. I gave it a chance it doesn&#x27;t work just has a strong smell. Other products are much better.</li>
    <li> Real review! Just so you know, I purchased this using my boyfriend&#x27;s Amazon account. First of all, I want to say that I paid for this product with my own money, $35, and I could not justify the price other than the slim chance it could work. And I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a girl who went to get my eyebrows threaded every 2-3 weeks as they recommended, and then tweezed anything else I didn&#x27;t like. This made my eyebrows very thin and I no longer have an arch. Not only that, but I can&#x27;t get an arch anymore unless I tweeze even more and make them thinner! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a month. It is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;At first, it smells horrible. But after a few applications, I got used to the smell and now it&#x27;s just odd but not horrible. Each time I apply, I twist the cap about 3-4 times to get a lot of product on each brow. I do this twice daily. I have noticed hairs growing in places where they NO LONGER GREW! It really works. My eyebrows are getting fuller and in places where hair just stopped growing, new hairs are growing AND getting longer each day. I am so excited that by the summer I will be able to have nicer, fuller eyebrows for my birthday. I highly recommend this product. I have seen some reviews that it doesn&#x27;t work and maybe they don&#x27;t apply it twice daily, or use enough, or maybe it just simply doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. But I am very light skinned with dark, coarse hair and it worked for me. I really recommend this product, I will be buying more if it runs out since I use SO much for each application! I recommend applying the product to areas near your brow where hair doesn&#x27;t grow anymore, where it&#x27;s just your bare skin! I apply it on my actual brows and then a little above and a little below and voila, hair is growing!&lt;br /&gt;5 star product. I stand behind it 100%. I couldn&#x27;t get hair to grow this much on my eyebrows no matter what else I tried, including castor oil.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as regularly as I should, and still think it&#x27;s working. For the first time in a couple of years, I often look in the mirror and notice I am ready for a threading. I don&#x27;t think it is creating growth where there is none, but rather thickening and darkening where there is some.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results, and it appeared to run out relatively quickly (less than a month). I recommend just buying neubrow for the extra $25 bucks and getting your money&#x27;s worth. This product was a joke! Even the packaging looked suspect</li>
    <li> It has not worked for my brows but I&#x27;m glad some people are having success. I&#x27;ll update soon since I&#x27;m starting to use it 3-4 times a day and let you know of any better results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have much faith that this would work at all, but was really surprised. I used it faithfully for an entire month, and was just about to give up when I looked (really) closely in the mirror. There were tiny little hairs growing! Unfortunately, some were gray, but they are there. It&#x27;s rare to find a product the works just like they say it does. Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> soooo incredibly happy i took a chance on this product. i had been using another eyebrow serum for a couple of months in the hopes of growing back some spotty areas that were the results of stress picking but to no avail :( that one was worth about $20, but after reading the reviews for this i decided what the heck. my eyebrow spots were fully growth in within the week, no joke. same color (already dark) and everything, but hairs where i haven&#x27;t seen any in a couple of years now. that means less of a need to use brow pencils. yayyyyy :)</li>
