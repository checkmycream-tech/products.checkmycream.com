      <li>CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>

      <li>I think the big corps bought it up and decided that If It Were Thinner.......they would make more money!  </li>
      <li>We used this for many month; however, it is becoming harder to find or is increasing in cost so were are looking for alternatives that work as well..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great, natural way to rehydrate dry skin.  </li>

      <li>Very timely and quick service.  </li>
      <li>We have been using Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk for years and it consistently delivers everything we&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
      <li>Makes my old hands feel and look smooth.</li>
      <li>Very nice medium to thick lotion.</li>
      <li>, i guess it can help me go through the whole winter.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is suppose to be much thicker than what it is.</li>
      <li>Covers well and absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
      <li>Lotion performs well and is very soothing</li>
      <li>I rarely return things, but this one went right back.</li>
      <li>I cannot say for certain it was the goat&#x27;s milk lotion and body wash but nothing else in my life was new or changed.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend for yourself of as a gift.</li>
      <li>I stopped using the lotion right away, but the allergy still didn&#x27;t calm down.</li>
      <li>I find the original scent to be refreshing (and perhaps a bit nostalgic too.)  </li>
      <li>Sensitive skin?</li>
      <li>It turned out a complete disaster.</li>
      <li>This one was so much thinner than those I used in prior years.</li>
      <li>I order the natural scent lotion and the bath wash.  </li>
      <li>All natural.  </li>
      <li>At first, it smells strange.</li>
      <li>people have said they don&#x27;t like the smell of the natural scent.  </li>
      <li>We buy it in bulk whenever possible and keep the unused portions in the fridge till were ready to open a new bottle.</li>
      <li>It is our favorite, and getting harder and harder to find in local stores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try something new next time.</li>
      <li>I really thought my dry skin was over?  </li>
      <li>the next morning, my faced was covered with red rashes, very itchy.</li>
      <li>Slight fragrance - fresh and powdery.  </li>
      <li>Frankly, the smell of the lotion can only be described as \\&quot;an old person\\&quot; smell.</li>
      <li>it help a little, maybe I will add a little more to it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this lotion...but to be honest the scent was just awful!</li>
      <li>I moisturize, and so far this winter, no problems with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase the &#x27;all natural&#x27; Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk lotion for my dry skin.  </li>

<li> Can&#x27;t quite place what it is other than what another reviewer described as an old lady smell.</li>
<li> I do find that I need to apply it more than twice a day in the winter with all the dry air and frequent hand-washing, which is more often than I used to with other commercial brands, but then they had all sorts of nasty chemicals in them too.</li>

<li> I bought this lotion because of winter dry skin.  </li>
<li> Hands are a bit dry in the cold and dry months, especially if washing them frequently, but typically find only a cream or something like this used multiple times a day can keep up with that.</li>

<li> Never a better body lotion made.</li>
<li> Worry No More!  </li>
<li> My daughter suffers from eczema and really dry skin.</li>
<li> I use this every day without fail.</li>
<li> Although the lotion itself is thick and absorbs well, it smells terrible in my opinion.</li>
<li> I can use it all over without that awful greasy feeling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I started using this I really thought my dry skin was over?  Then a couple of orders later I noticed it was thinner?  The last time I used it .....It Was THINNER YET. I love this product in its original form.  I think the big corps bought it up and decided that If It Were Thinner.......they would make more money!  It is a shame what is happening with these really great products.  When I started using the same brand body wash......It went from Very Thick......to water thin.  I&#x27;m going to try something new next time.</li>
    <li> My daughter suffers from eczema and really dry skin. Many products intended for that sting her. One or two uses and her eczema is healed. I can not say enough good things about this product. I recommend Canus bar soap as well!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very moisturizing without being greasy.  Moisture lasts all day.  Slight fragrance - fresh and powdery.  This lotion also provides a nice relief for a sunburn, too.</li>
    <li> Non greasy lotion that is good for you.  All natural.  Does a great job and  doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy or slippery.  It smells great and not overpowering.  This paired with the milk bath are perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always searching for a thick, natural, organic lotion. And this lotion is a little bit of both. Problem is, I don&#x27;t feel moisturized throughout the day. It smells great and absorbs into the skin quickly, but after a couple hours, my skin doesn&#x27;t look hydrated. I don&#x27;t appear to be ashy, nor does my skin itch, but I don&#x27;t have the glow that other lotions give me after application.</li>
    <li> Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;dissolves into the skin rapidly&lt;br /&gt;leaves no noticeable residue&lt;br /&gt;moisturizes beautifully&lt;br /&gt;beautiful fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve placed bottles of it by all the sinks in the house, so after I wash my hands I moisturize, and so far this winter, no problems with dry skin.  I like it.</li>
    <li> After using this lotion, I promise you won&#x27;t use anything else.  Rubs right in and smells great.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews, I decided to purchase the &#x27;all natural&#x27; Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk lotion for my dry skin.  Although the lotion itself is thick and absorbs well, it smells terrible in my opinion. Frankly, the smell of the lotion can only be described as \\&quot;an old person\\&quot; smell.

To reiterate, the lotion does its job for dry skin, but won&#x27;t leave you smelling &#x27;nice&#x27;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest lotion. Feels rather watery. I won&#x27;t repurchase. The smell is alright but overall doesn&#x27;t improve, soften skin noticeably.</li>
    <li> I love putting on Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Lotion because I know that there are no parabens or petroleum based products involved in the making of it. It&#x27;s a great, natural way to rehydrate dry skin.  I find the original scent to be refreshing (and perhaps a bit nostalgic too.)  I do find that I need to apply it more than twice a day in the winter with all the dry air and frequent hand-washing, which is more often than I used to with other commercial brands, but then they had all sorts of nasty chemicals in them too.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. My friend recommended this product to me. It turned out a complete disaster. Three day ago I got the lotion and used it on my face. the next morning, my faced was covered with red rashes, very itchy. I haven&#x27;t had skin allergy for years. This is the worst allergy in my life. I stopped using the lotion right away, but the allergy still didn&#x27;t calm down. rashes are still there and the itching keeps me up at night.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this lotion...but to be honest the scent was just awful! Even after washing it off I still had this extremely flowery / powdery smell on me. I rarely return things, but this one went right back.</li>
    <li> We have used Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk for years.  It is our favorite, and getting harder and harder to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever found. Non greasy and wonderful scent. Makes my old hands feel and look smooth. I can use it all over without that awful greasy feeling. Also it helps with the winter itchy skin.</li>
    <li> it smells good and quickly absorbed by skin, its good! and it is really a big one, i guess it can help me go through the whole winter.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift; and this was a great gift..came right on time for Christmas&lt;br /&gt;The price was perfect&lt;br /&gt;MMHelgert</li>
    <li> We used this for many month; however, it is becoming harder to find or is increasing in cost so were are looking for alternatives that work as well..</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I bought it originally because it was PH balanced and free of Parabens, phosphates and Sodium Lauryl Sulfates. To top it off, it is not tested on animals. The fragrance is good. Even my husband likes it. It is not too frou frou.</li>
    <li> Never a better body lotion made. Super Super lotion.. light and not too greasy.  The pump is wonderful with the lotion lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> There is a nice balance, not too watery, not too greasy.  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t disappear or stay sticky.</li>
    <li> I think this is some of the best lotion you can use for both male and females.  It doesn&#x27;t have an oily finish and soaks in quickly to get dressed.</li>
    <li> Lives up to claims 100%.  Moisturizing PLUS, that saturates and lasts.  Sensitive skin? Worry No More!  I am definitely a commited user.</li>
    <li> Very nice medium to thick lotion. Covers well and absorbs fast. Non-greasy. It is a lotion, not a cream, so I don&#x27;t know that it is suppose to be much thicker than what it is. Used daily after showering. Can keep up skin&#x27;s moisture level most of the year. Hands are a bit dry in the cold and dry months, especially if washing them frequently, but typically find only a cream or something like this used multiple times a day can keep up with that. Would purchase again other than the scent. Can&#x27;t quite place what it is other than what another reviewer described as an old lady smell. Slightly musty, wildflower-ish. One of the better &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lotions. Very good price for this size lotion.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because of winter dry skin.  It did not help my skin at all I still have itchy skin after use.  I added extra virgin olive oil to it. it help a little, maybe I will add a little more to it.</li>
    <li> I order the natural scent lotion and the bath wash.  These two products are nothing but wonders.  I have psoriasis but can&#x27;t  take any more steroids.  I&#x27;ve used these two Canus products for less than two weeks and yesterday I noticed the psoriasis is fading and going into remission.  I cannot say for certain it was the goat&#x27;s milk lotion and body wash but nothing else in my life was new or changed.  I may have a better idea if the psoriasis returns but I don&#x27;t want that opportunity.  I will not stop using these products because the psoriasis is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said they don&#x27;t like the smell of the natural scent.  To bad, I find it a nice subtle scent.</li>
    <li> I use this every day without fail. Delicately fragrand ,ultimately moisturizing, this is a must have in my beauty routine. The lotion is not greasy but keeps the moisture in my skin.Love it and would and have recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion I have ever used.  Iwill definately order it again, and have gave it for gifts also</li>
    <li> The light scent is amazing and it made my skin feel soft and hydrated! Would highly recommend for yourself of as a gift.</li>
    <li> It absorbs well and makes your skin better. At first, it smells strange. But now I like that smell. It is awsome!</li>
    <li> thanks for your great service really appreciate it.  Very timely and quick service.  Lotion performs well and is very soothing</li>
    <li> This product aids in healing not just moisturizing (which it does great too). We have been using Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk for years and it consistently delivers everything we&#x27;ve come to expect. Love the mild fragrance too. We buy it in bulk whenever possible and keep the unused portions in the fridge till were ready to open a new bottle.</li>
    <li> For years I used this brand of lotion. This one was so much thinner than those I used in prior years. I like my lotions creamy and nice. Will not purchase again.</li>
