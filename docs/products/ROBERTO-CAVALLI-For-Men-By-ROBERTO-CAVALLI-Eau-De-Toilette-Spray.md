      <li>I smelled this on a co-worker in November of 2011 and fell in love \\&quot;with the scent\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>My husband liked that one as well and quickly used it up.&lt;br</li>

      <li>The cologne is good, but my main complaint is that the damn cologne took too long to arrive.</li>

      <li>Not sure if this is an original.</li>
      <li>love the fragrance as it lasts a long time but is also subtle (not overpowering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone</li>

    <li> There is no much people out there know about Roberto Cavalli  You would be the only ONE!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but from the listing I expected more--very little smell/scent even with four sprays. I was dismayed about the nonreturnibilty. Useless-truely a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The cologne is good, but my main complaint is that the damn cologne took too long to arrive. What a horrible customer service provided by Amazon... Why im not surprised???!</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a co-worker in November of 2011 and fell in love \\&quot;with the scent\\&quot;. I asked him what it was as I wanted to get it for my husband for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I looked and looked but could not find it.&lt;br /&gt;I found one similar by Robert Cavalli that was nice but not as nice as this. My husband liked that one as well and quickly used it up.&lt;br /&gt;I went here on Amazon and low and behold I found what I had previously been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It just arrived and I opened it immeadiatly to make sure that was the one.&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOSH!!! I SWOONED!!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that came to mind was...\\&quot;There is no way I&#x27;m letting my husband out of the house with this on alone or with out me!\\&quot; LOL!</li>
    <li> very good product. good price, good aroms and exclusive. you dont have to go to cavallis store to get it.</li>
    <li> I first experienced this frangrance on a relative and i began to inquire about where it was purchased. I have never smelled anything so fresh and withstanding so i had to have it. After receiving my bottle of Roberto Cavalli i immediatly began to wear it, every place i went. I get so many compliments on the fragrance which makes me feel good. I now tell everyone to go to amazon.com to purchase this product at a good price. I Love It!!!.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell the same, as the smaller one I bought from macy&#x27;s. Not sure if this is an original.</li>
    <li> very disapointed with the name....you could create your own at home and it will smell better that this....</li>
    <li> The price at Amazon was amazing, where as other sites the price neared $70.00 here I was able to get it for &amp;#60;$30.00.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance as it lasts a long time but is also subtle (not overpowering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone will definitely notice it if they are in close proximity (hug distance) but won&#x27;t bother anyone at normal conversational distance.

    <li> smells good and fresh, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they don&#x27;t last long impregnated in your body.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about getting this via amazon but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else and it has always been one of my husbands staple colognes. We were happy to find that wasn&#x27;t a knock off. Very please with the purchase. Price was great!</li>
    <li> Very nice I bought this as a gift and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
    <li> I love cavelli and the smell of this cologne is great. Plus I got it at a good price. I still use it after two years.</li>
    <li> As a cologne hound, this one is one of my favorites in the Cavalli line. It smells really exquisite without being obtrusive and my wife loves it whether I wear it to work or out on the town.</li>
    <li> This colgne is sexy and has a light clean scent to it. Great for a day of play or a night of romance!</li>
