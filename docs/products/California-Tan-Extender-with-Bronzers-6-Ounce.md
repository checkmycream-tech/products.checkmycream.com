    <li> Just the same at what you get at the salon but for half the price!</li>
    <li> i was disappointed by this product.  says it has bronzers but clearly doesnt. didnt last long compared to other lotions i like. waste of money</li>
    <li> This tan extender by far beats all the others I have tried. It smells good and leaves your skin nourished, along with helping extend your tan. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the product line!</li>
    <li> This is a great daily lotion to keep your tan looking good.  It is also great in the winter when you want just a little something to take the &amp;#34;glare&amp;#34; off.  It will not make you dark - just a little warmer skin toned.  And it does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year. I originally bought it at the tanning salon, for a pretty penny. It smells great, which is a plus for me. Any self tan, bronzing products have a terrible smell to me. This smells great, and never gets that nasty self tanner scent.</li>
    <li> Love the gradual tan it creates when I&#x27;m not spray tanning regularly.  This also helps my spray tan appear more even as it is fading.  Love the smell as well.  The price is half the cost at the salon.</li>
    <li> Great product, performs as stated</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Love this in the summer. I can&#x27;t get in the sun so I use a &amp;#34;fake tanner&amp;#34; and this in between. Nice smell. Tricks me into thinking I&#x27;m at the beach. Keeps &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; longer and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Just not really impressed in it keeping or lengthening the color of my tan. Would not buy again. Not worth the $$$$</li>
    <li> this brand is great , a must have for tanners and fake tanners , this product works great , it does extend the life of your tan</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing lotion with the benefit of a hint of self-tanner.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming tanner smell, which makes it even better.  Bought it at my tanning salon for almost triple the price I found on Amazon and the products are the same.</li>
    <li> Great product, helps enhance color plus, iprevents your tan from fading.</li>
    <li> It smells good and goes on smooth without smearing. It helps to moisturize my spray on tan which is great. It has a great color and doesn&#x27;t turn me orange. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> love it - works best if you already have a nice base tan</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot, but wish it was a bigger size to last longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product inside the bottle is the same as what is sold in tanning salons but it is way cheaper. The price is good and the lotion smells nice. Although, it tends to dry out your skin. I notice a few hours after I apply the lotion, it feels like I need more. I don&#x27;t notice the bronzer&#x27;s either. The lotion tint is not as dark as I was expecting. Compared to VersaSpa Tan Extender Lotion (which I also own), it does not compare. I, in the future, will probably spend more $ on the VersaSpa brand products because you get what you pay for. If you are tight on money, this product is a good replacement because it is half the price. It definately beats store bought brands of tinted moisterizers because it doesn&#x27;t contain Mineral Oil, which can streak spray tans. As for a seller review, product arrived fast and had no problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion to extend my spray tans for over a year now, and I love this one. It smells great and does seem to extend my tan for at least 2 days.

    <li> I like this after-sunless lotion....does just fine for me and I&#x27;m a guy....not going to pay huge bucks to buy something else....well pleased and will buy more</li>
    <li> First time ordered, and they were very fast, efficient received product before estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely use them to place another order when needed.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment, love product have used it before but never was able to purchase it as cheap! Best pricing I have found so far. Wrong product was actually shipped to me but company caught it before I even received it and was able to send correct product out just as quick! Even gave free gift for inconvenience!!!

    <li> I really does help to extend your spray tan!</li>
    <li> Very nice product to extend the life of your spray or lotion tan.  smells great.  leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great. Perfect for any type of tanning, even sunless. Price is half of what you would pay in a tanning salon.</li>
