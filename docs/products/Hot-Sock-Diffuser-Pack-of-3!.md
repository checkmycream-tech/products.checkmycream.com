    <li> Great for traveling.  Like it better than typical diffuser.  Fits almost any size blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair looked exactly like my hair dresser did my hair when I used this! Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!</li>
    <li> Love these diffusers!  Perfect if you travel and need a diffuser. Easy to pack with out bulk or weight. Girls with curls...you should try this!  Works better than my full size diffuser! It dries my hair with out a lot of air motion which can cause frizz vs curl.  The company selling these is fantastic to work with as well!</li>
    <li> Perfect to travel with. Fits on hotel dryers. Works great as a diffuser and is inexpensive. It&#x27;s the only attachment I need.</li>
    <li> Great to take with me when I travel!  Fits every hair dryer in the hotel and spares me from taking up 1/2 my luggage with my hair dryer and diffuser.</li>
    <li> hot socks arrived a couple of days after I order and they are wonderful for travel. Saves a lot of room in your travel bag and will fit on that hotel blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Had one for years and lost it. They are great as they fit most if not all dryers. One for the gym bag, one for the travel bag. Works as they should</li>
    <li> My wife loves these. They last a couple of years, depending on the diameter of the hair dryer you&#x27;re wrapping them around.  They are perfect for gently drying her curly hair; she won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> this is the best. i have been using these for years and so glad they still make them. it helps keep your hair curly without the frizz! i have an extra on hand just in case one of mine rips.....but they do last for years!</li>
    <li> This does not stay on the dryer so it does not work for the purpose I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a suggestion - require less words and probably have more feedback.</li>

    <li> Diffuser allows for more controlled blow drying without adding frizz. Perfect hair every time!</li>
    <li> These are the best diffusers!! I have been using then for about 10 years. They are great for travel and they fit any hair dryer. They dry my hair quickly without frizz and stay on my dryer. Love these!</li>
    <li> Works ok but it has blown off of my hair dryer during use. May have to put a rubber band or something around it to make sure it stays on my hair dryer.</li>
