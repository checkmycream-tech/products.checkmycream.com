      <li>Im wearing that smells so good!</li>
      <li>Great day perfume.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for many years, and continue to receive compliments on how good I &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this through Amazon the Seller is called \\&quot;The Perfume Club\\&quot; and it arrived promptly within 3 days and in good condition.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the product!</li>
      <li>my favorite scent ever!</li>
      <li>It is simply the best perfume  I have ever worn.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I love this scent have been using it for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>I payed $67 thinking it was better than $110 in the store.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic  to most perfumes but this one I can wear.  </li>
      <li>This is nothing more than water in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>I give this perfume 5 Stars,  I love it.  </li>
      <li>I cannot think of a more appealing way to smell.</li>
      <li>The scent is there just not as potent.</li>
      <li>And, for people who may be allergic to perfumes, you can confidently wear this parfum around them without them experiencing any reactions.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Soft almost powdery scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, great for work if in an office setting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice fresh clean scent that is not powdery.  </li>
      <li>You will enjoy a shower feel throughout the day without having to experience an overbearance of cologne.  </li>
      <li>but the scent will last all day great spring and summer fragrance.</li>
      <li>It smells so light</li>
      <li>This smells great, but for a parfum spray.. it should last a lot longer.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume, light and fresh.</li>
      <li>I love this so much, and yes, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for many years, too.</li>
      <li>It has a very clean fresh linen/soapy scent.  </li>
      <li>It smells light and clean like bubble bath.  </li>
      <li>It is not overwhelming and is perfect to wear to work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or cloying--a light, pretty fragrance  that lasts nicely.</li>
      <li>Carriere is a lovely and soft clean smelling fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this spritz in the closet to keep hanging clothes smelling fresh as well.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Be aware that scent are not returnable though; it&#x27;s pretty spendy.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance, but the spayer doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
      <li>A new favorite since Pure Grace is getting scarce, but it certainly isn&#x27;t strong our long lasting.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter all that much, as I just rub it in.</li>
      <li>Received product fast.</li>
      <li>If you need a real noticeable scent, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
      <li>Unlike Pure Grace, Carriere is made from extremely high quality ingredients that do not irritate my allergies or induce migraines.</li>
      <li>But it will keep the wearer smelling clean all day long.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a new, light signature similar to Pure Grace with a hint of green grass, this one is worth a try.  </li>
      <li>But after dry down it becomes more unique like clean sundried dry linen or high quality triple milled French soap.</li>
      <li>I am using more than I used to because the scent or smell doesn&#x27;t last as with the previous.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Carriere is subtle yet sexy.</li>
      <li>I am just surprised that the new bottle has lesser potency than the frosted bottle.</li>
      <li>This Fragrance initially smells similar to Pure Grace, by Philosophy.</li>
      <li>A great product that unfortunately has been discontinued in other retail locations.</li>
      <li>It may make a nice clean base paired with a Lemon Verbena or Orange Blossom Fragrance during the Summer Months.</li>
      <li>It is definitely not going to reach out and grab passing people with any loud florals or gourmand sweetness.</li>
      <li>Occasionally I try something new, but I always come back to this one.</li>
      <li>It is fresh, not strong</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this scent.  It&#x27;s a nice fresh clean scent that is not powdery.  It is not overwhelming and is perfect to wear to work.</li>
    <li> I love this scent have been using it for more than 10 years. I am just surprised that the new bottle has lesser potency than the frosted bottle. I am using more than I used to because the scent or smell doesn&#x27;t last as with the previous. I end up using half a bottle in less than a month. The scent is there just not as potent. Thank you Amazon for working with me as you sent me another bottle because I called about it. I would still give the perfume a five star as well as your service.</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for at least 10 years. Occasionally I try something new, but I always come back to this one. I get compliments constantly when I wear it. It&#x27;s not heavy or cloying--a light, pretty fragrance  that lasts nicely.</li>
    <li> ...fragrance has no scent - very disappointed</li>
    <li> Everything as promised</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume to layer with the body cream.  It smells so light but the scent will last all day great spring and summer fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have run out of this, a month before Christmas.  I&#x27;m now buying it for myself because I cannot bear to be out of it!  Nor can I bear wearing anything else.  I love this so much, and yes, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for many years, too.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this fragrance</li>
    <li> my favorite scent ever!</li>
    <li> Carriere is a lovely and soft clean smelling fragrance.  You will enjoy a shower feel throughout the day without having to experience an overbearance of cologne.

    <li> This smells great, but for a parfum spray.. it should last a lot longer. Seems like it&#x27;s just scented water.</li>
    <li> I give this perfume 5 Stars,  I love it.  It is simply the best perfume  I have ever worn.  It is fresh, not strong and I get compliments all the time from strangers and family as to what Im wearing that smells so good!</li>
    <li> I am allergic  to most perfumes but this one I can wear.  It has a nice clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> A new favorite since Pure Grace is getting scarce, but it certainly isn&#x27;t strong our long lasting.  If you need a real noticeable scent, this isn&#x27;t it.

    <li> purfume had no scent.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for many years, and continue to receive compliments on how good I &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, but the spayer doesn&#x27;t work properly. It doesn&#x27;t matter all that much, as I just rub it in.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a scent that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and i came across this at Nordstroms. I fell in love with the product! However Nordstrom&#x27;s sells it for $100 which is a little out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carriere is subtle yet sexy. It has a very clean fresh linen/soapy scent.  All in all its exactly what i was looking for. I will def. buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This fragrance (and Gendarme for men) always takes me back to my childhood.  It smells light and clean like bubble bath.  I cannot think of a more appealing way to smell.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I received from Amazon.  This is nothing more than water in a bottle.  The bottle was even fake.  I am extremely disappointed in AMAZON.  Unfortunately, I tossed the box and receipt before testing since I was so excited and it never occured to me this would be a fraud.  I payed $67 thinking it was better than $110 in the store.  NOT!!</li>
    <li> Incredibly expensive but worth it.  Soft almost powdery scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, great for work if in an office setting.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, light and fresh. Great day perfume. Received product fast.</li>
