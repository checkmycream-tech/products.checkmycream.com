    <li> I have a standard size massage table and this didn&#x27;t quite cover the entire width for the table, which concerns me. It fits well enough, so I won&#x27;t be sending it back. But if I need another set in the future, I may consider anther brand. The pad itself is plush and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations according to price</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. The softness is amazing and the secure straps and face cradle cover fit perfectly. I will definitely purchase a second set.</li>
