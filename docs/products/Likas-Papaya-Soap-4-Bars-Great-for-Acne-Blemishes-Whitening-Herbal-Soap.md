      <li>Will continue to use it, love the smell.</li>
      <li>I still love the soap but more for exfoliation than lightening.</li>

      <li>Try it anyway, and see if you have better luck than I do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product works well with skin and makes you glow</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! LEAVES SKIN SMOOTH AND CLEAR COMPLEXION</li>
    <li> This soap come second best to Koji san skin whitening soap. But its still pretty good</li>
    <li> This soap is so overated. I bought these bars that based on my skin I would get a lighter complexion. All this soap does is  give your face a smooth texture.</li>
    <li> very disappointed at the reception of the soap that looked nothing like the one I&#x27;m used to use you&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just a fake&lt;br /&gt;I have compared it with the latest soap I had left at home</li>
    <li> I Love it. I initially brought this soap to lighten dark areas. But instead I washed in it and at first the tub would be filthy, now it&#x27;s hardly dirty. I see a Major improvement.  Some say don&#x27;t use soap now I see why. Now my skin is almost completely even.</li>
    <li> Bought the soap based on the reviews I have read.  Was hesitant to purchase, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.  My daughter&#x27;s skin has improved since she first started using it.  She&#x27;s uses the product on her face, and she&#x27;s prone to breaking out.  But this product is great, NO BREAKOUTS!!! and at the same time her scars has lightened up a lot.  Thank you amazon and people who took the time to leave feedback about their experience with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap from watching a video on youtube. To be honest this soap is not genuine, the packaging looked fake and the quality of the soap was not impressive. It dries out the skin and i haven&#x27;t notice any difference in the daker areas of my skin. I will advice that you buy it from someone else.</li>
    <li> This soap made my acne go away, brightened my complexion, and made my skin super smooth like it was before I had any acne problems.  I have not broken out since I started using this soap, which I used every night when I wash my makeup off.  I use this with xtreme bright gel, which I put on under my make up in the morning.  This combo is a dynamic duo! I get compliments on my skin all the time now (and I had suffered from mild acne for a few years so the compliments were welcome)!</li>
    <li> It tightens my skin and also makes it smoother I love it</li>
    <li> Decent so far need to use it more.</li>
    <li> This is fake! I am a Filipina who used this soap in the Philippines. The original has a mild sweet smell. This fake one has a&lt;br /&gt;chemical scent. The effect on my skin is also different. I could feel my dead skin peeling off when I used the original one. While this fake one is just like a regular soap. I regret buying this. Wasted money. :(</li>
    <li> It kinda lightened my body BUT GAVE ME HORRIFICALLY LARGE PIMPLES ON MY FACE!!</li>
    <li> This does not lightening, even skin tone or anything.  It does nothing.  Its not even a good soap.  It strips the skin and is very drying.  Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I got this product to help lighten up my unsightly farmers tan from the brutal summer and have found it to be just a great face bar. Sure it dries you out, but your face feels clean like it strips away dirt from the day. Dries your skin out a bit, but just moisturize and you&#x27;ll be good. Still gonna try on that farmer&#x27;s tan and hopefully add a few stars to my review in a few weeks</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for almost two months now and all I can say is WOW! Likas Papaya Herbal Whitening Soap works! You just have to be patient with it. Not only my skin has become lighter, but my scars also started to fade out. I don&#x27;t usually take time to review product, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the manufacturer of this soap if I refused to do so. The only thing is you need to get yourself a very good moisturizer cause the soap tend to dry your skin a little. Other than that, it is a great product! I am one satisfied customer! And I will be buying soon!</li>
    <li> I had been considering purchasing this soap for several years. I regret not having done so before. The primary reason I bought this soap was to lighten my elbows and underarms. Years of using antiperspirants and shaving left my underarms several shades darker than the surrounding skin. I type a lot and my right elbow in particular was getting rather dark from resting it on my desk. I began wearing shirts with sleeves beyond the elbow in the summer. That was my final straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the soap prior to the expected delivery date. I&#x27;m in Canada. The packaging was excellent. The soap was exactly how it was described and comes from Yollie&#x27;s Oriental Market and not from any of the places that claim it&#x27;s real and are actually not pure Likas soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this soap on my right elbow, the more problematic one. I thought it would be a great test area since it is much darker than my left elbow. Within 4 days, I noticed the skin on my right elbow was closer in terms of pigment to my left. After 1 week, my right elbow is now identical in skin tone to the left elbow. I was expecting it to take at least a month to see results so it was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews stating the soap might cause a burning sensation, dryness and even peeling. I experienced neither of these problems. I didn&#x27;t even use a moisturizer afterwards. I&#x27;m assuming this might not be the case for everywhere else on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the soap, I left it on for only 30 seconds. I strongly urge you to try it on an inconspicuous area first in case you have an adverse reaction. The second time and onward, I&#x27;ve kept the soap on for 3-5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the soap as okay in terms of scent. It doesn&#x27;t have a medicinal scent but it&#x27;s not a perfume scent either. In addition to lightening the affected area, I noticed how much softer the skin was. This soap has a great exfoliating property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To preserve the soap and make itlast as long as possible, this is what I do. I never, ever run the soap under water. I wet my hand, roll the soap in my hand so there&#x27;s a thin layer on it then I rub it on my skin. Excess water is usually what causes soap to deplete so rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap and this buyer. I&#x27;m a very, very satisfied customer. I also got a discount coupon with my soap to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I&#x27;d like to add is not getting discouraged if you don&#x27;t see results after a few days or even a week or two. No two people are the same, it may take several weeks to see results. It&#x27;s also possible that this soap won&#x27;t work for you. It worked for me, I hope it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: It&#x27;s been almost a year since I purchased this soap (it&#x27;s now August 8th, 2012), I took off a star because while the results were good for my elbow, they were more reversible than I expected. In my case, I have to be really diligent: using everyday without fail. My elbow returned to its darker color quite rapidly after stopping to use it for awhile. That was disappointing. On the other hand, it really does exfoliate well. I consider it an excellent exfoliating soap and an average lightening soap. My sister is also very fond of it, she&#x27;s used two bars. She had some discolorations on her arms and shoulders and the soap has helped immensely. I still love the soap but more for exfoliation than lightening. She likes its lightening properties more than I do.</li>
    <li> Did nothing buy dry out my skin. I didn&#x27;t have bad acne, but now I do! This stuff broke me out. It doesn&#x27;t lighten your skin or scars.</li>
    <li> Am nt if dis is d real one</li>
    <li> this thing works great. I used to buy Nutragena the expensive stuff but it always dried out my skin. This product is cheaper and works better and last longer.</li>
    <li> The soap that was sent to me was not what I ordered from the screen.  Two boxes were open and white spots was on the soap indicating that it was old.  I have used that soap for years and it never looked like that.  I usually get it from the Philippines and it is very clear with Whitening. great for Acne and Blemishes on the outside of the box.  I sent it back, because I don&#x27;t use products that have been opened  on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using luxury brand skincare products and while I like them, my skin has not reached it best. I decided to try something more natural and so far, I am loving this product.It arrived in the mail, very fast, about 2 weeks ago. For my skin, I generally know if I will be able to use a product after about 2-3 weeks of use (I am very sensitive). So far, Likas has helped to even out my skin tone, has smoothed the texture of my skin, and has helped to control oil production ( I am very oil). I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it drying my skin out like some people have but again, I am oily. Yet, it has dried up any breakout. I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since I started using this soap. I will probably never stop using this!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t read, or write reviews, but I did for this product. I&#x27;m a 19 year old African American, who is fairly light, but has darkened a little over the years. I&#x27;ve been using Likas for a few days(maybe 2 or 3) now, and I&#x27;ve already seen results. The soap does a great job with exfoliating, and has made my skin nice and smooth. It did make my skin get a little dry, but not as bad as everyone made it seem(or maybe it&#x27;s just my skin). A good moisturizer will help with that. Most importantly, I have not had any negative reactions to Likas. I use it everywhere, including my face, and it&#x27;s pretty much done it&#x27;s job. My skin has gotten a little brighter, and I predict that it might return me to my original skin tone. I use it as another buyer said. I work it in for a few minutes before I rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I had to say \\&quot;wow\\&quot; three times, is because the dark scar on the left side of my face just beside my nose(the result of a nasty reaction to an insect bite) has faded almost completely and has gotten smaller. Yes, it&#x27;s almost gone now. Also, the scar just under my belly button has lightened as well. I&#x27;m really pleased with Likas so far, and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone. Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Some reviews rave about this being wonderful but it did nothing for me. I bought this with the hopes of making some marks left behind from acne lighter but ive been using it for 3 weeks and nothings changed, thank god i bought one bar only. ITS A WASTE OF MONEY IN MY OPINION BUT HEY IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of fakes here on Amazon. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM KC COMMERCE she lied. i contacted her via email before i purchased product and asked all the proper questions about authenticity and she said yes , guess what when the soap came it was nothing like her picture and nothing that she told me it was. The soap had been open and closed back up with a glue gun because you can see the glue strings hanging, second then color of the soap and smell screamed I&#x27;m fake. Another seller  i was not pleased with was SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL because when i received the package you can tell the soap had been open before also used hot glue gun to seal it and the soap was old and moldy, although the soaps did look authentic. i still returned because it had been opened and moldy. Both times this happened i called Amazon customer service and got my money back. if you are not sure it authentic make sure its amazon prime shipping.</li>
    <li> Ive used this soap in the past. I must say that I worked for me just fine. I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin after 3 months of constant use. so stick with it!!!!</li>
    <li> When used in conjunction with another skin brightening product, it works pretty well.  Otherwise, it is not something that you can use by itself and expect to see results.</li>
    <li> I had bought this soap before from a different seller and it was fake it was not the real deal. This soap from this seller sells the original soap . I had go to the beach and had gotten a tan and it was taking a long time for my skin to get clear , so I bought this and in a matter of 2 to 3 day my skin was getting clearer :) as I said before great soap ... just be careful which seller you buy from</li>
    <li> I love this product. I got hooked on it from my sister. I haven&#x27;t stop using it yet!!!! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I am a filipina who recently migrated in the US. I was really happy when I saw that amazon offers likas papaya soap so I immediately ordered some. Well my disappointment was terrible when I opened the boxes(which were already slightly opened). The soap itself, should be orange, same as the bright orange color of the box. But these fake ones are a light caramel shade!!! The smell should be mild and pleasant, these soap smell a yucky kind of sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them from Yollie&#x27;s Oriental market. I want my money back! I posted a pic on the customer images link so you guys can see what fake looks like. I emailed the seller and asked for a return shipping label because I do not want to spend anymore money and they refuse to do it. Told me they will give me 10 dollars back for the shipping cost. That is not the point. I want my money back and I do not need anymore hassle just to get rid of this product and get my refund.</li>
    <li> (1)Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;(2)Neatly packaged (when you take the box of soap out of the package and turn it from side to side under a light if there isn&#x27;t a colorful reflective decoration on the box. You got a fake!&lt;br /&gt;(3)The bars are a large size and Sods up alot so each bar of soap lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;(4)Skin is a nice even tone and gives my skin this like \\&quot;liquid look\\&quot;. (using this product for a month)&lt;br /&gt;(Liked it so much I gave a bar to my mom to have.</li>
    <li> Hello, I was not please with the product because you can tell the package was old, and mill dew, seems like  the seller had&lt;br /&gt;it for a long time, it smelled like mole, however I would try it again but not from the seem seller hopefully it will be authentic and not molded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Does not lighten your skin, but cleans it nicely and clears away some scars. I have been using it for months. I am a African American male.</li>
    <li> I used all the four bars and my skin was same as before. This seller is fake and the soap is made of cheap ingredients, not natural at all! I thought it would be a great deal to buy four at once, but I should have just bought one checked it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that there were stickers all around individual packets saying something like \\&quot;This product is not guaranteed to make skin lighter\\&quot;. I was shocked as this is supposed to be a &#x27;whitening soap&#x27;! Then I scratched off the stickers and saw the original quote similar to \\&quot;Makes skin lighter\\&quot;. So this is a fake seller not selling the original Likas soap. Do not buy from this seller. I am not going to buy this product altogether. I am very disappointed. I&#x27;m just going to put lemon juice and honey on my skin to remove my tan.</li>
    <li> I thought this would clear my skin blemishes but its get even more after using it. I m not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Came in all the way from Cali to Florida in 2 days. Perfect</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 months going on three and haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference yet. Still using it though, after 6 months if there is no improvement, I will find something else. Shipping is fast and arrives on time in perfect condition</li>
    <li> my roommate loves this thing and always buys it when he breaks out, however, my skin ends up feeling dry. I don&#x27;t see a whitening effect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, everything came as expected. Me and my mother love this soap, good for evening out skin tone and having a brighter complexion! You get so much whitening effect from long term use, but I find this soap is best for getting rid of the summer tan and any tan lines and uneven skin tones on the body.</li>
    <li> I purchased my soap at a local store in Knoxville Tennessee. The very first time I used it, my skin felt amazing. I bought it to lighten my discoloration on my face. I am a Beautiful Brown Woman and was afraid of it makeing me lighter, but it hasn&#x27;t. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but I don&#x27;t care. I cleanses the heck out of my skin. No need to use anything but my hands. Most importantly, it has cleared up my acne. So I bought some for my children now. I have my twin and her daughter using it. I use nothing else on my body for the last 2months.&lt;br /&gt;I freaking love this soap!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used! It cleans my skin and ensures I feel confident. People are always complimenting meonmy complexion!</li>
    <li> I USE IT EVERY MORNING TO WASH MY FACE, AND I CAN FEEL THE SMOOTHNESS IN MY SKIN.  NICE PRODUCT, AND I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> this soap works great it really cleans you. i been using for over a months now. and i love it</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful. It really works. My various dark spots on my body have diminished a lot. Took a few months but now they are less visible. My daughters are alos using it and love it.</li>
    <li> My skin seems clearer and more even toned.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin so smooth and whiten as it says. Although since this works as an exfoliant, it is best not to use any other acne exfoliant because it might cause you to break out even more. But other than that this product works wonders!</li>
    <li> No skin change just a softness to your skin</li>
    <li> Im African American female and I bought the soap during the summer to lighten my skin. I did 2 months of scrubbing with this soap but no change.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to buy this soap after seeing the reviews on it and reading about it i bought a 4pack to last me a while when i showered i used it every time and i let it sit for a 1 min in the shower i used it for 2 months and i havent seen a change highly upset that it didnt work i will never buy this again sorry .</li>
    <li> not sure about authenticity of the product. The words &amp;#34;skin whitening&amp;#34; came covered with a white tape over it.  What does that mean?</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and got it 4 days later.I am a brown-skinned girl, and this product worked great for me.  I love this product because it lightens you skin to its original color and leaves you with this healthy glow. The color on your inner fore-arm is your true color and that&#x27;s the color this product will return you to. I live in South Florida so I&#x27;m in the sun a lot.</li>
    <li> This is my first review for any item I have ever bought.  I just want to say how amazing this soap is.  I bought it because I wanted to lighten some spots from a few old scars on my arms and legs.  I have only been using it for a few days and I have not seen any lightening as of yet, but it is a miracle how this soap exfoliates and makes my skin soooooo smoooooooth!!!  I am amazed.  Any rough patches I have ever had are gone.  I&#x27;m going to keep on using the soap even if it doesn&#x27;t lighten my spots, because it makes the texture of my skin so silky and smooth... no other product has ever done this for me.  I use it everyday on my body and moisturize afterwards... my skin is satiny smooth the whole day :)  I am very happy with this soap.  Granted, it may not work for everyone, especially those who require heavier/ richer soaps and moisturizers, but this worked miracles for me.  It has a rich lather, but it&#x27;s not heavy and the smell is neutral, so it&#x27;s just light and cleansing.  I love taking a shower just before I got to bed, so I feel clean and moisturized when I get under the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can think of is the possibility of whitening.  I&#x27;m already pretty light, and I don&#x27;t want to look like a ghost.  But even so, I think I&#x27;d keep on using it just for the way it makes my skin feel :)</li>
    <li> The smell is very subtle and nice ! It was packaged well, came fast.  I have yet to know if it works for me but I&#x27;ve heard many good things Abt it</li>
    <li> I like the oil cutting power of this soap. I like to use exfoliating type soaps post gym and this one is pretty good so far. It really gets all the grime off and you will see the icky stuff going  down the drain. Especially if you use spa gloves. However, try not to scrub too hard with the gloves or loofahs since the product is very acidic and will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to wash you face with as well. Unlike the body, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend scrubbing. Just lather and rinse. Since the skin on our face is thinner and more sensitive, you don&#x27;t want to risk microscopic cuts and burns.</li>
    <li> We love this product. My sister and I use this product religiously. It even out your skin and reduces blemishes and breaking out. Love it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> It exfoliates good and VERY slowly whitens your skin and it&#x27;s an overall decent soap.</li>
    <li> This soap does lighten my post acne scarring a bit which pleases me.  Does well with oil control on face too.  I don&#x27;t want to get shades lighter, just a more even tone would be nice.  This seems to be doing the job after using it for two months now all over my body.  My skin is so much smoother also.  Would recommend for acne prone and oily skin!  This is now one of my must have staples to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This soap REALLLYYY dries out your skin, however it does whiten over time. If you are one of those people who want quick results, this is not for you, but, anyways, then there&#x27;s no natural and safe way to get what you want. As mentioned above, it does whiten, but not drastically, just a shade or two.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as described.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this trust me</li>
    <li> Soap does pretty well. I wish it had a fragrant smell of papaya.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me but dry my skin out</li>
    <li> Just as described. LOVING this soap so far. I have very oily skin, and this soap has helped tremendously in controlling the oil. It has also lighted up spots from previous acne, and has helped tone my skin overall. I wish it wasn&#x27;t called a whitening soap, cause that turns people off from a great product. It hasn&#x27;t lightened my skin at all, just helped with the hyper-pigmentation spots which is all I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought the 4 pack likas soap. It came pretty quick, which I was very excited about. I have been using this product for a month now and my body has not got any lighter once so ever. My face, however, did. Strange. The upside is that my body is really soft! I love feeling my arms and legs, even when im sleep I can notice that im feeling my skin. Bad for whitening, good for exfloiating and softening of the skin</li>
    <li> I wanted to even my skin tone from sun damage I am brown skinned AA but was originally about 3 to 4 shades lighter (currently bronze originally topaz) I was not trying to get back to my normal color because the bronze is very beautiful on me but it is darker in some spots.  I used this soap for over 3 months and did not lighten any dark spots.  It did how ever make my skin feel very soft and supple and clean.  My lighters shades got lighter but i am still uneven and now have to work on my original color with koji san which has not come yet but this soap is def worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks and I already see a difference in my skins appearance, not so much as far as brightening but its only been 2 weeks. I&#x27;m anticipating my overall results. I will update in about 3 mo.</li>
    <li> It as been a while since I purchase this soap and it does not seem to be what I remember it to be.</li>
    <li> Great soap for every day exfoliation. I was using it for two years for now and even my son is \\&quot;hooked on it&#x27;</li>
    <li> I used two bars already and I bought them from a different seller, the soap smelled good, however this one smell strong like a chemical. It has the seal et all the awards on it but does not smell like the first one.</li>
    <li> The soap I got works really well. It wasn&#x27;t fake and it last a pretty long time. I am very impressed with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and my complexion is more even.  It&#x27;s very good for people with oily skin and lessen up the breakouts, but it does dry your skin, so follow it up with a moisturizer. But don&#x27;t expect this soap bar to lighten your complexion to a porcelain color.</li>
    <li> Even though i cannot notice much difference, i think this is not a bad soap being herbal and i am using it</li>
    <li> Idk it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> All this soap did for me was break my face out in major hives of multiple, super red zits. I wasn&#x27;t allergic, didn&#x27;t over-exfoliate. The soap just didn&#x27;t like my face. Go ahead. Risk it if you want. Maybe you&#x27;ll get good results. I didn&#x27;t. The two bars I haven&#x27;t used are going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> with all the rave about this so I decided to buy. This is complete rubbish it doesn&#x27;t do anything doesn&#x27;t lighten your skin just complete trash buy at your own risk</li>
    <li> Purchased January of this year and gave it about 3 months and did not notice any change, not even a slight. I would not purchase this product again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great for acne, blemishes &amp; dark spots.  Keeps your skin smooth and your complexion glowing.  I have recommended this product to my Mom as well.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this made a difference on my skin, it actually dehydrated my skin and gave me really bad dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good and one bar does not seem to last to long either.</li>
    <li> We really love it. It also helped clear up my granddaughter&#x27;s eczema. She was also very pleased. My husband loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  We use this same product in the Philippines and loved it.  My wife loved it.  It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> This a good product, it works very well. I does what it says, lighten the skin and help fight acne.</li>
    <li> I AM SHOCKED AND AMAZED AT THIS SOAP!!...so i ordered this soap the end of february after reading great reviews on its \\&quot;lightening\\&quot; power and how great it exfoliates the skin. I was looking for something that could get rid of the dark patches i received while being pregnant. Well after receiving it in the mail I put it 2 work right away and after 2 weeks of no results i was a little disappointed, after a month still disappointed so i began leaving it on my skin for 3-5 minutes lyk sum reviewers say they did...once i began doing that i noticed that when i would rinse, the water would be a nasty gray color and that is a true sign your skin is exfoliating (the dead and old skin is being removed). So after almost 2 months of use i am seeing an amazing difference in my skin. Lighter (just a tad bit) and it has a healthy glow and feel to it. even tho this soap is drying, using a nice lotion or body butter after moisturizes you up nicely. I plan to continue using and buying this soap, and im also goin 2 use with a loofah sponge 2 get double the exfoliation :)</li>
    <li> i think it works but very slowly. i went to different state about 2 months and when i came back to CA, my friend noticed that my face looked brighter. so, so far so good. and it last long too</li>
    <li> I have been ordering likas soap for a while now and I am very happy with the results.  I use it mainly after the summer days to get rid of my tan lines.  Good product</li>
    <li> We really enjoy this product but you&#x27;d have to buy more than 1 bar of soap to actually see a difference when you use it in the shower, and I personally like it because it really helps clean up the oil in your face I recommend when using this product to leave it on for a while before washing it off. Overall we do recommend this product it works great just get more than one or you won&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT...IF YOU HAVE OILY SKIN AND SENSITIVE THIS IS GREAT... USED IT A T NITE FOLLOWED BY A MOISTERIZER..SKIN FEELS SUPER CLEAN..WASH LET IT STAY ON COUPLE MINS.,  LOOK AT THAT SMILE, FOR ACNE AND OILY SKING THIS IS GREAT...</li>
    <li> Made me break out very badly and dried my skin</li>
    <li> When i got the soap the box was already open. I thought it was kinda weird that they didn&#x27;t close the box when they put in the soap. I felt like the just put the soap in the box and ship it out.</li>
    <li> It came exactly when it said it would come</li>
    <li> It was the best price that i ever fine y look on eBay and compare the price and I find it here on Amazon the best prize I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Dont&#x27;t waiste your time or money. I bought a pack of 4 and nothing! I used it all summer long and waisted over 4 months using this product.</li>
    <li> Box does not look like picture on website - the round seal on the front of the box is absent, white tape covers the words &#x27;skin whitening&#x27; everywhere it the phrase appears on the box, soap bar is orange but dinged and smells like detergent, and the font differs from the picture shown for the &#x27;Original&#x27; version of this product.</li>
    <li> Before finding Likas, I had tried different kinds of expensive serums, face washes, and bleaching creams to help remove the dark spots, with all of them leaving me with nothing but a hole in my pocket. I have been using this soap for about 2 years now. To date it is the most AMAZING product to remove the dark spots left over by active acne.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately a lot of fake likas soaps are found in the market because of their popularity..so make sure you got the original likas papaya soap or u end up making ur face even worse..original soap works wonders on your face..check out the following link to find out a fake likas soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best video that will make u sure u got the original soap is here check this once..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_x61r-f9ZF8</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face and it cleans your skin well without harming or drying it.  This is a age benefit over time.</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my skin color already and i&#x27;ve only brrn using this for a week and a half. It does burn the first couple times you use it but u get past it, my natural skintone is about Gabrielle Union with a golden undertone. I struggled with acne but im getting it undercontrol but the scars left marks, i can see them going away, i use this soap in combination with makari de suesse soap, i like both of them. Beware this makes skin very dry so moosturize, moistirize, moisturize. For me i have to do it immediately after i towel myself dry. Goodluck ladies</li>
    <li> I bought two orders of the 4pk for $19.99 with the intention to use it as my new everyday bar soap.  Order came in the mail quick thanks to amazon prime 2day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, the soap worked wonders on skin tone when I was in middle school.  Then, as I was a darker caramel shade and after about a years worth of usage, my skin tone lightened up to the same color of my palms, which is a light olive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I remember about this soap is the odd numbing/tingling sensation I used to get when I lathered up with the soap. This batch doesn&#x27;t seem to do that and am wondering if it contains less of the same whitening properties as it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less, hopefully this soap does help to even out my skin tone on my back/tummy from a bad allergic rash I got a year ago. I&#x27;ve been using the soap for every shower since late October 2012 and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in color yet. I&#x27;ve finally used up one bar out of eight.  I just opened up a new box to begin using today (late February 2013).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for side effects, my skin is already quite dry and I&#x27;ve made it a habit to lather on tons of lotion anyway to combat this. So I haven&#x27;t really noticed the extra drying effect it may have from what others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels clean and refreshing after a wash.  I recommend really lathering up the feet and armpits with this soap to get all the grime and dead skin cells off for a squeaky clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably update this review again in another 3-6 months to verify it is working. Or not. We will see.</li>
    <li> My second go with Likas it&#x27;s good for exfoliating, but with that being said over drying for the skin be prepare to moisturize. Did it clear up dark marks? No. Did it make me brighter or lighter? No. How did you benefit from this product? bottom line too much work for a soap I shouldn&#x27;t have to buy a specific moisturizer because the soap makes my skin feel like a prune and it leaves orange streaks behind. Also, sometimes because of over-drying I experienced cystic acne.</li>
    <li> This product definitely worked for me. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this soap for clearing body acne. Unfortunately at 29 my skin is clear everywhere but my back and this is one of the only products that has worked for me long term. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make me itch like others have and it actually seems to help control oil. It has a soft, clean, pleasant scent and one bar lasts me several months so it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> stay out of sun use sun block and wash skin  every day then u will have great results soap last longtime :)</li>
    <li> I saw immediate results from the beginning. But then hardly anything. Will continue to use for another month to see what happens.</li>
    <li> I think the soap works well. It does what it says it will, although it does take a little bit of time and consistency. The only downside for me is that it tends to dry out my skin, so I always follow up with lotion, which I do not enjoy.</li>
    <li> I love Lika&#x27;s soap!!! I typically buy Lika&#x27;s in a regular basis; but this is the first time purchasing from this seller.  Ive gotta say, this seller&#x27;s brand is not what I&#x27;m use to.  I dont like their soap has way too much dye and bleeds orange.  I will not purchase this product from this seller again. I will be purchasing from my regular seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this soap before but from an actual filipino, I figured why not try it again since summer is almost over and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot darker. I&#x27;m from the West Indies and sun never bothered me or my skin until I moved to the states. The soap did a good job of clearing up my skin because I noticed fewer acne and bumps. But in terms of lightning your skin it did nothing. The last time I used this soap I saw results in 3 days. The soap I ordered from here didn&#x27;t change anything about my skin and I still have a tan line...and it&#x27;s been 3 months lol. I still use the soap because I do get clearer skin but for whatever reason this did not lighten my complexion at all.</li>
    <li> Produced results for user</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what it said to do the only reason why i purchased it was because of the reviews however after using it my complexion did not change therefore i am returning this time.</li>
    <li> I Like this soap....not sure about the acne but it does brighten the skin.</li>
    <li> This soap didnt brighten my skin like I wanted but it did help my husbands face, very smootg and clear on him.</li>
    <li> unfortunately this product did not live up to the expectations and also did not supply my needs this soap is fake! this product does not do any of the things that it says it does just due to the fact that it is not the original soap I knew this after a long week of research so please take my advise and don&#x27;t buy this product is a fake and you will just be disappointed that you spent $21 on something useless and fake.</li>
    <li> Noticed a more even toned skin in a week&#x27;s time. Will continue to use it, love the smell. Highly recommended....</li>
    <li> Totally burned my skin. They issued a refund and were very nice, but stay away if you have sensitive skin. I often have to use Basis soap and very mild formulas, so should have known better. The company seemed very nice about it though.</li>
    <li> $19.99 for 4? Really? These things only cost about $3 each in stores. You can find them at any local asian market/stores. With that being said, I&#x27;ve been using this for some months now and I love it. It works better than the Proactive stuff. If I go 2 days without using Likas, my face will get oily and start breaking out again so I try to use it every day. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my face drying out or anything. Works well on the body too. Highly recommend using the item, but I don&#x27;t recommend ordering it online because really its only $3 each in stores. I get mine from the Cambodian store.</li>
    <li> This soap really works if you use it everyday, you can start seeing result in about two or three week.</li>
    <li> The quality is no longer as before. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have  psoriasis and adult acne this soap helps with both.  I&#x27;ve been using steroids, but they thin the skin I&#x27;ve also been using retinol it works for the acne that the steroid cream helps cause.  So its a catch 22. I haven&#x27;t seen it lighten my blemish marks yet, I&#x27;ve only had it a week, but I love the way it makes my skin feel. I use it all over and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. I would recommend it as an exfoliate alone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap a little over a year now! I have 7 different skin conditions but the one that has caused me the most concern is my hyper-pigmentation. After the first month of use I noticed a major difference but after 3 months my skin conditions were completely under control and much less noticeable...Fast forward to one year later there is no indicator of skin conditions at all...CONSISTENCY IS KEY! This product has been life changing!</li>
    <li> This works well and I went thru this in less than a week.  I can&#x27;t complain as my @ss is a little bit lighter now.... lol. :D</li>
    <li> I previously used a fresh papaya to do a sort of mask on my face for acne and it worked great but smelled horrible. I decided to give this soap a try because it is cheaper than buying papaya where I live and doesn&#x27;t go bad. I love this soap. It cleared up my acne so quickly. Even when I have some acne, after washing my face with this soap it is soooo much clearer. I started using it on my arms also because I always have had little bumps on my upper arms, and it took care of that problem too.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Absolutely love it. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> just be careful not to rub off much on your face using a facetowel, it kind of thins your skin</li>
    <li> This soap works great for hyperpigmentation and it lightens my complexion as well.</li>
    <li> The shipping of the product was very fast; therefore, I was excited to use it right away.  Unfortunately, when I opened the first box it had some powdery white spots on the soap bar and the inside of the box was kind of yellowish.  I was okay with it because thought I would at least end up with three bar soaps, but no upon opening each box I found same white powdery spots with mold on it and yellow color inside the box.  Not so happy.</li>
    <li> Does not whiten your skin. It&#x27;s great for acne like it says. An expensive acne soap though. I believe it does not even have kojic acid in it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item some time ago to lighten dark spots and hopefully reverse some of my tans. I was born with a pale complexion, but after years of outdoor activities without the aid of sunblock, my arms have grown increasingly dark to the point where there is a stark difference between them and the skin on my torso and legs. I bought the 4 pack, and after using it for months on end, I maybe got my right arm to be a smidgen lighter. The bruises on my underarms were also still present after using the Likas soap. This is not to say that it won&#x27;t work for you. Try it anyway, and see if you have better luck than I do. Everybody&#x27;s skin is different and will react differently, as you can see that most reviews have been positive for this item. However, if it doesn&#x27;t end up working out for you, you&#x27;re not crazy. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist if you are truly passionate about eliminating those dark spots, because you can&#x27;t ask for a miracle with a couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> Excellent for removing dead skin.</li>
</ol>
