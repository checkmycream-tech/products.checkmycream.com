      <li>It smells just as good burned as it does before it&#x27;s lit.</li>
      <li>Their incenses do a good job of avoiding that ashy/burnt smell while they are burning, as well as when they are put out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this incense.</li>
      <li>Its perfect blend of aromatic oils infused into fine burning charcoal produces a very enjoyable and memorable scent.</li>

      <li>Amazing all around.</li>
      <li>Gave some to friends as well they liked them as well.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this incense for over thirty-five years.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite smells by Gonesh.  </li>
      <li>This incense is my favorite scent of all time, but 4.95?</li>
      <li>Gonesh sticks are the best for filling your home with scent instantly.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have been buying them for more than 15 years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&#x27;Perfumes of Ancient Times &#x27; (#6) is my all-time favorite and</li>
      <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY SCENTS AND</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE FRAGRANCES OF &amp;#34;THE ANCIENT TIMES&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Favorite scent of mine.</li>
      <li>This was better than the Lavender though so hence that earned another star from an otherwise 2 star scent.</li>
      <li>but now I love it so perhaps this one will take some getting used to.</li>
      <li>#6 has always been my favorite</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>Really makes the house smell great.  </li>
      <li>#6 favorite sensual &amp; light scent.</li>
      <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why it smelled so strong.</li>
      <li>Ships very fast!!</li>
      <li>they were worth the money we enjoyed the aroma.</li>
      <li>This product is not new to me, but has fortunately kept its superior quality among most incense ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s rich.</li>
      <li>it has a rich musk/spice/myrrh blend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gonesh in general is still good though.</li>
      <li>They burn easy and fairly long (like most Gonesh sticks), and smell absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve had incense burn for longer periods of time, but very VERY few that smelled better than this blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Love the low cost.</li>
      <li>; first.</li>
      <li>The smell is like a vanilla lavender with other very sweet, smooth scents lingering in the background.</li>
      <li>Gonesh Incense are very high quality for the price.  </li>
      <li>Smell like the ladies sitting in Church with large hats and way too much perfume on.</li>
      <li>Like someone who put on too much of it.</li>
      <li>I recently tried a few others by Gonesh and they were also very nice.  </li>
      <li>THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS A NEW SCENT FOR ME, AND I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
      <li>/&gt;By the way, when it comes to Gonesh in particular, get the sticks instead of the cones if you can.</li>
      <li>Also, COMPLETELY MADE IN THE USA!</li>
      <li>Very heavy sent but satisfying.</li>
      <li>usually the only kind I buy.  </li>
      <li>My least favorite of the Gonesh incenses that I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this from the website directly.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a floral yet very pungent incense with a long burn time you would probably like this.</li>
      <li>It was more diffuse by then, but definitely noticeable at least for anyone coming into the room from another.</li>
      <li>I completely understand everyone is different.</li>
      <li>Certainly a decent product, but my tastes prefer other flavors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorite smells by Gonesh.  Really makes the house smell great.  They make the best incense ever!!!!!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Uplifting and calming. Sent stays around for a long time. Very heavy sent but satisfying. These Gonesh sents seem thick but soothing. Highly recommend!! Ships very fast!!</li>
    <li> This incense is my favorite scent of all time, but 4.95? That&#x27;s ridiculous! I can pick these up locally for a 1.94. Too bad, if the price was lower I&#x27;d definitely buy them on here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this incense. I have not seen at nay local stores. It&#x27;s not overpowering yet it&#x27;s rich. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this incense for over thirty-five years. Its perfect blend of aromatic oils infused into fine burning charcoal produces a very enjoyable and memorable scent. Never overpowering, never cloying.   As poetry to the soul is this incense to the nose.   Heavenly!</li>
    <li> Gonesh Incense are very high quality for the price.  The best I have ever used.  I have been buying them for more than 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Perfumes of Ancient Times &#x27; (#6) is my all-time favorite and usually the only kind I buy.  I recently tried a few others by Gonesh and they were also very nice.  But #6 still tops my favorites list.</li>
    <li> Favorite scent of mine. Love the low cost. Amazing all around.</li>
    <li> they were worth the money we enjoyed the aroma. Gave some to friends as well they liked them as well.</li>
    <li> They burn easy and fairly long (like most Gonesh sticks), and smell absolutely fantastic. Honestly, I&#x27;ve had incense burn for longer periods of time, but very VERY few that smelled better than this blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2.95 (what I bought them for, and the current price as of writing) is not too bad for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when it comes to Gonesh in particular, get the sticks instead of the cones if you can. I generally recommend cones, but for this particular brand the cones are very difficult to get started and don&#x27;t smell quite as strongly.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of outdated African-American hair spray.  Like someone who put on too much of it. Dark scent in the direction of oils, and maybe a hint of a soft spice, and a touch of makeup powder (--not baby powder).  Dark smell in the direction of burnt hair, although not burnt. Somewhat musky.  I can actually see why some people may like it, but it&#x27;s not my cup of tea.  My least favorite of the Gonesh incenses that I&#x27;ve come across.  I actually rather avoid smelling this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you like musky, oily, a touch of spice and a touch of powder with an overall reminisce of hair spray, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonesh in general is still good though. Their incenses do a good job of avoiding that ashy/burnt smell while they are burning, as well as when they are put out.  Additionally, the scent lingers for a long time in my bedroom.  Longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen brands. I fell asleep in my living room and came back into my bedroom 5 hour later and could still smell the incense, even with my door open. It was more diffuse by then, but definitely noticeable at least for anyone coming into the room from another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this incense before so it&#x27;s what I expected. It&#x27;s perfect. I have no complaints about it. Enough said.</li>
    <li> It just smells funky!  It smells like they dipped it in milk.  When it is burned, it gives off a &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE FRAGRANCES OF &amp;#34;THE ANCIENT TIMES&amp;#34;  IN THE FORM OF INCENSE.  I HAVE TRIED MANY SCENTS AND THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS A NEW SCENT FOR ME, AND I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a floral yet very pungent incense with a long burn time you would probably like this. Certainly a decent product, but my tastes prefer other flavors.</li>
    <li> If U want something Spicey Smelling this is It !</li>
    <li> Gonesh sticks are the best for filling your home with scent instantly.  #6 has always been my favorite it has a rich musk/spice/myrrh blend.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome. Hard to find in stores even when they sell this brand. Love it.</li>
    <li> I completely understand everyone is different. This may not be for you, and it&#x27;s difficult to buy things like this when you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;check them out&amp;#34; first. The smell is like a vanilla lavender with other very sweet, smooth scents lingering in the background. It smells just as good burned as it does before it&#x27;s lit. One stick lasts between 30 min. and one hour, and this package comes with 20. Also, COMPLETELY MADE IN THE USA!</li>
    <li> This product is not new to me, but has fortunately kept its superior quality among most incense ever purchased.  It&#x27;s a brand I will always trust and purchase.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was very heavily perfumed. Smell like the ladies sitting in Church with large hats and way too much perfume on. I doubled up the incense in my room so maybe that&#x27;s why it smelled so strong. It wasn&#x27;t a bad scent but I didn&#x27;t love it. Then again I had #4 and immediately though car air freshener but now I love it so perhaps this one will take some getting used to. I purchased this from the website directly. I have others that I am trying and will review them as well, as I open them. This was better than the Lavender though so hence that earned another star from an otherwise 2 star scent. I will update this review as I use again later on if I feel differently about it.</li>
    <li> Always excellent incense. Used this product over 6 years. #6 favorite sensual &amp; light scent.</li>
