      <li>Nice, light weight, translucent power</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Many times, I have tried so-called translucent powders only to have them make my perfectly applied makeup foundation appear orange and cakey.  </li>
      <li>Lovely product.</li>
      <li>I am here to tell you this is the best loose powder out there.</li>
      <li>The price is very good for the amount of product you get, definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t have color at all and gave good shine control.  </li>
      <li>Without it, my make up wiped off easily and my oily skin would just seep through.</li>
      <li>just want to say that I have tried again since I didn&#x27;t want to give up easily</li>
      <li>your skin tone easily</li>
      <li>This came very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product to all women.</li>
      <li>I would recommend also using their brush applicator for best results and I typically keep my brushes for my powder separate.</li>
      <li>it will not accentuate your fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m biracial with light brown skin.  </li>

      <li>satisfactory and quick transaction</li>
      <li>It gives you a beautiful coverage for few hours.</li>
      <li>It works almost as good my Dove Dry Shampoo!</li>
      <li>The price is amazing and the jar is soooo much bigger.</li>
      <li>Worth trying this product.</li>
      <li>This powder is one of the only things that helps absorb the oil on my skin and keeps it nice and matte.</li>
      <li>and your makeup is going to look like you as fresh as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Little bit pricey but totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It gives me a more natural finish and look.</li>
      <li>After applying, it left a nice matte finish and kept the oily look at bay, and it is translucent</li>
      <li>And I wasn&#x27;t really in a M.A.C friendly budget</li>
      <li>It works wonders I apply it right after I finish applying my liquid makeup</li>
      <li>Most loose powders will settle and cake making fine lines appear...</li>
      <li>My previous \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; powders (purchased at the neighborhood drug store) had, over the years, been developing more and more color in them to the point where I couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t turn my face orange.  </li>
      <li>However I got this complimentary via Influenster.com the first time</li>
      <li>It is very light and simply highlights and illuminates wherever it is applied.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This powder blends flawlessly into my face and matches my skin tone perfectly. I&#x27;m not really sure how it does that, because it looks so white in the container. But it works, so I&#x27;m not questioning it!</li>
    <li> At first I thought it would look too white and powdery, but this blends right in with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Have been a fan for years.  As I have fair skin and am a difficult color match, foundations and powders are nearly impossible for me to match up to.  Even tanned, this product illuminates my glowing skin.  It&#x27;s glorious.  Most loose powders will settle and cake making fine lines appear...well, APPEAR! this product does NOT.  It is very light and simply highlights and illuminates wherever it is applied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t keep my face matte for that long though.</li>
    <li> this product is very good</li>
    <li> very easy to apply and covers well</li>
    <li> Great product at an affordable price.  This is a great alternative to Make Up For Ever powder.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is a good brand so it was as expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $20 for the HD makeup I was buying at Sephora. To my surprise this makeup works exactly the same! I love it. The price is amazing and the jar is soooo much bigger. This is what I&#x27;ll be ordering from now on.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and despite using face washes and/or washing my face periodically through the day, I will still get oil on my face. This powder is one of the only things that helps absorb the oil on my skin and keeps it nice and matte. I also like that it can be used with anything, or alone, and that there is no smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it to absorb oil in my hair from my bangs. I dab it on with the brush, then take my hairbrush or comb and comb it out. It works almost as good my Dove Dry Shampoo!</li>
    <li> If you have allergies or sensitive skin, I recommend this loose powder.  It goes on very smoothly without a hint of smell.  Also, it is very lightweight and will not clog pores or make the skin burn or itch.  If you like the color of your foundation and don&#x27;t want your powder to affect the overall color, this is the powder for you.  Many times, I have tried so-called translucent powders only to have them make my perfectly applied makeup foundation appear orange and cakey.  Very frustrating! Mary Kay translucent powder will not affect your skin tone or ruin your foundation color--it is truly translucent and it seems to keep oil under control most of the day.  I highly recommend it if you like a minimal coverage powder.</li>
    <li> Great on my skin. Not as oily or shiny as before</li>
    <li> A little too light for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Seller (Ruby Boutique) never was in communication until after I filed a claim. So I sent it back and had bought it from a different seller (Pink Sunshine) who got it to me faster but also sent me a used product which was very noticeable. As a makeup artist this is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have used the Translucent Loose Powder for 4 yrs. Would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> satisfactory and quick transaction</li>
    <li> I had been using the mineral face powder with color, and decided to try the translucent powder with no color.&lt;br /&gt;At first it was different, but now I feel like it does what it is suppose to do, set your makeup without adding to your&lt;br /&gt;foundation.</li>
    <li> I thought this might look white on my skin.  I&#x27;m biracial with light brown skin.  It really didn&#x27;t have color at all and gave good shine control.  It doesn&#x27;t cake.  I only reapply once, during the day.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> I love this powder. It doesn&#x27;t cake and looks perfect on.  The texture is very fine and it goes over makeup perfectly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and helps keep my makeup on the whole day even when I sweat. I found the best way to apply it is using a clean brush. Little amount is usually enough to get the job done. First I tried using different applicators: sponges, pads, foam, etc... and all of them tends to take too much makeup off when applying the powder. Besides I read they are great places for bacteria to gather and grow. With a brush, I can quickly wash it with soap and water when I&#x27;m done and it is way easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t pick up much makeup in the process as the other applicators did. After applying, it left a nice matte finish and kept the oily look at bay, and it is translucent so it blends in with your makeup nicely. Will buy another when I finish this.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have use it, and it is great, it gives a shine to my face. I will recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this translucent powder for a couple of months now, probably since December 2013. I purchased the travel size to use as a trial to determined if I liked it or not. I ended up loving it! It is perfect for any skin tone or type. I have combination to oily skin and my skin tone is warm/deep. I use this to set my foundation, I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Translucent Power&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a more natural finish and look. It help control the excess oil on my face.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying i use several MK products (foundation, primer, eye primer, shadows, lipsticks, lip glosses, etc.) and second of all, I&#x27;m explaining what the powder is for. The Mary Kay translucent is a finishing powder, you put it on after you finish all of your makeup routine, that (even though is white) goes with EVERY skin tone. here is my opinion on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Matches your skin tone easily, you won&#x27;t even see the white on your face at all&lt;br /&gt;- Silky, soft, velvety kind of texture&lt;br /&gt;-For those with oily skin must be GREAT cause it does helps absorb the shine excess from makeup. I personally have a combination skin and it works wonders on me&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long the way with this! So you don&#x27;t need that much product on your face&lt;br /&gt;-When you feel your skin is getting a bit oily and out of control (things that happen with a bit of a party sweat, etc.) You can always go on and touch up and your makeup is going to look like you as fresh as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Little bit pricey but totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t last too long. It gives you a beautiful coverage for few hours. But hey, nothing major. You can always touch up and Voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really worked for me!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s for but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be destined for me to use this type of product, I&#x27;m a picky person about scents and what goes on my face because it&#x27;s sensitive and while it is safe for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t have a scent I still smell a faint powder smell and since it&#x27;s on my face I don&#x27;t like it since my sense of smell if ridiculously sensitive so it&#x27;s just me. Otherwise this product is good and a small amount goes a long way which I&#x27;m sure a lot of women have heard this about other products.  It does settles liquid make up and make your face less shiny just be careful a lot isn&#x27;t used because it can give a face a light white overcast. This loose powder does leave my face silky soft which a like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone with everything kind of skin tone and if their skin is sensitive or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say that I have tried again since I didn&#x27;t want to give up easily and I have found that I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent that the powder had anymore, it seemed that the scent I smelled was because it as brand new. I just got to say that it makes my face silky soft and takes away any shine I might have on my face as well as prevents my face from getting shiny thru the day, I also don&#x27;t have to touch up much maybe once in the day or not at all. I&#x27;m liking this product a lot and would say to those thinking of buying it to give it a try because it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It sets your foundation and gives your skin a glow. Will never not have this on hand.</li>
    <li> Have previously purchased this item before and it is exactly as I had wanted. Arrived on time and was priced fairly. Product is light and subtle when applied. Not heavy.</li>
    <li> Nice, light weight, translucent power and it&#x27;s especially good at setting base makekup on aging skin.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for sensitive skin. I purchased this product for the second time the day after Christmas and still do not have it. This seller (ruby-boutique) takes forever to get your item to you. If you want to wait a month to get it then go for it, otherwise I&#x27;d go somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Worth trying this product. Can&#x27;t remember if it came with a brush, but I currently use a brush from something else.</li>
    <li> This came very quickly and was well packaged.  I was very pleased to discover that it is pretty much identical to my nars powder, at a fraction of the price!  This will last me a long time but I will buy again.</li>
    <li> works very well for shine</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I took a chance on this product. It really works:) I use this after my Bare Minerals foundation and I just love how it evens out my skin tone and make it glow as well. I love it.</li>
    <li> not completely sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be used but it does leave a nice finish i enjoy having it as an option for makeup</li>
    <li> I absolutely have to keep buying this Translucent Powder from Mary Kay.  I  have acne scars and frequent breakouts so I do still have to apply foundation to conceal my acne scarring. Because I am darker complected most powders out there I use make my skin look like I threw a pile of corn starch on my face and looks rather scary.  However I got this complimentary via Influenster.com the first time but I ended buying a 2nd set because it set your foundation and does not clog your skin.  It gives your skin a natural glow without looking greasy. At first I was thinking because it is white it would not blend in with my mocha /mahogany complexion. I am here to tell you this is the best loose powder out there. I tried them all an this by far is affordable and lasts a long way. I would recommend also using their brush applicator for best results and I typically keep my brushes for my powder separate.</li>
    <li> Its my first time ordering on amazon cause I live in kingston jamaica . Anyways I ordered this powder thinking tht it was a gud size for my muni , I was shock to the core to c wat I got for my money but its a very good powder</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey (think I might go back to my back up powder - Cover Girl for oily/combination skin) HOWEVER, if you don&#x27;t mind the price this product is WONDERFUL.  A little does go a long way and it absolutely sets your makeup to a smooth, soft, flawless finish.  I have olive-colored skin and while this is pure white it blends with my skin color and makeup color perfectly.  If you do not use too much (comes with directions on how to avoid this mistake) it will not accentuate your fine lines or wrinkles.  Further, it is gentle and non-drying on my maturing skin.  A quality product.</li>
    <li> really good powder to hide oil shine on face..great for combination and oily skin...</li>
    <li> bad horrible product very cakey and it reflects light very badly so you look like a ghost on pictures taken with flash</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been into basic makeup, but was very uncomfortable in public whenever there was sun beaming on my face because I felt like I looked like a cake face in the sun. I did some research and found that a translucent powder will help with that problem. I&#x27;ve had elf which didn&#x27;t seem like it did the job. And I wasn&#x27;t really in a M.A.C friendly budget so I went with the next best thing Mary Kay. And I am glad I did, the container itself is a good size for the price, I like the fact it has a lock on the inside so when you open it there won&#x27;t be a cloud of dust getting all over my clothes. It works wonders I apply it right after I finish applying my liquid makeup and I must say I was afraid of the fact that I am a Moor(of African descent) that it would show up. This really make my makeup look great. Its  a must buy for me now.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED MARY KAY PRODUCTS FOR YEARS BUT NEVER TRIED THEIR LOOSE POWDER. I REALLY LIKE IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER IT.</li>
    <li> This made me break out.</li>
    <li> I thought this powder did its job, but It does not last all day unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I was worried it would make my skin look washed out, but adds just the perfect amount of coverage, and lasts all day.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I usually use a bare mineral finishing powder which kept my makeup in place for 8-9 hours and subdued my oily t-zone. Thought I&#x27;d try this after reading the reviewed, but it didn&#x27;t do either of the things my other powder did. My t-zone was oily after an hour and I have to reapply my foundation at least twice during the day. I guess it&#x27;s different for everyone.</li>
    <li> I use  all Mary Kay for skin and much make up but could not see the purpose in this powder.  Gave it awayo my daughter.</li>
    <li> When I was first introduced to the powder, I thought no way this would work. This stuff is going to make me look like a ghost. I tried it and love it. Looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Nothing to not love. Came fast. Mary kay is actually great makeup I am a fan. This powder is not too white for anyone. It really is translucent.</li>
    <li> This powder is very soft and shear and does not make your face look like you have on too much makeup. It also only  takes a little bit. I like the fact that you can open and close the plastic cap within so you don&#x27;t get too much powder out or waste any either. The price is very good for the amount of product you get, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It worked great for setting my makeup. Without it, my make up wiped off easily and my oily skin would just seep through. The only downfall is if you put too much on, you look like a washed out doll in every picture with the flash on.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have cappuccino skin tone and I thought it would look powdery but it blends right in with my skin and looks flawless and radiant all day. I strongly recommend this product to all women.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of oiliness &amp; shine. I LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I love this product perfect finishing powder</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powder! I switched over from Maybelline&#x27;s &amp;#34;dream powder&amp;#34; (which kept cracking, so it was more like a nightmare!) and this is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t make my foundation darker like the Maybelline powder does. And yes, I made sure I matched it before. It still made it darker and gave me Oompa Loompa face! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s perfection! Now all they need to do is figure out a way to make foundation and powder kiss-proof. Lol</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay. Great products!!!!!</li>
    <li> great product! I&#x27;ve tried many other powders, but this one is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> The no color powder leaves a great finished look to your face after applying makeup.  It&#x27;s also great for a touch up during the day.</li>
    <li> This is my second time to buy this product. Great product.......</li>
    <li> I just got this product yesterday, and I do like it, but not as much as the product I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably not buy this again.</li>
    <li> As far as meeting my expectations, it definitely does, with no reservations.  My previous \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; powders (purchased at the neighborhood drug store) had, over the years, been developing more and more color in them to the point where I couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t turn my face orange.  I&#x27;d begun not using powder at all until I found this product. It doesn&#x27;t add color at all, I&#x27;m happy to say!  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
