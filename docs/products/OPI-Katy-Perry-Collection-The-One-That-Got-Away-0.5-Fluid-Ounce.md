      <li>I am very happy with this nail polish and so happy tat</li>
      <li>so I was happy to receive it.</li>
      <li>like Bright colors</li>
      <li>and this is bright.</li>
      <li>And since it&#x27;s OPI, it&#x27;s a superior product.</li>
      <li>Got 2 good bottles.</li>
      <li>and she loved it.  </li>
      <li>This color is impossibly gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I love this color!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I really liked this color</li>
      <li>A nice magenta</li>
      <li>I got it because it thought it was going to be an irridesceant kind of polish</li>
      <li>I liked the color when I saw it online, but when I got it I liked the color even more.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great magenta color with just the right amount of a glitter tone, and the durability is immaculate.</li>
      <li>and I love all the colors, but The One that Got Away is BY FAR the best of the 5.</li>
      <li>Verrrry nice color, good quality, it&#x27;s a real OPI product!</li>
      <li>i love this color.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>Holds up with a top coat.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Shame, because I really love the colour..</li>
      <li>buy it :)</li>
      <li>its also named after my favorite katy perry song.</li>
      <li>the color is okay</li>
      <li>It is a gorgeous plum with just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
      <li>Because of the metallic finish it doesn&#x27;t chip easily either.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s bright but still wearable for work &amp; professional purposes.</li>
      <li>I love this color so much that I bought three more bottles of it.</li>
      <li>It is beautiful and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>The color is a pretty color, but it looks more of a reddish, then purple like the photo.</li>
      <li>With a clear top coat, the color becomes even more shimmery.</li>
      <li>polish came quickly from the vendor, well sealed &amp; protected in a bubble wrap envelope.</li>
      <li>I especially like this color with the Black Shatter over it, although it is very nice on its own.</li>
      <li>Makes me smile when I look at my fingers &amp; toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Loving it, I use it for x-mas color nails that aren&#x27;t the traditional red but are christmasy :)</li>
      <li>great late summer fall color.</li>
      <li>i first used this color in the katy perry mini set.</li>
      <li>When I first got this nail polish, the color had separated.</li>
      <li>I have a HUGE OPI collection and this is a color I keep coming back to.</li>
      <li>can see the real color when on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When I finally tried the varnish (The One that Got Away), it only lasted a 2-3 days before it was chipping already..not so happy about that when my my others last much longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sparkly without being too much like glitter.  </li>
      <li>i thought this would be the only color i would not buy in the full size</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s pink, in darker light</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen this exact color in any other nail polish.</li>
      <li>i have completely neglected my entire collection for this one bottle.</li>
      <li>First thing I noticed was that the brush was not attached to the cap which looked a bit different from my other bottles.</li>

    <li> I really liked this color it was even prettier when I pit it on you can see the real color when on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I like Bright colors and this is bright. I am very happy with this nail polish and so happy tat I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I got it because it thought it was going to be an irridesceant kind of polish but it wasnt, the color is okay just not what I wanted, if I knew it was just going to be fuschia than i wouldnt have bought an expensice bottle of OPI.</li>
    <li> i first used this color in the katy perry mini set. i thought this would be the only color i would not buy in the full size but i was wrong, it was the exact opposite. i have completely neglected my entire collection for this one bottle. it is all i have been wearing since i got the mini months ago. now i have my 2 big bottles of it so i never run out &lt;3 i love this color. its a berry/ purpley shimmery sparkly bottle of wonders. its also named after my favorite katy perry song. buy it :)</li>
    <li> The color arrived and it looks nothing like the pic. The color is a pretty color, but it looks more of a reddish, then purple like the photo. And plus it has glitter in it.</li>
    <li> Gift for grandaughter and she loved it.  They are into OPI Nail Polish just as I am.  It is beautiful and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Verrrry nice color, good quality, it&#x27;s a real OPI product!</li>
    <li> This color is impossibly gorgeous. It&#x27;s a deep berry pink with subtle shimmery glitter. Love it! And since it&#x27;s OPI, it&#x27;s a superior product.</li>
    <li> I have the ENTIRE Katy Perry OPI collection and I love all the colors, but The One that Got Away is BY FAR the best of the 5. it&#x27;s a great magenta color with just the right amount of a glitter tone, and the durability is immaculate. I love this color so much that I bought three more bottles of it. With a clear top coat, the color becomes even more shimmery. I love it. Highly reccomend.</li>
    <li> The best&lt;br /&gt;Luv the color!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a pixie, you need this polish!  I use a purple coat under this + a shiny topcoat and I dazzle!!!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is impossible to find in stores anymore, and I&#x27;m a huge Katy Perry fan so I was happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> This color is great for all seasons! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed was that the brush was not attached to the cap which looked a bit different from my other bottles. When I finally tried the varnish (The One that Got Away), it only lasted a 2-3 days before it was chipping already..not so happy about that when my my others last much longer. Shame, because I really love the colour..</li>
    <li> Got it as described. Holds up with a top coat. I love the color. I Got it at a salon, and had to have it! :) Loving it, I use it for x-mas color nails that aren&#x27;t the traditional red but are christmasy :)</li>
    <li> When I first got this nail polish, the color had separated. Shaking the bottle didn&#x27;t seem to help. However, after a while, the nail polish settled, making it look the way it did in the photo.</li>
    <li> I liked the color when I saw it online, but when I got it I liked the color even more.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen this exact color in any other nail polish. It&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s pink, in darker light it looks a cherry color, it&#x27;s sparkles, it&#x27;s metallic, it&#x27;s everything! Wear this and people will ask \\&quot;so where&#x27;s the party?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I especially like this color with the Black Shatter over it, although it is very nice on its own. It matches a lot of the colors of the clothes I wear. I&#x27;m thinking of getting a bottle for my nail technician as she always checks the name on the bottom of the bottle after polishing my nails.</li>
    <li> I have a HUGE OPI collection and this is a color I keep coming back to. It is a gorgeous plum with just the right amount of shimmer. Usually I am not a huge shimmer fan but this is just vampy enough that it works. I always get compliments on this color.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  It&#x27;s sparkly without being too much like glitter.  Because of the metallic finish it doesn&#x27;t chip easily either.  A nice magenta that&#x27;s bright but still wearable for work &amp; professional purposes. Makes me smile when I look at my fingers &amp; toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish came quickly from the vendor, well sealed &amp; protected in a bubble wrap envelope.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely manner.  Got 2 good bottles.</li>
    <li> I looked every where for this color and was very happy when I found it here. Lots of compliments on the color. great late summer fall color.</li>
