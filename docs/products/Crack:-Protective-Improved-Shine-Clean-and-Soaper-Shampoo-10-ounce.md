      <li>once they get you hooked they don&#x27;t give you the good stuff) which it did have the appearance of because it had &amp;#34;separated&amp;#34; thereby looking grainy even though it was not grainy in texture.</li>
      <li>If Anson Mount from Hell On Wheels uses this then you know it&#x27;s got to be good.</li>

      <li>It Makes my hair so soft and smells great!</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and frizzy around my hairline.</li>
      <li>Shampoo delivered very quickly!</li>
      <li>OR that Prolock knows exactly how to make a great product</li>
      <li>, I wish there was more of a lather</li>
      <li>Once of the better shampoos in my opinion.</li>

      <li>It did feel stripped but the conditioner more than made up for it.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more</li>
      <li>Love this for my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Lightweight but with a very rich lather.  </li>
      <li>My stylist recommended the cream for my fine, somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>It def made my hair a light shinier....</li>
      <li>Overall loved it and will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>so I broke down and bough it on Amazon, and the price was very good.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair squeaky clean</li>
      <li>and I can say all I needed was one wash to clean the henna out.</li>
      <li>I would rather prolock used the good stuff--I would certainly pay more to get the same quality I got out of the packet!</li>
      <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t feel super clean though.</li>
      <li>I was a Biolage girl myself been a loyal follower for 8yrs, but my hair just never seemed to change.</li>
      <li>this shampoo does exactly that!</li>
      <li>Trust me its worth the money.</li>
      <li>Shampoo works pretty well</li>
      <li>This means the product is being cut with water (funny its called crack....</li>
      <li>My hair color would wash out and who wants to go to the salon and pay 100s for a color to just wash out.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to use so much.</li>
      <li>I really like these products they work wonders on color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>other shampoos leaves my hair feeling healthy and shiny</li>
      <li>It left my hair extra clean and full of body...but smooth at the same time.</li>
      <li>, uses this better quality stuff for samples then makes a less quality product.</li>
      <li>I tend to be allergic to something in shampoos/conditioners and try to go as natural as I can.</li>
      <li>Soft scent.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this item from any of my professional distributors</li>
      <li>Soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I sell professional hair products and have for about 13 years now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tough to find a sulfate and paraban free shampoo that actually works up a descent &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; and leaves your hair clean....</li>
      <li>My daughter has super thick, curly, semi-dry hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Does not lather well.  Smells a bit icky.  Has the same effect as Crack that you put on damp hair.  I prefer the after-shampoo stuff.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo... I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I sell professional hair products and have for about 13 years now. I received a sample of this product from my sister and it was phenomenal! It left my hair extra clean and full of body...but smooth at the same time. I couldn&#x27;t find this item from any of my professional distributors so I broke down and bough it on Amazon, and the price was very good. However,the item I received was not of the same quality  as the sample I had tried ( as another reviewer noted.) This means the product is being cut with water (funny its called crack....once they get you hooked they don&#x27;t give you the good stuff) which it did have the appearance of because it had &amp;#34;separated&amp;#34; thereby looking grainy even though it was not grainy in texture. OR that Prolock knows exactly how to make a great product, uses this better quality stuff for samples then makes a less quality product. I would rather prolock used the good stuff--I would certainly pay more to get the same quality I got out of the packet!</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo with it&#x27;s delicious aroma, great lathering, and easy rinsing. Once of the better shampoos in my opinion.</li>

    <li> prompt delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo. I tend to be allergic to something in shampoos/conditioners and try to go as natural as I can. This shampoo worked great and no itching! Yay!!</li>
    <li> I really like these products they work wonders on color treated hair.  After washing and conditioning it leaves my hair feeling AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Hair doesn&#x27;t feel super clean though.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of &amp;#34;Crack&amp;#34; from my hair dresser, and I was &amp;#34;hooked! My hair is very fine and frizzy around my hairline. The shampoo added volume and smoothness.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works pretty well, I wish there was more of a lather so I didn&#x27;t have to use so much. A little expensive</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called Crack for a reason. You honestly wont want to be with out this shampoo. I was a Biolage girl myself been a loyal follower for 8yrs, but my hair just never seemed to change. My hair color would wash out and who wants to go to the salon and pay 100s for a color to just wash out. My stylist told me about this shampoo and I haven&#x27;t looked back since I made the switch. The shampoo takes some time to get use to. It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as others do but thats a good thing. It really gets down and dirty with your dirty hair and gets it super clean. I am addicted to this shampoo. Trust me its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this for my color treated hair. Works great, smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used my hair is not dry and has helped with fly away hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a year now and love it! It&#x27;s tough to find a sulfate and paraban free shampoo that actually works up a descent &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; and leaves your hair clean....this shampoo does exactly that!</li>
    <li> My daughter has super thick, curly, semi-dry hair and we have not noticed a difference in this hair line :( Was so hoping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but too expensive</li>
    <li> Crack head addict lol love this shampoo it doesnt lather like other shampoos leaves my hair feeling healthy and shiny i bought this along with the conditioner and together its a win win. i am now waiting on crack leave in products to come. cant go wrong with these products</li>
    <li> Lightweight but with a very rich lather.  Soft scent.</li>
    <li> I used this after hennaing my hair and I can say all I needed was one wash to clean the henna out. I also use lots of products so I need a real good shampoo to get the product buildup out. This did the job. It did feel stripped but the conditioner more than made up for it. See my review about the Crack conditioner. Overall loved it and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> The shampoo, conditioner and styling cream are all great. My stylist recommended the cream for my fine, somewhat frizzy hair. The products have turned it into something manageable. I also believe I&#x27;m losing less hair, perhaps because it&#x27;s easier to style.</li>
    <li> Growing my hair out and it keeps my hair under wraps while growing out. Soft and manageable. Love!  CRACK ADDICT  LOL!</li>
    <li> It lathers soo well. Leaves your hair squeaky clean</li>
    <li> Shampoo delivered very quickly! I love this stuff! It Makes my hair so soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> not quite the same as the product I received from my hairdresser...like this product, but I question the quality.  Texture and fragrance is different...</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! It is amazing.  My hair never looked so healthy!</li>
