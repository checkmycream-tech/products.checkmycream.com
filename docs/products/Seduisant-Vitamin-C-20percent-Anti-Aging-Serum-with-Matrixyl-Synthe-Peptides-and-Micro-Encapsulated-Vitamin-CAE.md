<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I look 10 years younger.  I always get complement on my skin.</li>
    <li> Using this product once a day didn&#x27;t seem to do much. So I started using it morning and night and it seems to be working. It seems to smooth and brighten my skin. This doesn&#x27;t make me break out either. Customer service has been great.</li>
    <li> I love the Vitamin C Serum.  It feels great on.  I&#x27;m 50 years old and have very few wrinkles.  However, I have been using anti aging products since my early 20s.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this product.  I would heartily recommend it.  The longer I use it the more noticeable the benefit. Vitamin C is great for protecting the skin from sun damage.</li>
    <li> I used it when I first got it. Not so much now, but I am going to start again. Great smell and texture.</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant scent and nice feel.  Non-greasy and hasn&#x27;t broken me out.  I don&#x27;t like the eyedropper.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for visible results.  I have no lines and wrinkles but am using this to prevent sagging and to lighten dark marks.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price is very good.  However, they have changed the packaging for the product. It used to come in a bottle with a dropper. Now, they have switched to a pump container, which in my experience means you get less product! This is due to the fact that there is always a small amount left in there that can&#x27;t be retrieved. I know this as I purchase other product that come in the same types of containers. I always end up cutting the tops off and sure enough, there is a good amount of product left.  I will have to reassess my next purchase as this may not be a good value any longer.  Unless of course, they start putting more product in to compensate for the amount you lose.  FAT CHANCE!</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product. My skin has never looked or felt better. I have very sensitive skin and was worried this would be too greasy and cause breakouts  etc. It goes on like silk and has certainly improved my complexion no end. I have recently tried another brand of Vit C and will go back to this one for sure.</li>
    <li> Update:!!! I still love this stuff and use it daily. I wanted to share that the glass bottle has been changed to a pump system!! This is great being the glass bottle dispenser was messy and waisted a lot.  I&#x27;m writing again! I&#x27;ve used this stuff for months and for some reason decided to try a new brand:( Stupid me. It was two weeks later I ordered more of this stuff. It helps my skin to not break out while giving it all the benefits of C,A,E and peptides. It&#x27;s hard to fine an all in one and this one is it! So sorry I strayed...lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. It feels luxurious on the skin. Very light-weight. No unpleasant odor. Very nice, subtle scent. No burning or irritation when applied. I have very sensitive skin and cannot tolerate anything that irritates, burns, or feels &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing and exfoliating, using a loofa facial, I apply this serum; smoothing it over my entire face, including my sensitive eye area, and my skin feels and looks wonderful. Then I apply Cerave moisturizer with hyuralonic acid and my skin feels nourished and baby soft, with a bit of a glow.&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing, exfoliating, this product, along with the Cerave moisturizer has all the ingredients needed to help in healing aged, sun-damaged skin. Used in conjunction with a good SPF, protecting my face from the sun (wear a hat) and being committed to the care of my skin, I can&#x27;t see not having improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I can&#x27;t be lazy, and think there&#x27;s one magic serum. Just being realistic. : )&lt;br /&gt;Thus far my skin is loving it.</li>
    <li> thank you. great product!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this new serum for a short time but have already noticed my smile lines are disappearing and my age spots are fading. I also love the consistency and the way it makes my skin look and feel. I love it!</li>
    <li> GOES ON LIKE A DRY OIL AND SKIN ABSORBS IT QUICKLY. SMELLS LIKE VIT C LIQUID FORM. CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE IN ABSORPTION AND FEEL OF MY FACE. TOO EARLY TO SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES, BUT LOVE IT SO FAR</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2HM0F11EH2DX9]]This serum is a really great product to use if you have dehydrated, dull, aging, or just tired looking skin. The smell is really great-clean and fresh, and the product fills really good when applied before your moisturizer and after your toner. I would recommend this and would repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**FTC-I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Seduisant Vitamin C Serum.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This serum has made a huge difference in my complexion. I have been using this for only two months and the age spots are fading and so are the wrinkles.  I have never endorsed a product before but this really works.  I am a 67 year old female and have used a lot of serums and this  is one I will never be without.</li>
    <li> I waited to leave feedback so that I could use this serum for a month and I have to say I love it! I see a definite improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes and my skin looks smoother and softer... I will order again!</li>
    <li> Great product. I been using for 2 month now and love.</li>
    <li> I am 57 and have been using this product for  the past few weeks and notice an improvement in my skin, my face is brighter, less lines under my eyes and my forehead lines are softer.....Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I did not give this a 5 star simply because I have only been using this product not quite a month.  I do notice that the fine lines are becoming less noticeable. I was applying the product both morning and night, but have stopped the morning usage for a couple of reasons.  First of all, I have been breaking out a bit; not sure though if it&#x27;s from the product.  The other reason is that it states one must use sunscreen because of the ingredients in the product and although I use a face moisterizer that contains sunscreen, I avoid putting it on my upper eyelid as sometimes it gets into my eyes and it stings. Therefore, I avoid putting the product on my upper eyelid, which defeats the purpose of trying to lessen the wrinkles in that area. For the most part, I do like the product and will purchase another bottle when I use up this bottle, as I think the more one uses it the better the results.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST serum I have used.  I have tried several but none made my face feel as soft as this.  I can see the difference using this serum has made.  I am on my 2nd bottle and will buy more.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels when I use this product.  I do see a difference in my skin tone as well.  I would definitely recommend this product and will be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I really hoped that this would work. Bought it for dark spots on the skin. Used it for 2 months and saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.</li>
    <li> Feels really good on the face, but has not as yet reduced the couple of wrinkles I am really trying to reduce without any surgery.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Would definitely recommend to a friend, it makes my face feel super soft and velvety, and reduces wrinkles. I am a recurrent customer of this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I was a little concern about ordering this, because it was in a liquid form, and in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I always thought creams would work best. When I received the item at home and saw that it was oily looking I thought Mm! this might not be what I wanted, but as soon as I put it on my face it felt incredible my face felt and look smooth and&lt;br /&gt;there was no oily residue. Basically my skin absorbed it all. It was not just a wonderful feeling, but a much better skin. Even my husband notice the difference, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and a half. My husband was so impress with the results that he ask me to put some in his face, and trust me when I say this, but he barely likes any type of cream or anything on his face. Ever since I&#x27;ve been using these product I barely use make up, as I love the way my skins feels and looks. I know I sound like a commercial, but I just love the product from every angle. A+++</li>
    <li> I really like the seduisant formula. It feels nice on my skin and absorbs real quick without leaving my skin feeling greasy. I use it quite liberally (I use a whole bottle like every three weeks) but the goal for me is to protect my face and neck during the day while helping to prevent any new wrinkles. I would say try it!</li>
    <li> I do love it and will continue to use it daily.+</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, and the buying experiences I&#x27;ve had with distributor has been awesome as well!!!!!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to have great skin.</li>
    <li> Great. I&#x27;m buying this kook-aid!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I recently tried another brand, but I did not like at all. with this serum, my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
    <li> While I am very satisfied with the quality of the serum itself. It has been over shadowed by the dropper. If this product included a pump. I would gladly repurchase but since the dropper is horrible Anna I cannot control the amount of product being used I will be looking for another serum. It really is a shame. I LOVE the serum but I&#x27;ve used more than half a bottle and a lot has been wasted. It is very disappointing. Please change to a pump.. or at the very least offer a pump option. It could even cost more but this way it a packaging fail :(</li>
    <li> The delivery time was great, and I love the way this product feels on my skin.  Although you may think from the feel, it&#x27;s an oil, it isn&#x27;t. Seduisant totally absorbs and leaves your face silky smooth. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of month now, but I really don&#x27;t notice a difference, but then I just turned 70.</li>
    <li> Made my face tingle in a good way.</li>
    <li> feels like silk ..not greasy ...and best of all it works!</li>
    <li> I tried a few vitamin c serums before I discovered this one, looking for one that was not too watery or sticky. This new Seduisant serum feels like satin on my skin and really glides on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a lot of research on vitamin c serums and read that the micro encapsulated vitamin c is way more effectively absorbed into the skin. I also love the light scent that it has. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, so I&#x27;ll update when I have more results to post.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I have been using it for six months and have seen a dramatic improvement in my skin tone and texture. Also, a reduction in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchsed Seduisant for the first time almost a year ago.  I did some research to find other ingredients that my serum should include and Seduisant passed with flying colors.  The reasonable price was a final selling point.  I figured I would just use it on days I would be around the house and didn&#x27;t need make up, as I was a thirty year Estee Lauder skin care veteran.  The first day that I tried Seduisant I was pleased with the way it made my skin feel.  Soft and definitely not greasy.  Soon, it became my night time treatment and while I continue to use some EL products, Seduisant is now my go to serum for the big stuff.  It has also served in many small ways.  I season my make up sponges with a few drops so when I do need them my foundation goes on effortlessly because, thanks to Seduisant, my skin is in good shape and so are my sponges.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with product!  The increase in compliments tells me that what I am feeling is also showing.  Not a bad thing!</li>
    <li> I am older, so I find this product a little drying.  I use moisturizer over it, but I end up skipping days between use so my skin gets a break.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Has a lovely smell. Not greasy. Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> Extremely lightweight and not sticky. My face feeling smooth and silky. I have been using it at night and will definitely be ordering more</li>
    <li> The product feels wonderful on my skin and has a subtle orange scent .  I haven&#x27;t noticed a real change in the look of my wrinkles, but it did take 67 years to get them so it may take awhile to diminish them!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Seduisant Vitamin C Serum for about 2 months now.  I absolutely love it!  It has reduced my wrinkles around my eyes, lighted my dark spots and generally brightened the look of my skin.  It feels so smooth on my skin when I apply it.  I started out using the serum in the morning and in the evening, but now I find I can use it just once a day and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Have noticed a slight difference but only use it once a day as I&#x27;m finishing up some other serums.  Perhaps in time I&#x27;ll see more of a change.</li>
    <li> Its a very, very, very smooth serum. I have 3 months using this and the results are very appreciable.  No odor or fragrance on it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Whenever I run out of my serum I can tell a difference in my skin. The moment I start using it again my skin looks brighter, clearer, younger, smoother and it give me a beautiful glow. It also allows me to use less makeup and provides a very smooth base for my foundation. I always get compliments on my skin when I am using this and I can finally go foundation free if I want!!</li>
    <li> I have been in the beauty business for over 35 years and have sold many beauty products in two of my hair salons, this one really works.!!!! Facial wrinkles seem to diminish and one is left with a very smooth and silky result.The odor is enjoyable too. I am a very pleased customer.</li>
    <li> Tried a few different brands-this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could!! This serum feels like silk on my face. I will be using this serum for a very long time. I&#x27;m in my sixties and these fine lines appeared on my face, this product will an answer o help these lines fade . Thank you to the maker of vitamin C Serum. Karen Hogan</li>
