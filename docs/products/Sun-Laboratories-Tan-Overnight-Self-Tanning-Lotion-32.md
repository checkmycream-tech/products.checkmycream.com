      <li>Ps use rubber gloves :)</li>
      <li>I love Sun Labortories sunless tanner.</li>
      <li>but I see this lovely glow on my legs</li>
      <li>In even wearing it today :)</li>
      <li>The color turns out perfect and doesn&#x27;t streak or anything, and because it has olive undertones, it actually makes me look tan, not orange.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>My friend had better luck</li>
      <li>I have read most of the reviews before I did this purchase</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be more pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>product is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>Really glad I got the 32 oz size my spouse decided to use it also, waited to see how it looked.  </li>

      <li>Being a Amazon prime member had it in two days again outstanding.</li>
      <li>I have had so many compliments on my tan and people can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s out of a bottle.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure and wash your hands.</li>
      <li>okay, too.</li>
      <li>Have never found a better self tanner.  </li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>I love how this self tanner gives my legs just a hint of color.  </li>
      <li>I love that I can put it on, put on my makeup or do my hair</li>
      <li>The downside is that is best to have someone either apply it or spot you while you are applying it since you can get streaks if not applied properly</li>
      <li>First of all, like everybody said, the lotion smells great, lovely light almond scent and this gives out a lovely lovely tan without the orange.</li>
      <li>Nope, colour stays on pretty well, and it stays on for a good 2-3 days, and now my thighs are</li>
      <li>great natural looking tan!</li>
      <li>Great natural looking color (not orange).</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I breakout easily and this does not bother my skin at all, which in itself amazes me.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a strong self-tanner smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the many years that I&#x27;ve been using this tanner, it has never made my legs &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;, nor does it leave streaks or bold spots.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t stink as much and love that it is an overnight tan as that is the way to go!</li>
      <li>I paid $50 for this bottle, which is HUGE.  </li>
      <li>Hassle free tanning at home and</li>
      <li>I am soooo happy I bought a big bottle</li>
      <li>so I suppose my real reason for loving this product is the COLOR</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly, there is a tint to it</li>
      <li>For pale skin, the medium one is perfect if you just want a sun kissed appearance.  </li>
      <li>okay they&#x27;re all pretty easy to use</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use, dries fast without streaking and the color is natural-looking.</li>
      <li>Good even tan with a minimal smell that us much more tolerable than any others I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
      <li>it really looks pretty good, but if you use this on your face, which I rarely do or your legs after shaving it will sit in your pores and make you look spotty.  </li>
      <li>Noticable &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; RIGHT AWAY!</li>
      <li>you leak/sweat brown.....not so cool.....</li>
      <li>So next time, I&#x27;ll probably be using a drug store brand with good ratings.  </li>
      <li>Actually looks very good and natural.</li>
      <li>so the tanner comes off quickly.</li>
      <li>it goes on dark and the color is great.</li>
      <li>More of a natural color, not orange at all!</li>
      <li>Comes out smelling great gets a self tanner smell after a few hours but just jump in the shower.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about it.  </li>
      <li>Invest on an sponge applicator is worth it too</li>
      <li>and I think it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>I just put in on right after I shower and towel</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Noticable &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; RIGHT AWAY!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have ever used.  I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about it.  I love the instant tint you get when first applying (a little instant gratification) and then the gradual darkening as the day goes on.  I have found that the best way to apply is with gloves and then after I use a cotton pad to apply the tanner to the tops of my hands, that way your hands don&#x27;t need to be scrubbed .  I use it all over including my face.  I breakout easily and this does not bother my skin at all, which in itself amazes me.  It doesn&#x27;t have a horrid smell and besides being a great tanner, I have found it to be one of the best moisturizers too.  My skin feels great since I started using this product.  It&#x27;s so soft and silky.  My skin usually turns orange when I try sunless tanners and this is the first one that does not do that.  I have had so many compliments on my tan and people can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s out of a bottle.  The only drawbacks I have found, and this will happen with most sunless tanners, is don&#x27;t wear white the day you apply and don&#x27;t go to the gym the day you apply, even if it&#x27;s 8 or 10 hours later.....you leak/sweat brown.....not so cool.....especially if you&#x27;re wearing a white t-shirt.....lol.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! My sister loved it, she has fair skin tone (MAC NC25) and when she applied it her legs looked AMAZING. The downside is that is best to have someone either apply it or spot you while you are applying it since you can get streaks if not applied properly and once it dries is hard to correct them. I am a MAC NC42 skin tone and I cannot wait to try the darker shade because this shade on me it didn&#x27;t work, it was the same shade as me so you cannot tell I had it on. Invest on an sponge applicator is worth it too</li>
    <li> All time BEST tanning lotion!!!!!! There is no smell AT ALL and absolutely no streaking (I use a mitt when applying). I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 years, and have not needed to indoor tan for over a year. I even apply this to my face with no breakouts. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Easiest self-tanner I&#x27;be ever used, okay they&#x27;re all pretty easy to use so I suppose my real reason for loving this product is the COLOR and it gives me that instant tan I need/want (no sun for this healthy gal).</li>
    <li> Did Not turn orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed with body lotion and applied to skin...............  Washed hands immediately afterward and no tell tale orange hands.  Love, Love, Love this lotion!  This 32 oz size will last all summer and winter.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered quickly which was great but streaked and turned legs an orangish color.  Couldn&#x27;t shower fast enough and scrub with the loofa to remove.  My friend had better luck so I&#x27;ll give it one more try...  Hope to be able to increase my rating of this product after 2nd try.</li>
    <li> The Self Tanning Lotion Tan Overnight Instant Tint in Medium works well for me. This product is very easy to use, dries fast without streaking and the color is natural-looking. I don&#x27;t notice a strong self-tanner smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product deserves a five star rating, but I only awarded four based on the description alone. The product description reads \\&quot;Sun Laboratories Tan Overnight Self Tanning Lotion 32 - Size-32 oz. -Case Qty-6\\&quot;, but you only receive one 32 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with the lotion and delivery time, but disappointed with the inaccurate description.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak or look bad. Actually looks very good and natural. I had a tanning bed until a scrape and burn done on my upper arm. Only need to redo it once a week. Smells okay, too.</li>
    <li> This particular bottle was the consistency of clay. If you could get it to spread evenly on your skin, it gave you a decent tan overnight.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell pleasant, it blends smoothly and tans within a few hrs without making you look like an oompa loompa. It lasts well over a week depending on how often you exfoliate... I love this. Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. In even wearing it today :)</li>
    <li> Not orange ! Comes out smelling great gets a self tanner smell after a few hours but just jump in the shower. There&#x27;s no streaking and if you feel uneven just was off that spot an re apply. Color does come off in the shower but not a lot but if you shave you will lose a lot of color. I have to apply to my face daily bc I was my face twice a day so the tanner comes off quickly. Very natural color I am pleased! Ps use rubber gloves :)</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that does NOT turn me orange!!!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat fair skin, and I love this product!  Because it&#x27;s too dark just on it&#x27;s own (for my skin type) I actually mix it with my regular body lotion and apply it that way.  The color turns out perfect and doesn&#x27;t streak or anything, and because it has olive undertones, it actually makes me look tan, not orange.  To top it off, the price was way lower than anywhere else I looked for it!</li>
    <li> Product is great but I&#x27;ve gotten 2 pumps and neither one works.</li>
    <li> More of a natural color, not orange at all! The instant tint does come off in the shower, but still my fav self tanner out there! Doesn&#x27;t make me break out when I use it on my face, either.</li>
    <li> So overall I would say this product is ok, but for the cost I would not purchase again.  On places like my chest, stomach and arms it really looks pretty good, but if you use this on your face, which I rarely do or your legs after shaving it will sit in your pores and make you look spotty.  On my legs it looked like I had a terrible razor burn.  Not exactly cute.  So next time, I&#x27;ll probably be using a drug store brand with good ratings.  This product is just too expensive for any imperfections.  Sort of a bummer.</li>
    <li> Natural color on lighter skin.  No orange color.  Easy to apply.  Would be helpful to wear gloves during application.  Have never found a better self tanner.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product over 10 years ago and I couldn&#x27;t live without it during the summer months today. Mix with your regular lotion and you won&#x27;t have that dried out orange look that others give you. Big piece of advice: wash your hands or they will be black. That&#x27;s how dark it is. Don&#x27;t hesitate to spend the money on the 32oz. It will last forever. It doesn&#x27;t take much when mixed with regular lotion. Love Love Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome beautiful color. Doesn&#x27;t stink as much and love that it is an overnight tan as that is the way to go! Doesn&#x27;t stain sheets. The only recommendation I have is to wear gloves when applying. It&#x27;s impossible to wash off hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 2 months ago and have loved the results! It is the best self-tanning product I have ever tried. There are no issues with the color leaving streaks or stains.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner! it goes on dark and the color is great. applies very well. Just make sure and wash your hands. Doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I found it because of a blog post and it delvers an awesome brown tan that looks really natural. I would recommend either wearing gloves while applying this, or just scrub the palms of your hands with baking soda to get the staining off. BONUS: it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> great natural looking tan!</li>
    <li> It will streak if you are not careful.  You have to be careful, but does leave a nice dark tan.</li>
    <li> This looks natural, but dosent last as long as a spray tan, needs to be applied about every 3 days, smell is great, but becomes more stinky as day wears on</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product as the reviews all seemed great. I have used several other self-tanning products in the past that weren&#x27;t really all that great. They either fade very quickly, smell terrible, or cost way to much. I use to be a tanning bed junkie, then a spray tan junkie, both of which can become very expensive habits as well as wreck havoc on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a fair price for a quality product, and the size is great...it&#x27;ll last me more than 2 weeks. I like that it gives you an instant bronze tint, with color that develops quickly in a few hours. It didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or bed sheets but I did wear loose garments after I applied it, and I waited about an hour before I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and unfortunately after applied about a dime size amount of this tanner to me face, I went from clear skin to having several whiteheads within about 12 hours. I just wont use this on my face anymore, but the color is great, it doesn&#x27;t streak, and it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I love Sun Labortories sunless tanner. Great natural looking color (not orange). Easy to apply. I use latex gloves to apply it.  Does have a slight sunless tanner smell but not nearly as bad as most sunless products. I apply twice to three times a week and expect this bottle to last 6 months.</li>
    <li> I like the product. And it adds a hint of color. Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange at all.  I find that this works best using half of my regular body lotion mixed with half of this tanning lotion.  I always get less streaks this way yet plenty of color.</li>
    <li> I am SO disappointed. My daughter has been a loyal user of Sun Labs for over a year and absolutely LOVES their self tanner. I received this product in a card board box with absolutely nothing padding the product. The tanner had come open in the box and was all over. My daughter had homecoming that weekend so I decided to brush it off and have her use the product anyway because we didn&#x27;t have enough time to order a new one. For a while, my daughter thought that the product was a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but continued to use it. It is now a month later and it is very clear that we have received a knock off product. The product washes off immediately in the shower, unlike the previous bottle of Sun Labs she had. And the packaging is slightly different. The new bottle is a bit bigger and the bar codes are in different writing than the original one. Also, on the back of the bottle where it says &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34; the new bottle has these weird signs DRAWN on with pen that are supposed to represent animal cruelty free I suppose. I write this as I am comparing the two bottles right in front of me. DO NOT buy from this distributor because most likely you&#x27;ll receive a fake product.</li>
    <li> Great product, being a skin cancer patient and a lover of the outdoors and being in the sun, Sun Labs. product is outstanding.  Must admit was dubious at first due to the colour of the product but alas no yellow or orange colouring.  It is really a natural looking tan.  Really glad I got the 32 oz size my spouse decided to use it also, waited to see how it looked.  Other products made me look orange and my knees and elbows would look lousy but not with Sun Labs.  Being a Amazon prime member had it in two days again outstanding.</li>
    <li> I used to be an avid bed tanner...I finally got my act together and gave it up. I found this self tanner and I&#x27;ve never looked back! It gives me am awesome color, doesn&#x27;t have any smell, goes exactly where I put it and never ever gives me streaks. This stuff is the ultimate self tanner. If you&#x27;re looking for the very best don&#x27;t even try any others because eventually you will wind up here in your pursuit for the ultimate self tanner.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SELF TANNER. .COMPLETELY NATURAL LOOK..EVERYONE LOVES MY NATURAL  LOOKING TAN....NO ORANGE OR STREAKING. IF YOU WANT THE BEST NATURAL LOOKING  TAN  LOOK NO FURTHER.&lt;br /&gt;THE PLASTIC SURGEON MY FRIEND WENT TO SELLS THIS AT HER OFFICE&#x27;....AT A UNBELIEVABLE PRICE COMPARED TO WHAT ONE CAN GET IT FROM HERE.....</li>
    <li> I paid $50 for this bottle, which is HUGE.  It should last me a while and I think it was worth it.  I have medium complexion, brown hair, brown eyes.  It&#x27;s great for getting a little color since I don&#x27;t tan outside, and don&#x27;t like doing tanning beds.  It definitely gives an overnight tan. I like the results on my face, especially to give a little color.  The smell isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as the old school tanning lotions, but it&#x27;s there.  Jergens has a new gradual tanning lotion that actually smells kinda good, but it&#x27;s very a gradual tan. The slight smell of the Sun Labs is worth it for the more dramatic effects of an overnight tan. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin is very, VERY fair and because of this fairness, I don&#x27;t tan, I bake, as red as a lobster &#x3D;)  I love how this self tanner gives my legs just a hint of color.  I particularly love that it gives an instant tint, just enough to reduce the paleness of my legs with a little color.  I use the medium one and it works for me just perfectly.  Being so pale, I don&#x27;t really want to look &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; per say. I want just enough color to look &amp;#34;sun-kissed&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply the tanner, I start by removing the hair of my legs with Nair.  I then exfoliate my legs, I towel dry AND I use latex globes to apply the tanner.  I then pump two or three pumps of the tanner into the palm of my gloved hand and I start applying the tanner to my leg in a circular,&lt;br /&gt;firm and fast motion.  It is not necessary to rush but you don&#x27;t want to allow it to dry either. I leave my knee, my foot and my ankle for last.  This way I can apply whatever is left on the glove in a &amp;#34;brush away&amp;#34; motion, sparingly.  These areas don&#x27;t require much product, and this way, they don&#x27;t get darker than the leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, there is a tint to it so you can see exactly where you are applying it.  In the many years that I&#x27;ve been using this tanner, it has never made my legs &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;, nor does it leave streaks or bold spots.  Gotta love that!  It has a pleasant scent.  I apply it and then I wait a minimum of 15 to 30 minutes before I put on clothes and its never stained my clothes or my bedsheets.  I love that I can put it on, put on my makeup or do my hair and then I can get dressed and go, love that instant tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other tanners in the past and the smell alone would give me major headaches.  This one does not.  It isn&#x27;t sticky, It does not provide sunblock so I make it a point to apply sun block if I&#x27;m headed to the beach. It last a few days, I would say three or four days.  By the time the hair on my legs need to be removed again, it is time toreapply the tanner anyways.  To remove the tan, I just apply Nair, or shave and the tint goes away completely.  I also make it a point to apply moisturizing body lotion every night on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I was getting the 8 oz size and it has lasted a very long time, like a year of regular use on my legs only.  This time, I ordered the big daddy, the 32 oz bottle, its more cost effective since it&#x27;s a product that I have been using on a long term bases for years.  I&#x27;m thinking this should last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as delivery, I placed my order on 5/20 and I received it on 5/26.  It came very well packaged.  There was no leakage at all and the bottle appears to be intact.  Happy with the deliver and packaging of my tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly an awesome product.  Hope they never discontinue it! For pale skin, the medium one is perfect if you just want a sun kissed appearance.  It is easy to apply, easy to remove.  Hassle free tanning at home and the more you use it, the more you become an expert on how much product you need and how to apply it perfectly to obtain the best results for your body.</li>
    <li> I am a fairly pale person and this tanning lotion gives a natural tint/glow, It looks as if I had been sun bathing for a week! The lotion is dark when you apply it - you must wash your hands immediately after applying. I have noticed some streaks or dark spots, but only in tricky locations (like wrists and feet); just try to rub in completely. Best tanning lotion I have ever bought!</li>
    <li> Good even tan with a minimal smell that us much more tolerable than any others I&#x27;ve tried...good even color, as well</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. I use it almost daily for a healthy glow. It has not clogged my pours.  You can see immediately what your tan will look like and takes a short time to develop. After a&lt;br /&gt;couple of hours you are tan.  Does not take all nite.NO SMELL . That is the best part. I have several other brands in my closet that I dont use due to the odor.  Tan lasts a few days like most others.  Would&lt;br /&gt;purchase again.  Does NOT look yellow.</li>
    <li> I normally love this product, but every once in a while I get a bottle that just doesn&#x27;t tan very dark at all.  I don&#x27;t know if something happened with the formula, but it is disappointing to buy such a large quantity, only to find it is not as effective as expected.</li>
    <li> First time ever self-tan lotion user. I can&#x27;t be more pleased with the product. I have read most of the reviews before I did this purchase and I have to tell you it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. I went ahead and bought the 32oz bottle. After reading all positive 5 stars reviews, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get a big bottle. First of all, like everybody said, the lotion smells great, lovely light almond scent and this gives out a lovely lovely tan without the orange. I used gloves like everybody recommended and I didn&#x27;t exfoliate before I put it on. I just put in on right after I shower and towel dry. I kinda freaked a little when I saw how dark brown the lotion is when it came out of bottle as I ordered medium. I rubbed it good on both my legs. It appeared slight streaky after application but I read reviews saying not to worry. First application I did it straight out of bottle and rubbed them on my legs. Doesn&#x27;t give you a whole lot of colour right after one application. So I did a second application but this time I mix in some of my regular body lotion. Still not a whole lot darker right the way but since this is an overnight lotion, I waited about an hour before I went to bed. Was still a bit sticky when I went to bed and colour didnt come off on sheet. Next morning, some colour came off in the shower but I see this lovely glow on my legs and I can&#x27;t be happier. They look pretty even, except I could have rub it on better on the areas below my inside ankles, thats the only spot where I see unevenness. I was worried that colour will come off when I applied my sunblock lotion on legs, as I am allergic to sun so this sunless lotion is a God sent. Nope, colour stays on pretty well, and it stays on for a good 2-3 days, and now my thighs are inner calves still got some color to it after 4 days but the outside of my calves colour has started to fade due the rubbing of outside calves when I have my legs crossed. I am soooo happy I bought a big bottle and I HIGHLY recommend this product!!I only experiment it on my legs for the first time and now I cant wait to apply it to rest of my body.  UPDATE: I have developed an allergic reaction to the lotion after several use, now my skin break out in hives after use. I have since stop using the product and now I wish I bought the 8oz bottle instead of the 32oz.</li>
    <li> best self tanning lotion I have ever used. I bought it 2 years ago and I still have a lot left. I use gloves to put it on and then do my hands after, product lasts for days. soon as this huge bottle is finished I will be buying more!</li>
