      <li>These are awesome and do exactly what they say they will do and they smell so good --last a long time</li>

<li> Won&#x27;t be buying anymore. :(</li>
<li> Not like the one you get from rainbow very disappointed.</li>

    <li> •:*¨¨*:•.♥♥BRILLIANT.•:*¨¨*:•.5 STAR •:*¨¨*:•.THANK YOU!!♥♥.•:*¨¨*:</li>
    <li> It is oil! Not like the one you get from rainbow very disappointed. Left a stain in my bowl:( that won&#x27;t come out</li>
    <li> Fragrances are too expensive to keep buying.  Gave the globe thing to a friend.</li>
    <li> For the price, they do just as good as the name brand.  I was happy with how fast they made it to me here in Afghanistan (10 days).  I only gave it 4 stars because they tend to leave little spots of color in the air purifier I have.  It easily wipes away but still worth noting.  Next time I need to purchase more fragrances for my purifier I will definitely opt for these ones over the name brand ones.  Hope this helps with your decision.</li>
    <li> Very week fragrance. Was hoping for more.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my product arrived for an on-time amazing quality</li>
    <li> These generic Rainbow fragrances are horrible.  They smell nothing like the original Rainbow scents I normally get and I will be sure not to order them again.  I will order brand name Rainbow scents from now on, spending the extra money for brand name is definitely worth it.</li>

    <li> I thought that it same quickly and it did smell good however the smell did not last very long in my deoderizer.  I would definitely purchase this item again</li>

    <li> They stain my container. The smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t strong, I had to use a lot to make it smell in my house. stick with the rainbow brand. it&#x27;s more expensive but you don&#x27;t use much.</li>
    <li> I love refreshing the air as I vacuum. The scents I have gotten are very nice, and not over powering.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recommend buying these from anyone bit rainbow. The ones I recieved were so old that it took half a bottle to get a fague scent out of them. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for for my rainbow vacuum cleaner and at a great price.  Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Rainbow products are al great products. I did not care for one of the scents in this group, but indefinitely would recommend this product to anyone with a rainbow. The gardenia and lemon scent were great!</li>
    <li> These are awesome and do exactly what they say they will do and they smell so good --last a long time</li>
    <li> This product does not smell anything like the original scents and all 4 bottles smell the same.  It stained the bowl and didn&#x27;t make my living smell good.</li>
    <li> I purchased to replace the name brand items that I got with my rainbow, but these have very little scent and you have to pore almost a fifth of the fragrance into the tank to have any of the scent come out and it is still not much.</li>
    <li> These are crap dont waste the money on them</li>
    <li> Smell good while vacumming</li>
    <li> These work great. Came in mail great.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Rainbow brand and a lot cheaper and fragrances were  a lot better also will certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> The scents are great, but unfortunately you need to dump quite a lot to sense a smell. A few drops won&#x27;t give any smell. We use it in our rainbow vacuum cleaner. I will probably not buy again because of that.</li>
    <li> The scents are not at all what I was ecpecting. when I ordered the oil, it did not have a seletion of the acents that I could choose from. The scents that were sent to me are, pine, which smells NOTHING like any pine ive ever smelled, apple, the same as pine I put it in my rainbow and after a few secs I had to turn it off and dump it out, because the smell was so bad. Lemon is not to bad nor the gardenia. But dont think I will be ordering this product in the near future.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great,  we use our Rainbow  once a week, and the fragrances are a must.  two more words  JR</li>
    <li> Nice clean smell in my rainbow vacuum and rainbow  room freshener.  Would buy again. Sizes could be a bit larger.</li>
    <li> These are not Rainbow products, and should not be used in Rainbow equipment. Rainbow does not sell anything online, and does not endorse these products- warranties will not apply to items purchased online, including damage as a result of using products purchased online. Beware.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the scents, and my spouse really enjoys the lemon the most.  I wish the scents lasted longer.  We use them in a Rainbow RainMate air freshener.  I would say that after two hours, the smell decreases.</li>
    <li> The orange scent was opened and half of it was gone.</li>
    <li> You can barely smell these.  I put about 8 drops in my rainmate &amp; didn&#x27;t smell anything.  For as much as these cost they should smell better/stronger.  Won&#x27;t be buying anymore. :(</li>
