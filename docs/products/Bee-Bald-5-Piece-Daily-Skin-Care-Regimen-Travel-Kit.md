      <li>He liked it.</li>
      <li>Thought it was a nice, thoughtful gift.</li>
      <li>After using this product it&#x27;s possibly the best shave for my head.</li>
      <li>He is always satisfied on how they make his head look and feel.</li>
      <li>More like a gag gift.</li>
      <li>He is so pleased with the product and is looking for more products.  </li>
      <li>is more thicker and leaves a closer shave.</li>
      <li>I really like the Bee Bald Scrub, Clean and Smooth products in the larger sizes the best.</li>
      <li>His head feels smoother, he likes the pleasant smell and his head does does not feel dry.  </li>

      <li>My husband (who is incredibly hard to shop for) liked it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff I use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>BEE Bald made me sweat a white liquid on my head, it was ok but for the problem with smooth or heal, when i sweat it would be white on a black head.</li>
      <li>He states that the feeling he gets after shaving is total different from what he has experienced from using the products he has used in the past from the grocery store.  </li>
      <li>The Smooth Head and Face left a white film on my husbands head!</li>

<li> shaving takes long enough without further complicating it!</li>
<li> smaller than i expected the samples to be, but maybe i didnt read the product description well enough</li>
<li> Would definitely recommend to other guys who shave their heads.</li>
<li> Was not worth the money, Immediately went back to my routine shaving cream and after shave....</li>
<li> They give you a few different moisturizers.</li>
<li> A little truly does go a long way too.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s really no use for a few of these tubes.</li>
<li> I was going to give it as a gift to my brother for his birthday and this is way too small.</li>
<li> However, I prefer the Head Shave Slick Cream in the 8oz size vs. the Bee Bald</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s $15 for such small tubes.</li>
<li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s too small.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this five-star item</li>

    <li> BEE Bald made me sweat a white liquid on my head, it was ok but for the problem with smooth or heal, when i sweat it would be white on a black head.Stop using it.Would also burn my eyes.</li>
    <li> So adorable! Can&#x27;t wait to give to my husband for Christmas</li>
    <li> My husband loves these products.  He is always satisfied on how they make his head look and feel.</li>
    <li> The Smooth Head and Face left a white film on my husbands head! He didn&#x27;t care for the products.</li>
    <li> Great product whish it was monthly subscription</li>
    <li> Be bald traveling kit is one of the easiest things to carry with you whether your at a motel for going on vacation don&#x27;t leave your place without getting the bee bald. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this five-star item</li>
    <li> My friend was really happy with this gift. Products are First Class!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this to try out the product before spending the money on the bigger bottles. I love this stuff I use it everyday.  After using this product it&#x27;s possibly the best shave for my head. Would definitely recommend to other guys who shave their heads.</li>
    <li> My husband (who is incredibly hard to shop for) liked it. Thought it was a nice, thoughtful gift.</li>
    <li> Was not worth the money, Immediately went back to my routine shaving cream and after shave.... A lot of moving parts, 5 steps.... shaving takes long enough without further complicating it!</li>
    <li> Great products for any head shaver, period.</li>
    <li> These tubes are tiny. Also like 3 of the 5 are just excess and probably not needed for your head.</li>
    <li> gift , guy said he likes it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and shipped fast :)</li>
    <li> Man has liked trying the different products, but so far ingrown hairs are still a problem.</li>
    <li> Husband said it was the best shave he&#x27;s ever had.  The after shave works great and he likes the smell. His head and face were the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever felt, with no red marks or irritation. A little truly does go a long way too.</li>
    <li> My husband received this as a gift.  He is so pleased with the product and is looking for more products.  He states that the feeling he gets after shaving is total different from what he has experienced from using the products he has used in the past from the grocery store.  His head feels smoother, he likes the pleasant smell and his head does does not feel dry.  Right now he is using razor blades, so my next gift to him are the razor blades that are offered by this company.  I will let you know later if he is satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> These are sample size bottles. I really like the Bee Bald Scrub, Clean and Smooth products in the larger sizes the best. However, I prefer the Head Shave Slick Cream in the 8oz size vs. the Bee Bald shave product because of the size and price! The Head Shave Cream is more thicker and leaves a closer shave. I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the Bee Bald Heal product.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and great product as always!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no use for a few of these tubes. They give you a few different moisturizers. The scrub and shave oil worked well but the smell is not so good. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Like one of the previous posts said, these are more like sample sizes than anything. It&#x27;s too bad that it&#x27;s $15 for such small tubes. I&#x27;m thinking of returning it because of the size. If it were a bit bigger, for the price, it wouldn&#x27;t be too back but unfortunately it&#x27;s too small. I was going to give it as a gift to my brother for his birthday and this is way too small. This would be a nice stocking stuffer, but it&#x27;s no longer the season.</li>
    <li> More like a gag gift.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband.  He liked it.</li>
    <li> smaller than i expected the samples to be, but maybe i didnt read the product description well enough</li>
