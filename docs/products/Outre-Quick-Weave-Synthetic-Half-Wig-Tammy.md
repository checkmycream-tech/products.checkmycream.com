      <li>This is a sexy n fun Halfwig....</li>
      <li>I really enjoy rockin it</li>
      <li>but I must admit this is a good wig for natural hair.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite looks, most people think it is my real hair.</li>
      <li>but overall I love you Tammy !!</li>
      <li>The hair just tangled after about three weeks but for $30 bucks it worth it!</li>
      <li>Luckily it was cheap</li>
      <li>Nice way to grow in your hair as you go natural.  </li>
      <li>i love this hair, it feels natural and it blends in fine with my hair, plus i conditioned it and it came out even softer</li>
      <li>con make sure u dont sleep in it and make sure you hang it up on some type of wig stand for it to last longer.</li>
      <li>I did wash it twice, but it quickly tangled again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The older it gets the better</li>
      <li>The back is nice and full but he front.  </li>
      <li>I seen a review for this half wig on YouTube and was impressed with how natural it looked.  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair everyday for it to blend in just fine with the weave!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty wig.  </li>
      <li>hot look n</li>
      <li>This is the second Tammy I ordered, I love it.</li>
      <li>I will definetly buy this in the future, I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I also kept mines for at least 3 months (taking care of it) and it looked great with each use.</li>
      <li>So be aware.</li>
      <li>I love my tammy and will definitely buy another one.  </li>
      <li>but I had heard so much about this piece on the web I had to give it a try!</li>
      <li>I also like that its a very full wig, there are no hidden spaces and the front of the wig is made very well.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s very soft and full.</li>
      <li>This is the only half wig I&#x27;ve found that is awesome for African-American women with natural hair.</li>
      <li>It blends so naturally and it looks even better once it gets old.</li>
      <li>I have thick coarse &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34; hair and this blends perfectly.</li>
      <li>but it cleans up nice with a little product and water.</li>
      <li>The cost needs to be much lower.</li>
      <li>The hair is well sewn to the cap and very silky and lightweight.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for all hair types!</li>
      <li>Different hair....shiny with cheap synthetic appearance.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t have to leave much hair out.  </li>
      <li>but if you brush it lightly it bounces back.  </li>
      <li>and I really need a 2</li>
      <li>I just use a flat iron and lightly press it out.  </li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s ok for the price, if you don&#x27;t mind the tracks showing or wearing a hand band around it.</li>
      <li>So I have a lot of hair and will admit that I just don&#x27;t want to detangle it everyday, so this is the perfect piece to just put on, on my lazy hair days.</li>
      <li>To get into it, I believe I received an older version of this wig.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re lucky before the back starts matting up and getting nappy and stuff</li>
      <li>Very close to natural hair!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I normally buy these 2 or 3 at a time b/c</li>
      <li>its great for the price not too thin and not too big</li>
      <li>Although the wig gets really big, the edges are very sparse especially near the drawstring.</li>
      <li>The shedding is not excessive by the way.</li>
      <li>Now I know that this wig has been a go to wig for a lot of natural AA women</li>
      <li>it looks with my natural...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite natural, everyone believes it is my hair, although if you ask I will tell you its a wig.</li>
      <li>It clips on in 1 min and looks like your natural hair.</li>
      <li>I use a soft brush for blending.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten a lot of compliments, because It look and feels like my natural hair.</li>
      <li>As a person with natural hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Tammy since I went natural April of 2010.</li>
      <li>CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS 1B.  MUCH LIGHTER.</li>
      <li>BACK TO &amp;#34;BEAUTY OF NEW YORK&amp;#34; FOR ME.</li>
      <li>It mixed we with my natural hair and it has a soft feel to it.</li>
      <li>Not all shiny like these other synthetic wigs , really looks natural</li>
      <li>I recently went natural and cut my hair down very low to start fresh.  </li>
      <li>First let me say that  I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I am going to wear this half wig.</li>
      <li>Its wavy &amp; slightly frizzy textures looks natural &amp; mixes well with my naturally kinky frizzy texture.</li>

    <li> I am absolutely in love with this wig. You wouldnt have even thought this was synthetic hair. It blends so naturally and it looks even better once it gets old. I will definetly buy this in the future, I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments. I am highly impressed!</li>
    <li> The looks is great! One of my favorite looks, most people think it is my real hair. I always get compliments about how full and beautiful my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this wig sheds more than any wig I have known. It also tangles bad. I wish it didn&#x27;t but it only lasted three weeks for me when I wore it daily. I did wash it twice, but it quickly tangled again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because I like the look of it. It would be 5 stars if it the quality was improved to prevent tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this product sheds like crazy! I am constantly finding random strands in my car, house, even at work, crazy.</li>
    <li> My go-to half wig but literally you&#x27;ll het 2-3 weeks of wear if you&#x27;re lucky before the back starts matting up and getting nappy and stuff but overall I love you Tammy !!</li>
    <li> Great wig blends in and looks natural. Not all shiny like these other synthetic wigs , really looks natural some people thought it was my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con make sure u dont sleep in it and make sure you hang it up on some type of wig stand for it to last longer.</li>
    <li> Great wig! Match was perfect! The hair just tangled after about three weeks but for $30 bucks it worth it! Great for the summer for high buns and pony tails!</li>
    <li> This wig is ok.  It would have been a terrific product if the front wasn&#x27;t so skimpy.  The back is nice and full but he front.  No matter how I try to style it you can see all the tracks.  I&#x27;m going to try to add some tracks to it to see if that will fix it.  But other than that it&#x27;s ok for the price, if you don&#x27;t mind the tracks showing or wearing a hand band around it.</li>
    <li> First let me say that  I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I am going to wear this half wig. I wore it for two days and it wasn&#x27;t a bad experience, but I&#x27;m still trying to figure this wig stuff out. For my first wig, this has been a great one for me to experiment with. Sadly, I got a 1B and I really need a 2 but I&#x27;ll work with it. To get into it, I believe I received an older version of this wig. It came with a drawstring  and not the adjustable straps advertised and two combs in the front and in the back. Although the wig gets really big, the edges are very sparse especially near the drawstring. The nap of this wig does tangle  and the wig does shed but it cleans up nice with a little product and water. I&#x27;d recommend  only combing this wig with a paddle or wig brush to lessen the shedding. The shedding is not excessive by the way. Now I know that this wig has been a go to wig for a lot of natural AA women but when they talk about it blending they have to be referring to the fluffiness of the wig and possible the sheen of it. With that said, you will have to do some work to blend this wig. I&#x27;ll update if my feeling change.</li>
    <li> I wear this all of the time and it doesn&#x27;t give me any problems. It clips on in 1 min and looks like your natural hair.</li>
    <li> As a person with natural hair I like it...I usually pull my hair back with a headband &amp; put this wig on. Its wavy &amp; slightly frizzy textures looks natural &amp; mixes well with my naturally kinky frizzy texture. The older it gets the better it looks with my natural...it&#x27;s perfect for my protective style or if I just wanna switch it up &amp; wear semi straight hair instead of my afro &amp; twist outs.</li>
    <li> My favorite wig. Everyone thinks that it is mine!! I have thick coarse &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34; hair and this blends perfectly. Trick: wash your hair and braid while wet. In the morning pop this on, unbraid and style. Trust me no one will know otherwise!!! This wig has gone down in quality unfortunately. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to. So be aware. Brush out the tangles at night and it&#x27;ll last longer. Once you do though the pattern will change. Otherwise it&#x27;ll only last about 2 weeks max</li>
    <li> This is the only half wig I&#x27;ve found that is awesome for African-American women with natural hair. It&#x27;s not unbelievably shiny to the point it looks fake. It has a great wave and a bit of a kink to bend with my blow-dried, 4c hair. This half wig allows me to wear the front out for believability while protecting the rest of my hair. Please continue to make this forever!</li>
    <li> Still don&#x27;t understand how to blend this texture of hair. Regret  purchase</li>
    <li> i love this hair, it feels natural and it blends in fine with my hair, plus i conditioned it and it came out even softer</li>
    <li> ordered this a while ago but it still holds up nicely the curls bounce back with water it does tangle but its great for the price not too thin and not too big</li>
    <li> I love my tammy and will definitely buy another one.  I recently went natural and cut my hair down very low to start fresh.  I do not relax the front of my hair I just use a flat iron and lightly press it out.  The tammy fits in with the texture of my hair.  I don&#x27;t use any hair products and  I use a soft brush for blending.  The back will start to tangle after about 2 weeks but if you brush it lightly it bounces back.  The best part is after brushing, the texture remains in place.  I also like that its a very full wig, there are no hidden spaces and the front of the wig is made very well.  All the hairs are close together and its easy to blend your hair in the front.  You won&#x27;t have to leave much hair out.  Nice way to grow in your hair as you go natural.  Very close to natural hair!</li>
    <li> Crown of wig is very thin now. Ordered for two years. Different hair....shiny with cheap synthetic appearance. Outre duplicate in my opinion. NOT THE SAME WIG. COMPARED TO OTHERS I STILL HAVE. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY. COLOR ISN&#x27;T CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS 1B.  MUCH LIGHTER. DISSAPOINTED WITH PURCHASE. BACK TO &amp;#34;BEAUTY OF NEW YORK&amp;#34; FOR ME.</li>
    <li> It was good,  but it  tangled on me but I must admit this is a good wig for natural hair. But do expecr some tangles</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS HAIR. I had never worn fake hair before but I had heard so much about this piece on the web I had to give it a try! The tangle very easily take very good care or you&#x27;ll have to buy a new one ever two weeks like me :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this half wig for about two months and it is honestly gorgeous! Even my sister who is very picky about weaves noticed immediately that it does not have the fake weave shine. I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair everyday for it to blend in just fine with the weave! Great product in general! Highly recommend for all hair types!</li>
    <li> So I have a lot of hair and will admit that I just don&#x27;t want to detangle it everyday, so this is the perfect piece to just put on, on my lazy hair days. I just leave a little hair out in the front, braid it, to give it the same texture of the wig. Even people in my family do a double take and have to ask me it this wig is all of my hair. I&#x27;m in my 30s and never have worn wigs and this is just so easy. Great price, great value, great wig.</li>
    <li> This is the second Tammy I ordered, I love it. I have gotten a lot of compliments, because It look and feels like my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This is a sexy n fun Halfwig....My daughter s love yhe hot look n I really enjoy rockin it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love Tammy! Always make her last for months</li>
    <li> this is plastic Halloween not even</li>
    <li> This looks like Barbie doll hair and is very thin. It doesn&#x27;t even look good under a hat. Luckily it was cheap</li>
    <li> Please order this wig!!! The picture does not do the wig justice. The hair is well sewn to the cap and very silky and lightweight. Amazon has the best price for this hairpiece and shipping is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Tammy since I went natural April of 2010. She&#x27;s a life saver, I&#x27;m lazy and do not like to do my hair. It&#x27;s quite natural, everyone believes it is my hair, although if you ask I will tell you its a wig. I just like that my wig doesn&#x27;t look wiggy. I wouldn&#x27;t care if you thought it was a good weave, I like non-wiggy wigs lol... I normally buy these 2 or 3 at a time b/c it is synthetic and they don&#x27;t last long. She&#x27;s very soft and full. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I seen a review for this half wig on YouTube and was impressed with how natural it looked.  It turned out to be the same texture as my daughters hair</li>
    <li> I abosulutly love this hair. This was my second time buying it because I thought it was great. It mixed we with my natural hair and it has a soft feel to it. I also kept mines for at least 3 months (taking care of it) and it looked great with each use.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty wig.  Fits comfortable on your head but Tangles up really bad in about a week and a half.  Very pretty and soft but gets Tangled  and Natted really bad.  The cost needs to be much lower.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit my head. I gave it to a friend and it looks great on her</li>
