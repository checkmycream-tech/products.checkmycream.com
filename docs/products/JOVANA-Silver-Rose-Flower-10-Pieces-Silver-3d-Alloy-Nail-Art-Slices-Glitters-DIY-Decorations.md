### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
      <li>Great for nail art</li>
      <li>im verry happy with the seller</li>
      <li>They are very cute, but the problem that I found is that after a week the flowers start to turn out brownish color like the metal is coming off.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply on nails and for decoration will be beautiful.</li>
      <li>Love the quality, too!</li>
      <li>They are cute though!</li>
      <li>this product look amazing in the nails</li>
      <li>Nice roses.</li>
      <li>Loving these roses.</li>
      <li>These are shiny and look just like a metal rose.</li>
      <li>These are huge!</li>
      <li>Just do a bit of research if your searching for a better quality.</li>
      <li>They were okay.  </li>
      <li>Gorgeously shaped and very eye catching</li>
      <li>they are cute roses .</li>
      <li>Love the size and design</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with these decorations .</li>
      <li>Strong nail glue is needed, they can fall off</li>
      <li>The shipper was fine</li>
      <li>The bottom is curved to fit onto the nail without gaps.</li>
      <li>but then again, they were purchased at a cheap price.  </li>
      <li>Not only are they a very nice quality, but it came way before the posted delivery dates.  </li>
      <li>Nice and big sit well and look elegant</li>
      <li>They&#x27;d be much easier to use if they were better shaped to fit fingernails on the bottom</li>
      <li>but with strong nail glue they are usable and really pretty to boot.</li>
      <li>The product came fast and the little flier are perfect for my nails.</li>
      <li>I think the roses are very pretty</li>
      <li>I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  </li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t worth anything to me if I cant use it.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color looks just like the picture and has a slightly curved back for easy application on nails.</li>
      <li>The picture is true to what they really look like.  </li>
      <li>They are all cute; and the crosses actually have a slight curve to fit onto your nails which is really nice because I had wondered about that.</li>
      <li>All came in good shape, it&#x27;s a little bit of a wait to receive them, however they do come from far, cute enough to wait for them, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The petals are scratched, and they are all melded together, which takes away the look of many small petals and ends up looking more like gnarled up metal.</li>
      <li>I DO NOT use nail glue to attach, I place on sticky top coat and let dry.  </li>
      <li>I then follow with another heavier layer of top coat and let dry.  </li>
      <li>They are pretty and sits low on the nail, smooth</li>
      <li>They are a little big to wear on every nail but look great on just one.</li>
      <li>It took awhile to get them which was expected, but I love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll take up your whole nail.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s not too big and loud.</li>
      <li>I love these gems and so do my children and other clients.  </li>
      <li>I love the look, the size, everything about these little silver roses.</li>
      <li>BUT I feel I should have been a little more educated on the quality before I purchsed them.  </li>
      <li>4 stars because the size is just a wee bit larger than I like but not to large</li>
      <li>It even came with a free little gift.</li>
      <li>They look a little cheap</li>
      <li>You also must get this to small but cute all at the same time i just love it... must get to mad cute...</li>
      <li>Regarding this purchase I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to see what it would be like to have roses just like these for nail art, they are inexpensive enough to try even if they didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d have hoped.</li>
      <li>They so far have been on my nails for a week and no problems.</li>
      <li>These are really poor quality, bashed up pieces of metal that end up looking somewhat like a rose.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I could say about these is that they are small enough to use as nail art, without over taking the nail; also there are ten pieces as advertised.  </li>
      <li>At first my order was short but they quickly sent out my missing items and they still arrived before expected.  </li>

    <li> they are cute roses . I am satisfied with these decorations . They are a little big to wear on every nail but look great on just one.</li>
    <li> You also must get this to small but cute all at the same time i just love it... must get to mad cute...</li>
    <li> I love the look, the size, everything about these little silver roses. Can&#x27;t wait to use these on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so since the last time I ordered the roses.. I reordered them ... and the crosses ... and the stars. They are all cute; and the crosses actually have a slight curve to fit onto your nails which is really nice because I had wondered about that.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to get them which was expected, but I love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them. It even came with a free little gift. Little sticker guides that I can use for design.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Inexpensive, I received all 10 as described&lt;br /&gt;2.) Gorgeously shaped and very eye catching&lt;br /&gt;3.) Small enough for tiny nailbeds, they are the width of my pinky nail which is why I picked these. Anything larger would be too awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Flat, slightly rounded bottoms are convex instead of concave, making them difficult to attach to nailbeds&lt;br /&gt;2.) They are alloy, so they are a little heavy but that is to be expected&lt;br /&gt;3.) Strong nail glue is needed, they can fall off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with them! I really wanted to see what it would be like to have roses just like these for nail art, they are inexpensive enough to try even if they didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d have hoped. They&#x27;d be much easier to use if they were better shaped to fit fingernails on the bottom but with strong nail glue they are usable and really pretty to boot.</li>
    <li> The product came fast and the little flier are perfect for my nails.

What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Nice and big sit well and look elegant</li>
    <li> They were okay.  They look a little cheap but then again, they were purchased at a cheap price.  I think I had something else in mind when purchasing BUT I feel I should have been a little more educated on the quality before I purchsed them.  The shipper was fine so no problems there.  Just do a bit of research if your searching for a better quality.</li>
    <li> All came in good shape, it&#x27;s a little bit of a wait to receive them, however they do come from far, cute enough to wait for them, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Nice roses. Great for nail art</li>
    <li> I never expect great quality of the products that are so inexpensively priced and simply hate when they take a month to deliver from China.  Regarding this purchase I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only are they a very nice quality, but it came way before the posted delivery dates.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> the underside of the flower is hollow so it is hard to glue it down well almost impossible so it isn&#x27;t worth anything to me if I cant use it.</li>
    <li> These are to big for nails, they should be used in decorations cellular or similar things but not for nails</li>
    <li> These are huge! If you have small to average nail beds and/or do not have long nails don&#x27;t purchase this item.  They&#x27;ll take up your whole nail. They are cute though!</li>
    <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  At first my order was short but they quickly sent out my missing items and they still arrived before expected.  I love these gems and so do my children and other clients.  Loving these roses.</li>
    <li> I think the roses are very pretty, I got them for my sister , if she doesn&#x27;t like them I can use them in my craft work.</li>
    <li> Love the size and design</li>
    <li> I Was sent another product</li>
    <li> These are shiny and look just like a metal rose. The bottom is curved to fit onto the nail without gaps.</li>
    <li> i recommend this product to everybody ilove this product look amazing in the nails i rate this with 5 start im verry happy with the seller came on time</li>
    <li> 4 stars because the size is just a wee bit larger than I like but not to large I wont use.  They are pretty and sits low on the nail, smooth so they won&#x27;t snag on anything.  The picture is true to what they really look like.  I DO NOT use nail glue to attach, I place on sticky top coat and let dry.  I then follow with another heavier layer of top coat and let dry.  They so far have been on my nails for a week and no problems.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color looks just like the picture and has a slightly curved back for easy application on nails.</li>
