      <li>Always a good product</li>
      <li>So ordering here is super easy and fast!&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an incredible bargain considering you&#x27;re getting Kinerase for bargain-basement prices!</li>
      <li>After using many eye products I have fallen in love with this one!</li>
      <li>i never paid almost $80.00 for eye creams and i certainly will not for this no matter how good it is!</li>
      <li>It does feel nice on my face and make it smooth</li>
      <li>I have used this product before but have not been able to find it anymore.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect your eyes to be magically transformed</li>
      <li>and i was always pleased with the results</li>
      <li>My wife said this is a good product and very affordable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one is easy to apply and has GREAT results!</li>
      <li>There is absolutely nothing else that works better for my eyes!  </li>
      <li>But this is an absolutely amazing eye cream that will soften fine lines and moisturize your eye area like nobody&#x27;s business!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers, like me.lol ...</li>
      <li>the cheap packaging.</li>
      <li>Great product it works for me and will continue to purchase this in the future</li>
      <li>Dr Lewinn products are fabulous-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old and this does what many of the overpriced products do, even better.  </li>
      <li>I always loved this eye cream and it always worked for me and would have given it 4 stars  and have been using it for several years now</li>
      <li>They lasted me about two to three weeks which is not bad at all for the price.</li>
      <li>it really does what it states!!</li>
      <li>Worth trying one tube to see if it works for you.</li>
      <li>Great product and very inexpensive compare to other brands.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I have also used L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s eye balm that worked better in the sample than actual purchase.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>first i was paying $18.00 for this</li>
      <li>Does it all, puffy, dark circles love it!</li>
      <li>and this is just as good if not better than Kinerase.</li>
      <li>and results are certainly on the plus side.</li>
      <li>At first it was just a hole, so I covered up the main dispensing hole with my finger and squeezed the product through the crack.</li>
      <li>Then, tonight the whole applicator tip broke off and is stuck in the lid, so there is no way to close it now.</li>
      <li>It really works on those under eye wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Really makes the wrinkles around the eyes disappear.</li>
      <li>20 minuets after using this cream the puffiness and dark ness is Much better, even it is not all gone yet.</li>
      <li>The profound increase in price.</li>
      <li>anyway I need something that helps with my dry skin as well as those little fine lines I have.</li>
      <li>No other American product will help with my under eye luggage!  </li>
      <li>Definitely helps with dark circles but doesn&#x27;t do much for puffiness.  </li>

<li> I have such dry skin</li>
<li> I have been using them for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Affordability</li>
<li> There is still product left in the tube that will now go to waste.</li>
<li> Think about it...same active ingredients as Kinerase eyecream...</li>
<li> Have been using it for a few weeks and although I still have puffiness, the skin is much less wrinkled or dry looking.</li>
<li> Concealer only makes the under eye area look dry and the ,puffiness and darkness look worse.</li>
<li> I mean it was only 12 dollars for these little bottles.</li>
<li> think this is a little more expensive in Walgreens--if you can find it, which isn&#x27;t likely :(</li>
<li> My eyes are very dark and puffy.  </li>
<li> I bought this product in April 2015, and the tip of the bottle where the applicator is cracked within a few uses.</li>
<li> are you serious?</li>
<li> Not happy</li>
<li> am i disappointed?</li>
<li> but this is disgusting</li>

    <li> Think about it...same active ingredients as Kinerase eyecream...Kinerase is like $75, this is like $9...It&#x27;s a no-brainer!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used both and this is just as good if not better than Kinerase. Don&#x27;t expect your eyes to be magically transformed--nothing is going to do that, despite Kinerase claims...But this is an absolutely amazing eye cream that will soften fine lines and moisturize your eye area like nobody&#x27;s business!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers, like me.lol ...I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a little more expensive in Walgreens--if you can find it, which isn&#x27;t likely :( So ordering here is super easy and fast!&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an incredible bargain considering you&#x27;re getting Kinerase for bargain-basement prices!</li>
    <li> I had bought about three bottles of this cream. I mean it was only 12 dollars for these little bottles. They lasted me about two to three weeks which is not bad at all for the price. I just didn&#x27;t see a big difference after the three bottles. I have such dry skin anyway I need something that helps with my dry skin as well as those little fine lines I have. This just didn&#x27;t do it. It does feel nice on my face and make it smooth but I Need More!! So I would say save your money on this.</li>
    <li> After one tube the puffiness from allergies was greatly reduced!</li>
    <li> Really makes the wrinkles around the eyes disappear.</li>
    <li> After using many eye products I have fallen in love with this one! Does it all, puffy, dark circles love it! I use it in the morning and in the evening if needed and it takes care of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m 53 years old and this does what many of the overpriced products do, even better.  Great price, keep it coming!</li>
    <li> Thank you, Dr. Lewinn for this product!  NOTHING on the market works for my stubborn bags and puffiness plus circles under my eyes.  No other American product will help with my under eye luggage!  I was using a Suisse brand that has since lost potency for my needs.  I have also used L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s eye balm that worked better in the sample than actual purchase.  I have used it regularly for over eight months as it takes a long time for product to continually work towards its fullest potential!  I have noticed that when I sway away and try something else, I have to return to this product for desired results. This product is like beauty crack for my eyes.  There is absolutely nothing else that works better for my eyes!  Hope Dr. Lewinn under eye recovery works for you!</li>
    <li> I always loved this eye cream and it always worked for me and would have given it 4 stars  and have been using it for several years now and i was always pleased with the results but i will not be ordering this product anymore!!!! first i was paying $18.00 for this then about 6 months later it went up to about $21.00 then a year later it went up to $28.00 then several months later it went up to $38.00 now several months later it goes up to $79.00? are you serious? it looks like Dr.Lewinn has gotten way too greedy! i never paid almost $80.00 for eye creams and i certainly will not for this no matter how good it is! am i disappointed? your dam right i am but this is just another example of the greed that has gotten out of control in this world nobody gives you a break anymore but this is disgusting i work in the beauty industry and i come across many women every day i will spread the word about this company and how they foolishly are taking people for granted!!!</li>
    <li> Dr Lewinn products are fabulous- I have been using them for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Affordability and results are certainly on the plus side.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product!</li>
    <li> My wife said this is a good product and very affordable.</li>
    <li> Great product and very inexpensive compare to other brands. it really does what it states!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but have not been able to find it anymore. It really works on those under eye wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement</li>
    <li> Always a good product</li>
    <li> Definitely helps with dark circles but doesn&#x27;t do much for puffiness.  Having been use several weeks, religiously, now.</li>
    <li> I have seen no improvement at all</li>
    <li> I am 56 with allergies.  I bought this cream at a local store today to try.  My eyes are very dark and puffy.  Concealer only makes the under eye area look dry and the ,puffiness and darkness look worse. 20 minuets after using this cream the puffiness and dark ness is Much better, even it is not all gone yet.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe a couple of things about this product. 1. The profound increase in price. and 2. the cheap packaging. I bought this product in April 2015, and the tip of the bottle where the applicator is cracked within a few uses. At first it was just a hole, so I covered up the main dispensing hole with my finger and squeezed the product through the crack. Then, tonight the whole applicator tip broke off and is stuck in the lid, so there is no way to close it now. Also, in April I only paid $28.50 for it (approx four months ago). There is still product left in the tube that will now go to waste. Not happy</li>
    <li> May work for some but not for me.  I think it may work on people that have morning puffiness only not 24/7puffiness.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a few weeks and although I still have puffiness, the skin is much less wrinkled or dry looking. Worth trying one tube to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Great product it works for me and will continue to purchase this in the future</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this one is easy to apply and has GREAT results!</li>
