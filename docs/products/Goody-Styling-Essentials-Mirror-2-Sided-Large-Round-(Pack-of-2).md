<li> Unfortunately, the image that appears in the looking glass is less than desirable, but I can&#x27;t fault the company on that.</li>
<li> So stupid.</li>
<li> I am done with those fogless crap mirrors that are $40.  </li>

    <li> HIgh quality mirror at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of style- doesn&#x27;t look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Dont hesitate to get this.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s in the title, but I must have missed it when I ordered it and caused some confusion. Ended up giving one away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is good and does everything you could need it for.</li>
    <li> The magnification is not too large like so many other mirrors are.</li>
    <li> Not the best but it serves its purpose.  I needed a handheld mirror and this one fits the bill. Two for $10. One of the mirrors has a small chip on the mirror on magnified side. Doesnt bother me too much i dont use that side too often.</li>
    <li> These two mirrors were delivered as promised and the paper stickers were easy to remove if you just carefully use your fingernail and slowly lift one corner, and S L O W L E Y pull off the sticker.  There is no need to try and scratch the sticker off, as these are NOT permanent stickers, but REMOVABLE stickers. The mirrors are the right size and a great buy, especially with prime shipping.</li>
    <li> My mirror is defective, it has some middle-aged guy in it. No matter how much I spray it with Windex, the picture won&#x27;t come off. Thinking of returning it and ordering one that has SI.com swimsuit models in the reflection. ...</li>

    <li> I bought these two mirrors -- one for me and one for our grandchild who would really like to have his own mirror--he gets such a kick out of carrying on conversations with what he perceives as another person when he looks into a mirror.  But I could do without the stickers on the mirrors.  They are such a pain to remove unless you have a special product and I don&#x27;t want to jeopardize the finish by getting liquid into the rim of the mirror.</li>
    <li> Price was great for a 2 pack of mirrors. I have ms &amp; constantly drop my hand mirrors!  Good value!</li>
    <li> Very handy and very durable!!!</li>
    <li> OK but stickers hard to remove from glass. I had to scrub very hard and this left the area where the sticker was with a different look from the rest.  Otherwise it would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> One side had a HUGE sticker tha I have not been able to completely remove. So stupid. I only can ony use 1 side...</li>
    <li> Nice heavy duty mirror, I love that it&#x27;s 2 sided and has a hole to hang it from. I live in a tent in Afghanistan</li>
    <li> Great value, and you get 2 mirrors!! Perfect size, handle, and weight. Can hold this mirror for quiet a while before having to rest.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the color shown in the picture.  That was the only reason I ordered it because of the color.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift upon request.  It arrived as it said it would.  The little girl like it.</li>
