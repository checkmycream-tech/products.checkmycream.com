<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> top marks for this stellar product!</li>
    <li> the only thing that works with heat rash - we have tried it all!  This is the best powder before and after you work out.</li>
    <li> Cute, used it as a gag gift and it was a hit.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Smell is decent and product works well.&lt;br /&gt;I was however chastised, by several females, because this product contains talc which has been linked to uterine cancer via the asbestos found in trace amounts.</li>
    <li> Keeps everything dry, good stuff.</li>
    <li> My husband had heard about this when he started to get a butt rash from the high heat at work from a co worker. I found this with a little discount through prime. I ordered it for my husband. After a couple of days his butt rash was gone and using it daily all last summer he had no issues at all. I used this product after shaving my bikini line and it kept the irritation away and never had any issues. This has now become a must have in our family and have told all of our friends about it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. it keeps you dry all day long.</li>
    <li> Wonder what the difference is in the yellow versus the pink? This is a great product for sweaty palms.  An instructor introduced this product to us for slippery hands, it works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two years now. I have also used products like the Fresh Balls cream (See notes about that at bottom), which also works well and is a little different than this. This is obviously your traditional-style baby powder type of product. The scent is mild, fresh and isn&#x27;t overly powering in any way, shape or form. I know many people complain about powder getting all over the place... However, people simply need to get their method of &#x27;application&#x27; down and they&#x27;ll be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ll get the boxers or briefs on (whichever I&#x27;m wearing that day) and I&#x27;ll methodically apply the product. There is minimal waste this way (or excess snowing onto your floor), and provided you aren&#x27;t shaking the bottle like you&#x27;re a ticked off baby shaking a rattle, you&#x27;re also not going to have the powder bombs or extra stuff floating around in your underpants. Just a gentle shake so the stuff sprinkles out like you&#x27;re sprinkling garlic powder or salt out of one of those big McCormick containers... maybe a little squeeze to help it poof out. But again, be gentle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the product is on, it will last you throughout the day. I imagine if you&#x27;re like the Lion King down there, you&#x27;ll have slightly different results, also dependent upon activity levels. Regardless, it WILL keep you dry, pleasantly scented and actually leaves you feelings surprisingly smooth long after the powder has faded away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work as intended and can even be used on other problem areas (feet, chafing areas, etc.). My wife has even snagged some for herself and shares the same sentiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are the type that would rather skip the &#x27;mess&#x27; of the powder route, then I can equally recommend the Fresh Balls cream. My only quarrels with it are that you do have to sit there and wait for this cream to dry into a powder, which can develop almost a thin crust, if you will, kind of like wet hands with flour, but not quiteas much of a nuisance. The time can be excessive and I don&#x27;t find it to work nearly as long as the Anti-Monkey Butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, if you need either of these products to disappear quickly, for whatever reason. I definitely recommend the Anti-Monkey Butt Powder over the Fresh Balls for this. Just seems to take care of itself better than the cream... plus there&#x27;s that soft thing I mentioned earlier. You&#x27;re welcome ladies and gents... Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Works as well or maybe better than any other baby powder but is considerably more expensive, what can I say, I just like the way it smells</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this product, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  If you do any physical activity, and keeps it nice down there.  It also prevents your boxers from riding up and getting stuck, and trust me, no one likes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned, you don&#x27;t want your lady friend to go down there and get a mouthful of powder.  Being spontaneous is great and all, but sometimes it ain&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as other brands on the market..  Basically this stuff just smells like regular baby powder.  With such a subtle smell this makes me want to wear this product out in public where I would hate wearing goldbond powder due to its unmistakable smell!  This powder last all day and really helps with all kinds of chafing (Meaning you don&#x27;t have to just use it on your butt ;-) lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pick it up here on Amazon or DSE website itself PLUS I have seen it in my local Wal*Mart (Foot Health Section), my local CVS, and even hardware stores..  It&#x27;s also a great conversation starter when guest see it in the bathroom! Not nearly as embarrassing as goldbond powder..</li>
    <li> Product just seems like a regular powder with a tad bit more absorbency but I can&#x27;t say it keeps me dry like a lot of people review it does.</li>
    <li> I love that this powder doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have a forever issue of monkey butt (crohn&#x27;s disease) and this stuff..wow..has signficantly decreased the redness and irritation around my butt!  Plus, I&#x27;m dry now which feels so good.  I can put on underwear immediately after applying this and it leaves no residue at all.  A real bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t smell strongly or weirdly.  It has a fairly neutral scent and I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> Since it was just talk and calamine I didn&#x27;t expect much from this stuff - certainly didn&#x27;t think it would be as great as the reviews say, but it is!  Only complaint is the indiscreet packaging :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this add-on because my local WalMart is not carrying this. Instead of the original pictured and described here, I received the baby version. Had to get a refund from Amazon, which they were good about.&lt;br /&gt;The stick on label the seller puts on the bottle matched the \\&quot;06017\\&quot; in the description so it may have been a low volume mistake, but I ordered from a different seller after this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Helps with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am chaf free yay. Keeps me dry and rash free. I would highly recommend it to any sweaty hiker.</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s name, the Anti Monkey Butt successfully rid me of the bright red baboon butt that has plagued me since birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hopeful that it would also help quell the urge to fling my poo at passersby... and overcome my habit of playing with my junk in full view of public onlookers. No luck with that yet. I&#x27;m still giving it four stars for getting rid of the red butt though.</li>
    <li> Love this for riding motorcycles, it works as described.  Ordering more!</li>
    <li> Just started riding long distances and wont take a ride with out it..</li>
    <li> We have a monkey problem. I thought this would resolve it but NO. This product does not repel monkeys. It actually seems to attract them - which is not a good thing.</li>
    <li> Bought some of this ahead of a family trip to Disney World. I&#x27;m a big guy and the trip was scheduled for June. So, yeah. I knew things were gonna get swampy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last forever, of course, so I went into the trip anticipating that I&#x27;d want to carry a little canister of the stuff into the theme parks with me each day, so I could &amp;#34;reload&amp;#34; or re-freshen things up periodically throughout the day. (I wish I could&#x27;ve found a smaller, &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size bottle for taking into the parks. The standard bottle is huge. And putting it into a generic unmarked canister made me wonder if the security people would think I was bringing in drugs or something.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from freshening up things downstairs, I also occasionally found it useful for sprinkling it onto my sandals (reducing the friction between my foot and the sandal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it gets messy, especially if you&#x27;re applying it liberally. If you&#x27;re slapping it on in your hotel room or a bathroom stall, you can expect to leave a big powdery mess behind when you&#x27;re done. Nothing you can do about that, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went through the first airport on that trip, I got stopped by security as they wanted to run chemical tests on my Anti Monkey Butt bottle. Maybe the security guy was just bored and felt like breaking up the monotony in his day by busting out his drug test kit and playing &amp;#34;CSI&amp;#34; for a few minutes. Or maybe I just look like the kind of person who is going to try smuggling a soda-can sized bottle full of cocaine onto an airplane?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re taking this stuff with you on a trip, and you are worried about being held up at the security checkpoints, put it in a checked bag instead of your carry-on.</li>
    <li> Work as advertised. I am a powder user and have been for more years than I&#x27;d like to count. For those of you who sweat in that area of your body this will do the trick. Monkey butt does keep you drier longer than any other product I have used over the years. It is a little pricey but effective.</li>
    <li> For anyone who has sweaty teenage boys, this is the absolute best chaffing/sweating/soothing powder ever.  We tried everything on the market and nothing worked.  We  stumbled upon this in the middle of the summer at a local drug store and gave it a try and my son makes sure I keep in in stock ever since.  As a matter of fact, he has his entire baseball team using it now!  He carries it in his bag for workouts and sports.  It works anywhere on the body the sweats or chaffs!  Great product and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> It is GREAT! I didnt like to use powder before I used this. Now I use everyday!</li>
    <li> Best powder ever..have purchased b4 and will continue to do so...highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Works. But so does the stuff you buy in local drug store. Would buy again.  I like shopping here.</li>
    <li> The first shipment and the replacement had the same product description on the container. The little 1.5 can was not as easy to use as the full sized 6 oz can. Seems to work OK to soon to tell. Vendor seems genuinely concerned about their desire to have buyer love them.</li>
    <li> It does just what I want absorbs has no added perfume makes your skin nice and soft. Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff, it does the job; but I can&#x27;t stand the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Finally a powder that works and doesn&#x27;t smell like a baby orold person! This powder is awesome! I&#x27;m a heavy sweater and this has helped so much swamp *** and odor. I do spin classes and hike quite a bit and even if I shower right before going I can get a bit smelly. First time using this and 2 hours of spinning and I had zero issues with odor or chaffing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time finding this locally but when this bottle is done with I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another!!!</li>
    <li> My mother had originally bought this for me as a gag gift about 5 years ago when I asked for powder for my gentlemens  area. I now use it everyday. It is the absolute best powder I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s better than any regular store brand. It&#x27;s keeps you nice and dry for hours on end. Wonderful accidental find.</li>
    <li> loved this product. shipped and arrived on time!&lt;br /&gt;I use this powder when I go hiking or will be spending a lot of time outside (I live in the hot desert). Just a little bit of powder keeps my feet dry and keeps my shoes from starting to smell bad. My friend recommended it to me. He is a pipeliner and spends a lot of time outside in various weather conditions and it works great for him as well!</li>
    <li> This product smells pleasant and leaves skin silky soft. seem to ease some of the redness and soreness when baby has a little &amp;#34;monkey butt&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It performs; calamine helps with the basic powder. TSA got a kick out of it in Dallas when I went through their screening.</li>
    <li> Bought for gift and own as well awesome product</li>
    <li> This is essential for those who want to prevent any discomfort in the nether regions when they are biking. I did a LOT of biking this summer and used this for nearly every bike ride. I don&#x27;t know what condition I would be in without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gag gift for my husband.  It arrived quickly and exactly as described.  I am not sure if he has actually used it yet as he really doesn&#x27;t have a monkey butt.</li>
    <li> I love these powders.. My favorite is the Lady&#x27;s Monkey Butt in pink but this one works nice too. I also prefer the smell of the Lady&#x27;s Monkey Butt.  We live in a very dry environment which causes a lot of sweat and these are the best powders I have found. Yes, there is a new scare to talc causing cancers and dozens of families winning against companies using talc.. yet billions have been using talc and the female reproductive cancers in no way shape or form match those numbers. I personally have no statistical fear in regards to using talc</li>
    <li> I have used several powders to prevent and heal my skin chaffing. This is the only one that stays put and covers up my sore spots. I lost a great deal of weight and the loose skin rubs against my firm skin where I am toned. I always put some on after I pat myself dry from showering. This even stays on during a sweatie workout.</li>
    <li> .....probably doesn&#x27;t work as well.  And though I&#x27;ve been&lt;br /&gt;called worse this Monkey product sure fills the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Not flowery scented but works anyway. Better than other&lt;br /&gt;not so &#x27;flowery&#x27; scents!</li>
    <li> Sprinkle some in your shoe if you have stinky feet. It works very well. Amazon wants me to write more but I have nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> While I have been riding all types of motorcycles, off road, back country discovery routes and the highways for over 46 years now.  For the hours I do spend on my motorcycles, this has been a great relief, literally, for my rear end.  I have seen a great improvement over my riding comfort since using this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firefighter and this helps when I have to wear my gear in this hot weather</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, item as described, packaged well.. Thank you</li>
    <li> Hubby won&#x27;t use anything else now!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get enough of this.  not only do i use it where intended i also use it under breast area in the summer.</li>
    <li> My motorcycle gear cause me to sweat in certain areas where I don&#x27;t receive much ventilation. I went on a 10-day, 3,000-mile trip and averaged 8 hours on the motorcycle per day. I rubbed the powder on my elbows, back, knees, and feet where the worst possible sweating usually occurs. After all day riding in hot temps with poor ventilation in those parts, I barely sweat at all. This has now become an essential product for me, and keep it in my motorcycle bags!</li>
    <li> Especially for running, this stuff just about eliminates swamp ass</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to use during summer golf tournaments. He said this works better than anything else we have purchased to control sweating, including products that cost 3x as much. We will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> No other powder works better for keeping you cool and chafe free. It smells good too. Perfect  for athletes.  Every household needs to have a can on hand.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend since he works at a chemical plant as an I&amp;E tech so it gets hot sometimes.  He was complaining about it and mentioned he had this product a while back but he could not find it.  good ol Amazon came in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con is that it is a loose powder so it can get messy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall great product !</li>
    <li> As a year round cyclist, and someone who works out frequently enough, this stuff is a godsend. I don&#x27;t know what mystery molecules are in it, but it cools, soothes, smooths, and heals. A must have to deal with them swampy days!</li>
    <li> As a butt powder, it&#x27;s fine, but it horribly fails to live up to its claim of being \\&quot;anti-monkey\\&quot;. I took my 13-month-old with a me on a boat tour of the Amazon rain forest; I selected this butt powder specifically for its alleged anti-monkey properties for this occasion. While he never suffered diaper rash once on this excursion despite the humid and sticky climate, I can&#x27;t say that any monkeys were repelled. In fact, I think they might have actually been attracted by the product, as several rainforest capuchin monkeys harrassed me and those seated near me for nearly a mile on the riverboat trip. One even tried to make off with my son! Well, I will certainly continue to use it as a butt powder, but I&#x27;ll look elsewhere for my anti-monkey needs.</li>
    <li> Funny name but my husband prefers this product over other powders on the market.  Use to buy at WM but not available at ours anymore.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say I like to keep things clean and smooth down below. This can make for parts sticking to each other when loose clothing or loose undergarments are worn. This powder keeps things fresh and stick-free so less &amp;#34;adjusting&amp;#34; is needed. Even with daily use it lasts several months. The odor is lite and pleasant.</li>
    <li> This powder works great for most of the time that I use it!  It has A nice fresh scent to it!  It keeps you dry most of the time where ever you apply it to your body!</li>
    <li> I just started using the Monkey Butt.....and I LOVE IT!!!!! I can cut the grass, watch t.v. play some round ball and not sweat a drop. Works great in the areas that really matter to me &amp; the wife. Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dale</li>
    <li> Anti Monkey Butt powder is a must in our house. Hard work usually results in sweat, but this powder makes the uncomfortable feelings associated with this sweating, (chaffing, sticking...etc.) almost  disappear! It also has a heavier consistency than regular &amp;#34;baby powder&amp;#34;- this makes it not &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; everywhere when you apply it!</li>
    <li> After hearing a lot of talk about this product, I was a little disappointed with it. I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance, and it does not really help that well with chafing. I would probably not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good product!</li>
    <li> Met expectations. Where&#x27;s off with a lot of skin to skin rub, but definitely helpful.</li>
    <li> Currently I&#x27;m using this powder on my baby and it&#x27;s just alright. I wish it had more of a fresher scent to it. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything at all and when I change his diaper it leaves a pink stain in it from the powder which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I gotta say, this stuff really works.  It keeps you dry and comfortable pretty much all day.</li>
    <li> Works much better than regular baby powder. It feels a bit weird putting it on the first few times because it&#x27;s a powder but it kind of feels like lotion when applying it, but it works all day. In my job I&#x27;m usually sweating for 10 hours straight and it prevents chaffing the entire day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this over and over again to use inside socks to prevent feet from sweating.</li>
    <li> Recommended by urologist, husband is hairy person and this product kept him eliminates from sweat odor. He like it.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a christmas gift. Great gift idea and it got a good laugh too. Is being used well.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works. way better than gold bond. this stuff lasts and lasts</li>
    <li> I take care of a person cannot get out of bed, so is important yo keep dry this product works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my firefighter son who does a lot of physical, sweaty work.  He has been using it for a couple weeks and says it&#x27;s the best.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best for chafing, controlling sweat-those moments in the gym-and just for feeling comfortable.  My police officer son in law puts it in his wet suit to be able to slide into his suit. Not perfumerey will not interfere with cologne and very long lasting on skin, it does not disappear as soon as you apply.  I love this stuff and order by the case, I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great when riding. Does the job at keeping you comfortable</li>
    <li> Silky smooth and a very fair scent that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I should be wearing a diaper.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that could relive chafing, redness and sweat...this fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the powder is super silky and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, we really enjoyed this product&lt;br /&gt;and will be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> i think i am allergic to this</li>
    <li> Yes, I sadly suffer from heavy sweating from down below from my groin and butt areas. It&#x27;s not easy to deal with, but items like these make it easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTICE: These products don&#x27;t really soak up sweat like anti-perspirants do. They more or less just prevent friction in the area, which was bad for my case, because I can sweat just because I&#x27;m sitting down. And no, I&#x27;m not overweight, I&#x27;m actually a fairly skinny guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s more like 3.5 stars, but I don&#x27;t like to mislead people into greater expectations.&lt;br /&gt;-It smells kinda weird, but like my situation, it&#x27;s probably better than what it covers up.&lt;br /&gt;-Kinda hard to apply, I just normally pour some in my hand and then try to work something out.&lt;br /&gt;-I bought this along with \\&quot;Fresh Balls\\&quot;, which is like a lotion version which dries up fairly quickly. I prefer Fresh Balls.</li>
    <li> No more chaffing on long bike rides. I think that says it all about this product.</li>
    <li> I use it under my back brace everyday , this stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Not smelly like Gold Bond powder. Soft powder. Helps heal those rashes we get when sweating at work or in sports.</li>
    <li> It was a gag gift for my monkey lovin&#x27; daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> I have issues with chafe. Bad issues. I work my a__ off for a living, and anything else after that from walking the dog, driving, well... I have had issues going on for a long time, tried a great amount of things to make it stop and keep it clean, to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; properly. Yes, to everyone who sees this as I did thinking it&#x27;s a  gag, I found some in a tractor supply shop and finally asked the employee who passed by, if it worked and he said it really does. I took a bottle home, and honestly, it really works, has a pleasant smell, and stopping the tendency to chafe areas down there is the KEY to healing yourself. I am glad to see amazon carries it, as I&#x27;ll be buying it here, now. This stuff stays on for a LONG time, which is what you need, no need thusfar to reapply, and I have REALLY put it to the test in hot, humid, weather, when anything else, baby powder included would have washed off with the amount of sweating I have done, like I have come inside with clothing soaked, the kind of thing where it must be hung up to dry before putting it in the dirty clothes hamper, and down there, is dry as a bone.  I am honestly REALLY relieved to have found out about this stuff!</li>
    <li> Funny name but it does work.</li>
    <li> I use this product under my breasts along with milk of magnesia. The combo keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice a whole lot of difference between this in baby powder other then the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this powder.  I would not be without it summer or winter. Keeps you dry and comfortable. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s pretty much gold bond on steroids.  Since I grew up on a farm we found this stuff at the mercantile when I was young and have used it since in lots of ways, sports in particular.</li>
