### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I work at a horror attraction during October and this is the best scar wax that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Stuff works great!</li>
      <li>I made my husband&#x27;s joker scars with this worked great!</li>
      <li>It was awesome!</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>This wax is perfect for scars or wounds of any kind!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>The plus side is that if you know what you&#x27;re doing, then the wax is great to use.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>It was my first time using modeling wax, so I was unsure of what brand was best.</li>
      <li>It makes Lovely wounds!</li>
      <li>it get warm</li>
      <li>stayed on nicely.</li>
      <li>you will need to take some out, and warm it in your hands.</li>
      <li>Also to be truly honest I like this modeling wax</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll tell you right now I will never work with it again!!!</li>
      <li>This modeling wax is so easy to use!</li>
      <li>Really good just like nose and scar wax, came in the mail fast and works good</li>
      <li>Thank You for quick ship and packaging well!!</li>
      <li>The end product was pretty good, however in the heat the nose kind of bubbled and slid.</li>
      <li>Im not so sure about this wax.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>i wasnt able to form or create anything with this wax.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you seal it with PLENTY of latex as it heats up while you wear it.</li>
      <li>I did use spirit gum to hold it to Franenstein&#x27;s brow bone, but it sure wanted to fall off.</li>
      <li>This wax  was very easy to use and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>Fantastic product and blends smooth into skin, helps create wicked scars and wounds!</li>
      <li>Now my opinion is if you really want a good ointment for your hands or fingers try (Lucas&#x27; Papaw Ointment)</li>
      <li>more then the Ben Nye, it seems that Ben Nye wax melts much more quickly with your body heat</li>
      <li>But this is so easy to work with.</li>
      <li>I bought it because it had good reviews and youtuber Madeyoulook by Lex highly recommends it...</li>
      <li>I bought this scar wax and some liquid latex, and made a gorey Halloween bullet wound in my forehead that had people cringing all night.&lt;br /&gt;Super sticky, but that is perfect for placement, and a little bit of lotion on your fingertips allows you to work well with it once you have it where you want.</li>
      <li>This wax is very sticky if it gets warm.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>But I would just smooth it out every 1-2hs and it would go back to looking good.  </li>
      <li>then Graftobian does and this is a true fact because I tested it out.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend not getting this junk any type of scar wax unless you know for sure you don&#x27;t have to have Vaseline coming out your eyeballs..</li>
      <li>just make sure you put baby powder/ lotion on fingers first because it&#x27;s very sticky</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff easy to use and mold into the shapes you want I did a giant scar down my face and into a big hole in my neck looked amazing</li>
      <li>Cute, portable and very loud.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a busy tone signal when dying</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very very sticky and gummy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alittle weird to get used too aT first this is a great product!</li>
      <li>It makes one heck of a real life wound!</li>
      <li>And most definitely do NOT go into the jar with your fingers because this stuff will stick to the underside of your nails and the thought &amp;</li>
      <li>It could have been because it had been in transit that the item got hot and sticky</li>
      <li>but as I found out, you need latex to make this work (which from my first experience, I said &amp;#34;screw</li>
      <li>but if you want a longer lasting wound that doesn&#x27;t fall off try using spirit gum BUT make sure you have spirit gum remover.</li>
      <li>At first it was really tacky and we couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in the shape we wanted bc</li>
      <li>You really have to check graftobian&#x27;s page on their website for this product for application.</li>
      <li>This wax was very sticky, but you could mold it.</li>
      <li>As stated in other reviews, the wax can get very sticky, very quickly when working with it.</li>
      <li>Normally I use latex and tissue for wounds</li>
      <li>Loved the idea behind this</li>
      <li>Way goopy and never dried</li>
      <li>Some people are sensitive to these sort of things.</li>
      <li>If you do not seal it well its gets really soft and can shift.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent- just do your homework about application (use baby powder on your fingertips for application) and removal- save yourself some grief because it wax.</li>
      <li>;) The product melts nicely from your body heat for application but when you have it on your skin, and you start cutting the wound you want or molding it to the shape you want, your body heat will continue to melt the wax and doesn&#x27;t stop melting.</li>
      <li>It did exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
      <li>Much softer than expected but a quality product overall.</li>
      <li>About 24 hours after using it I developed a dry patch in the shape of where the grin was.</li>
      <li>and it does stick to your fingers but what modeling wax doesn&#x27;t, but there is nothing like a little Vaseline ointment on the tips of your fingers can&#x27;t fix and it will not stick as much.</li>

<li> Its a bit hard to use just wet your fingers and press more firmly.</li>
<li> Extremely tacky and hard to smooth even with wet tools...</li>
<li> downfall randomly speeds up the songs sometimes and it sounds like the chipmunks are singing for a few then goes back to normal.</li>
<li> it, not worth it!&amp;#34</li>
<li> If I did have any complaint it would have to be the actual molding</li>
<li> If I do it again I would use less olive oil.</li>
<li> Had no instructions, way to sticky compared to other brands, and was not easy to work with.</li>
<li> but it kept melting off even when I tried to mix with a little bit of spirit gum.</li>
<li> This is Junk so dang messy you cant work it into shape you want it unless ur covered in Vaseline and still it sticks</li>
<li> it is a little hard to work with</li>
<li> small tub but works well</li>
<li> and i payed for it with hard earned money</li>
<li> I was extremely disappointed when I found it, like some other people have, with the lid cracked, same with others, it had a piece of cardboard on it to keep it from getting ruined.</li>
<li> we probably just don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly but it smells like a bandaid and is hard to wash</li>
<li> so it was a bit hard to work with.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed on this wax its very stick and hard to mold with !</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard and thick.</li>
<li> it is not good i try to use it</li>
<li> but I was not able to use thiw as this left nasty hard to get off wax patches.</li>
<li> False advertising.</li>
<li> it self, it stuck like crazy to my fingers</li>
<li> Does not work well with fake blood!</li>
<li> a must have for any halloween gory wounds!</li>
<li> it&#x27;s almost impossible to work with..</li>
<li> OMG it was sticky and terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is definitely a product for those with experience. As stated in other reviews, the wax can get very sticky, very quickly when working with it. The plus side is that if you know what you&#x27;re doing, then the wax is great to use.</li>
    <li> small tub but works well</li>
    <li> It was awesome! It blended in beautifuly with my sisters and my skin tones. If I did have any complaint it would have to be the actual molding it self, it stuck like crazy to my fingers so it was a bit hard to work with.</li>
    <li> This modeling wax is so easy to use! I made a realistic scar in seconds and it lasted hours with just a little talc.</li>
    <li> Loved the idea behind this but it kept melting off even when I tried to mix with a little bit of spirit gum.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have participated in several zombie walks over the years and I am into FX makeup as a hobby. This product is excellent- just do your homework about application (use baby powder on your fingertips for application) and removal- save yourself some grief because it wax. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a girl who loves theatrical makeup. ... put a checkmark in the terrific gift box. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This is Junk so dang messy you cant work it into shape you want it unless ur covered in Vaseline and still it sticks it get warm it&#x27;s almost impossible to work with.. I highly recommend not getting this junk any type of scar wax unless you know for sure you don&#x27;t have to have Vaseline coming out your eyeballs.. It&#x27;s not Graftobian fault or who sells it, it&#x27;s the wax the consistency you have to have a lot of patience to work with this stuff and I&#x27;ll tell you right now I will never work with it again!!!</li>
    <li> This wax  was very easy to use and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;We will be using this with our costumes and ordering it again and again</li>
    <li> This wax is very sticky if it gets warm. Haven&#x27;t quite mastered using it yet. When it sets it seems to work well enough.</li>
    <li> Stuff works great! My daughter is getting into stage makeup and this stuff is what she wanted. It does the job!</li>
    <li> Its a bit hard to use just wet your fingers and press more firmly.</li>
    <li> Extremely tacky and hard to smooth even with wet tools...</li>
    <li> Normally I use latex and tissue for wounds so I was worried using this for my halloween costume this year. I was not disappointed. It makes Lovely wounds! Just make sure you seal it with PLENTY of latex as it heats up while you wear it. If you do not seal it well its gets really soft and can shift. ( it IS wax after all)</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed when I found it, like some other people have, with the lid cracked, same with others, it had a piece of cardboard on it to keep it from getting ruined. I tried to use it anyways and it was too sticky, I tried to use olive oil, but it just wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> Stuck to EVERYTHING but my face.</li>
    <li> This wax is perfect for scars or wounds of any kind! It&#x27;s very hard and thick. you will need to take some out, and warm it in your hands. It makes one heck of a real life wound! a must have for any halloween gory wounds! Thank You for quick ship and packaging well!!</li>
    <li> Cute, portable and very loud.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a busy tone signal when dying just so you know to listen for.&lt;br /&gt;One downfall randomly speeds up the songs sometimes and it sounds like the chipmunks are singing for a few then goes back to normal.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed on this wax its very stick and hard to mold with !</li>
    <li> I truly like this modeling wax and yes I am not gonna lie it is a little hard to work with and it does stick to your fingers but what modeling wax doesn&#x27;t, but there is nothing like a little Vaseline ointment on the tips of your fingers can&#x27;t fix and it will not stick as much. Now my opinion is if you really want a good ointment for your hands or fingers try (Lucas&#x27; Papaw Ointment) now this is something that even the professionals use you can find this here on Amazon as well. Also to be truly honest I like this modeling wax more then the Ben Nye, it seems that Ben Nye wax melts much more quickly with your body heat then Graftobian does and this is a true fact because I tested it out. Now the wound done in this picture was without any adhesives whatsoever but if you want a longer lasting wound that doesn&#x27;t fall off try using spirit gum BUT make sure you have spirit gum remover.</li>
    <li> It did exactly what I expected it to do. I applied lotion on my fingers before I played around with it which minimized the stickiness drastically. I made my husband&#x27;s joker scars with this worked great!</li>
    <li> Had no instructions, way to sticky compared to other brands, and was not easy to work with. Ended up not using it and just trashed it seeing as it was used and therefore not returnable.</li>
    <li> This wax was very sticky, but you could mold it. I did use spirit gum to hold it to Franenstein&#x27;s brow bone, but it sure wanted to fall off. He had to keep pressing it in place. Still, you could blend edges and add makeup. It served the purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought this scar wax and some liquid latex, and made a gorey Halloween bullet wound in my forehead that had people cringing all night.&lt;br /&gt;Super sticky, but that is perfect for placement, and a little bit of lotion on your fingertips allows you to work well with it once you have it where you want.</li>
    <li> Really good just like nose and scar wax, came in the mail fast and works good just make sure you put baby powder/ lotion on fingers first because it&#x27;s very sticky</li>
    <li> we probably just don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly but it smells like a bandaid and is hard to wash</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and blends smooth into skin, helps create wicked scars and wounds!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alittle weird to get used too aT first this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Im not so sure about this wax. It could have been because it had been in transit that the item got hot and sticky but I was not able to use thiw as this left nasty hard to get off wax patches. i wasnt able to form or create anything with this wax.  Not happy with an item I expected more from</li>
    <li> I work at a horror attraction during October and this is the best scar wax that I&#x27;ve used. Of course its sticky, its wax.</li>
    <li> I used this wax with liquid latex to create a Glasgow grin. It worked well but you MUST use moisturizer on your fingers to keep the product from sticking. It&#x27;s very very sticky and gummy. Also, the product worked BUT it gave me an allergic reaction. About 24 hours after using it I developed a dry patch in the shape of where the grin was. I don&#x27;t think it was the latex since it was over the wax. I would recommend testing it out before you put it on your face, just in case. Some people are sensitive to these sort of things.</li>
    <li> I was making an Owen Wilson nose for Halloween and this did the trick. It did take some work with though. At first it was really tacky and we couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in the shape we wanted bc it kept sticking to our fingers. After you tubing a how-to video we added some olive oil and that worked wonders. We then added some make-up foundation to blend it. The end product was pretty good, however in the heat the nose kind of bubbled and slid. But I would just smooth it out every 1-2hs and it would go back to looking good.  If I do it again I would use less olive oil.</li>
    <li> Much softer than expected but a quality product overall.</li>
    <li> False advertising. Not like picture. Different wax. Way goopy and never dried</li>
    <li> It was my first time using modeling wax, so I was unsure of what brand was best. But this is so easy to work with. I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> it is not good i try to use it and it woudnt come off i cant return it either and i payed for it with hard earned money</li>
    <li> Works great. Would buy again if needed. -Holly</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff easy to use and mold into the shapes you want I did a giant scar down my face and into a big hole in my neck looked amazing I do suggest getting stuff to set the wax though.</li>
    <li> You really have to check graftobian&#x27;s page on their website for this product for application. OMG it was sticky and terrible. I bought it because it had good reviews and youtuber Madeyoulook by Lex highly recommends it...but as I found out, you need latex to make this work (which from my first experience, I said &amp;#34;screw it, not worth it!&amp;#34;) The product melts nicely from your body heat for application but when you have it on your skin, and you start cutting the wound you want or molding it to the shape you want, your body heat will continue to melt the wax and doesn&#x27;t stop melting. By the end of Halloween night, I had patches of modeling wax on my shirt, fingers, and hair. And most definitely do NOT go into the jar with your fingers because this stuff will stick to the underside of your nails and the thought &amp;#34;what the hell was i thinking?!&amp;#34; will come soon after. I gave it two stars because the paint/colors applied onto it stayed on nicely.</li>
    <li> Way too sticky to work with. Does not work well with fake blood!</li>
