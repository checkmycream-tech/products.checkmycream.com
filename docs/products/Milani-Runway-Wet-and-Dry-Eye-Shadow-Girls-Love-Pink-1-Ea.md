      <li>I have gotten so many compliments on the color</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve caused myself all manner of irritations using that top layer.~</li>
      <li>And I dust off the top of all my eyeshadows before I use them.</li>
      <li>I should have known better.  </li>
      <li>I love this eye shadow - it glides on.</li>
      <li>Milani is my favorite</li>
      <li>Blends perfectly and is simply amazing over dark purples, medium purples, blackened blues.</li>
      <li>The perfect ICE PINK color that you can&#x27;t find anywhere!</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is not too strong .</li>
      <li>love it, very nice eye shadow, enjoy wearing pink, hope you had a great new year, and one to follow.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a brand one, even for a cheap one</li>
      <li>Looking on Milani’s website, I don’t even see this eyeshadow listed, which I’m not sad for you because I didn’t love it.</li>
      <li>This is such a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>Fun fact</li>
      <li>It looks way more pink in the picture, it is so light</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find it in local drug stores and was so thankful that Amazon had it available!</li>
      <li>for me personally I don&#x27;t use that top glitter layer.</li>
      <li>It looked so pretty on the photo</li>
      <li>I love it over my reddend brown maybelline shade with the lilly white milani on my brow bone.  </li>
      <li>I dust off the top coating that is really for packaging purposes only anyway, and in my opinion should never be used).  </li>
      <li>It can pretty fast and the product its self is very pigmented</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention I guess, but it&#x27;s not a real Milani eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I love this pink shadow for my brow.  </li>
      <li>like I said it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
      <li>I live for this eyeshadow!</li>
      <li>It was a really light pink with sparkle in it, but when I put it on my lids, it basically was just like putting glitter on there.</li>
      <li>The tamper seal had been pulled away from the container, and a very large gouge run across the entire pot.</li>
      <li>Kmart was going out of business and wasn’t buying new products...</li>
      <li>This shadow is very glittery but light enough to blend well and the color gets bolder when you apply it with a wet brush!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought more expensive shadows (like high-end ones at department stores) and this holds up just as good, if not better, than those.</li>
      <li>Top layer with glitter and the rest no color and hard??</li>
      <li>My personal opinion... don&#x27;t waste those $5 bucks or whatever, just get some at the dollar store that might be even better quality.</li>
      <li>For the eyeshadow, I actually went looking for the Bella line when I was shopping, and I guess they were too new for my Kmart to carry (or</li>
      <li>None of the pink shade really came through, and the only way to get any color was to load up on product and use a liquid like Mac Fix + to help give it a boost.</li>
      <li>And this must be a knock off of Milani, as it came with a very cheap thin foam applicator that was visibly used!</li>

<li> This one was awful!</li>

    <li> This shadow is very glittery but light enough to blend well and the color gets bolder when you apply it with a wet brush!</li>
    <li> For the eyeshadow, I actually went looking for the Bella line when I was shopping, and I guess they were too new for my Kmart to carry (or Kmart was going out of business and wasn’t buying new products...that’s probably it). Looking on Milani’s website, I don’t even see this eyeshadow listed, which I’m not sad for you because I didn’t love it. It was a really light pink with sparkle in it, but when I put it on my lids, it basically was just like putting glitter on there. None of the pink shade really came through, and the only way to get any color was to load up on product and use a liquid like Mac Fix + to help give it a boost. I wasn’t going to recommend that for you, but I’m still wanting to try out the Bella line, because I really good things about that.</li>
    <li> When I received my order I was thrilled!  Until I opened the package! I ordered three of the Milani shadows, and two of them were fine! This one was awful! The tamper seal had been pulled away from the container, and a very large gouge run across the entire pot. And this must be a knock off of Milani, as it came with a very cheap thin foam applicator that was visibly used! Immediately emailed the seller, and have yet to receive any response!  Dont know what I was thinking!  I should have known better.  This one is on its way to the trash can and half afraid to even use the other two! Hope others get a better product and experience!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  I wanted more sparkle to it.  Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Nice eyeshadow. Could last a little longer, though. I&#x27;ve learned, over time, that silver sparkles do not flatter me as well as they would on someone with a cooler skin tone. It was my fault that I bought the wrong shade, but I love Milani shadows.</li>
    <li> I use it as a highlighter over dark lipstick. It creates a center of the lips glow.  I don&#x27;t use it as eyeshadow. I have aquamarine eyes and use that color for eyeshadow.  My only complaint is that although it stays in the drawer, the lid breaks off early on.  So I just toss the lid and leave it uncovered since I am not carrying it in my handbag.  Parenthetically, all make-up cases suck.  Planned obsolescence.  Boo.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t find it in local drug stores and was so thankful that Amazon had it available! Fun fact: I use it as highlighter/blush more than eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> The pigmentation is not too strong . You need to put a lot to see it .</li>
    <li> I love this pink shadow for my brow.  It goes with every color I put on my lid.  I have green eyes and use an olive green shadow or a purple shadow and this goes well with both.  It stays on great and I just put it on once a day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and use it dry.  I&#x27;ve never tried it wet, so I don&#x27;t know how well it would do.  I think it&#x27;s a great buy for the price.  I&#x27;ve bought more expensive shadows (like high-end ones at department stores) and this holds up just as good, if not better, than those.</li>
    <li> This is such a gorgeous color. I use it often. It can pretty fast and the product its self is very pigmented</li>
    <li> The best color for me.  I love this eyeshadow. I am very happy with this color, &amp; will continue using it. I have gotten so many compliments on the color</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye shadow</li>
    <li> love it, very nice eye shadow, enjoy wearing pink, hope you had a great new year, and one to follow.  thank you</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention I guess, but it&#x27;s not a real Milani eyeshadow. It looked so pretty on the photo and when it arrived I was a bit confused... like I said it&#x27;s not the real thing. But I don&#x27;t mind it as much as how it&#x27;s really bad quality and trust me, I buy cheap makeup. The color looked gorgeous on the package but when I ran my fingers through it was just glitter and no color at all... not only that but after I passed my finger on it a bit all the glitter came off and the eyeshadow was unusable. Top layer with glitter and the rest no color and hard?? I do not recommend this to anyone. Really bad product and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a brand one, even for a cheap one it&#x27;s still bad and well, learned my lesson. Only buy eye makeup in stores where you can see it and maybe try it as well. My personal opinion... don&#x27;t waste those $5 bucks or whatever, just get some at the dollar store that might be even better quality.</li>
    <li> I live for this eyeshadow! I use it wet. The perfect ICE PINK color that you can&#x27;t find anywhere! And for a girl who&#x27;s a pale &#x27;muted winter&#x27; this is an absolute must have staple color. (This is a high shimmer pearl shadow under a small protective layer of glitter. I dust off the top coating that is really for packaging purposes only anyway, and in my opinion should never be used).  Blends perfectly and is simply amazing over dark purples, medium purples, blackened blues. And blackened mulberry shades. I love it over my reddend brown maybelline shade with the lilly white milani on my brow bone.  I even highlight my cheeks with a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;~And for me personally I don&#x27;t use that top glitter layer. And I dust off the top of all my eyeshadows before I use them. There is generally a minimal layer of something to protect the shadow while on the shelf and  you don&#x27;t want to use that on your eye. I&#x27;ve caused myself all manner of irritations using that top layer.~</li>
    <li> It is very good I love it it is the best eye shadow I have ever had yea yea yea</li>
    <li> Not a good color. It looks way more pink in the picture, it is so light you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on. Milani is my favorite and it&#x27;s all I use, disappointed in this color</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow - it glides on. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
