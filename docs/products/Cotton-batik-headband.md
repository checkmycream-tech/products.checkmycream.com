      <li>I put mine through the washer and dryer and they all come out fine.</li>
      <li>It fit well around the head</li>
      <li>Fit well, appears like it is in the picture.</li>
      <li>bright mix printed headband is very cute, but way too tight.  </li>
      <li>At the end of the 12 hour shift the top of my head was very tender, haven&#x27;t tried it since.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, it is just the right size.  </li>
      <li>I get lots of compliments and is just fun to wear!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>The color of the blue one is mostly tan like another reviewer indicated but</li>
      <li>I love the colors in the  fabric and the fact that the band size can be adjusted simply by folding the fabric</li>
      <li>Thanks you!</li>
      <li>The bright mix headband is workable if you have an incredibly small head.</li>
      <li>It stays put and doesn&#x27;t slip off of my very fine hair like other handbands have.</li>
      <li>and I did not like it as much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cotton headband, there&#x27;s not all that much to say about it.</li>
      <li>The Cotton batik headband is a bit snug, but potentially  wearable, but the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; cloth is 90% light brown.  </li>
      <li>I bought both a Silly yogi bright mix printed headband and a cotton batik headband.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty wide head band.  </li>
      <li>Wished it had been a bit more narrow than wide in front</li>
      <li>I wore it at work to try to keep my hair up in my surgical cap, I have thick hair and the cap elastic is cheap, so my hair is a battle all day at work.  </li>

<li> It has a narrow elastic back covered with the same fabric as the front.</li>

    <li> Bought for my daughter and she loved it!</li>
    <li> very good product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this Headband.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty wide head band.  It fit well around the head and it does stay put.  The color of the blue one is mostly tan like another reviewer indicated but I did like it a lot.  Wished it had been a bit more narrow than wide in front but i think you can fold it to achieve a smaller look.</li>
    <li> Fit well, appears like it is in the picture. Not super soft but not scratchy either.</li>
    <li> I love the colors in the  fabric and the fact that the band size can be adjusted simply by folding the fabric</li>

    <li> it is okay. My mom loved this, but the I bought one for me and I did not like it as much.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I wore it at work to try to keep my hair up in my surgical cap, I have thick hair and the cap elastic is cheap, so my hair is a battle all day at work.  At the end of the 12 hour shift the top of my head was very tender, haven&#x27;t tried it since.  Will have to figure a different avenue to maintain hair at work.</li>
    <li> I bought both a Silly yogi bright mix printed headband and a cotton batik headband.  The Cotton batik headband is a bit snug, but potentially  wearable, but the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; cloth is 90% light brown.  Given the photograph of the product, I knew to expect some brown but the color should be labeled differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bright mix printed headband is very cute, but way too tight.  I gave it to my 9 year old daughter who found it a bit tight too.  The bright mix headband is workable if you have an incredibly small head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cotton headband, there&#x27;s not all that much to say about it. It has a narrow elastic back covered with the same fabric as the front. The front opens wide or can be folded to a smaller width. I put mine through the washer and dryer and they all come out fine. None have faded.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear mine for style, I wear it because I sweat when I am out in the sun gardening and like that it is all cotton. It stays put and doesn&#x27;t slip off of my very fine hair like other handbands have.</li>
    <li> Arrived within a week and fits perfectly. It stays on tight enough so that it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, but also doesn&#x27;t slide back off my head</li>
    <li> Once for myself another for my sister as a gift she loved it. Will order again if needed. Thanks you!</li>
