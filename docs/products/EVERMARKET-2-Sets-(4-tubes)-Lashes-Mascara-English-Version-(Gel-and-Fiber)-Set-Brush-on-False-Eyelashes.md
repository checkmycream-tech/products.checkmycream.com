      <li>This doesn&#x27;t get fibers in your eyes it stays on your lashes and makes them look so long and lush.</li>
      <li>I have the high quality Brands; yet, I pick this one hands down.</li>

    <li> I love this product.  NotHing else works to enhance my lashes like this does!  Easy too apply....Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> All I&#x27;m going to say is  you can definitely tell it&#x27;s cheap 👎👎</li>
    <li> I have never had so many compliments on the length of my lashes!!!</li>
    <li> Great Mascara makes my eyes pop. This has lasted me months. I will need to buy a few new bottles  soon will buy it from this seller because I get 2 sets for the incredible price of one. This doesn&#x27;t get fibers in your eyes it stays on your lashes and makes them look so long and lush. I had long lashes to begin with but this mascara makes my lashes so much longer.</li>
    <li> It is very good price the same result like unique tha product coming before date, I have returned to order again</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried that this brand wasn&#x27;t going to be as good as the name brand but guess what??? It&#x27;s better!!!! Thanks so much for great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a NYX doll eye or Maybelline false fiber girl, and this duo impressed me even without the extra free pack! You don&#x27;t get as much separation between lashes but they are definitely long!</li>
    <li> Did not like made my eyes feel weird</li>
    <li> This product worked very well when I used my friends. However, I ordered this product and it just seems like it works but then they fall later. Nice&lt;br /&gt;Product when you have time for touch ups.</li>
    <li> One of the packages did come with no fibers in the tube. But all the others did. You have to apply heavy mascara before placing on the gel, then the fibers. It was what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> Okay first of all, I&#x27;m going to say that this product is AH-MAZING. If you know how to use it. It&#x27;s not like regular mascara. There&#x27;s a wet adhesive stringy layer that you put on first so that you can then brush on the fibers. You can&#x27;t be too generous because it can get clumpy if you try to rush. It&#x27;s very easy to do though but I&#x27;d advise always adding a last coat if the wet adhesive over the dry fibers to keep them in place otherwise they&#x27;ll flake off a little. All in all it&#x27;s a BRILLIANT product. And you get two for the price of one. WORTH IT</li>
    <li> Dont even waste your money its stringy and the fibers tube is all dried out!!</li>
    <li> Lots of fibers, not enough gel, did not last long at all</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Best gell mascara out there. I have the high quality Brands; yet, I pick this one hands down. Doesn&#x27;t bleed or run. It comes off with no scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love!</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best... why spend so much on younique when this does the same for such a better price....I have the name brand version and it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing.... the results are amazing! I suggest you watch the YouTube video first in how to apply... I just bought 5 more!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my daughter and I to try out.  These are awesome!  They really work - my daughter could tell the difference in my lashes from across the room, and I only used one coat!  I do not wear a lot of makeup - usually only eyeliner, mascara and lipstick. I am definitely buying these again.  The price is for TWO sets and so affordable.</li>
    <li> love this its amazing for the price</li>
