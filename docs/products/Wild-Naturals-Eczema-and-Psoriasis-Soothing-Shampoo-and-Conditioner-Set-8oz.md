      <li>So far, very happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Itchiness is now &#x27;bearable&#x27;, which is a huge improvement!</li>
      <li>After 2 months of use, I&#x27;ve found my pillow has been much more oily than before, even though I wash my hair every night.</li>

      <li>I wish I could give them a better review</li>

      <li>After using this combo, my hair felt softer, smoother and much more manageable.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I went to four dermatologists, none of whom was able to help me.</li>
      <li>I love this products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it has helped my daughter&#x27;s psoriasis (since that is really auto immune) but the conditioner is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on her hair (and I buy salon products)  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, lathers ok and leaves my hair nice and soft</li>
      <li>No scent at all which is a HUGE plus for allergic to everything people like me.</li>
      <li>but I dont enjoy being called an &amp;#34;old-man&amp;#34; by my classmates</li>
      <li>They make your hair feel great, but left my scalp flaky, so I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
      <li>It took about 2 weeks of use for her to stop itching, but now she is itch free.  </li>
      <li>I wish the bottle were just a bit bigger because I like purchasing my favorite hair products in salon-type sizes but they are in medium, fairly generous-sized bottles.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner are natural and good for the hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still leaving 5 stars because of their great customer service, getting back to me so quickly, and being so kind and professional in every response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Original post:&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this 4 star only because I&#x27;ve just started using the product, but so far I&#x27;ve been impressed.</li>
      <li>I have recently tried this shampoo + conditioner set by Wild Naturals, and it worked great!</li>
      <li>I did not order these to treat Eczema or Psoriasis, but they are gentle and moisturizing and I think that anyone with sensitive skin or damaged hair could greatly benefit from using them.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so soft, shiny, healthy, and curly!</li>
      <li>My hair is nice, soft, clean, and manageable.</li>
      <li>NO to happy the the shampoo is watery,very different from the first time</li>
      <li>My hair looks gorgeous and full of life because of these two simple products.</li>
      <li>It is affordable and the company will send you a FREE E-BOOK on skin care, with your first order.</li>
      <li>This is new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I can surely say they have a new forever customer.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is my favorite, It makes your hair feel so silky and soft and moisturizes your scalp so well!</li>
      <li>Today is Sunday, my scalp feels great and my dry frizzy hair feels and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had tried products that were gentle, organic, fragrance-free, and free of chemicals, toxins, and detergents.</li>
      <li>My scalp has frequently been itchy, and I&#x27;ve noticed more hair loss than before.</li>
      <li>also like the fact that all ingredients are natural and aren&#x27;t adding to more pollution/chemicals getting into the water system.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Wow, I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
      <li>Speaking from experience it is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Not exactly what I needed but its still a good product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Amazing, after trying countless products and wasting so much time and money, it&#x27;s a relief at this point to have a product that works so well.</li>
      <li>After the first wash I noticed relief from the itch although I still had flakes of dandruff</li>
      <li>First time that I order this product I love it , second time</li>
      <li>After first use, rash almost gone BUT</li>
      <li>Thanks for this!</li>
      <li>I learned more about skin and scalp, after reading the e-book, than I did during my visits with four different dermatologists.</li>
      <li>However, it hasn&#x27;t really helped that I can tell, and doesn&#x27;t quite seem worth the price.</li>
      <li>First time using these products.  </li>
      <li>I stayed consistent with the shampoo and conditioning.</li>
      <li>After seeing these results so quickly, I have high hopes that the health of my scalp will continue to improve.</li>
      <li>Though it did make my hair feel really nice, but I can not use it due to the itching.</li>
      <li>Though I understand why the shampoo and conditioner is $50.00 (since they don&#x27;t use water to create more substance like most shampoos out there), it doesn&#x27;t seem to last 24hrs before my scalp gets itchy and dry and flaking all over again.</li>
      <li>I have very long super fine hair that tangles if you look at it.  </li>
      <li>First shampoo and conditioner that have really helped my eczema</li>
      <li>Her hair is super soft and lustrous.</li>
      <li>I would really really recommend these products and they are MADE IN THE U.S.A.  </li>
      <li>and I applied gallons of shampoo and conditioners, in these categories: Rx, OTC, hair salons, Whole Foods, Amazon, Etsy, and home-made recipes.</li>
      <li>It contains no fragrance or colors and is gentle on his head.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to people suffering from psorasis/dry scalp as it is much healthier for you then the chemicals in the tar shampoos</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work with me.  </li>
      <li>I really hope this is a forever product for me.</li>
      <li>however is very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product! After first use, rash almost gone BUT NO ITCH! I&#x27;m so happy that the itch is gone! I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural. It takes such a small amount so the bottles will last a long time. I will be a life long customer and can&#x27;t wait to get some cream for body use as well. I highly recommend this product because it does what it says it will do and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products that did not work.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this set and I am extremely particular about shampoos and conditioners. I did not order these to treat Eczema or Psoriasis, but they are gentle and moisturizing and I think that anyone with sensitive skin or damaged hair could greatly benefit from using them. I&#x27;m picky about the smell of shampoos and conditioners and this one is the perfect mix of honey and citrus. I find that many products that contain honey can be overly thick and have an artificial scent to them, but this one smells like genuine honey with just the right amount of energizing zestiness from the orange peel. The shampoo was hydrating and thoroughly cleansed my hair without stripping away all of the natural oil from my hair. When I used the conditioner, it felt like I was adding even more moisture instead of replenishing what was taken away from the shampoo which is unfortunately how I feel with many shampoos and conditioners. I wish the bottle were just a bit bigger because I like purchasing my favorite hair products in salon-type sizes but they are in medium, fairly generous-sized bottles. After using this combo, my hair felt softer, smoother and much more manageable. I ordered this product with a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have had psoriasis and dry scalp for over 40 years.  I like this product because it is a low suds, all natural shampoo/conditioner. It is a little more expensive than the shampoos at my health store however is very concentrated.  I have very thick hair and a small amount of both shampoo/conditioner penetrates to the scalp easily and leaves my scalp feeling renewed and it does not itch or flake!  I recommend this product to people suffering from psorasis/dry scalp as it is much healthier for you then the chemicals in the tar shampoos and they do not test on animals!!!  Very pleased with this product.  Excited to try other products from Wild Naturals.</li>
    <li> So im slightly modifying my rating from 4 to 3 star after using this product for longer. I have found that sole use of this product on a regular basis caused my hair to be heavy and weighted down by the shampoo in some spots. I suspect because I wasnt evenly applying the produst - for which i believe was made difficult because the shampoo doesnt lather well at all. Therefore, ive taken a hybrid approach - used this shampoo and mixed a very small amount of my shampoo with it for lather. This has helped apply the shampoo evenly while allowing me to still reap the benefits of less itch and dander. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original post:&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this 4 star only because I&#x27;ve just started using the product, but so far I&#x27;ve been impressed. First off, the same day I purchased this product, it was delivered. Thank you Amazon Prime! So far I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and conditioner twice and already seen a difference. After the first wash I noticed relief from the itch although I still had flakes of dandruff but by the second wash (and correctly applying the conditioner to my scalp) I noticed less dandruff. The best part, is this stuff doesnt leave my hair oily or greasy. After seeing these results so quickly, I have high hopes that the health of my scalp will continue to improve. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great products.  First shampoo and conditioner that have really helped my eczema and I have tried several.  The conditioner is maybe the best I have ever used.  The shampoo and conditioner are both very soothing when applied and have helped to clear up the eczema problem.  I have been using the product for about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that all ingredients are natural and aren&#x27;t adding to more pollution/chemicals getting into the water system.</li>
    <li> I wish this worked for me but after using several times my scalp still is irritated and itching within a day or so.  I don&#x27;t use styling products so it&#x27;s not irritated from anything like that.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Thanks for this!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific hair product!  My daughter has eczema, and had been itching at her scalp frequently. I had tried numerous products with no success, then ordered Wild Naturals.  It took about 2 weeks of use for her to stop itching, but now she is itch free.  Her hair is super soft and lustrous. Thank you Wild Naturals!</li>
    <li> Products arrived same day, as promised. Great customer service follow up. Very light fragrance and good ingredients. Working well so far!</li>
    <li> I used this product as instructed for almost 30 days with nothing else and it constantly left me with an itchy scalp, I had hopes this would subside but it did not. Though it did make my hair feel really nice, but I can not use it due to the itching. Very disappointed and unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are both wonderful! My husband used them both two days ago and he said his scalp feels wonderful. The products have a nice scent which is not overpowering. I checked his scalp today and it still looks healthy with absolutely no flaking and he is having no itching symptoms. We are very pleased with the results of these products and are so glad we found them on Amazon! My husband&#x27;s dermatologist has prescribed several medicated shampoos which have not worked nearly as well, plus they are full of chemicals. Thank you, Wild Naturals, for your excellent products!</li>
    <li> I  must admit I was  skeptical, its been my experience that so many products always  claim they will do this or that, yet never deliver. Having suffered from Psoriasis  and Eczema since I have been in my late 20&#x27;s some  30plus years  ago now I have tried nearly everything out there.  This product definitely  delivers!  I have only used it a couple times so far as I have only just received it recently, but so far, my hair does not feel dead, or like a scouring  pad any more. Its soft, shinny, it feels alive. Hair loss already seems a bit less, but not gone completely. Itching has been reduced from 100% to about 80%. My hair is not as dry as it was.  and even with oil treatments it was still dry before. I would highly recommend giving this product a try, I truly  don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner it works amazing for my hair and suds and cleans well. It&#x27;s the only one I can use and doesn&#x27;t affect my hair color. I have bad eczema not on my head but I&#x27;ll get really itchy if I use regular shampoo not with this!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a dry scalp problem.  Wonderful shampoo and conditioner with a light scent.  Leaves my hair soft and my dry scalp was improved after just 2 washes.  Especially liked the conditioner.  I have fine hair and it did not weigh it down or leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasisof the scalp.  I thought this product would help relieve the itch and sooth my scalp, but I have yet to feel/see improvements.  The same goes for the cream. 😒</li>
    <li> This has done nothing for my scalp! It weighs your hair down and it smells like skeeter dope. ( bug spray) Would not waste money on this again!!!</li>
    <li> The best product we&#x27;ve found to combat scalp eczema. After a few uses there is virtually no signs of the eczema. It&#x27;s Amazing, after trying countless products and wasting so much time and money, it&#x27;s a relief at this point to have a product that works so well.</li>
    <li> I have very long super fine hair that tangles if you look at it.  I have eczema outbreaks on my scalp. I have pretty much tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market that is organic only.  I am very very surprised that it has healed my eczema and itchy scalp.  I can comb my wet hair in 5 min rather than 15-20 min AND NO BREAKAGE.  Unbelievable product!!!</li>
    <li> Definite improvement in my itchy atopic eczema after using the shampoo. Itchiness is now &#x27;bearable&#x27;, which is a huge improvement! Thank you to other reviews that made it try it.  Although the shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam up, don&#x27;t worry, the usual amount will rinse out and leaves hair squeeky-clean.</li>
    <li> I bought these following all the high reviews. Unfortunately they did not work for me. I understand that not all hair growth products will work for everyone, but this shampoo didn&#x27;t even seem to clean my hair properly. I have fairly oily hair. After 2 months of use, I&#x27;ve found my pillow has been much more oily than before, even though I wash my hair every night. My scalp has frequently been itchy, and I&#x27;ve noticed more hair loss than before. The conditioner feels pretty average as well, but more likely due to my hair just not feeling clean. Definitely not worth the price, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, lathers ok and leaves my hair nice and soft but so do a lot of other shampoos/conditioners. I bought this for the itchy scalp problem I have and this has not helped at all, in fact, the itch seems worse. Definitely not worth the high price.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell good. They soothed my itchy scalp. Haven&#x27;t used them long enough to give a full review but so far they make my scalp feel better than harsh medical shampoos.</li>
    <li> First time that I order this product I love it , second time NO to happy the the shampoo is watery,very different from the first time&lt;br /&gt;No to happy</li>
    <li> This is new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Supposed to help with scalp issues, but it did nothing but make it worse</li>
    <li> I love this products.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The only thing to make it better would be a larger size for the same price</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo and conditioner set for people with skin sensitivity. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days now with no reaction and old reaction spots from other products are clearing up. I really hope this is a forever product for me. My hair is nice, soft, clean, and manageable. No scent at all which is a HUGE plus for allergic to everything people like me. Wish I had known about this wonderful product sooner.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but they did refund me. I still have dandruff after 26 days of use. I stayed consistent with the shampoo and conditioning. It may have helped a little, but not enough to notice the flakes and dandruff I have.</li>
    <li> this is the only product I will use to soothe my aching scalp</li>
    <li> Seller cemented the sale with the help of a coupon. I ordered this on 7/2 and received it on 7/4 and used it the same day. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that would help my extremely sensitive scalp &amp; this did the trick. I am grateful to find a product that worked on my stringy, dry grey hair, this combo is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Speaking from experience it is worth the price.  If you have scalp issues and need a shampoo and conditioner that will sooth the itchy dryness of your scalp this is the one.  Please give this a try.  I know it&#x27;s a bit expensive but in the long run the relief this product gave me is well worth it.  This may not work for everyone but for ME this is great!  I would really really recommend these products and they are MADE IN THE U.S.A.  They have acquired a new customer and I will tell others about this product.</li>
    <li> Still looking for a remedy for my dandruff.  Didnt help too much but like the fact its natural. If I use too much it makes my hair oily so a little can go a long way depending on hair type. Not exactly what I needed but its still a good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it has helped my daughter&#x27;s psoriasis (since that is really auto immune) but the conditioner is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on her hair (and I buy salon products)  Can&#x27;t imagine not using it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I tend to have a dry, itchy &amp; scaly scalp. Though I understand why the shampoo and conditioner is $50.00 (since they don&#x27;t use water to create more substance like most shampoos out there), it doesn&#x27;t seem to last 24hrs before my scalp gets itchy and dry and flaking all over again. I even tried washing my hair twice then conditioning w/ the same results. I&#x27;m about done using both of bottles and I still have the same issues. Moving on to another shampoo to hopefully fix my scalp psoriasis.... :(</li>
    <li> I had struggled with scalp issues for years. Tried everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, on the market and nothing worked. I was embarrassed to go to the salon not to mention it was painful and itchy. Gave this a try as a last ditch effort and within a couple weeks there was about 50% improvement and within a couple months about 80% improvement and now that it&#x27;s been 4-5 months it&#x27;s COMPLETLY healed!! It&#x27;s not going to work overnight, but give it time. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> this is for my 20 year old grandson who has the same problem.. we have very hard water here in our area.. my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and managable in a long time my hair is silver,, recommend whole heartedly.</li>
    <li> For ten years, I have suffered from a chronic, severe, painful scalp condition: &amp;#34;seb derm&amp;#34; and folliculitis, which made my life a torment. I went to four dermatologists, none of whom was able to help me. In my search for a remedy, I spent lots of money and I applied gallons of shampoo and conditioners, in these categories: Rx, OTC, hair salons, Whole Foods, Amazon, Etsy, and home-made recipes. Nothing worked and some of the the &amp;#34;remedies&amp;#34; made it even worse! I had tried products that were gentle, organic, fragrance-free, and free of chemicals, toxins, and detergents. I have super-sensitive skin and scalp and I cannot even use &amp;#34;California Baby Super-Sensitive Unscented Shampoo and Body Wash.&amp;#34;  So, I searched Amazon and found this pH-balanced product, with all of the good ingredients and none of the bad.  It is affordable and the company will send you a FREE E-BOOK on skin care, with your first order. I learned more about skin and scalp, after reading the e-book, than I did during my visits with four different dermatologists. Do what I did: Throw away every other hair product and use ONLY this product line! I have been using ONLY the &amp;#34;Wild Naturals&amp;#34; Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I have thick, naturally curly hair and I wear my natural silver color.  I shampoo &amp; condition my hair every day. My hair has never been so soft, shiny, healthy, and curly! My scalp is healing thanks to this wonderful product line.  I ordered my second set of &amp;#34;Wild Naturals&amp;#34; Shampoo &amp; Conditioner because I do not want to run out! The pH balance may be the secret ingredient for which you have been searching!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I used the shampoo a little while longer and it still feels so natural and clean on your hair and doesn&#x27;t make it feel like you&#x27;re putting a bunch of chemicals on it. Unfortunately, for some reason, instead of continuing to help my scalp clear up like it did when i first used it, it did the opposite and made it even worse.  I contacted the seller for a refund and I&#x27;m still leaving 5 stars because of their great customer service, getting back to me so quickly, and being so kind and professional in every response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 23 years old with long thick hair.  i have the most uncontrollable dandruff that I&#x27;ve been battling for 10 years already and have tried and spent hundreds on shampoos and nothing has helped even a bit. This is the only shampoo that has been helping. It hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of the dandruff but I&#x27;ve only used it twice and it was when my dandruff was at its worst. This shampoo and conditioner set makes my hair feel so clean after I use it and a little really goes a long way. The conditioner is my favorite, It makes your hair feel so silky and soft and moisturizes your scalp so well! Aside from the shampoo, i can&#x27;t begin to say how amazing the customer support is. They were so quick in getting back to me when i sent them an email about an issue i was having with my order. They resolved the issue 10x better than i thought they would and by the emails i could tell they cared more about making sure i was happy with my order rather than just making a buck. In a couple of weeks i will come back to this review and update how well the shampoo is working for me and hopefully by then i will have complete relief from my dandruff. I have very high hopes for this wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo and conditioner! For months I have been very miserable, I have been suffering from redness and itching in my scalp, I suffer from eczema and have very dry hair and to add I also color my hair which makes it worst. I have tried many expensive shampoos as well as organic products and nothing has worked. After more research, I found Wild Naturals Eczema &amp; Psoriasis Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and decided to try it, never heard of this brand or company but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I received it on the mail this past Tuesday and tried right away, what a relief “no itching” I thought maybe it was my imagination because I was desperate for something to work. I said well my scalp is going to start itching tonight; the itching is going to wake me up. Well that did not happen, next day just very, very minor itching. I washed it again on Thursday and no itching and the redness is subsiding. Today is Sunday, my scalp feels great and my dry frizzy hair feels and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;I am not the one to leave comments on products but I have to do it for this one. This has alleviated the constant itching on my scalp, which was embarrassing and miserable. I read the ingredients and everything is natural!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a month now. I like that it&#x27;s clean, natural, and gentle, and it&#x27;s overall decent hair care. However, it hasn&#x27;t really helped that I can tell, and doesn&#x27;t quite seem worth the price. I will be shopping alternatives, rather than purchasing this again. If it were a bit cheaper, I would definitely recommend it since it is superior quality to typical haircare, but at $40, it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> Great customer service and prompt&lt;br /&gt;delivery. I really like the smell of this shampoo and conditioner. They make your hair feel great, but left my scalp flaky, so I won&#x27;t buy them again. I&#x27;d recommend the set if you&#x27;re looking for a decent shampoo and conditioner, but not if you want to get rid of flakes.</li>
    <li> Wow, I LOVE this product.  I have struggled with dandruff and an itchy scalp for as long as I can remember.  I tried this product and what a difference.  The flaking and itchy immediately decreased and after  2 weeks of regular use, I am flake and itch free.  I can not believe how well this worked.  My husband even commented on how healthy and nice my hair looks now.</li>
    <li> My son suffers from eczema and this Winter has been brutal for his scalp.  This product helped to soothe his dry itchy scalp.  It contains no fragrance or colors and is gentle on his head.  I like the wholesome ingredients that are in this product.</li>
    <li> I got these in exchange of my honest review and I can surely say they have a new forever customer. This shampoo and conditioner are natural and good for the hair. My natural oils were not stripped and it cleaned my hair at the same time. It&#x27;s hard to come by so even though it seems a little pricey, its well worth the cost. My hair looks gorgeous and full of life because of these two simple products. Most shampoo are so bad for your hair they tell you to go as long as you can without washing it; I&#x27;m pretty sure you can wash your hair everyday with these items. I am absolutely in love with my hair and I have only been trying these for a couple of days now. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after months of using this product.</li>
    <li> First time using these products.  So far, very happy with the results.  Calming and soothing to scalp.  Relieves itching and hair conditioned and soft.  No striping as I have colored/highlighted hair.  Would recommend using daily and switch for other shampoo/conditioning products. I use with an apple cider vinegar rinse prior to use. I recommend. 4 star rating due a new product user.</li>
    <li> I have recently tried this shampoo + conditioner set by Wild Naturals, and it worked great! I did feel my hair got drier in the beginning (since the product is sulfate-free), but my hair did get cleaner and stronger after using this set for one week. Previously my hair gets oily quickly and I need to wash my hair every other day, but now it is the third day after my last hair wash, and my hair feels not as oily as before. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short open-package video can be found @ http://youtu.be/fYWb5nVGSEU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as expected for the price😞</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo and conditioner as well as the skin cream they sell. I have found these products to be expensive and not so effective. I wish I could give them a better review but my psoriasis didn&#x27;t improve a bit with use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work with me.  I tried in conjunction with a shampoo brush and it still didn&#x27;t get rid of my recurring dandruff.  I&#x27;d like a refund if possible.  Edit--  Yuri was extremely helpful in terms of customer service so I edited my review. The shampoo just seems to bring my dandruff to the surface though giving my hair a greying look. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal but I dont enjoy being called an &amp;#34;old-man&amp;#34; by my classmates</li>
