      <li>I used it on my fingernails, too, having never used clipper on my fingernails, and again, was pretty happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I managed well and was pretty happy with the results.</li>
      <li>it is very smooth.</li>
      <li>Sure, it wouldn&#x27;t look as good, but I&#x27;d gladly trade clean looks for better function.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Clippers received for sincere review.</li>
      <li>Probably safely stored away.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>nail file is interesting.  </li>
      <li>Glad I purchased them.</li>
      <li>I received this item free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I know it calls that out in the item description, but holding them in your hand will put it more into perspective.  </li>
      <li>These are fantastic for fingers nails &amp; toe nails!  </li>
      <li>Love these clippers.</li>
      <li>am satisfied.</li>
      <li>reading this $9 to put towards something better.</li>
      <li>owned!!!&lt;br /&gt;Could not ask for a better product, Than You</li>
      <li>They worked so much better</li>
      <li>They are my now favorite clipper.</li>
      <li>I actually like the file best of all - it won&#x27;t wear out the way</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call them &amp;#34;mens cutters&amp;#34; more like Baby cutters.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with these clippers, which have now replaced the other pairs that I own.  </li>
      <li>I have a size 15 feet with substantial toenails, and I was very excited to give these toenail clippers</li>
      <li>I decided to invest in a few more dollars for a nice nail clipper, and I have to say I am quite impressed.</li>
      <li>First the good.</li>
      <li>The good thing about these being stainless steel is that you can sanitize them more easily.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, good quality, stainless steel tool and I find it adequate for both fingernail and toenail service.</li>
      <li>but they cut very clean and are easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s top handle has a curve/depression that allows my thumb to settle in securely.</li>
      <li>to use on both fingernails and toenails.&lt;br /&gt;Provider has followed up 3 times with very useful info about nail care and making sure everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>So sharp and glass nail file that came with them perfect!  </li>
      <li>Easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Not as easy to use as I thought, wish they opened wider.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having a good set of unisex nail tools is important, and this set from Klick Professional has really filled that gap for us!</li>
      <li>Also which is great, it comes with a very sturdy nail filer, it has a very modern look with a frosted glass appeal.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, but I&#x27;m still getting used to its shape--which is not tapered or curved at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used them and the cut was easy and smooth, did not split or splinter my nails at all.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for giving my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>And the clipper is huge, so if you have big hands, these would be great for you.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will not return it, the effort would constitute more than the $10 refund is worth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are not very sharp at all and don&#x27;t cut my nails cleanly.</li>
    <li> Opens too small to fit toenails. It works on my hands but my toe nails are too thick to fit in the small opening. Pleased with the quality but not the small opening. I wouldn&#x27;t call them &amp;#34;mens cutters&amp;#34; more like Baby cutters.  &#x27;Edit&#x27; They contacted me saying if the opening is smaller than 3mm then it&#x27;s a defective batch. I used a micrometer to measure the inside diameter and it read 1.35mm. They responded by sending me a free pair of clippers. Awesome! But When I received them I tried them out and they were still too small. A little bigger but they measured at 1.89mm witch is not near 3mm like they claim the opening would be. I ended up buying a generic pair from my local cvs. Even tho the toenail cutters I orderd were too small they did in the end refund me my money.</li>
    <li> Do everything clippers should do.  Fast service.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a nail clipper except that they cut well and are comfortable. Well, this nail clipper is sharp, easy to hold and looks really neat as well. It comes with a glass nail file as well. While the nail file is small and really for touch ups and not complete nail care, the clipper is large and probably better suited for toenails. You can use it for fingers but if you want really precise or small for children, you will need a smaller set.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive nail clipper with a unique nail file made of glass. I personally had never seen anything like this nail-care set. It comes in a gift box and would make a nice stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both men and women would be comfortable using this nail clipper. It is neither particularly masculine nor especially feminine but rather somewhere in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is made of brushed steel, and it feels light and comfortable in my hand. It doesn&#x27;t slip when I am using it in my left hand, as some nail clippers do. Though this clipper is as large as a typical toenail clipper, it works well on fingernails, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass nail file works fairly well, though for toenails, I ultimately had to finish up with an emery board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewer disclosure: I received a sample of this product from the merchant who sells it here on Amazon in order to test it out before writing an impartial review.</li>
    <li> These clippers work really well for me. They are sharper than others I&#x27;ve used and made of stainless steel. Not much else to say other than I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
    <li> These are extremely sturdy nail clippers. They can handle the thickest nails including toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these to clip my toenails. They use a lot of leverage so that it takes next to no effort to use them. As described, they&#x27;re precision clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also a bit larger than the product photos make them appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clippers received for sincere review.</li>
    <li> hello,   this is a quality nail cutter and the included file is a great product.  the file makes the cuts extra smooth as it is not a gritty as some diamond nail files.  it leaves the nails smooth and clean.  but, it is small, clear and can get lost in your drawer.  the cutter blades are sharp and can cut fingernails, and thicker toenails.  a great product and delivery.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using these clippers. They are very different from the clippers you buy in cheap bins in the store. They are very sharp and the length of them make it easier to clip your nails accuratly. The best part is the included file.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully, exceeding my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have thick nails and these work very well.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of using cheap nail clippers that break, get dull or rust, I recently discovered that there are better ones out there.  I guess I just never realized that the clippers nail salon professionals use were available for regular people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Klick Professional clippers are very well made, sharp and comfortable to use.  I had no problem even cutting the thick nail on my big toe, where many clippers wimp out.  The top handle of this clipper is perfectly shaped for firm control and secure grip, and the blades are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included with this set is a wonderful nail file.  It&#x27;s made of glass and does a perfect job of filing and smoothing nails after clipping.  I actually like the file best of all - it won&#x27;t wear out the way emery boards do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features of this set:&lt;br /&gt;- solid brushed stainless steel for a lifetime of use&lt;br /&gt;- larger size for men or women&lt;br /&gt;- ergonomically shaped handle for secure clipping&lt;br /&gt;- sharp cutting edge that doesn&#x27;t leave ragged nails&lt;br /&gt;- Clips cleanly with only gentle pressure&lt;br /&gt;- attractive box that&#x27;s nice enough for gift giving&lt;br /&gt;- a glass nail file&lt;br /&gt;- money-back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current price as I write this review is $9.98, which is a lot more than dollar store clippers, but I have to say these are ten times better than any clippers I&#x27;ve bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Klick Professional nail clipper set for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for giving my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> best clippers i have every owned.</li>
    <li> All is good. BEST nail clipper i ever owned!!!&lt;br /&gt;Could not ask for a better product, Than You</li>
    <li> It seems Ok but not as effective as the pliars style I have used for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came with nice glass nail file.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very sharp but the opening is very small. hard to get my husbands toe nail in the tiny slit.. Nicely made not cheap junk. Packaged nice and presentable. Overall a great product and I would recommend. Purchased free or at a discounted price for my own honest unbiased review</li>
    <li> These clippers are as advertised and actually got here a day earlier than posted. I like the way they cut and the way they fit my hand, and they are a breeze to using my left hand.  The only shortcoming I have found is the opening in the blades is too narrow, they will not open enough for thick nor acrylic.  The glass file is great I can&#x27;t complement it enough and I think it is worth the price of the whole kit!</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made, somewhat masculine looking pair of large clippers. As a man that&#x27;s refreshing, since all &#x27;unisex&#x27; products are usually designed for female buyers.&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel has a brushed finish rather than the usual polished &#x27;mirror chrome&#x27; finish, and there are cutaways as shown in the current photo on both the handle/lever and the end of the clipper body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large oval cutout hole on the lever would allow you to attach a lanyard if so inclined. I had an uncle who&#x27;d had a stroke and had difficulty with dropping small items like clippers, and a lanyard was very helpful to him with small items.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if that was the conscious intention here, but it would definitely work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers do cut cleanly and neatly, and I do find they&#x27;re easy to use left-handed. Large enough for toenails. Operation is by the standard clipper swivel-handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a cardboard retail display box suitable for gift wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;Also included is an unexpected bonus, a nail file made of clear transparent material (glass?) that&#x27;s rather heavy for its small size.&lt;br /&gt;The sanding end is frosted. The nail file also works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice clippers. Sample sent for testing and impartial review. I like these.&lt;br /&gt;At a current price of $8 delivered, they&#x27;re a few dollars more than competing clippers at a zillion discount stores, but on the other hand these look like they&#x27;ll last forever if you don&#x27;t lose them, and it&#x27;s refreshing to see a grooming product that looks like it&#x27;s actually designed for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful to you as you comparison shop online.</li>
    <li> They are toe nail clipper size but curved like finger nail clippers.  Easy to hold. Work well.</li>
    <li> These are the clippers you want instead of the discount store ones. They work admirably well.</li>
    <li> good quality, sharp and easy to grip, but, the jaws don&#x27;t open far enough as compared to others I  have owned</li>
    <li> Great for fingernails!  For thick toenails like I have, the Heavy-Duty Sharp Nail Clippers do not open as much I would like to.  Otherwise, they are good for the price I got them for.</li>
    <li> This my first new set of nail clippers in probably 30 years. I had an upcoming elbow surgery and knew there was no way my old set would make the grade. These worked as well as I could have possibly hoped. The ergonomics seem great and I was able (with a little ingenuity) to get a good cut even with the injured arm. The new sharp blades no doubt helped and I am really satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Took a chance at paying a higher price to get a better product -- the delivered!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use on both fingernails and toenails.&lt;br /&gt;Provider has followed up 3 times with very useful info about nail care and making sure everything is great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This a very sharp nail cutter; however the opening is a bit narrow that its use is limited only to fingernails. I bought this hoping I could use also it on my toenails but as the space between the cutters is too small, I could not use it on my toenails. It might work on women&#x27;s toenails but not on men&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It is big, sharp, easy to use and it appears to be durable. It is a stainless steel and cut designs that help provides precise and pain-free nail cutting for a long time if used as directed. There&#x27;s also a semi-transparent nail file in the box, which is nice. It was nice to give as a gift  so it&#x27;s packaging is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product for  free for a  complimentary review. All I can say it works on fine and thin nails but if you use it on thick nails, it does not work that good. But I like the fact that it is very handy, just the right size for adults but for kids i suggest to use smaller ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered on  time and I have no issues with packaging at all. Still a good product for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> First the good. These clippers are high quality and nice looking. They came with a small glass file that I wasn&#x27;t interested in but it turned out to be a perfect file -- just the right grit and small size. The clippers are sharp and cut cleanly through my thick/hard big toe nail, which is why I went for this upgrade over the cheapies.&lt;br /&gt;However I expected them to be easier to hold than the standard kind you find in the stores, but they aren&#x27;t. They are a little too long and your thumb wants to slide down the lever arm. That hole doesn&#x27;t really help. I wish the whole thing was about 1/2&amp;#34; shorter, with the lever bent with a scoop at the end (like a shovel that has been bent backwards a bit) so that you could apply constant force all the way down without worrying about it slipping out from beneath your thumb. Same with the bottom/fixed arm, which could be shaped to provide a better grip, maybe concave and thicker at the end to give your index finger more to brace against. Sure, it wouldn&#x27;t look as good, but I&#x27;d gladly trade clean looks for better function.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product. Its a good quality heavy duty clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that their customer service is really appreciable.</li>
    <li> These are good quality clippers and very sharp. It would have been nice if they came with a pouch to accomodate the clippers and the glass file.</li>
    <li> Love it. However, I only use it for my fingernails as the gap between the blades isn&#x27;t wide enough for my toe nails. The glass file is a nice bonus too.</li>
    <li> Met expectations but was a little smaller and more angular. The leverage and grip is good.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper! Perfectly smooth edge and not very strong.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product and was asked for review. First I noticed the attractive nicely designed packaging. Upon opening I could see that these clippers were made with an attention to detail, and on holding them in your hand you could tell that they were well made. I have had ZERO problems with it. They clip my nails cleanly and smoothly, without fault.The jaws are open wide, so it was good using it on my big toe. I managed well and was pretty happy with the results. I used it on my fingernails, too, having never used clipper on my fingernails, and again, was pretty happy with the results. And the clipper is huge, so if you have big hands, these would be great for you.&lt;br /&gt;The nail file works better than any other nail file I have ever used. Thank you for this gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using nail clippers from drugstores all my life, until I came to the conclusion that those nail clippers just weren&#x27;t cutting it. I decided to invest in a few more dollars for a nice nail clipper, and I have to say I am quite impressed. The nail clipper is larger than a normal fingernail clipper, so my first impression was that it was a toe nail clipper; however, it works great on nails. Although, I was in fact disappointed about the nail file included. I expected that the nail file would work as great as the nail clipper, but after 3 uses, it seems as though parts of the filing surface was already worn down, leaving a dull file. Overall, I recommend the nail clipper, but not so much the nail file included.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! They trimmed my toenails even without soaking first, as one does when having a pedicure.  They are my now favorite clipper.</li>
    <li> These are good nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time getting real excited about nail clippers, but I learned many years ago that good clippers are worth spending your money on. So I don&#x27;t remember the last time that I used cheap clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little file works well and I can recommend this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for me to test and review.</li>
    <li> Solid product, well designed and built.  Makes short work of even thick nails.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Very well made, very sharp, and a bit longer than most other nail clippers, which is much appreciated by those of us with larger hands. Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Five stars for design, sharpness, and stainless steel.  Original item received had flaw, seller was quick to address problem.  Great customer service, and great clipper, because of the design even my kids can use it with ease.</li>
    <li> Regular nail clippers are so tiny and hard for me to use, but this clipper is pretty big and it worked really well for me.</li>
    <li> As soon as you take your Klick nail clippers out of the box you will notice the difference in these clippers compared to your run of the mill clippers.  First off these clippers are large.  I know it calls that out in the item description, but holding them in your hand will put it more into perspective.  The clippers are a thick, brushed stainless steel that feels high quality.  The clippers have a swivel open, opening to a very wide angle compared to other clippers.  The wide angle, I have found, allows for better control while clipping.  The cut-out on the clippers aid in achieving a secure hold.  I never feel like there are going to slip out of my hands like sometimes happens with my other clippers.  Clipping my nails with these clippers is effortless.  They are very sharp yielding a clean clip every time.  The included file is nice to have as well.  Because it’s glass I don’t have to worry about it bending or breaking with use.  I am very happy with these clippers, which have now replaced the other pairs that I own.  I received this item free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as I thought, wish they opened wider.</li>
    <li> These toe nail clippers are actually very difficult to use which sounds strange, but i think it might have something to do with the size of the blades on the clippers themselves. I&#x27;m still giving a 3 star review because the nail file that comes with the clippers is fantastic. Wish I could just buy the file by itself.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;They seem very good. The opening to insert the toenail isn&#x27;t quite as large as I am use to but they cut very clean and are easy to use. My wife loves the file it is very smooth.They are very well made.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These clippers are very nice and have a good quality feel to them.  I used them and the cut was easy and smooth, did not split or splinter my nails at all. The good thing about these being stainless steel is that you can sanitize them more easily. I felt like these were very good clippers with a nice smooth cut, no jagged ends.  Best clippers I have used, and they seem like they will be nice for a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband keeps his fingernails a little longer than most, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find him a good set of clippers to help him keep on top of them. This set of large clippers and glass nail file from Klick Professional has made it easy and enjoyable for him to take care of his hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has always complained that the clippers I use are too small for his &amp;#34;man hands&amp;#34;. These clippers are over 3&amp;#34; long and clip almost his entire nail in one press! The handle is easy to manipulate and takes very little pressure to achieve a clean cut. The cutaway design in these clippers looks very classy as well - who would have thought nail clippers could look good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails take more than an occasional upkeep, and the included glass file is amazing for daily maintenance! This file never dulls and anything built up in it rinses out clean under a stream of water. It&#x27;s easy for all of us to use and quickly takes care of any sharp or uneven edges. The small size makes it perfect to stash on the desk in our office so my husband is more likely to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a good set of unisex nail tools is important, and this set from Klick Professional has really filled that gap for us! I did receive this product at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how well these clippers cut his nails, nor does it effect my review.</li>
    <li> Wish I had purchased these years ago, grooming is so quick. Good investment in myself.</li>
    <li> + Really sharp&lt;br /&gt;+ Doesn&#x27;t rust&lt;br /&gt;- Never did cut with with corners from the start (design flaw, where one side is straight and the other is bent, so the jaws do not align) It&#x27;s sharper than my 8 year old clipper, but I still have to go back to the old one for cutting hangnails and cuticles with corners, which is a major deal for using a nail clipper in the first place.</li>
    <li> I guess I am a minority of one.  I hated these clippers.  they seemed cheaply made and the handle bends when I cut my nails.  The 99 cent version from walmart was much sturdier built, just as large and did just as good a job.  save some money and go to walmart.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever used. Very sharp and easy to hold. Glad I purchased them.</li>
    <li> The jaws of this clipper is not wide enough to get my thumb nail in position for cutting.  If this was a couple of mm wider at the jaws  I would give it a higher rating.  It is not worth returning and I will look for another clipper.</li>
    <li> So I figured paying $9 for nail clippers would mean at least some guarantee of quality. But, I was wrong. I seriously doubt I was blessed with super duper thick toenails, but this product would make you think so. I think part of the problem is that the fancy looking holes in the handle make it bend more easily on a thicker nail (aka a toe nail), thus bending instead of using the force for cutting. I had to kind of &amp;#34;chew&amp;#34; through a few of my nails to get the job done. As far as the glass nail filer, it&#x27;s a gimmick. I think I would have better luck filing my nails on concrete than using this. I bought some glass nail files on Amazon for my wife and those go through nails like a hot knife through butter, but this one you have to sit there and grind on it to make any sort of progress. Really disappointed because I had high hopes, especially when I read all the good reviews. I&#x27;m hoping I can save some of you reading this $9 to put towards something better. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 was because you &amp;#34;can&amp;#34; get the job done with them, just not very well.</li>
    <li> clippers very good. Gave it to my nail tech, she liked it and will use it.&lt;br /&gt;nail filer was kind of soft, could be a little rougher.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is solidly constructed and easy to use. The clipper is sharp and cuts through my fingernails with ease. (I hardly had to exert any pressure.) It leaves a smooth cut on the nails. I’ve also used it on my toenails, which are much thicker and harder to cut. Here too I’ve had excellent results. While I’ve had to exert a little more force, the clipper is up to the task. This clipper also comes with a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; nail file. This works okay, but it&#x27;s a very average file. However, it&#x27;s doubtful anyone will be buying this product for the file. The clipper itself is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Everything I hoped for. I think my nails are harder than usual but the Klick Professional clipped my nails with ease. I didn follow the suggest to soak feet for 20 minutes before cutting.</li>
    <li> I like it. It cuts with no effort.The size is big which I love it, because it stay perfect in my hand and the holes helps a lot for non slipping under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Quality 4 stars. The cutting edges are not very much align, but it cuts perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Nice toenail clippers! There are two features I look for in a nail clipper: The precision of the cutting blades, and how easy it is to grip and manipulate the handles.  This pair works well, although there is a bit of give in the handle you bear down with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting blades meet each other perfectly, and the cutting blades are sharp and make a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to grip both lever handles for a steady hand-hold. It&#x27;s top handle has a curve/depression that allows my thumb to settle in securely. It also have a nice weight: Not too heavy, but not lightweight either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature that may not be important to you, but is to me: It has a totally different look from most clippers. Its distinctive look allows everyone in the family to know these are MINE. I don&#x27;t like using other people&#x27;s clippers, and I don&#x27;t like them using mine. Just a hygiene thing, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file is interesting.  It works fine, but I&#x27;m still getting used to its shape--which is not tapered or curved at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Klick Professional.</li>
    <li> The perfect gift for Father&#x27;s day!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. So sharp and glass nail file that came with them perfect!  Will order again from this seller!</li>
    <li> Used the clippers.  Did a good job on my fingernails.</li>
    <li> Pretty heave but feels sturdy and gets the job done so I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well, I am 82 and finally I have a serious working nail file!  Where were they all these years?  Probably safely stored away.  Yes this clipper is EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is &#x27;NOT so good&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be considered ONLY for clipping FINGER NAILS, NOT toe-nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jaw-Opening is only 2mm wide, which is NOT WIDE at all.  I can barely slip a FINGER nail between the jaws for clipping.  NO possibility of clipping Toe-Nails,.... NONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  clipping blade does NOT seem to be very sharp.  During clipping an average Finger Nail, it is necessary to press &#x27;quite firmly&#x27; in order to make the cut.  The clipper lever flexes noticeably under force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall size of this clipper frame is &#x27;average&#x27;, so it can not generate a large amount of clipping force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I can not recommend this clipper.  I will not return it, the effort would constitute more than the $10 refund is worth.  Chalk it up as &#x27;a lesson learned&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I used my new clippers for the first time yesterday and I have to say they exceeded all my expectations. I had been using and old set of clippers that finally wore down. I picked up a new pair at the grocery store and they had to be the worst purchase I ever made. So I turned to Amazon and saw these clippers and thought what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are awesome I had to clip five or six times with my store clippers with these I only need to clip once. They worked so much better I am ordering my wife a pair. If you need some clippers check these out they are a great deal.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:bbe643cb4bbfd9ef35c9c776289a0504]] I received this product free for review but as always, despite receiving a free product I&#x27;m perfectly candid in my review. See my video for the real details but the highlights are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Very solid construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Pretty quiet as clippers go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The nail file I&#x27;m not sure if really much of a selling point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I hope my review was helpful. If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that you&#x27;d want to know. I always aim to improve.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, good quality, stainless steel tool and I find it adequate for both fingernail and toenail service. It was offered as a &#x27;for review&#x27; item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sharp, easy to use and it appears to be durable. I expect it to last and to help provide precise and pain-free nail cutting for a long time if used as directed. There&#x27;s also a semi-transparent nail file in the box, which is nice. And, just in case you are not a professional nail cutter and could use some advice, some good one is provided on the back of the box such as \\&quot;cut your nails after shower or bath when nails are soft\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s five stars for the product&#x27;s excellent quality and the competitive price.</li>
    <li> I have a size 15 feet with substantial toenails, and I was very excited to give these toenail clippers a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are probably the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It clips through toenails effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The industrial design looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) They&#x27;re quiet and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about these.  If you&#x27;re looking for very high quality clippers, I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kinda clumsy and these don&#x27;t slip out of my hands like the regular ones do...great purchase...fast service...</li>
    <li> First, I am an adult male suffering from carpal tunnel - it&#x27;s horrible.  After being cheap &amp; buying a nail clipper at a local pharmacy for clippers, I immediately knew I needed to upgrade for higher quality clippers.  After a bit of Amazon researching, I came across these &amp; I am soooo glad!  These are fantastic for fingers nails &amp; toe nails!  They are razor sharp &amp; best of all required very little effort to get a superb clean cut.  For someone with hand issues like me, this is a lifesaver.  Just pray you don&#x27;t get carpal tunnel like me &amp; certainly don&#x27;t over use your hands like I have from work - which has led to my condition today.  Also which is great, it comes with a very sturdy nail filer, it has a very modern look with a frosted glass appeal.  The clippers are also very modern as well.
