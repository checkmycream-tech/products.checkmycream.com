      <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>The conditioning quality is great and my shoulder length hair easily combs out.  </li>
      <li>An effective product.</li>

      <li>It is SAFE:</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff..</li>
      <li>started using Tim Swim and noticed my hair has become much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Be advised that it behaves more like a conditioner when you put it on.</li>
      <li>This is my 3rd year of looking for a SAFE swimming shampoo for our family and my search can now stop!!!</li>
      <li>no need for a separate shampoo and conditioner which comes in handy when you have kids or to keep in your swim bag if you need to take a quick shower at the gym</li>
      <li>But that is okay, because it does a fine job of cleaning my hair.</li>
      <li>After a workout I wash my hair and the chlorine smell is instanly gone and my hair is easy to style.  </li>

      <li>I know you don&#x27;t need a lather to make your hair clean.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad it was developed</li>
      <li>It also leave my hair soft and pretty much tangle free.  </li>
      <li>We are senior citizens who have used this shampoo and both of us find it leaves our hair clean, soft and</li>
      <li>Gets rid of the smell of chlorine which is a positive, you don&#x27;t want everyone knowing you just swam</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It really does get the chlorine out.</li>
      <li>Let me say that when Tim Swim sent me a sample—I really didn&#x27;t need another product.  </li>
      <li>It will fast become your staple \\&quot;must-have-on-hand\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I bought this product just as my hair was on the cusp of becoming unmanageable - dry and tangled.  </li>
      <li>Tim Swim is good for the serious athlete and the weekend warrior that wants amazingly soft and manageable hair.</li>
      <li>I swim 3x a week in a highly chlorinated pool.  </li>
      <li>And for hair that feels like soft, manageable hair when you&#x27;re done...</li>
      <li>My husband and I are triathletes, and our 3 kids are active swimmers (2 of which are very blond</li>

<li> I swim 3x a week in a highly chlorinated pool.  </li>
<li> And for hair that feels like soft, manageable hair when you&#x27;re done...</li>
<li> My husband and I are triathletes, and our 3 kids are active swimmers (2 of which are very blond</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely conditioning, though I find that I do need to add conditioner after to long hair.</li>
<li> I am an IM triathlete and have long over processed hair.  </li>
<li> so I have to watch the old green hair chlorine reaction) .</li>
<li> I am a multi sport athlete and track &amp; field coach so it can be difficult to find a shampoo that can effectively clean and condition long hair.  </li>
<li> (I have dry, curly, colored hair and was amazed).    </li>
<li> it&#x27;s makes it difficult to feel like you&#x27;ve gotten all areas of your hair clean.</li>
<li> Left my hair dry and thick</li>
<li> A little goes a LONG WAY!!</li>
<li> Leaves my hair feeling soft without feeling too fried (its already fried enough from the chlorine, no need to make it worse!).</li>
<li> it is different than other shampoos in that it isn&#x27;t as foamy, but that means it is actually what it says it is which is free of nasty chemicals that are in a lot of other chlorine eliminating shampoos....</li>
<li> I have even used it when my hair is dry on the ends to tame them</li>
<li> I&#x27;m coming out of the pool or finishing a half marathon, this shampoo hits the mark.  </li>
<li> Cleans without harsh Sulfates, Parabens, Pthlalates, or Formaldehyde Donors</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like shampooing my hair everyday because I have color &amp; highlights.  </li>
<li> Hopefully it will help with all the past damage that was done to his hair from the YMCA pool.</li>
<li> Everything I have tried in the past has either been full of harmful chemicals,or a horrible time consuming 3 step process or just plain</li>
<li> I have very blonde hair, and this shampoo keeps it from turning an ugly shade of mermaid green.  </li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t think of anything negative.</li>
<li> But for very thick course curly hair</li>
<li> Seems to work well for getting chlorine out, but does not bubble up like shampoo and does not clean dirty hair</li>
<li> You wont&#x27; be sorry.</li>

    <li> My daughter says this shampoo works great on her hair. She is bi-racial and swims 6 days a week. The co wash is definitely the way to go because of the conditioning component involved. 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo! Leaves my hair feeling soft without feeling too fried (its already fried enough from the chlorine, no need to make it worse!). Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Left my hair dry and thick</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great whether you are a swimmer or non-swimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is really good regardless of your age.  We are senior citizens who have used this shampoo and both of us find it leaves our hair clean, soft and shiney!&lt;br /&gt;Highley recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been swimming for over 45 years, and I&#x27;ve tried all the swim shampoos and several others. None of them did as good a job on my hair as Tim Swim. It really does get the chlorine out. I&#x27;m so glad it was developed and I plan to continue to buy it. Be advised that it behaves more like a conditioner when you put it on. It doesn&#x27;t get all foamy. But that is okay, because it does a fine job of cleaning my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  I am a multi sport athlete and track &amp; field coach so it can be difficult to find a shampoo that can effectively clean and condition long hair.  Weather I&#x27;m coming out of the pool or finishing a half marathon, this shampoo hits the mark.  Tim Swim is good for the serious athlete and the weekend warrior that wants amazingly soft and manageable hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy thtis shampoo it is different than other shampoos in that it isn&#x27;t as foamy, but that means it is actually what it says it is which is free of nasty chemicals that are in a lot of other chlorine eliminating shampoos.... Oh yeah it is also a MADE IN USA product...</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for getting chlorine out, but does not bubble up like shampoo and does not clean dirty hair</li>
    <li> I have used the product daily for one week on colored hair. It leaves my hair clean and soft with a good shine. The conditioning quality is great and my shoulder length hair easily combs out.  The scent is mild. I like to try products that may extend my color and condition. I will purchase the product again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  My son and I are both swimmers and we are very pleased with how clean and soft our hair feels when we use TIm Swim.  Highly recommended!</li>

Everything I have tried in the past has either been full of harmful chemicals,or a horrible time consuming 3 step process or just plain didn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1.

Gets rid of the smell of chlorine which is a positive, you don&#x27;t want everyone knowing you just swam&lt;br /&gt;4. Safe for color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;5. A little goes a LONG WAY!! This stuff is going to last us forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sorry but I can&#x27;t think of anything negative.</li>

And for hair that feels like soft, manageable hair when you&#x27;re done...Tim Swim.    It will fast become your staple \\&quot;must-have-on-hand\\&quot; when you realize you can instantly get your fingers through your hair without a comb. (I have dry, curly, colored hair and was amazed).    [...]    Cheers! Tim Swim</li>
    <li> An effective product. I swim 3x a week in a highly chlorinated pool.  My hair is both a fine texture and light coloured.  The chlorine wreaks havoc on it.  I bought this product just as my hair was on the cusp of becoming unmanageable - dry and tangled.  The conditioning shampoo takes away the chlorine, softens my hair improving its manageability and with a pleasant scent.  At the start I did quite a bit of research to find a swimmer&#x27;s shampoo that would would not strip my hair. This is a product is excellent!</li>
    <li> I have very blonde hair, and this shampoo keeps it from turning an ugly shade of mermaid green.  It also leave my hair soft and pretty much tangle free.  Get it.  You wont&#x27; be sorry.</li>
    <li> I am an IM triathlete and have long over processed hair.  Between cycling and swimming to say my hair is fried is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Tim Swim and noticed my hair has become much more manageable.  I love that it is truely a shampoo &amp; conditioner all in one.  I keep this in multlple bags so I always have some on hand.  After a workout I wash my hair and the chlorine smell is instanly gone and my hair is easy to style.  I have even used it when my hair is dry on the ends to tame them a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for swimmers &amp; triathletes.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I have my boyfriend using it now too.  Hopefully it will help with all the past damage that was done to his hair from the YMCA pool.</li>
    <li> This product disbelieve your hair manageable after swimming and smells great. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather. I know you don&#x27;t need a lather to make your hair clean. But for very thick course curly hair it&#x27;s makes it difficult to feel like you&#x27;ve gotten all areas of your hair clean. Unlike others have commented I do need to use a conditioner because just using Tim swim shampoo alone does not work.</li>
