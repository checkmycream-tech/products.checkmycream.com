<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the small size; easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray down shopping carts, unknown counters/table tops or anything else you are not sure of.</li>
    <li> Necessary suppliment to apply to a surgical mask just in case the African Muslim In Chief doesn&#x27;t get a handle on the Ebloa crisis like he hasn&#x27;t gotten a handle on ANYTHING in regard to America&#x27;s safety, much less best interest ;^(</li>
    <li> I had a horrible winter with one bad cold after another. I bought this to help me stay well this coming winter.</li>
    <li> I use this on the plane as an air freshener and as a mood enhancer.  Smells wonderful! Have purchased from this seller before...Awesome</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome.  I purchased it after a friend of mine told me about it and how it helps her staying healthy and not getting sick with colds, cough, or the flu.  A few days after I received this, I woke up with pain in my throat and I just sprayed this directly into my mouth, twice and in an hour I notice that the pain was gone!  I now carry one bottle in my purse and take it wherever I go.  I high recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE Thieves but one of my bottles came and wasn&#x27;t sealed. I ordered 3. I didn&#x27;t  feel comfortable using it due to not being sealed so I ended up with 2. I do use Thieves for everything and I love the smell and tasted so the only reason I gave a 3 was due to the unsealed bottle.</li>
    <li> one of the greatest products I&#x27;ve found to cleanse and deodorize air.  One spray is all it takes.  Very potent.  Last supplier though cheated me on the amount of product sent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it in my massage room to help prevent spread of germs.</li>
    <li> I use these on my chaco&#x27;s when the start getting smelly. Kills the stink and lasts for a while. I&#x27;ve also sprayed them before tossing them in the wash and it keeps them clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> These products were recommended by a friend.  After using it for three months in the winter, I did not realize any protection from the common cold or flu which I expected.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough or trusted too much.</li>
    <li> Great to take traveling for those not so fresh hotel rooms.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Great product to supplement your anti-flu/virus regimen. I don&#x27;t have more to say but have to write 20 more words so this review can be posted here. :)</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  I was trying to come down with a cold; the wife sprayed some in the air.  I could breathe and the next morning I felt good---no sign of a cold.  I spray the soles of my feet every day.</li>
    <li> this is the real deal and will start cleaning you out fast so beware of herxheimer reactions such as sore throats and the body forcing all kinds of phlegm out.. wheew whatta week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product occasionally for about 3 years after having first received it as a gift.  I don&#x27;t have any scientific evidence as to it&#x27;s germ-protecting power; however, I have been sick less frequently when I use Thieve&#x27;s Oil regularly.  I am a music teacher, and I use it to rid my classroom of some of the odors the kids bring in from class to class.  When they enter the room, they say that it smells like Christmas.  I have noticed that when I use it in the classroom, it seems to have a calming and focusing effect on the kids--we are all much more pleasant with one another (including me).</li>
    <li> Wow I Can&#x27;t believe your trying to turn a profit on a free promo</li>
    <li> I have to wear a mask often at work.  I use it on my mask.  After it dries I then apply the mask.  It&#x27;s sort of like an aromatherapy.  The scent has a calming effect and you don&#x27;t mind wearing the mask.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the many uses of thieves.  A friend had suggested I try Thieves, and I am glad I did.  I plan to give the spray bottles as gifts for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This product is great for using as a hand sanitizer as well as an all around wellness product.  Instead of the smelly hand sanitizers they have out there that I am sensitive to, I use this whenever I need it and is not bad for you.  I also use it on the tops of toilet seats before using the bathroom and also when I&#x27;ve started to get a cold, I have rubbed it on my neck and throat area which has stopped the progress of the germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the thieves products and continue to find so many uses. I do not travel without it!  Thank you</li>
    <li> This spray knocked out my sinus infection within 20 minutes.  I gave some to my husband, now he uses it every day.  We love it!!!</li>
    <li> Thought I was ordering a throat spray. When I got it the label says not for internal use - does not help tooth pain if you can&#x27;t put it in your mouth. I do like Thieves Essential Oil as a product though. I&#x27;m using purchased oils as a disinfectant spray as it is intended.</li>
    <li> I work at a school and kids carry all kinds of sickness with them.  Innocent as they are they still have germs.  So far this school year I haven&#x27;t gotten really sick!  I put it on my hands when they are really sick and I spray it on my feet when I feel a little low.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, spray on bottom of feet every day</li>
    <li> I previously purchased a single spray bottle that lasted for several months.  Now I have purchased the 3-pack.  I spray into the cold air return every day or two and it has changed the air in our home.  One bottle can now go to work, too.  The fragrance is gentle and stimulating.</li>
    <li> Thieves is marketed by an MLM company. That is neither her nor there if the product is good. But I&#x27;m not sure it is; and I&#x27;m not sure that all the glowing reviews aren&#x27;t from people who are invested in selling. What really set me off is the fact that this product is not in a glass bottle. Putting essential oils into plastic packaging is very near ridiculous to me. I have seen good castor oil and clove oil eat right through plastic garbage bags. Try a single bottle before you buy a 3-pack. And - it does smell like Christmas - very full of cloves.</li>
    <li> Great Product and it works well.  Great Seller</li>
    <li> i love this i use it on everything i use it everyday. I had a bad sore thorat and it cleared it up and the pain went away thank you i wil;l be ordering more when i get close to running out.&lt;br /&gt;Bradi</li>
    <li> I buy this pack of 3 Thieves Spray and have a bottle in different places. I use it for cleaning and freshen the air and pillows. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely invaluable in my house.  I mainly use it as an air freshener but it is so much more than that.  I feel it purifies the air in bathrooms and kitchen and keeps germs at bay.  One spray is all you need.  I have used it several years and would not be without it.  I don&#x27;t like using regular room sprays as the perfumes bother me, but I have no reaction to this spray.</li>
    <li> Amazon has a list of the many beneficial uses of this product.I have used it about 2 years now and ordered extras.  I have given them to several people and one is my nurse.  She used it on an inflamed scrape on her leg.  It killed the bacteria, got rid of the inflamation and the sore is healing nicely. I have used it to deoderize and disinfect shoes and slippers; I sprayed on bad collar stains and other stains-(2-3 sprays), let it set overnight and washed the items with hand soap-success; great on bug bites; gets rid of bad breath,etc.  This stuff is so versatile.  It contains plant products (clove,etc) so check for allergies before you buy it for skin use.  I highly recommend it.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> This handy spray can be used for everything from a breath spray to freshening up a room to a deodorizing spray for the bathroom. I never leave home without one in my purse. My daughter loves it for travel on a plane and freshening any public place. She lived in New York City and uses it all of the time. Also great for turning around a sore throat if you use it right away and frequently.</li>
    <li> This product smells very strongly of cloves.  It might work very well on naturally eliminating germs, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
    <li> Originally designed for Bubonic plague, the Thieves spray handles a lot of equally scary modern germs, airborne and on surfaces. I spray it whenever I have company, when I visit the doctor, and in general just for the reassuring ambiance. Nobody has ever complained about the heavy clove scent.</li>
    <li> this stuff is very, very, very strong.&lt;br /&gt;i live in a 1500sq ft house with 4 floors. I used 1 bottle just on one floor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s good stuff though. kills odor and cleans the air instantly.</li>
    <li> Best product to have on hand. Takes care of cough immediately. Good to use at the doctors office. A few squirts around your sitting area and you are germ free. Same for when anywhere in public. Stay safe in this sickly environment!  Been using Theives for over a year. I always have 3 bottles on hand. One at bedside. One in pocket. And one at the desk! I like how it got&#x27;s it name!</li>
    <li> I became a fan of this essential oil about a year ago when one of my kids got the flu.  As soon as I picked him up from school and got him into bed, I started diffusing this oil in his room.  He was better by the end of the day.  The flu that had been going around was knocking people out for over a week, and he was better within a day.  A month or so later when my other son got sick, I did the same thing.  He was also better by the end of the day.  I did nothing else different than what I normally do when my kids get sick, so I truly believe this oil is the reason.  So when I saw this 3 pack of spray, I had to get it.  It allows me to use this amazing oil in so many different ways - I have used it as a throat spray when I felt like I was getting a cold (knocked it right out, but a word of warning...it tastes HORRIBLE), on my cutting boards to make sure they&#x27;re sanitized, on my counter tops for the same reason, on scraped knees, as a hand sanitizer, and as a plain old room freshener.  I love the smell, and I love the cleansing properties of this oil.  This is one thing I will never be without!</li>
    <li> Natural waterless hand cleansing is just what I like.  It smells like your baking something too.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is some good, powerful stuff! I feel like it works well because of the strong smell and because of the research I&#x27;ve done on the ingredients. The strong smell could be slightly offensive depending upon where you use it, though. I sprayed my purse, which I was ok with; but when I sprayed my neoprene water bottle covering, it was way too strong and I smelled the strong clove-cinnamon type smell every time I took a sip of water from my bottle... slightly too strong in that area. Everywhere else, I have been pleased, though! YAY!</li>
    <li> This is great especially during the cold and flu season</li>
    <li> I wish the bottles where bigger for the price, but I loooooooooove the smell and it&#x27;s helping to keep our home fresh and spicy~~~</li>
    <li> The first day of trying this on, people said I smell like Christmas. I use it as a cologne and to deodorize a room. I put a few drops in a cup of water for a mouthwash too or to drink to cleanse out my system. I just love how versatile this stuff is!</li>
    <li> I searched high and low - for several days - looking for an alternative to bleach to get rid of a small patch of mold (2 inches by 1 inch), which was located in my pantry.  The pantry area was used to story plastic and paper grocery bags; 23 inches by 17 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold on the product after reading Dr. Edward Close&#x27;s endorsement.  He is a mold remediation consultant of 30 years, and conducted mold experiments using Theives essential oils with astonishing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Christmas had a scent, the Thieves smell would be it.  Sweet, refreshing with a splash of cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the pantry.  I removed all the bags, sprayed the area with Thieves, and wiped the area clean.  I am so impressed!  More importantly, my wife is very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thieves is an extraordinary alternative to bleach, Lysol, or any toxic household chemicals/cleaners.  It works, and is all natural!</li>
    <li> Bought this since I work in a busy ER and exposed to many germs. It&#x27;s added security for me along with good hand washing.  Be aware that people on blood thinners or about to have surgery should not use as it can affect clotting times on blood Making blood thinner.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning the air.</li>
    <li> I hope to never be without my Theives. Most people seem to be a little suspect of natural remedies and Im not sure why. I would never travel without my theives..I figure if it kept those thieves from getting the plaugue...Im in. It really does work to help prevent illness and increase recover time if you do get sick. I spray it on handles, key board...plane seats/blankets ect ect....it smells great and works really really well and it&#x27;s all natrual. Win Win Win!</li>
    <li> As a teacher, I am always worried about getting sick.  I hate taking flu shots, OTC medications, etc, but this stuff works, as I haven&#x27;t gotten sick once during the flu season.  If I feel something coming on, then this takes care of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very allergic to poison ivy and it takes forever to get it cleared up.  No matter how careful I am to avoid it,it seems to find me.  Spraying with the Thieves Spray lessens the itch and cleared it up in no time!  I will keep it on hand for that and any other problem I might get!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Quick shipping and great price,</li>
    <li> The 3 pack is good so you can keep one in your car and a couple at home.  It dries your hands out though- I wonder why the alcohol is really necessary when the oils are supposed to do the work.</li>
    <li> Our first experience with YL Thieves Spray is &amp;#34;we&#x27;re sold on it&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know what cave we&#x27;ve been living in, but discovering this essential oil spray has been beneficial for our travel this holiday season as well as expediting wellness when the contamination around us was challenged. I&#x27;m buying more. Great fragrance. Investigating more deeply its benefits and uses.</li>
    <li> Works very well and cleaning at home and disinfecting</li>
    <li> THIS IS GOOD PRODUCT THAT HELPS HEALING OF MINOR SKIN IRRITAITONS AND RASHES, ETC. THIS STUFF GOES A LONG WAY, BUT THREE BOTTLES IS ABOUT THE MINIMUM YOU CAN BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V TENNERY</li>
    <li> Great value for a valuable oil.</li>
    <li> Ordered Qty. 2 of product on-line Dec. 10.  Product shipped Dec. 15 and arrived at my house a couple days later exactly as described and in time to give to my massage therapist friends/associates for Christmas. Great product, cleans the air of most bacterias and leaves a nice cinnamon kind of scent behind.  I kept two bottles for myself and use it to clean the air in the classroom where I take Pilates.  It cleans the stale air of that dirty sock smell and I was one of the only people I know that didn&#x27;t get sick this holiday.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance and good on Athletes feet</li>
    <li> I have used Thieves for the last 10 years.  Whenever I go into a public area, when my husband was in the hospital, I cleaned the area with it and kept it on my husband (under his nose) so he would contact MERSA or anything else.  We have not had colds in all of this time.  The history behind it, is that during the time of the plague in Europe, that had thieves that would cover their faces with bandanas filled with the different  herbs.  They would rob the people that had died but never caught the plague .  Researchers finally found what it was and in this little spray bottle, you too can be saved.  I worked around children who always had colds and never got sick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically like Windex in My Big Fat Greek Weeding. I use it for everything and haven&#x27;t found anything it doesn&#x27;t help with yet. Love it.</li>
    <li> Got the 3 pack and glad I did. I use it at the store and at home. I use it everywhere I go. I is a strong germ killer. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great shape!</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet, but I know several people that tell me it is very good to have just in case.</li>
    <li> Thieves will counteract germs and nasties that are in the air from others. Smells great and protects. Essential in winter</li>
    <li> Believe it or not...we use this as a bathroom spray.  It works wonders in eliminating orders.</li>
    <li> Cannot do without, smell reminds me of Christmas time, cinnamon like smell</li>
    <li> The best spray! A must have for flu season! Please make a larger size refill bottle!</li>
    <li> Love this spicy spray! also giving it as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;BJ</li>
    <li> Seems to be the cure for the common cold! I use this whenever I wake up with a sore throat or congestion and I feel fine after using this. Also seems to help pain when sprayed on site.</li>
    <li> This is good for most anything</li>
    <li> Always travel with this.. It worked during the plague - why not now.  New mainstream medical studies validate it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> A spritz of Thieves spray and poof - smells be gone. This is really an excellent product for reclaiming territory taken over by an unpleasant odor or just to freshen up a space. It&#x27;s antimicrobial and I use it when I travel as well as regularly at home.</li>
    <li> Gave 2 away since you only need a little it will last and friends liked it so I gave them a bottle. Arrived as promised and in great shape.</li>
    <li> great product good price great service</li>
    <li> Because it WORKS !! It takes away &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; in throat that causes violent coughing !!  Love Thieves Oil ...thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great way to get the benefits of Thieves oil, I highly recommend this product...Will diffiently order again.</li>
    <li> I read this use to be used to mask the smell of rotting flesh along with sterilizing the area. We bought it to fix a mold problem in our basement and it worked!!</li>
    <li> Theives oil is one of the best. I have to say I have been using it and will re-order soon. I really think it has helped this winter with all the illness and the harsh cold we have had. I use it daily. When I was ill with a virus I used it three times a day and it really helped me to feel better.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with delivery and product!</li>
    <li> My order came insanely fast.  I received it today (Christmas Eve).  I plan to keep a bottle of it in my purse to spray anywhere I go that I think might be dirty/germy.  The smell does remind me of Christmas...very clean though.  I plan to also use this in my throat if I feel any sickness coming on and hope that it works as well as it has for others that have reviewed the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this spray by the word of mouth from someone else. this spray does what it is supposed to do. A little goes a long way. Grear for disinfecting the air as well.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of the Thieves product. It gets its name from the time of the Black Plague when gypsies looted the bodies of the dead and were not getting sick. They knew how to use herbs to keep themselves healthy. In my estimation, this stuff works better, smells better, and is more natural than hand sanitizers. Took it on my cruise and keep a spray bottle with me in my purse and at work.</li>
    <li> interesting smell, but works wonders</li>
    <li> Works very well, I have been using thieves for years and I love it would buy again and again ...</li>
    <li> Great prepper item.  Always have on hand.</li>
    <li> Got rid of a sinus infection without antibiotics surprisingly didn&#x27;t think it could be this powerful:-) strong taste</li>
    <li> Household and travel essential</li>
    <li> Love the thieves spray. Its perfect to take on trips. I pack one in my son&#x27;s backpack. It&#x27;s great deodorizer and sanitizer</li>
    <li> Ohhhh....Soooo Gooooood!&lt;br /&gt;Highly concentrated formula...very refreshing taste...I would recommend this product to anyone without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of solution goes a long way as this is a premium priced product.</li>
    <li> This spray is an all-purpose spray! Amazing stuff. It cured my sore throat in a day and it cleaned my toilet!</li>
    <li> Very convenient spray to take for travel.  Thieves cleaner useful for antimicrobial activity.</li>
    <li> Thieves Spray stopped the hacking cough in the middle of the night and soothed the throat.  I recommend this product for those suffering from cold and cough.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma and it is great to use as a hand sanitizer, or a one-spritz room freshener -- a little goes a LOONG way.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the white bottles -- the amber ones were great becuz you could see the level of Thieves inside.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have heard that the bottles are white because it now contains Polysorbate-- a NO NO as far as I&#x27;m concerned-- I thought this was safe to use!!</li>
    <li> I love it...on the list of things you need in your house....recommended in a bugout bag too!!! Thanks Young Living!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the spray for 3 years now since a friend used some on my son&#x27;s leg when he got road rash. I was amazed at how quickly he healed without scarring. Since then I keep some in my purse and house for many uses. Today I was helping at our community garden and a honey bee stung me in the arm.  I got the stinger out and sprayed Thieve&#x27;s on the area which was already hurting and swelling up. In 20 min. and 3 separate sprays, the swelling disappeared and pain completely gone!  We raise bees at our house but I&#x27;m not the one who handles them and when I told and showed my husband he couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Received it promptly.</li>
    <li> Even my dentist feels it helps not only your breath but the health of your teeth. It is great for clening cutting boards.</li>
    <li> I carry this with me everywhere. The best place I used it was at the airport before putting my stuff in the TSA bins. I spayed it on because so many dirty, nasty shoes have been put inside those bins. God knows how many germs people come in contact with. This lady behind me was wondering what the smell was, the aroma of the cinnamon was so strong and therapeutic. If you are not from the island and are not familiar with nice herbs like cinnamon, whole clove, lavender etc... you won&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I use this spray almost everyday in my office. I have the public in my office regularly and try to keep it smelling nice as well as keep the germs at bay. This seems to do the trick!!</li>
    <li> LOVE.  LOVE.  LOVE.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 7 months now.  I spray it on the bottom of my feet before bed time, I even spray it twice into the back of my throat if I&#x27;m feeling a cold tickle coming on.  We are planning a family vacation in a month and I plan to take this will me to help disinfect the nasties on the plane.  The price has gone up quite a bit since I first purchased it, and personally I would wait and hope it comes back down.  I&#x27;m comfortabe spending $10 for each bottle, but really, no more than that.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a more hollistic approach to getting rid of the nasties.</li>
    <li> This works like charm.</li>
    <li> best for your sinus problems and has helped keep my grand daughter giving me her colds. thanks , I will continue to use this product, a long time.</li>
    <li> The family sprays at least once a day, We go through the bottles at an average rate. This is a great price. We really appreciate this seller,</li>
    <li> Favorite substance on earth...</li>
    <li> Wow...this stuff is truly amazing and tastes so much better than other herbal throat sprays I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m only giving it four stars instead of five because the spray containers are plastic instead of glass. As expensive as this product is, I was surprised and disappointed to discover the spray comes in a plastic container. Nevertheless, I will most likely continue to purchase it. Maybe if enough people provide similar feedback, the company will make a change. Just my two cents worth! :)</li>
    <li> I have used Thieves for years to avoid winter flu and colds; and it works for me.  I just put a few drops of the oil on my wrists each morning.  With the spray,  I use one quick spray on my throat and it really helps  with my allergy symptoms.</li>
    <li> love it. works well on insect bites too.</li>
    <li> one of my fave products.. it helps me get over any sickness fairly quickly and i never get super sick!  I swear by it!</li>
    <li> A friend suggested Thieves spray to me as a way to treat that oncoming feeling of getting sick.  I have been using it now for 2 years and am never without it.  I take a spray internally when I start to feel something like a cold coming on and it (Thieves) has never failed me.  I wake the next day feeling great.  When I first started using Thieves, I took it on a cruise and was the only one in my family (the others refused to try it) that didn&#x27;t come down with a cold.  I also spray it on the air conditioner filter to spread it throughout the house.  I also bought the cleaner and use a capful in the laundry.  I have told many people about this product and really believe in its healing qualities.</li>
    <li> Talk about getting rid of an odor … knocking down a bad one and having it replaced with cinnamon - cloves - and I don&#x27;t know what else.  All I know is that it&#x27;s GREAT and it works.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cover up&amp;#34; … it gets rid of what you don&#x27;t want to smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this spray for years. I find it very useful in the winter months when flu and colds are going around. I spray it every night before bedtime in mouth, and find it keeps away these colds. If you have a sore throat it helps also.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this fragrance at the holistic vet I was seeing for my very sick Aby cat.  He gave me a catalog with dealer pricing so I was very happy when I saw I could buy this on Amazon.  I love the fragrance and it&#x27;s healing powers.</li>
    <li> this &#x27;cinnamon&#x27; type spray has warded off every sore throat I&#x27;ve had in the last 2 years I ran out once, and caught a cold within a week. Call it crazy, but I swear by this effective and natural germ killer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE thieves!  The scent is amazing and it&#x27;s great to have something like this that is all natural that kills germs.  I will keep buying this.  Only downside is the price. But it&#x27;s good stuff 😀</li>
    <li> This product is pricey, but a lot goes a long way.  I use it when I&#x27;m in public and I hear sneezing and dripping and coughing - oh my!  Spraty the air around you, your hands, whatever.  It keeps germs at bay and smells good!</li>
    <li> What a surprise to find THIEVES on AMAZON!  I have heard the stories of how this essential oil kept grave robbers from getting the plague.  So my health is protected against whatever bugs my students bring to my studio.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of thieves because it not only kills germs but it&#x27;s also good for masking bad odors. I use it all the time on the subway or in taxis- or whenever I travel. I recommend this product to anyone who wants protect themselves from the perils of city living.</li>
    <li> The smell is good, but way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 6 bottles of the spray in the past week.  Took the bottles to work, and let some co-workers use some.  One had a bad cold, the other one just felt ill.  In each case, they felt much better within 15 minutes, and felt fantastic after one hour.  All I did was to put one spray on Kleenex, and told them to breathe it for 15 minutes.  I now have only two bottles left, and won&#x27;t part with them.  I&#x27;m using them at home, and at work.  This is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ll never be without it again.</li>
    <li> I carry this in my purse. Great smell and disinfects stuff my kids get into without me feeling like I&#x27;m smothering them with chemicals</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!!!Really is helping with allergies and colds....&lt;br /&gt;I Can breathe much easier, and it is easy to use and travels well.</li>
    <li> Acquired a house which had a small amount of black mold. Theves Oil was recommended to us to erradicate it. Sprayed it on studs and sheathing after removing affected areas. Does great and smells like cinnamon. Cannot believe how thorough it works. Do recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the health benefits of this oil, have bought more to use in my diffuser so beneficial for flu season</li>
    <li> Perfect to spray on sore throat.  It works better than the name brands that just numb it.</li>
    <li> Works and it is strong</li>
    <li> So Strong and so effective!</li>
    <li> Great buy and great product!  LOVE Theives</li>
    <li> This is probably the fifth time I have purchased this product - for work and home. I love it! The best product to hide unpleasant smells. Every bathroom should have this product. It does not simply add another scent or smell to the existing one, it actually covers it up. Especially at work it is a savior to our office.</li>
    <li> This Thieves spray smells good and I use it all the time now. I spray it on everything from the seats and arm rests on chairs at the doctors office to the steering wheel of my car and even on my hands! I&#x27;m coming down with a nasty cold so I hope it helps keep it from getting too bad or at least keep it from spreading.</li>
    <li> Was feeling the scratchiness of a sore throat coming on and this stuff works wonders, helped minimize the discomfort and knocked the ache out in a day and a half</li>
    <li> These are good for a sore throat and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to have on hand during the flu season. I keep one at work to use in the restroom, break room, on phones &amp; other surfaces. Great scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The little bottles make it easy to bring anywhere I go. Small enough to even fit in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Tiny, but mighty!  Thieves spray in concentrated, and effective!  Does all from disinfect to protect the immune system.  I like the 3 pack deal!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like cloves but I like this because it works great on sore throats, mouth sores (burns for a couple of minutes), mildew on my ceiling by the air vents, and mosquito bites.  It does take the smell out after a humid shower on hot day and someone used the toilet.  Lots of uses, is my point.  And all natural !!!</li>
    <li> Thieves oil has many uses and this is a convenient way to get it right where you want it. I first got into using Thieves Oil as a deterrent for household mold then I read about its very interesting history and went from there; I hope to be able to buy this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant smelling spray that can be used to freshen a room and to help with several&lt;br /&gt;types of bacteria.  Kind of has a cinnamon fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use Thieves for any and everything. Germ control on surfaces and hands. Sore throats couple of sprays in the mouth and you are good to go. It is very strong and does sting but IT WORKS. Caution to ayone with a sensitivity to either clove or cinnamon. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I was visiting a B&amp;B in Tombstone, and I was so drawn to the entry-way, as everytime I would enter into the B&amp;B, I was so drawn to the scent, as it smelled like a pie of some kind was baking, however I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on what the scent was.  I now use nothing but Thieves Household Cleaner to clean my floors, along with make spray bottles up to clean my bathrooms, and it even gets rid of mold and aunts  The small Thieves three-pack spray, I keep in my purse to spray on toilet seats before using public bathrooms.  It&#x27;s amazing on the plane, as the bathrooms on the plane are disgusting, as I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without this stuff.  Thank you Young Living for making a product so unique!</li>
    <li> I love this, but not sure I can depend on the anti-bacteria; I have a compromised immune system and the infectious disease Doctor didn&#x27;t know about thieves oil and asked me to use bleach....I still use but also clean with the bleach.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. This small bottle of Thieves goes in my pocket whenever I travel. When out in public, like going on a plane or sitting at a table in a restaurant, I give a quick pump or two into my palm. Then I rub the spray into my hands and then cup them, taking a moment to breathe it in. I imagine that it gives me a protective barrier from unwanted germs. You have to do research on Thieves oil to see just how effective it is and what it can and cannot do. For me it is like a low cost and pleasant-to-use insurance policy that probably really does reduce - but won&#x27;t eliminate - the risk of passing along sickness.</li>
    <li> I use this in grandson&#x27;s room. Good item to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and already part of my routine. Quality packing and attention to detail. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to disinfect your home naturally.  It is very safe and smells good also. Also use the Thieves essential oil-wonderful for warding off germs and sickness.</li>
    <li> I just got these so no doubt I will be reviewing them more than once but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this, especially during allergy season.</li>
    <li> I love this spray. I&#x27;ve bought 9 bottles so far and given 8 of them to family members who also love it. I spray it on my wrist and sniff it any time I feel a sinus thing coming on and it clears it right up. It helps to diminish headache pain and my sister cleared up an earache simply by smelling it! My husband isn&#x27;t fond of the smell but he&#x27;s the only one so far to complain about it. I would and DO recommend this spray.</li>
    <li> Love Thieves Spray.  Best thing I have found for sore throats.</li>
    <li> I love this product and would def re order again. I esp use it during the flu season on anything that you would touch.</li>
    <li> I keep bottles this at home, my office and my purse.  It contains many essential oils that combat bacteria and virus and I&#x27;m constantly spraying my office if anyone is even acting like they are sick.  My chiropractor turned me on to it and he loves to spray some in his hands and then breathe it in deeply - opens your sinus, that is for sure.  He calls it his new cologne!!  The cinnamon and eucalyptus are just divine floating thru the air.  It has lemon oil in it which hospitals in Europe uses in their air to help disperse virus and bacteria.  Love the woodsy smell!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to spray  near our bed at night, to disinfect the air, because my husband has a lung condition. This helps him breathe better.</li>
    <li> This works, and I love the smell of cloves.</li>
    <li> I use the other sizes in my house, diluted, it cleans and sanitizes marble - sometimes it is hard to find a product that you can use without etching stone.  I gave it to my hairdresser as she comes in contact with so many in this flu season and she doesn&#x27;t need to get sick.  Great for spraying on steering wheels, seats, hands, etc. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This product is suppose to be sold by a distributor rather than online.  Next time I will buy for one.</li>
    <li> I kept one and gave the other two as Christmas presents....good for spraying in a room ...I love the fragrance and it is anti bacterial and gets rid of moldy smell if you have a  damp basement or other place susceptible to mold.  I think it actually  gets rid of the mold.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Breath spray and hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff right here is the BEST!  I suffer with chronic sinusitus and migraines.  So my system is very sensitive to products with a lot of chemicals in them.  This stuff actually helps me to breath better, especially when I come in contact to various odors or allergens.  I actually carry a bottle in my handbag, my totebag, and snack bag, and overnight bag.  This stuff is GOOD!  It works immediately to rid the area of odors and germs.  And you don&#x27;t have to use that much.  It is a little on the expensive side, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using thieves spray for over 10 yrs its grest for everything I need it  for I keep it in my purse I don&#x27;t leave the house with out it..</li>
    <li> Lots of hype, and the results did not seem to add up. I was given a bottle of this and told that it would help get rid of a sore throat. Let me tell you why I think people say it gets rid of a sore throat. First when sprayed on an enflamed sensitive throat, it felt as if I had just swollowed a red hot spoon. So once that burning went away, of course my throat felt better....for a minute. It reminded me of what my dad would tell me when I was a kid and would cry about something small, &amp;#34;get over here and I will give you something to cry about&amp;#34;. This product makes the burn of a sore throat feel like a walk in candyland. I dont know about using this product for other things but as far as for sore throats, buy some Ricola and save yourself the pain. Also, once sprayed it smells like christmas just exploded from your mouth. If you think that sounds fun, use this product.</li>
    <li> thieves spray is so to use. A quick spray before you go out in public to protect yourself from cold and flu germs.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I ordered.  Got here quick. No complaints.  You can&#x27;t beat Thieves spray for convent natural antibacterial needs. &amp;#34;Anywhere germs may be present&amp;#34; including your throat.  Stops sore throat and cough with one squirt. Don&#x27;t know if its made for that, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> The spray is a great idea. It can be used to sanitize surfaces; and because of the small size, it is very portable.  But what I like best is to use it in tea, or water, or spraying indirectly into the air.  Good handwashing and avoiding germs are most important, but Theives is an extra layer of protection.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great for on the body or around the house. It helps you stay healthy as it has been used for medicinal purposes for over 100&#x27;s of years.</li>
    <li> This clove/herbal disinfectant spray is great to freshen up powder rooms or pet litter box areas. We always travel with it because of its disinfectant properties and the small size makes it easy to pack. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on the fragrance and even though it is pricey bc these are small, I am on my second batch and would buy them again. One three pack has lasted me about a year which is pretty good!</li>
    <li> Have to admit it is one horrific taste but it does the job. Shortly after I ordered this I got the start of a sore throat and this knocked it right out within 2 days it was gone. So happy with my purchase. The nasty taste goes away with in a couple minutes but is worth it.</li>
    <li> A home shouldn&#x27;t be without this spray</li>
    <li> Who knows if it works….it smells so bad that I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
    <li> Unique and exceptional product. We have been using this for years and I should have posted a review by now. Young Living is a consistently dependable company with a great product line-up, and this product is a favorite. We use this spray around the house and in the RV to freshen the air. No chemical smell or manufactured scents. May just smell a bit like Christmas--not a bad thing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it for everything.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that there is no alcohol, but am put off by the strong smell.  Clove?  Am sick with a cold right now for the first time in years, so not sure how it works.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Nice spicy fragrance with no flower overtones.  Great for allergy sufferers like myself.  As far as killing germs, disinfecting the air, etc I&#x27;m not sure, but as an air freshener it works great.  Each bottle is really small (travel size) and because of the cost, it can be an expensive indulgence.</li>
</ol>
