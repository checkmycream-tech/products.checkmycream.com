      <li>The shipping was quick and I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>There are many reasons why this wig is fantastic and perfect to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone needing a good Twilight Sparkle wig!</li>
      <li>The fibers that were used to create the wig makes it feel just like silky, lovely hair, making it where anyone can wear it realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was in excellent condition and even included a wig cap that I dindt know came with it (as it turned out, this was absolutely essential for getting the wig to stay on).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 17 wigs for a bachelorette party and this is definitely one of the best!</li>
      <li>I received many compliments from my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for Halloween, conventions, daily use, mannequins, etc.</li>
      <li>I still love the wig,  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised and happy</li>
      <li>reasonable price and good deal for the money</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have much knowledge on what&#x27;s good or not.  </li>
      <li>The quality is very nice and lush.</li>
      <li>this would have been fine, but I just wanted a fun wig in colors I liked for this party.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is bright and vivid just like the picture!</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s nine, and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>I solved this by just rubbing some conditioner on my hands and lightly rubbing it through the strands.</li>
      <li>GREAT wig for a MLP costume, looks terrific.  </li>
      <li>I am rating it at 4 stars because it seems to tangle quite easily and quickly.</li>
      <li>I love it, love the way it feels and smells, and especially love the blue and pink colors.</li>
      <li>It had a decent amount hair and stayed on my head pretty good.</li>
      <li>I should have brushed it more as it tangles easily like most wigs.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great and fun wig!</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this wig to anyone looking for a top quality Twilight Sparkle wig.</li>
      <li>Once I had it right the wig was so comfortable I felt like leaving it on for hours.</li>
      <li>I thought the wig was excellent quality and had vibrant color - however, it was extremely heavy</li>
      <li>This wig is amazing, it&#x27;s nice and thick as well as adjustable to fit your head, so worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I bought this wig for part of my Halloween costume and it was definitely worth what I paid.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute but you gotta have a tiny head to fit this one.</li>
      <li>And the wig is kind of big</li>
      <li>I love the color and it is so soft.</li>
      <li>did have to ask my friend to trim the bangs for me as they hung right in my eyes.</li>
      <li>It feels and smells very soft, smooth, silky, and fresh.</li>
      <li>have to say that I am satisfied with this buy because it arrived on time and looked the same way it does in the picture.</li>
      <li>So much hair!</li>
      <li>This is my first wig purchase</li>
      <li>its exactly what you pay for</li>
      <li>This wig was exactly what I needed from start to finish.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and the fit is snug enough that I dont have to secure it with hairpins.  </li>
      <li>Good quality for a small price.  </li>
      <li>It is big for little girls (5 years old) but for adults work great</li>
      <li>This needs a lot of grooming and the colors aren&#x27;t nearly as vibrant.</li>
      <li>The picture made me believe I was getting a light purple and pink wig...</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant, the wig is extremely thick, very smooth, silky.</li>
      <li>Everything my Cosplay young, adult/child hoped for!  </li>
      <li>Full, thick, and very pretty</li>
      <li>I went to a party and some people thought it was my real hair, so I would definitely order again!</li>
      <li>and i had trouble keeping it on comfortably.</li>
      <li>Shiny and soft too</li>
      <li>I loved the finished look but was sad</li>
      <li>Took a little bit of time to get here but worth it.  </li>
      <li>I like it enough to keep it, but not enough to wear it frequently.</li>

<li> Thick and colorful wig.</li>
<li> Some wigs fit small and slide off easily, not this one.</li>
<li> Extremely well made for the price however the bangs are so long they completely cover my face and needed to be trimmed.</li>
<li> this is more of a dark purple with dark brown and black streaks throughout, and only a slight touch of pink.</li>
<li> The blue and pink go well together, making the wig eye</li>
<li> The bangs are long but you can either cut them or keep putting them to the side</li>
<li> and it does look like the picture its pink on the inside and purple on the outside.</li>
<li> After cutting what seemed like an entire wig’s worth of hair out, it still had plenty of thickness and kept shape well.  </li>
<li> It also holds up well to vigorous brushing, with minimal shedding.</li>
<li> It needs a tad bit of grooming, but that is to be expected.</li>
<li> the pink strip is basically unnoticeable.</li>
<li> It is thick and soft.</li>
<li> It is very, very thick and the colors are vibrant.</li>
<li> Had I been going for the My Little Pony</li>
<li> i had to cut the wigs bangs, feather them a little and took allot of the hair and pinned it up.</li>
<li> ; everyday after school since we bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This seemed to hold it in place for a few hours, but it required a thorough brushing before night’s end.  </li>

    <li> This wig is very nice. It fits well and it stays in place. Some wigs fit small and slide off easily, not this one. It is perfect!</li>
    <li> Used along with tail for Halloween costume for granddaughter.  It was perfect!</li>
    <li> Thick and colorful wig. Like everyone else has already stated, the thickness is surprising considering the price. So much hair! I had to trim the bangs a bit, and it tangles a lot so carrying around a comb is a good idea. I got a lot of compliments while wearing this.</li>
    <li> Everything my Cosplay young, adult/child hoped for!  Shiny and soft too</li>
    <li> The picture made me believe I was getting a light purple and pink wig...this is more of a dark purple with dark brown and black streaks throughout, and only a slight touch of pink. I like it enough to keep it, but not enough to wear it frequently. Sad face :(</li>
    <li> reasonable price and good deal for the money</li>
    <li> Took a little bit of time to get here but worth it.  Quality was excellent</li>
    <li> This wig is fantastically thick and does shed but that is if you keep messing with it. The bangs are long but you can either cut them or keep putting them to the side like I do. It is bright and vivid just like the picture! Me likey! Me likey a lot! I want to wear it everywhere (except the shower)!</li>
    <li> I loved the wig and got lots of compliments.  I should have brushed it more as it tangles easily like most wigs.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing, it&#x27;s nice and thick as well as adjustable to fit your head, so worth the money.  The shipping was quick and I am very happy with my purchase.  I would absolutely recommend this wig to anyone looking for a top quality Twilight Sparkle wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but you gotta have a tiny head to fit this one. Still good for my daughter who likes to play dress up.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality wig! The colors are vibrant, the wig is extremely thick, very smooth, silky. It needs a tad bit of grooming, but that is to be expected. Very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> Very nice. I love the color and it is so soft. It does tangle and sheds sometimes when you brush it. And the wig is kind of big but I have a small head. Overall, I likeit.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for part of my Halloween costume and it was definitely worth what I paid.  Good quality for a small price.  I went to a party and some people thought it was my real hair, so I would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 17 wigs for a bachelorette party and this is definitely one of the best! Full, thick, and very pretty</li>
    <li> There are many reasons why this wig is fantastic and perfect to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is very attractive. The blue and pink go well together, making the wig eye-catching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s perfect for Halloween, conventions, daily use, mannequins, etc. It doesn&#x27;t have to be weared for just a Twilight Sparkle costume. It can also be for an Anime, video game, movie, or tv show costume. For example, it resembles Violet&#x27;s blue hair from the movie Ultraviolet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It feels and smells very soft, smooth, silky, and fresh. The fibers that were used to create the wig makes it feel just like silky, lovely hair, making it where anyone can wear it realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am satisfied with this buy because it arrived on time and looked the same way it does in the picture. I love it, love the way it feels and smells, and especially love the blue and pink colors.</li>
    <li> I have a variety of wigs... this is one of my favorites. The hair is soft and feels wonderful, I could play with it all day. The colors are vibrant and the fit is snug enough that I dont have to secure it with hairpins.  And it is thick!! Plenty of hair here. Order with confidence! Wig buying on here has been hit or miss, but this one is a bullseye hit.</li>
    <li> The wig is beautiful. The colors are perfect. I did have to trim up the length of the bangs and use some hair spray to get the stripes to show. I also styled the wig to a shorter bob hair cut. I had no problems with this staying on my head for 16 hours at a cosplay convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until the last minute to purchase the wig , but when I did I was concerned I wouldn&#x27;t get it in time. I was so surprised and happy it arrived two days before I needed it! I received many compliments from my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was extremely happy with the wig.</li>
    <li> It was perfect, as shown in the picture. It is big for little girls (5 years old) but for adults work great</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice quality. It is thick and soft. I can&#x27;t wait for Halloween now!</li>
    <li> This is my first wig purchase so I don&#x27;t have much knowledge on what&#x27;s good or not.  It is very, very thick and the colors are vibrant. I did have to trim the bangs and ended up thinning it out.  After cutting what seemed like an entire wig’s worth of hair out, it still had plenty of thickness and kept shape well.  I am rating it at 4 stars because it seems to tangle quite easily and quickly. I solved this by just rubbing some conditioner on my hands and lightly rubbing it through the strands. This seemed to hold it in place for a few hours, but it required a thorough brushing before night’s end.  It also holds up well to vigorous brushing, with minimal shedding. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone needing a good Twilight Sparkle wig! I am posting two pictures, before and after the trimming so you can see the difference in the bangs once cut.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! Looks great and styles great with a flat iron! :) very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This wig was exactly what I needed from start to finish. I needed a wig for a theme holiday gathering I had with a few friends. I was pressed for time and low on money so didn&#x27;t have time to go out to a store or buy something pricey.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to order the wig from my phone while talking a walk, with my Amazon prime account it took about a minute to find and order it! The wig arrived several days before the date it was to arrive by. It was in excellent condition and even included a wig cap that I dindt know came with it (as it turned out, this was absolutely essential for getting the wig to stay on).&lt;br /&gt;I had to get help from a friend to figure out how to put on the wig and wig cap to get the wig to stay on. Once I had it right the wig was so comfortable I felt like leaving it on for hours. (I could wear it a lot)&lt;br /&gt;I did have to ask my friend to trim the bangs for me as they hung right in my eyes. Had I been going for the My Little Pony look this would have been fine, but I just wanted a fun wig in colors I liked for this party.&lt;br /&gt;Of all the wigs at the party my friends liked mine best. A friend&#x27;s boyfriend even said I looked like a superhero.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a satisfying purchase! And for only $10!</li>
    <li> Extremely well made for the price however the bangs are so long they completely cover my face and needed to be trimmed. Other than that, great and fun wig!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a dress up party!</li>
    <li> My sister is a hair dresser and even she thought it was great quality for fantastic price.</li>
    <li> I am using this wig for a Cheshire Cat costume.  The quality is very nice and lush. Fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> GREAT wig for a MLP costume, looks terrific.  also great shipping and alls as as described.  very happy with everything.</li>
    <li> I thought the wig was excellent quality and had vibrant color - however, it was extremely heavy and i had trouble keeping it on comfortably. A wig cap may help that but i just wish there wasnt &amp;#34;so much&amp;#34; to it so it was slightly lighter!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter a month ago, and she has been &amp;#34;Twilight Sparkle&amp;#34; everyday after school since we bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used the strap to adjust it to her size.  She&#x27;s nine, and it&#x27;s fine.  HOURS of pretend play, and in these techy times...pretend play is so valuable!!!</li>
    <li> This needs a lot of grooming and the colors aren&#x27;t nearly as vibrant. I still love the wig,  I just wish it was as brightly shown and evenly toned as the picture portrays.</li>
    <li> i had to cut the wigs bangs, feather them a little and took allot of the hair and pinned it up. It had a decent amount hair and stayed on my head pretty good. I loved the finished look but was sad the pink strip is basically unnoticeable.</li>
    <li> this wig was awesome great quality did its job and it does look like the picture its pink on the inside and purple on the outside. its exactly what you pay for</li>
