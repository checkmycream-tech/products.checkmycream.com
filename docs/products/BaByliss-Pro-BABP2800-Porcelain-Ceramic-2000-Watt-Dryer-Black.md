      <li>Worth every penny!</li>

    <li> I love that this hair dryer does such a great job blow drying my hair so quickly.  I certainly underestimated how hot this dryer actually gets when on the hot setting.  I normally use a natural boar&#x27;s head bristle brush and after using it with this hair dryer, the bristles on my brush melted a bit.  other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Quite good. I concur with everyone else regarding its heavy weight.</li>
    <li> Wonderully constructed, strong product.  A bit on the heavy side but works extremely well.</li>
    <li> I really liked the dryer at first. However I dropped it once and the cap that fits over the filter at back broke off. I called the company, and they do not sell replacement parts for this dryer, so now it is essentially useless.</li>
    <li> I am writing from my husbands account. This dryer gets so hot that it fries my hair. My hair is very thick and healthy. I would get a haircut and after 2 weeks of using this dryer I would already have split ends!  And the nozzle is constantly blowing off and hitting me in the head bc the air comes out so strong.  It does dry hair quickly and leave it smooth but at a price!! For me the damage it was doing wasn&#x27;t worth the time saves.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a professional hair dryer without the high price, this is the perfect one. I had this blow dryer for 10 years and it still would have worked if I didn&#x27;t drop it and damage it. I was very happy to see it on Amazon so I purchased immediately. I should have looked here first instead of buying a different porcelain ceramic blow dryer at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought may blow dryers over the years, spending up to $100 or more and in the end they were not work it. But this dryer is work every penny, I love it!</li>
    <li> Terrific. Have been disappointed for years with other dryers but my sister recommended this one and she&#x27;s right....as always :)</li>
    <li> This hairdryer does not make my hair shiny which is why I bought it.  My hair is shiny naturally &amp; this hair dryer did not add to that.  I am returning the dryer because the lowest blow setting is too forceful &amp; really blows my hair around where it is short &amp; does not benefit from the gust of air coming out of this dryer.  Maybe a person with long hair who tips her head forward to blow dry from the roots would like this strong gust of wind.  it is also heavier than I&#x27;m used to.  It is probably a solid product, well-made, but not right for me.  I am going to return it if I can.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I just hate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a comb. I am African American with unprocessed hair and I absolutely need a comb with a hand dryer.</li>
    <li> After 6 months, no heat. I&#x27;ve purchased far cheaper drugs than this that have lasted years. Waiting to see if it will be replaced.</li>
    <li> Love it and has amazing results for my clients</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and need a lot of heat to control it.  This is the hottest dryer I have ever had.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent! I have long and thick hair and typically spend quite a while drying my hair. This dryer gets the job done incredibly fast and my hair does have a little more shine than normal.</li>
    <li> BEST hair dryer ever! My wife has purchased many hair dryers in her days and saids this one is the BEST!! She has curly hair and likes to have it blown out weekly. She saids it dries her hair fast, always stays frizz free and healthy looking. Her hair hasn&#x27;t been in better condition, thanks to this blow dryer. She had a long term problem with frizz and hair getting all messed up once she stepped outside on a bad weather day. But thanks to this blow dryer and Marc Anthony style straight instant straightening hair cream her hair has been at it&#x27;s best. Gets many compliments.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  Just wish I had the stylist to actually do my hair!  Definitely gets hot so I keep it on the lower settings.</li>
    <li> I used a friend&#x27;s and HAD to have it! It dramatically reduces my frizz - I don&#x27;t even need to use a hair straightener after. It&#x27;s a little heavy, but it blows powerfully and reduces drying time. I like the option of continuous cold air. So glad I bought it :)</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE IT!  My second dryer from this company, never a complaint!</li>
    <li> This is not the first one that I have owned so I was not disappointed with this purchase .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did hair for over 25 years and I&#x27;m pleased with the functions and its weight.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews before purchasing this hair dryer on July 11, 2014.  I have NEVER spent this much for a hair dryer.  Most of my purchases are of the drug store variety.  I was so excited when I first used the BaBylissPro 2800.  It worked great for almost a full year.  But like other reviews have stated, the heat stopped working this morning.  It still works, it just blows cold air.  I am so disappointed!  All of my drug store hair dryers have lasted at least two years or more.  In fact, I had to finish drying my hair this morning with my old Revlon hairdryer that still works.  It just goes to show paying more money for something doesn&#x27;t guarantee a good product.  I do not recommend this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Produces salon quality blowouts</li>
    <li> Too heavy and does not give the ionic finish as promised. I am in Canada and I did receive the 2000W version. It works fine though, my husband uses it. I have coarse, thick curly, frizzy hair treated with thermal ionic reconditioning (so pretty straight, but coarse and frizzy still). Not happy with the dryer. Have had better results with some 1875W dryers.</li>
    <li> Smoother hair but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer! No frizz and quick! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Got it! Look good thanks!</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as the 2000. Didn&#x27;t heat or blow adequately on high probably defective unit. Returned.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this hairdryer. my sister in law had one and i couldnt believe how strong this hairdryer is and all this time i&#x27;ve been buying cheap, crappy hairdryers from walmart. i bought one and it lasted about 2-3 years until the motor started getting weaker and weaker and the difuser cracked from all the heat. i bought another one but was a BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer. didnt like it and rebought the 2800 model and LOVE it, LOVE it, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer 10 months ago and have LOVED it!  Just shy of a year it has completely disappointed me.  Now it will work for about one minute and shut off.  I have to wait several minutes before it will come back on and then it will only work for about a minute.  I have taken great care of it and only wash/dry my hair twice a week.  My old cheap dryer that I replaced with this one is at least 6 years old and is still going strong.  I would have expected a longer life span for this BaByliss model.</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer. I have fine hair and can only use the Hot while pre drying, and use warm for styling. Quality, sturdy, buy it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very heavy to hold and style for 5-10 minutes, the end cap keeps falling off and the motor makes an odd sqealing noise,&lt;br /&gt; It is also the most EXPENSIVE Hair Dryer I&#x27;ve purchased. Not worth the money or pain in my wrist .</li>
    <li> Amazing. Best dryer I have had over the years. The speeds are different enough to really matter for control. And I love having the three choices of temperature. It does have some weight to it, but if you don&#x27;t have a specific injury to shoulder or wrist, it does not affect use.</li>
    <li> Ordered this on Tuesday and got it Thursday.  I just used this dryer for the first time,  I am amazed!  It usually takes me 20 minutes to dry my hair and when done its wavy all over,  with this dryer,  it was completely dry in 10 minutes and straight.  I have fine hair on the sides but the back is thick and wavy. It was so much easier to style my hair and didn&#x27;t take as long to straighten and smooth it with the straightening iron, since I didn&#x27;t have all the wave&#x27;s to deal with.  I wish I knew about this dryer year&#x27;s ago.  My hair stylist uses a Babyliss dryer and she put me on to it.  I&#x27;m so glad she did and even happier to find it on Amazon for such a good price.  Thank&#x27;s !!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, nuff said.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair dryer. That is all I can say. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Very good value.</li>
    <li> This does ok for drying hair and stuff.</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as the turbo that I bought prior to this one, but definitely hot. Has a real &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; style feel to it.</li>
    <li> I should have heeded the warnings about this hair dryer(BaByliss Pro BABp2800). It worked great for 3.5 months and then just quit heating. It cannot be returned after 30 days of purchase. I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it, but it is a hassle of not having one when you need it.</li>
    <li> This is a long review, but I did a lot of research and I reviewed a lot of other reviews to make this purchase, so I thought it would be helpful to others to add my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the BaByliss Pro BABP2800 hairdryer last night and used it this morning. My previous dryer was a 10-year old Gold-N-Hot 1875 Watt Dryer. My old dryer did the trick and still works, but I wanted to try this &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; technology to see if it made a difference in how my natural African American 4-A type hair would look. Quick and dirty Pros and Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It gets really hot - I mean - seriously. The package and the instruction manual virtually SHOUT at you that the dryer is designed for use by cosmetologists only, and there&#x27;s crazy numbers of warnings all over the thing regarding it being a &amp;#34;professional dryer.&amp;#34; At first I was like, Okay - I get it - it&#x27;s for professionals, and I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;professional.&amp;#34; But, BELIEVE IT. The warnings made me hesitant to use it on &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; but I tried it for a bit and yep - it&#x27;s hot. Don&#x27;t mess around with the high-heat setting. I wanted a dryer that gets hot (the Remington I previously bought was like a warm breeze - what a joke). The BaByliss fits the bill. And I&#x27;m confident that - not being a professional - I could easily burn my hair off my head if I used it on high heat in one spot for too long. It&#x27;ll be a while before I mess with the concentrator nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something on this dryer seems to really protect and bring the best out of my hair - there is really a definite difference in the look (sheen) and feel of my hair post-drying. My curls are curlier and not separated. My hair is bouncy and soft. If that&#x27;s what ions or ceramics or tourmaline or whatever do, then I&#x27;m sold. Awesome results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud. It&#x27;s actually quieter than my old Gold-N-Hot 1875 Watt, but it doesn&#x27;t blow as hard, and has lots more technology. So happily, I can dry my hair without worrying about hearing loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really blow as hard as I&#x27;d expect a 2000 Watt dryer to blow. I mean, all this technology and fanciness; I thought my hair would be blowing like something from the movies. No dice. I don&#x27;t know if air force really makes that much of a difference, though - my hair dried in a shorter amount of time than my old dryer would have done, and my old dryer blew like a fan boat. I guess that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; element of the dryer - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do without messing up your style or tangling your hair while it&#x27;s doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a &amp;#60;little bit&amp;#62; heavy. I mean, it&#x27;s not like an anvil, but it&#x27;s certainly heavier than my old dryer. It&#x27;s listed as being a bit over 2 lbs in weight. I guess it&#x27;s all the ceramic fanciness inside it. I don&#x27;t think the weight of the dryer will impact my ability to use it, though - I think that because it dries faster and more efficiently, I&#x27;ll use it for less time and therefore be less impacted by the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - details on performance: My typical process is to wet my hair in the morning, apply a leave-in conditioner and either air-dry it in summer, or blow dry (or bonnet dry if I have time) in winter. My Gold-N-Hot 1875 would bone dry my hair in maybe 20-25 minutes from towel-dry status on high heat at high-blowing speed. The result with the Gold-N-Hot was dry hair with frizzy curls in places and loss of curl definition, and I never really dried it bone-dry because of time constraints and because generally, I just don&#x27;t like to have to take a lot of time with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new BaByliss Pro BABP2800 dried my hair (a little wetter than towel-dry) in 10-12 minutes and my hair was soft and shiny after it was dry. My curls were separated and well defined. My hair has a nice natural sheen to it anyway, but the Gold-N-Hot definitely caused it to frizz out if I dried my hair for longer than 20 minutes. In contrast, I probably could have used the new BaByliss for a longer period of time without it changing the size of my curls or the sheen of my hair. I really also loved how my hair felt after it was dry - soft, shiny, and my curls were bouncy. Seriously amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion - the BaByliss Pro BABP2800 is worth the money if you have hair that tends to frizz and that you want to be shiny and bouncy. What the dryer lacks in blowing power is totally made-up-for in performance because of the ceramic/ionic technology. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m disappointed in the blowing power, but I think that my lack of understanding of blow-dryer science is to blame for that. Maybe air speed isn&#x27;t all that important - it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m kind of surprised that another reviewer thought it blew too hard.  That&#x27;s definitely not my experience.e new BaByliss for a longer period of time without it changing the size of my curls or the sheen of my hair.

    <li> Bought as gift for wife.  After some research we replaced a model almost twice as much (different brand).  This was a superior product than the one from her salon (which was overpriced to begin with).  It was more powerful yet quieter.  The ratings were already great and the satisfaction level received super high marks.  This is a keeper and would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item is described as is, came promptly with no packing issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact model on a different Amazon page that&#x27;s not quite working anymore, but I just had to leave a review.  I have LONG hair, like down to my waist, and I&#x27;m tall.  I love the look and texture of my hair when it&#x27;s blowdried but my arms just get too tired.  With this model hair dryer, I can actually (mostly) dry my whole head of hair in roughly half the time it took me with my old machine.  In fact, when I&#x27;m at anybody else&#x27;s home and using their hair dryer, it makes me think something is wrong with it it&#x27;s so weak!  It&#x27;s just because nothing has the power of this little beauty.  It&#x27;s actually so strong that it tends to put knots and tangles in my hair if I&#x27;m not careful, but it&#x27;s worth it for the speed and efficiency.  I&#x27;d never buy a &#x27;regular&#x27; blow dryer again, it&#x27;s only professional quality products like this for me from now on!</li>
    <li> This blower is amazing. I am a professional and I have to say it is a little heavier than my old Plimatic dryer.  It isn&#x27;t too harsh on my hair and I&#x27;m glad I invested in this dryer. GREAT BUY!!!!</li>
