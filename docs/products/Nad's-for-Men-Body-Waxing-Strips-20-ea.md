      <li>This gets most of it.</li>
      <li>It was a okay product.</li>
      <li>More wipes per box would get it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>But it works, sure.</li>
      <li>It somehow gets more hair off.&lt;br /&gt;d.</li>
      <li>, it comes with two; you better figure that in to your day.  </li>
      <li>They apply very easy and come off easy as well.  </li>
      <li>They work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>, this is a good product--but be aware of its limitations     After trying this, I switched to sugaring.</li>
      <li>On top of this, the gunk on these pads does not come off easily.  </li>
      <li>My saint of a wife just completed my full back and it looks great!!</li>
      <li>no wonder it was so inexpensive, its cheap in more than one way.</li>
      <li>They pick up very well too which is quite surprising considering my experience with waxing.</li>
      <li>Easy to pull strips off and doesn&#x27;t leave chunks of wax on your skin.</li>
      <li>the wax does NOT wash off easily.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
      <li>This was one of the cheapest hair removal strips available</li>
      <li>This is so important.</li>
      <li>The stripsare great at reaching all those nooks and crannies that the regular cloths can&#x27;t reach.</li>
      <li>Smooth skin is under the hair, along with blood and tears.</li>
      <li>It’s smooth after the damage has been done.  </li>
      <li>but it leaves a clean look.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend is very pleased with the result, overall it is a great product plus its only $6, what else do you expect?!</li>
      <li>I used it on my.. special parts, and it was not bad at all.</li>
      <li>These little wax strips are so awesome and very convenient.</li>
      <li>One thing you really need to nail down is that rub the strips between your palms for a good 10 seconds to warm the wax.</li>
      <li>That Pad that removes the wax, super oily.</li>
      <li>Just do your research first!</li>
      <li>A friend prompted me to add a couple things since this is such a popular review- 1.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;ll enjoy it and you&#x27;ll not be able to guess when she&#x27;s ripping your back hair out.  </li>
      <li>Of course it isn&#x27;t fun, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>I go to a really nice place to get waxed - usually back, neck, and chest</li>
      <li>I guess I just need to do it more frequently</li>
      <li>And if you do it right and repeat I guarantee it is not nearly as painful as it was in your first &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; run.</li>
      <li>I have tried others and this one is better because of the fabric-like material that carries the wax - conforms better and is softer than other plastic types.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
      <li>if you know what you doing, I recommend waxing right before you shower.</li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>I followed the easy instructions on the back of the box, and everything went fine.  </li>
      <li>For some folks with more sensitive skin, they may only be able to do one snap in a session.</li>
      <li>and I barely was able to get them to pull hair out.  </li>
      <li>I usually have to soak in the bathtub in warm water for about an hour after using the strips and the wax will still not come off easily in spite of using soap.</li>
      <li>Nads has &#x27;updated&#x27; the product and the new formula is a significant downgrade in quality.</li>
      <li>We followed the directions exactly..</li>
      <li>Always be sure to stretch your skin in the opposite direction from where you are snapping the strips.</li>
      <li>The first night I bought this stuff I gave it a trial using it on my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>But I would not do the same spot more than twice.</li>
      <li>This was the first time using this brand.</li>
      <li>Do they work correctly without a lot of fuss with dealing with strips and hot wax?</li>
      <li>These pads worked and I&#x27;ll be ordering more for next time.</li>
      <li>First time waxing, it hurts like hell</li>
      <li>There is no way to enjoy ripping out hair that&#x27;s naturally embedded in your skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any sort of wax product to remove hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather just use hot wax without strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was the first waxing hair removal product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I think the strips work pretty well.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just have a higher pain tolerance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However such strips leave many sticky stuff on the skin and can&#x27;t handle anything shorter than an inch (?).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These strips work pretty terribly!  I followed the directions perfectly and I barely was able to get them to pull hair out.  I also do not have a lot of body hair.  Go with another brand!</li>
    <li> I go to a really nice place to get waxed - usually back, neck, and chest so I know what it should be like and feel like. I have been competing in cycling/triathlons events lately and wanted to take the plunge with my legs so I bought these. If you do them correctly, it&#x27;s exactly the same as having a professional do it (as long as you can reach it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they painful? Well, yeah - duh - you&#x27;re waxing. There is no miracle about ripping hair out of your skin. Do they work correctly without a lot of fuss with dealing with strips and hot wax? Yeah, they&#x27;re a snap. So, follow the directions and be a man and get over the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few tips: pull the strip quickly and in the opposite direction of the hair. If you are doing it wrong, it&#x27;s most likely one of those two things.</li>
    <li> One word: No.    A few words: this product is just as effective as getting masking tape and using it to peel off your hair and skin.  It does not remove much hair and its gunk that acts as a glue is nearly useless and very difficult to remove from the skin.    My situation: The first night I bought this stuff I gave it a trial using it on my shoulders.  It worked OK, with several hairs left but not too bad for a cheap product.  The next day I tried it on my back.  On those thicker patches of hairs it does about nothing.  I&#x27;m following this product&#x27;s directions completely and removing the pads quickly, but to no avail.  After applying it to several areas and the pads hardly doing anything I just gave up.  On top of this, the gunk on these pads does not come off easily.  The previous night I used the included towelette with its gunk-removing ingredients and this day I used the last one.  That&#x27;s right, it comes with two; you better figure that in to your day.  I tried soap and water and alcohol to get the gunk off and it does not fully get the stuff off.  And you&#x27;ll definitely want to get it off.    So, basically, there are others things to try out there.  I haven&#x27;t bought any of them yet, so I don&#x27;t know if the grass is greener.  But don&#x27;t buy this thinking this grass is green.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get rid fo some body hair for a beach trip this summer and ordered this product. I have never waxed or done any kind of hair removal stuff other than shaving, so I was interested. I applied the first strip and pulled. It hurt like a B!TCH. I almsot cried out, but didn&#x27;t want my roommates to know what I was doing. I eventually finished, and was hairless like it promised. But I did have two problems other thatn the pain, which I kinda knew to expect.&lt;br /&gt;1. The wax is increadibly had to get off of anything it touches. I dropped one on accident and my carpet is still sticky. They provide a pad that cleans excess from the skin, but only two.&lt;br /&gt;2. That Pad that removes the wax, super oily. I gues I should have expected it, but an hour after I had waxed and applied the pad, I was still just as oily, but the pads are veryt soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly reccommend this to anyone who wants to was unwanted hair of their bodies</li>
    <li> This product hurts both my wallet and my body.  Take my advice, use Nair or other Nair-like equivalents.  You get the same results with no pain.</li>
    <li> This was the first waxing hair removal product I have ever used. First of all, I am a male trying to get rid of thick excess body hair, and I&#x27;m sick of shaving. Its just really ineffective and you get a stubble the next day or so. I have a small epilator, but it is just too loud (therefore my family can hear)    So far I&#x27;ve used this 3 or 4 times on my stomach and chest, here&#x27;s what I got:    Pros:  * portable  * NO MICROWAVE NEEDED --&gt; the reason I bought it  * includes pre-wax and post-wax wipes  * individual hairs don&#x27;t grow back for several weeks     Cons:  * not very effective. Removes 30%-60% of hairs depending on the area, but that 40% is still going to be really visible.   * PAINFUL  * not enough wipes for multiple uses  * Somewhat damaging. Left a lot of bruises, and essentially RIPPED off my top layer of skin     The verdict: if you need something discreet, can stand the pain, and don&#x27;t want to use any form of heated wax, this is a good product--but be aware of its limitations     After trying this, I switched to sugaring. The results are better and its less painful. The only advantage this current product has is that it can be used right out of the box without heating.     [[ASIN:B0000691JH Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Package]]</li>
    <li> This product might get rid of the hairs but only if you get past the pain of ripping this off your skin. Also it would be nice if they would supply the consumer with an adhesive remover for the skin. It stays on your skin. I had to look online to find something that removes the gunk off the skin. If you have massage oil it will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Work great and far less sticky residue than regular wax.  Reportedly less painful too.  Still reidue though and not enough preparation or clean up wipes for me.  More wipes per box would get it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Work great if you can stand the pain:-) Larger pads are better for larger areas like the back.</li>
    <li> A bunch of negative reviews on here show some poor preparation and limited patience. I have tried others and this one is better because of the fabric-like material that carries the wax - conforms better and is softer than other plastic types. Also beats the hassle and mess of bottles and crap.  Here&#x27;s the problem guys: If you try to pull long hair out with wax strips, it is not going to work, it will hurt, and it will leave loads of messy wax all over the place. They tell you to use it on short hairs. So what you do is lightly shave your hair so it is short - about 1/4&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34;. THEN use the wax strips. Also, you really need to pull in the opposite direction of your hair growth, very close to the skin, and with a super fast snap. Don&#x27;t do it on a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; body. Plan to do it just before you shower. That way the wax will be pulling on the natural oils of your skin and some dead skin which reduces the &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34;. If you do it on clean skin, it will grab harder and therefore be more painful.  When I first tried these things I had the same reactions guys on here say: OUCH! what a mess! how many times do I have to rip to get all the hair out!? That is because I was doing it all wrong.  And if you do it right and repeat I guarantee it is not nearly as painful as it was in your first &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; run. After I realized how to do it to avoid being painful, I actually got the guts to use it places my girlfriend wanted!  Also, I have a whole bunch of extra finishing wipe packets used for wiping off the wax. There is plenty if you don&#x27;t throw the wax strips all over the place. Come on, just stick it on your chest or whatever, snap it off, then I just stick them to each other when finished, stick them back into the box and throw it out. If you do it right, there is usually only a small bit of wax left on your skin once in awhile and I need only one wipe to clean off from one full body session.  And it does work over time - I need to do it less and less nowand it is a lot easier than in the beginning.  So &amp;#34;MAN UP&amp;#34; guys - do your homework and you won&#x27;t have any trouble. UPDATE: A friend prompted me to add a couple things since this is such a popular review- 1. The strips work better when warm. You can warm them in your hands like the instructions say but I set the pile under a light or in the sun to get them a little warmer than just between my hands. There is a sweet spot - too warm and they are too soft and won&#x27;t grab, too cold and they are trouble. 2. Not all hairs grow in the same direction. When they do, snap the strip in the opposite direction. There are a few spots on my body where the hairs are sprouting in all different directions. So I snap in one direction and then go over the same spot and snap in the opposite direction. This gets most of it. But I would not do the same spot more than twice. The skin can get raw and you might hurt yourself. For some folks with more sensitive skin, they may only be able to do one snap in a session. You just have to find what works for you. 3. Always be sure to stretch your skin in the opposite direction from where you are snapping the strips. Snapping without tension on your skin is asking for trouble. Good luck!</li>
    <li> These strips have very strong adhesive. They ended up leaving a sticky residue on the skin that is very hard to get off. I ended up covered with ingrown hairs because it sticks more to the skin itself than the hair. Do yourself a favor- get sugar based wax instead. It is way less painful, and ten times more effective.</li>
    <li> These strips work very well.  They apply very easy and come off easy as well.  I had no experience waxing before I used this product.  I followed the easy instructions on the back of the box, and everything went fine.  Yes, waxing is a little painful, but you get used to it in minutes.  I am happy that I found an easy way to wax myself without spending hundreds at a salon.  First Time Users should try this product.  It is very simple to use and will show you results right after your first strip.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> gets the job done but not pleasant</li>
    <li> The quality of these nads strips have significantly gotten worse. They do not stick to your hair anymore  and this was not an expired batch. I would recommend trying another product.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to get these after reading other reviews, but I figured it was only $5, and it was the closest thing to what I was looking for. I got them because I had to have surgery, and I knew they would shave the area if I left it as is. I didn&#x27;t want that because that gets really itchy and uncomfortable with cloths on. I think the strips work pretty well. Of course it isn&#x27;t fun, but it does the job. The worst part is the acne it gives you because bacteria can (and will) get into the hair follicles. I found using some sort of acne scrub helps.&lt;br /&gt;It is best if you can get someone to help you, as that makes it go faster. However, if you&#x27;re like me and rather do it alone, it can take a little while. Just make sure you go &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; because if you try waxing in the same direction as the hair growth, it won&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Before the New Improved formula was shipped to me, I can peel two sides to a strip. The newer improved formula strips do not fully divide into 2 strips, I can see that the wax may be applied thicker but it is also inseparable. It separates with one side partially waxed or the wax stays only on 1 side. When it stays on one side it is thicker and not sticky enough to pull hair, leaving a small portion of the strip usable. This will be the second box of the new improved formula and both boxes were of the same quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to wash off. The kit only comes with two removal wipes, so after you&#x27;ve used those, you&#x27;re screwed.</li>
    <li> What do I anticipate from a hair removal? 1, remove all hairs, even short ones, 2, leave no or little residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However such strips leave many sticky stuff on the skin and can&#x27;t handle anything shorter than an inch (?). So it is better to go straightly to strip without initial shaving. However, it will be less useful then.</li>
    <li> I have tried wax bottles in the past and strongly prefer the wax strips for their convenience and ease of use.  Just lay them flat, wait a few seconds, and then pull them off in the opposite direction of the hair growth.  Sure, there is some pain, but you get used to it over time.  The aesthetics of a hairless back far outweigh the temporary discomfort.  After Wal-mart discontinued selling these, this is the best price I can find.  I will continue using these until I can afford a more permanent solution.</li>
    <li> First time waxing, it hurts like hell but the result is amazing. Its not messy at all if you know what you doing, I recommend waxing right before you shower. My girlfriend is very pleased with the result, overall it is a great product plus its only $6, what else do you expect?! Man up, and give it a try.</li>
    <li> It hurts like well...&lt;br /&gt;It does keep hair away for a long time and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> These strips are not easy to use, you have to break a sweat just to \\&quot;warm\\&quot; them up, and they just aggravate 90% of your hair and remove about 10%.&lt;br /&gt;I used these per the directions several times, even growing the hair quite long before using (a NAD&#x27;S \\&quot;tip\\&quot; on the box). Im not even a hairy guy! I am so disappointed I have written off NAD&#x27;S altogether, a brand I have used for years.</li>
    <li> Just to give an update, I made the mistake of giving this product another try, and I&#x27;m done.  Never again.  Not only did it not come with the calming wipes which the box states is included inside, but there just isn&#x27;t any stickiness on the strips.  This product is useless for everything except maybe wiping your ass with it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I realized that these were bigger strips rather than smaller ones, but that&#x27;s my own fault. They do what they say they do.</li>
    <li> I tried different ways of using this stuff, and no matter how short I used it for, or what technique I tried, it always ended up giving me a chemical burn!  And I tried using it ...way down there... and afterward I could barely walk.  It took a few days just to not have pain, and then it took much longer for my skin to heal.  I&#x27;ll never buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> I returned it after my wife found several mcomplaints online of people reporting rashes and fungus infections after using it.  Just do your research first!</li>
    <li> I really loved the product regardless the reviews I read. Yes it pains like hell and is really time consuming as compared to trimming or shaving but it leaves a clean look. Don&#x27;t forget to go through the instructions before using it and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
    <li> this product did not work at all. after rubbing the wax sheets between my hands for several minutes ( as if i was trying to start a campfire with a rock and a stick ) the wax had BARELY any &#x27;stickiness&amp;#34; to it at all. And it only pulls a few hairs out after several attempts of placing and ripping off new strips. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Used to removed some unsightly lower back hair and it worked well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much pain and baby oil cleaned up the remaining wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> The strips are large with a rectangle sized amount of removal product.  May work well for legs and arms with no clean up involved.</li>
    <li> these actually work well heat them with a blow dryer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gorilla hairy but would say I have a moderate amount of back hair. My saint of a wife just completed my full back and it looks great!! She used these before which was a plus. Yes, it was painful but the feeling subsides quickly. I had a professional back wax about 5 months ago that was just as painful. I guess I just need to do it more frequently so it&#x27;s not as painful. These pads worked and I&#x27;ll be ordering more for next time.</li>
    <li> These are very good waxing strips. I usually trim but my hair grew back within a week or two. Since I decided to try these strips I don&#x27;t have any hair growing back for about a month and a half. The only thing is that peeling them apart will cause them to rip off the glue. This is annoying when you have patches because of this. Excess glue is hard to get off. This is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Not great. I have a lot of hair on my shoulders and upper back. This was one of the cheapest hair removal strips available so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve only ever tried hair removing cream before. Anyway, the problems with this product is are:&lt;br /&gt;a. the wax does NOT wash off easily. I usually have to soak in the bathtub in warm water for about an hour after using the strips and the wax will still not come off easily in spite of using soap. The wax stays on the skin and feels sticky to the touch, mucking up anything you wear after.&lt;br /&gt;b. each strip can really only be used 4-5 times. Once it has even a moderate amount of hair on the wax, it becomes useless.&lt;br /&gt;c. the directions on the packet say that you need to pull the strip against the direction of hair growth for maximum effectiveness. I&#x27;ve found it much more effective to pull upwards and outwards from the skin. It somehow gets more hair off.&lt;br /&gt;d. the strips don&#x27;t do a thorough enough job. I have to manually pull out hairs even after using the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to go with hair removal cream the next time.</li>
    <li> No better or worse than any other brand of strips I have used. I am a woman and they work the same as womens brands. Going to get waxed is the best but these do enough of a decent job to get by until you find time or the momey to get it done by someone else.</li>
    <li> Awful product, does not do anything other than give you a red spot. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I recieved this and I have tried to use it as instructions say and it removes little to no hair. Very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> Good luck with this. You get sticky wax all over you hands while the paper that holds the wax occasionally rips apart. You don&#x27;t want paper for waxing you want cloth.</li>
    <li> first time i ever used hair removal strips, and they are wonderful, will buy more. just needs more cream/oil removal packets that come with it.</li>
    <li> gave me a massive rash! would not recommend , try something else if you ave sensitive skin.  also, hard to wash off!</li>
    <li> These strips really get the hair off. You can sometimes even reuse the same strip too as long as your not extremely hairy.</li>
    <li> Easy-to-use, instructions on box are clear, minimal or ZERO mess with waxing (hair all over the bathroom floor when you shave).&lt;br /&gt;Been thinking for a while before I bought it cause I thought waxing was terribly painful/&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, it&#x27;s not as painful as it looks (or sound.. Men screaming while getting waxed on youtube..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to guys who&#x27;ve never tried waxing: it&#x27;s easy and not as painful as you think!</li>
    <li> Fast and easy without mess. Best wax strips I have ever used. Easy to pull strips off and doesn&#x27;t leave chunks of wax on your skin. Less pain.</li>
    <li> I am easily 275 pounds and would say I am tough. My wife said don&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s going to hurt.  I didn&#x27;t listen.  I only did some of my back area.  Actually, my wife did the tugging.  It looked like the scene from the &amp;#34;40 year old Virgin&amp;#34; with the blood spots.  I am no where near as hairy as Steve Carell. Here&#x27;s what you need to know before using this product.  #1 Do not use this on your junkle area. There is no one on this earth man enough unless you have little thin hair.  Seriously, who doesn’t have deep rooted, thick pubes?!?! #2 Do not tug yourself.  Let your wife do this.  She&#x27;ll enjoy it and you&#x27;ll not be able to guess when she&#x27;s ripping your back hair out.  #3 The idiot who wrote the positive review claiming he was a pro at pulling the hair out is full of it.  There is no way to enjoy ripping out hair that&#x27;s naturally embedded in your skin.  #4 THIS HURTS LIKE HELL!!!!  Grab a small piece of wood and bite hard.  Get the pain reliever and headache medicine out BEFORE you man up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, I give it three stars because hair does come out, follicle and all.  It’s smooth after the damage has been done.  Unfortunately, I have to do the rest of the back tomorrow night as I was too big a pansy to do the whole back in one sitting.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used any sort of wax product to remove hair. I used it on my stomach and my thighs. Very very effective and easy to use. Just rub the strip between your hands to heat it up a bit, apply to skin, and pull. Finished stomach and thighs in less than ten minutes on my first try. I expected it to be more painful but honestly, it was practically painless and all the hair came out. Maybe I just have a higher pain tolerance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this product in the future. Great product Nads!</li>
    <li> This is a good product every once in a while.  I order it every so often, and sometimes the wax strips turn out ok, meaning you can pull them apart with out the wax sticking to one side.  However every once in a while you get a box where all the strips are pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> umm...I actually more or less figured that  this would probably not work when I bought it and I was right. It worked just a little bit, but even after doing the same area (for my son) 3 times, the hair was still not gone. Obviously it was too painful to make any further attempts.</li>
    <li> These little wax strips are so awesome and very convenient. Heat them up via rubbing them, place them on and pull em off. Simple, no annoying wax dripping or the mess. They pick up very well too which is quite surprising considering my experience with waxing. I absolutely would recommend them for anyone looking to wax.</li>
    <li> The wax came off instead of the hair...these strips did not work at all. We followed the directions exactly..they just didn&#x27;t work.Very cheaply made product.</li>
    <li> Ithe strips worked well but i had to use tha hair drier to heat the in order to make them work well</li>
    <li> Nad&#x27;s 3494 Nad&#x27;s for Men Hair Removal Strips, 20 Count  love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Nad&#x27;s 3494 Nad&#x27;s for Men Hair Removal Strips, 20 Count  love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Nad&#x27;s 3494 Nad&#x27;s for Men Hair Removal Strips, 20 Count  love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Nad&#x27;s 3494 Nad&#x27;s for Men Hair Removal Strips, 20 Count  love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Nad&#x27;s 3494 Nad&#x27;s for Men Hair Removal Strips, 20 Count  love it!!</li>
    <li> Not worth it, it is just like any other wax on strips. They don&#x27;t work, it took skin off but not hair. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time, unless you have luck with wax on strips. I&#x27;d rather just use hot wax without strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I am a female, I decided to try wax for men because I like men&#x27;s razors better. I wanted to use these on my legs. One box wouldn&#x27;t finish one leg, not that I kept using it because it would have taken me 5 hours to finish.</li>
    <li> It sure does work. Pulls out the hair.  Some people like their hair to be pulled. Not me. But it works, sure. It will bond with your hair and not let go. Thinking about torturing yourself? Buy it. Smooth skin is under the hair, along with blood and tears.</li>
    <li> I looked all around for different products to wax my chest and stomach.  I&#x27;m 18 years old and have a pretty hairy chest.  I followed all the directions step by step, these wax strips will rip your skin off.  These made me bleed and break out in rash with pimples.  Trust me I FOLLOWED ALL directions and ended up hurting my skin badly.  Listen to me stay away from these.</li>
    <li> I used it on my.. special parts, and it was not bad at all. One thing you really need to nail down is that rub the strips between your palms for a good 10 seconds to warm the wax. This is so important. I did not know and wasted about 20% of the strips in the beginning. Did its job well and the wax clean up provided did its job exceptionally well - no stickiness at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove distracting hair from my groin area.  I am sorry to say that I chickened out at the last minute and was too afraid to use it.  It sits at the bottom of my dresser drawer.  My girlfriend said she would help me when I get up enough balls to do it.  So stay tuned for further developments.</li>
    <li> I found the wax material to come off of the strip and stick to the body.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is extremely difficult to remove when this happens because&lt;br /&gt;it does not disolve very easly with water.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Nadsproducts for yearsand have always appreciated their ease of use and efficiency.The stripsare great at reaching all those nooks and crannies that the regular cloths can&#x27;t reach.I can only find them on Amazon and not in local pharmacies.</li>
    <li> Just follow directions folks&lt;br /&gt;Easy peasy&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Nads woman for years&lt;br /&gt;The strips are better than the jar</li>
    <li> They work pretty good.  Sometimes you have to go over the spot two or three times.  I don&#x27;t think they would do well on really thick man patches.  And they do leave some waxy residue on your skin.  It can take a shower or two to get it washed off.</li>
    <li> i used this product because i have somewhat hairy thighs. i didn&#x27;t really like it. the strip some what stuck to my skin and only removed about 1/4 of my hair, not the entire thing. no wonder it was so inexpensive, its cheap in more than one way. unfortunately I&#x27;ve gone back to shaving for the mean time.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this, maybe I had my hopes to high. It works don&#x27;t get me wrong, BUT it leaves a good portion of wax behind. It was a okay product. To me the smell was a bit distasteful and pungent. The 2 soothing packets were. Great, I wished it came with more than 2 or that you could buy more. Lastly if you would ask if I would buy thing again my answer would be no.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove hair well even after following the directions on the package. It seems that it removed only about 30 percent of the hair I was trying to get rid of.  It took like 4 times to get the hair off and then still some hairs left. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. There must be a better product out there.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. Worst of the Nads products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years and found that they worked well, until this purchase. Nads has &#x27;updated&#x27; the product and the new formula is a significant downgrade in quality. I really hope that Nads will return to their previous formulation that actually works at hair removal.</li>
    <li> This was the first time using this brand.I prefer other brands better.The straps didn&#x27;t get all the hair...I thinks I&#x27;ll stay with my old brand...</li>
    <li> got this cause i thought shaving would be really tedious. turns out this is more tedious. especially being that im a hairy guy, i would have to wax every week or so to remain smoooth. but i just use this for spots that dont grow as fast. REMEMBER! if you keep doing a same spot over and over it will rip off a layer of your skin. i learned this the hard way. and for about a month a had a cheetah spotted stomach. space it out a day or so, oh and if you run out of the cream that takes out the wax use baby oil, it works the same. overall for the price, i say give it a shot.</li>
    <li> This stuff was a bust. It did not stick and it sucked so bad. I was ready for pain but got nothing.</li>
    <li> I used the Nads system 9 years ago because I&#x27;m not very fond of body hair, and I saw a commercial for it and thought I&#x27;d try it. I was permanently disfigured from this stuff. It caused little red splotches on my skin that have never gone away. Buyer beware. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Directions and use of the product is simple and straightforward. However, it did next to nothing for me in my hair removal attempts. I am amazed that something so sticky and painful removed so little hair. It stuck to my skin so well that I was red and sore for a few hours after use. Removing the residue was difficult but the included wipes worked well to get it all eventually. Unfortunately, less than 25% of my hair (inner thigh and lower back) was removed, even after multiple attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very displeased with this product. I assume that it would work on very, very thin hair - which I do not have.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality material.The method of warming the strips between your hands doesn&#x27;t quite make it very effective. Bad product.</li>
