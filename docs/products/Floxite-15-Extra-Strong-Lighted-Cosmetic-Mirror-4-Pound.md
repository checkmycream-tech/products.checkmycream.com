<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mirror is insanely magnified &amp; shows every detail, vein, freckle, pore, etc... but didn&#x27;t make it easier to apply my makeup. I had to be within 6 inches of the mirror to see clearly or it would look blurry and crazy so it was very inconvenient to lean like I did and still was too close to even use a liner or mascara bc it&#x27;s just so so so magnified &amp; hard to see what it looks like in real life proportions. I guess it&#x27;s great for brow plucking with the light and magnification but I had a hard time getting my liner on the same bc it shows up so huge on mirror. Not what I was looking for in the $44 toy... but maybe for precise &amp; one step applications for others.. really wanted to like it but I think I&#x27;ll have to splurge on a big Hollywood style bulb mirror... wish it had a double side so I could check my makeup as I went...</li>
    <li> Kinda too much magnification , but the light is great.</li>
    <li> The only lighted mirror we&#x27;ve ever found that actually has enough light and magnification</li>
    <li> I hated this mirror and have sent it back.  The lighting was not adequate at all and the magnification was so off the chart, I couldn&#x27;t even focus on my face to put makeup on unless I was 2 inches away from it. Definitely not was I was needing.</li>
    <li> Very bright and magnifies wonderfully. I never knew how crappy my skin really was until I got this mirror!</li>
    <li> Not as bright as I had hoped.  It&#x27;s alright, but NOT like daylight.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Good Optics. Wish it came in a nicer finish, surprisingly hard to ind a decent makeup mirror. Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very poor quality. It actually broke the third day I had it. The plastic casing is really cheap and the mirror quality is less than good.</li>
    <li> Awesome large mirror!! Great lighting! Just what I needed for my 40 yr old eyes;-). I definitely would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Works good! Almost too good unfortunately I use it to fix the &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; hairs I missed to see THOUSANDS that need to be plucked. Great product though</li>
    <li> I have used the Floxite travel mirror for several years, so I had high expectations of this one.  It is easy to use; the magnification is wonderful; and the light is bright enough to really see what you&#x27;re doing!  Plus, it was reasonably priced, hence the five stars.</li>
    <li> It did not fall in the right position for me and it was distorted (unlike stated in other reviews).  I returned this item.</li>
    <li> this product gives perfect light and the strength of the mirror helps one see all the imperfections.  My makeup has been put on smoother, and I looks so much better.  I am so glad I purchased this light...</li>
    <li> Does the job it is supposed to do.  Fairly priced.</li>
    <li> WOW...WOWW...  I&#x27;m so happy.  I just got my mirror!!!!  It&#x27;s the BEST!!!  NO LIE!  I have one that I&#x27;ve had for years.  I&#x27;ve been traveling and keep forgetting it!! I&#x27;m 53 and can&#x27;t see like I use to.  I walked into a \\&quot;Sallys\\&quot; store and bought the most expensive mirror ($70.00).  It seemed to be what I had at home.  NOTTTTT.... The bulb was dim, dim , dim...  I couldn&#x27;t see, though it looked identical... One difference was the cord.  It was not fixed to the mirror. It was a tiny thin cord like a cell phone cord and it plugged into the mirror like a charger....  It was the worst.  I chanced buying this on line and I&#x27;m SOOOOO Happy I did.  I can SEE to put my makeup on and I can see any tiny little blimish on my skin.  The light is BRIGHT and exactly what I needed.  Thanks so much for you QUALITY product and at a GREAT PRICE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Adams&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  I even took it with me when we traveled in our motorhome.  Problems occurred when part of the plastic \\&quot;stem\\&quot; started falling apart. The bulb finally died after 4 years and the stem completely broke off.  I replaced it with the Conair Infinity, which is definitely not bright enough and basically useless.  I plan to buy another of the portable 10x, but can&#x27;t figure out why the same mirror, from the same vendor, sells under two different names for two different prices.  Would that vendor please explain??????</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror because I thought all Floxite mirrors were distortion free but this one is not.  You have to be an inch from the mirror to see clearly.  It is great for plucking your eyebrows but as soon as you move back from the mirror you can&#x27;t see the image clearly.  I could not use it to put makeup on because I had to be so close to the mirror I kept hitting the mirror with my hand and brushes.  I would have LOVED it if the image were clear when you got a few inches away but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror on October 15 and it quit working on December 10. Just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. My last one lasted 10 years: this one quit after 60 days. Too bad their quality is so poor.</li>
    <li> The 10x&#x27;s magnification was awful, very distorted. The light was so bright it hurt my eyes. I tried to give it to my 80 year old mother,  she didn&#x27;t like it either. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I love it, its perfect.  It&#x27;s not too big for the bathroom.  The reviews that I read on this product really helped me make the best decision.</li>
    <li> Fantastic light. Shows more than expected..</li>
    <li> A little hard to focus, but nice.</li>
    <li> Great mirror and works well for those with an eye deficit or need to see really close up..</li>
    <li> Within two months the light stopped working. As other people stated in their reviews you do not get a complete facial view using this. If you need certain areas to view as you tweeze it&#x27;s perfect. However, I cannot see well at all without the light (which is why I bought this) so its sitting in the cabinet unused.</li>
    <li> Well made, attractive,looks good on my vanity. BRIGHT light (wonderful, I can see to pluck my eyebrows.) Unfortunately, you also see the wrinkles but, hey we all have some. Even my 21 year old granddaughter found a few! I do wish it had a reverse regular mirror, but I put a small regular mirror on a stand next to it for a normal take. All in all, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great and wife wishes she could take it on vacation with her.  LOL</li>
    <li> This was a very disappointing product. Unless you hold it to within 2 inches of your face (then you can only see specific facial features like 1 eye or your nose) the magnification is so distorted that you have a fun house effect (NOT FUNNY).  To add to the disappointment in the product, I find that when requesting a return number I am told of a 10% restock fee as well as the shipping charges to return the item. I had already paid shipping one time.This means that after spending nearly $80.00, I might get $25.00 to $30.00 back eventually. I went to a nearby fleamarket and for half of the price ($25) bought 2 better designed, lighted,  magnifying mirrors that did NOT distort and paid no shipping.</li>
    <li> The #1 reason I bought this mirror was the other reviews talking about how bright the light was.  And it is definitely a big improvement.  My other makeup mirror was so dim, I had to have a second light behind it!  When the second light burned out, I finally decided it was time to just find a mirror with enough light and this is it!  Perfect for tweezing and eye makeup application.  There is a small bit of distortion if you are too far away from the mirror, but for the closeup work I use it for, there is no distortion.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> had one just like it that lasted 7 years</li>
    <li> perfect and bright...</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Shows more than I wanted to see.  Light is a bit too bright.</li>
    <li> Very helpful for seeing very small things.  Use it for increased magnification when needed.</li>
    <li> I saw so many good reviews that I actually bought this with confidence! The \\&quot;distortion free\\&quot; mirror is actually so distorted that if you are 6\\&quot; away from it, you still can&#x27;t see yourself! you have to be 2\\&quot; away, which doesn&#x27;t work for make up, even for tweezing. And if you are 2\\&quot; away from it, you can see yourself just in a small area, not the whole mirror. The light is ok, and the quality of everything else is good. I was impressed by how small it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, what&#x27;s the point of all this if the mirror itself doesn&#x27;t work!!!???</li>
    <li> This was a replacement mirror as the switch went out on my old one. The manufacturer has improved the on-off switch component and it now feels tighter and more secure than my old mirror. The magnification is great, allowing me to see every pore on my face!</li>
    <li> The mirror was great but way too magnetified for my needs. It would be good for someone very near sighted</li>
    <li> I bought another lighted 10x mirror that had a lot of good reviews here (and some negative ones) and didn&#x27;t like it at all.  So I was a bit anxious about ordering another one, but this one works well for my needs.    It&#x27;s not a makeup mirror but a 10x never would be, for me.  It&#x27;s for taking that really close look that you need to take every so often, and it works well for that.    It only has the one side and does not have a \\&quot;normal view\\&quot; side, which I do miss.  But the quality is quite decent.      For the price, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> 10x is really close...The lighting is very good and the mirror base feels substantial.  It&#x27;s adjustable and seems to be made well.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> super for tweezing eyebrows and makeup.  My eyes are terrible with close up vision so this mirror with the lights is fantastic for aging eyes.  Fits neatly on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> got this miror for my wife,she loves it. its a good quality mirror at a reasonable price. it was shipped in record time and i would recomend it to anyone ...</li>
    <li> I searched all over for a decent mirror and this one really fits the bill.  Nice magnification,no distortion and the quality is very nice.  Looks great on my vanity.</li>
    <li> My Aunt had this mirror and I fell in love with it.  You can see every little detail with the 10 X magnification and the bright white light.  I bought myself one and my sister one.  Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> So much easier to see stray hairs that need to be plucked and apply makeup evenly. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good mirror but not as bright as others i have had. Some distortion on edges but overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed an ultra magnification lighted mirror to apply make-up, tweeze and deal with other skin imperfections in a poorly lit bathroom.  This is not a mirror for those who do not want to stand up close to see up close. You do have to stand a few inches away to get into the right focus at 10x magnification. A bonus is that you don&#x27;t need your reading glasses to tweeze with this mirror.  If you don&#x27;t want to see the imperfections, and trust me it can be pretty scary at first, try a much lower magnification.</li>
    <li> Wow, this mirror is just great.  You can see everything so clearly! I now have three of these, and would not have any other kind.</li>
    <li> One can see every detail. Great for applying make-up, pulling hair where necessary. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had gone through numerous mirrors, trying to find something that would give great magnification without distortion.  This mirror does just that. It has great lighting. Because it&#x27;s been hard to find something that gives the right magnification at a distance, I&#x27;ve gotten not the habit of lying front down on the bed to do my make up and even though this has a stand, I can still do that. It&#x27;s  larger than I imagined and heavier, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it is very sturdy. I am quick to pick holes in products, but I am delighted with this</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is, but I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how BIG 10x magnification is. As someone else said, it&#x27;s so much magnification that it&#x27;s almost impossible to use for anything practical. Gives me a headache just looking into it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a magnifying mirror that was bright enough to work in my dim bathroom.  I read the detailed review by NLee and knew that this mirror would be perfect for me.  It did not disappoint.  The light is the brightest I&#x27;ve ever had on a magnifying mirror and the price is right. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched for a lighted makeup mirror that was bright, and I mean bright. I did actually find one that was super bright but was over $100 for a mirror the same size and magnification. I just can&#x27;t see paying that. Call me a cheapskate but I really feel like all makeup mirrors are a rip off. I mean, really, it is basically what amounts to a cheap lamp with cheap glass or cheaper plastic....I mean, REALLY???? I was bout ready to buy a cheap mirror and a table lamp to direct at my face! I learned that fluorescent bulbs are much brighter, plus they save energy, so that narrowed my search. I am happy with this guy for the money, it is bright enough and certainly a decent price if you want an overpriced piece of plastic, which I apparently do! Another nice thing about this is the 10x magnification. I find that for a middle aged woman who uses readers, the 15x magnification seemed distorted and the very center of that mirror seemed the only clear part so I had to keep moving and refocusing. But this mirror is the perfect maginification for tweezing and facials, and while not the brightest light, it is a clear white light that suffices.</li>
    <li> Have tried many lighted mirrors and the only one in the past that gave adequate lighting and magnification was top heavy and constantly fell over.  This one is ideal in every way.  Best lighting I&#x27;ve ever experienced and great magnification.  Feel much more confident about being seen in daylight! Give this product high points!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror from bed, bath and beyond...and i love it. You can see everything so clear that is almost scary. It is not good for makeup applying, in my opinion because it has some distortion to it, unless you are really close to it, but i mainly use it because I have so many black head and cannot get rid of them so i squeezed them (I know is gross) but it works great for seeing all those little things in the face, and hairs, since i bought this mirror i have been taking care of my skin way better because I can actually see all those little imperfections...I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I hope this product never goes out of production. I can&#x27;t live without it. Linens and Things carried it, but is now out of business.  This is the only site I&#x27;ve since been able to locate it on.  (THX~!)</li>
    <li> I really needed a new mirror and was excited that this was 10x and so large.  However, the one I received has a very distorted mirror.  If I move even slightly my face looks warped.  The light is also not as bright as I had expected.  I bought this specifically because people made comments on how bright it is, but I&#x27;m extremely disappointed how dim this actually is.  I spent my christmas gift card on this and really wish I had purchased a different brand.  Currently looking for a new one to replace this.</li>
    <li> Well made with no distortion. I was worried that the light would be too dim but it is on the very bright side. Almost too bright if that&#x27;s possible. Not too heavy and well made. I recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mirror espically the lighting 1st few tine takes a while 4 eyes 2 get adjustd but not long i would have given 5** but didnt have a feature where u could zoom in and out only has 1 setting magnify 10x would be nice to go smaller if wantd but no bigge and its plactic but also not cheap!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I looked and looked for a good mirror so happy with my purchase! Very bright!</li>
    <li> We purchased this mirror about 6 months ago.  It was never the brightest or best, but seemed to work fine until this week.  I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have had several different types of lighted magnifying mirrors and this one by far is the best.  My sister turned me on to this mirror and I have no regrets.  One of the best features of this mirror is the fluorescent light is replaceable.  The lighting and magnification is more than ample.....you can really see what you are doing. The size of the mirror is great too.  The height is just right for a vanity table and I love the way you can adjust the mirror.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.....trust me.... I have had 4 other mirrors that just didn&#x27;t cut it....they either broke, were too bulky, or the lighting, adjustiblity, magnification and size of mirror were not acceptable !!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good mirror . . . . I just wish it were able to adjust more . . . the adjustments that it allows aren&#x27;t much.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  It has 10X magnification; more than most mirrors I have found.  The light is bright, but not overpowering.  It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, and the mirror is easily adjusted.  The light cover arrived with a scratch; perhaps better quality-control is in order.  Other than that, I am pleased with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! As advertised, it brings your face up close and personal to you to put on your makeup right! Definitely buy from again.</li>
    <li> This provides very bright, fluorescent (energy efficient) light for close up work.  Great for eye make-up, and plucking.  Great for getting something (an eyelash) out of your eye.   To be in focus, one has to be close to the mirror, and there isn&#x27;t a full face view.</li>
    <li> Bright, stable base, easy to turn off and on (the power switch isn&#x27;t hidden in some strange place). 10x magnification illuminates everything. I purchased several other models and was frustrated by the lack of light, small mirrors, and 5x magnification. Reviews for this product on Amazon convinced me to try this and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Says that it is the best one she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Best Mirror. Excellent Product it&#x27;s light weight. And finding it on Amazon was a plus.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever if you need to really see your face!  I can see things with this that I can see with a regular magnifying mirror AND glasses.  But beware - you are going to see it ALL up close and personal.</li>
    <li> This mirror gives more light than any other make up mirror I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  I used to own a Conair, which gave little light and, after one year, broke.  I thought the bulb was out, so I ordered a replacement (at $16), and it ended up it wasn&#x27;t the bulb.  This mirror is far superior to any made by Conair.</li>
    <li> I have used many magnifying mirrors and this is an excellent one. I purchased one a few years ago and when I needed one for a different home I tried a few others before realizing this brand was the best and purchased another one. I caution women of a certain age -you will not like what you see when you use this mirror. It does not lie and what you see is NOT what your friends see when they look at your face. Fortunately our eyes do not magnify to 10X unassisted. It is great for tweezing and does clearly show all the sun damage inflicted on the skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money trying other mirrors, you will eventually want this one so buy it first and save yourself some money.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a cosmetic mirror because unless you&#x27;re right on top of the mirror, it is totally out of focus, and so there&#x27;s no way you can use it for putting on makeup.  But for identifying stray hairs or getting a better look at blemishes, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know how important it is to women to pluck their eyebrows. I heard my wife tell her friend &amp;#34;I wish I had a more powerful makeup mirror&amp;#34;. I got this one for her birthday. It had great ratings and looked like a good design. I gave it to her and scored some major points. When my grown daughters saw it they went crazy. They would come over and stay in the bathroom for quite a long time. When they came out their faces looked looked like they had been bitten by a thousand mosquitos. Needless to say they&#x27;re pickers. 10X magnification drove them into a frenzy.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Zadro lighted makeup mirror with this one. The Zadro had never been bright enough and it didn&#x27;t last but about two years, then it \\&quot;blew.\\&quot; Black soot actually came out of the bottom onto the bathroom counter. My husband tried new bulbs but it was a goner.    This Daylight mirror is very bright! Much better than my old mirror. You can see everything! Don&#x27;t know yet about the longevity, but overall I much prefer this one to my old one. And the price was better too!</li>
    <li> Surpassed my expectations.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror because I love to shape my eyebrows. This mirror shows EVERYTHING on your face.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those that want a lighted mirror to do their makeup because its extremely magnified to the point that only a certain part of your face is visible at one time.  But if you want a super close up of your face, this is the mirror for you.  I wish it had a better stand because the mirror itself doesn&#x27;t bend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother.  She picked it out in a hurry on her wishlist.  However, it&#x27;s not good for makeup, it&#x27;s short and not tall enough for her use and it only has one magnifying mirror instead of the two mirrors and the positioning and light do not work well.  We ended up going to Costco to purchase one with a $5.00 off coupon that was $15.00 total and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love -- and depend on -- this mirror! It magnifies better than most I&#x27;ve tried, with excellent lighting. I hate when I have to leave it behind when I travel by plane. If I travel by car, I take it along, no matter how indulgent it might seem. If you need a high-quality, durable lighted magnifying mirror, this one is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Bright light, small footprint, lots of magnification. What&#x27;s no to love.  Oh and easy to clean too.  I would recommend this .</li>
    <li> The Mirror arrived when I expected it too.  The magnification is great especially when you take your glasses off.  I like the light around the Mirror.</li>
    <li> its all good i love it thank you good job</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror. Terrific magnification with minimum distortion and a nice bright light. Perfect for makeup. You will see every clogged pore and blackhead no matter how small.</li>
    <li> Finally a lighted mirror that is super bright. The magnification will show you things you didn&#x27;t even know were there.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Lighting and magnification are great!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know why this needs a review.  I live and breath by this mirror, and that is no joke.  10x baby.. Need I say more?  Really?  This mirror is my life and can&#x27;t function well with out it.  I dropped mine, not too far from the floor, changed the light bulb and it didn&#x27;t work.  So of course, I bought a new one.  I love love love my 10x and I will never go without.  12x would really be the death of me.</li>
    <li> Holy Moly...there&#x27;s my face! I can actually see again with this mirror. Just don&#x27;t get your tweezers and start going crazy...just sayin.</li>
    <li> I agree with reviewers who wrote that to have a clear view of your face in this mirror, you must be very very close to the mirror--so close that you don&#x27;t have room to hold your lipstick or mascara without it (or your hand) hitting the mirror.  The lighting is good and the mirror seems to be of good quality--and you really can see in great detail--but I found it difficult to apply makeup.  The high number of positive reviews makes me think that many other users aren&#x27;t experiencing the issues that I did; maybe it depends upon how you wish to use the mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this.. My eye sight has gotten weak and so I bought this mirror for assistance on applying my makeup. It&#x27;s awesome because since i&#x27;v been using this mirror I get many more complements on my makeup.I highly recommend this product. The lighting is perfect, it&#x27;s very sturdy and the mirror is large in size. Again, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice bright light, great magnification mirror without distortion, nice large size.  If you are trying to decide on other brands, I found this one to be all that I was looking for: 10X, with good lighting, others with high magnification tend to have distortions.</li>
    <li> Without going into too much detail ... I&#x27;m obsessed with lighted magnified mirrors. I need one, all the time. I&#x27;m over 55 and have been losing my eyesight steadily for 10 yrs. In addition, I have more than a few crazy, wild, facial hairs that required daily attention. This mirror is it! It is light so I can even pack it to travel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> I received the mirror, and the light did not work.  I called (left a message) to let them know, and no one called me back.  I wrote an email given limited choices for response as to the return.  It ended up that I sent back the mirror at my own expense of $11 plus change, and was given a refund instead of a mirror with a working lamp.  I&#x27;m sure it would have worked great, but now I am out the money without a mirror.</li>
    <li> Nice lighted mirror. I appreciated how one reviewer pointed out that there&#x27;s an incandescent version of this model available at a slightly lower price but this one is brighter. It is VERY bright!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majorly magnifying mirror! I have to stare at it for a moment to let my eyes adjust. Once they do, it&#x27;s amazing how close-up you can see. Great for tweezing or applying false lashes or anywhere you only need to focus on a tiny part of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe anyone would try to use this mirror as your only makeup mirror. First, you can&#x27;t get a view of your full face and also, on top of that, the magnification is so great that you&#x27;re not really seeing a true representation of your makeup as it appears when people look at you with normal vision. You need to be able to step back &amp; see your whole face, which is impossible on this mirror. I&#x27;ve used magnifying mirrors before but this one is uncommonly close-up and I would say too much for realistic makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice little mirror, though, for those times you need to see every pore, hair &amp; skin flake.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, magnifies everything.  I use it everyday.  Tweeting is so easy now, as is putting on makeup!!  You can see things you don&#x27;t want to, LOL.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific mirror with excellent bright light and very high magnification. Many mirrors do not have good light.  This one has lighting around the circumference and although bright, it is easy on the eyes. I realize some people get upset with such high magnification, but I need it with my glasses off to put on makeup.  Its also fabulous for tweezing eybrows.  Okay, so I see every flaw.  What can I do, they are there.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but my wife says that the field of view is not as large as her old 10x mirror.  The two appear almost identical, but somehow the old one shows a little more of the face in clear focus.  To my wife this is important.</li>
    <li> Thanks to all the other reviews, I knew this was the one to get.  It has worked wonderfully.  For the first time in my 66 years I can put on eyeliner and &#x27;stay within the lines&#x27;.  I can see when &amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34;  :) stray onto my chin and also when make-up isn&#x27;t applied evenly. Oh yes, I can also see to outline my lips as I&#x27;m getting to that age when my lip edges seem to feather out.  Was well worth the money- how have I gotten along without it for so long?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have great eyesight anymore and this mirror is excellent.  The concave surface take a little to get used to but you can do an excellent job of facial maintenance!  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; mirror as I have this placed in front of my vanity mirror and so can get a clear enough whole face view in that larger mirror.  Using this in conjunction with that is a great solution for me.  The magnification and lighting is superb.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good lighting. Lightweight. Nice product. The visuals are good. I would recommend this mirror. A little pricey but comparable to other mirrors of it&#x27;s type.</li>
    <li> I have been asking for a lighted mirror for birthdays and Christmas for several years now, but no gift, so I bought one for myself.  I am glad I got to do the research myself and buy what I really wanted because this was the perfect choice.  The mirror clarity is great at 10x and the fluorescent light is white, compared to the yellow tone from the incandescent bulbs.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to fuss with batteries - it has a nice length cord.  The base is a small diameter, so I can keep it on the bathroom counter, too.  I am so happy with my choice, and it allows me to see everything I want to see, plus a few things I don&#x27;t want to.  :-)</li>
    <li> It is what I expected.  I have not used it much as I am havjng eye problems but I&#x27;m sure it will be very useful in the future.</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose, but is a little distorted.</li>
    <li> I have previously tried the [[ASIN:B001GS2B98 HoMedics Illuminated Satin Nickel Beauty Mirror]], only to return it because its incandescent bulb is quite useless. This item ([[ASIN:B001FS0HAY Floxite 9&amp;#34; high powered 10x Bright White Light Daylight Mirror]]) on the other hand, is equipped with a circular fluorescent bulb which provides cool, bright illumination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is good illumination so important for a magnifying mirror? When the image in the mirror is magnified, its brightness decreases proportionally. Therefore you really need much stronger light to illuminate the subject (your face). Bright light also makes your pupils contract, which allows people with poor eyesight to focus much better. Finally, a circular light source surrounding the mirror is the best configuration, because it does not cast any shadows on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that this mirror is perfect. Here are some minor annoyances:&lt;br /&gt;1. The 9&amp;#34; diameter mentioned in product description includes the fluorescent bulb. The mirror itself is only 7.5&amp;#34; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;2. The optical quality of the mirror is decent, but not exactly &#x27;distortion free&#x27; at full magnification.&lt;br /&gt;3. Many other magnifying mirrors also offer a flat &#x27;1x&#x27; surface. This mirror only has one &#x27;10x&#x27; magnifying surface (*).&lt;br /&gt;4. The white plastic construction looks rather cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to find a high quality magnifying mirror for under $100. So considering its relatively low cost, this item is still a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*) Footnote / Pet Peeve:&lt;br /&gt;Why do manufacturers of magnifying mirrors always insist on abusing the definition of &#x27;magnification&#x27;? For example, a &#x27;10x telescope&#x27; means its LINEAR magnification factor is 10, so the subject in view appears 100 times larger in area. However, a so-called &#x27;10x mirror&#x27; in this case means that it makes the subject looks 10 times larger, so its linear magnification is just 3.16 (square-root of 10).</li>
    <li> I have had wall mounted magnifying mirrors for years and find these indispensable. I bought this for travel to my daughter&#x27;s wedding and do not like it.  The light is great, but if found that I have to get very close to the mirror to have a focused reflection.  A whole face view cannot be seen despite the large, bulky size of this mirror. The only comfortable position I could get in while using it was sitting close to it.  Our suite had a smallish bathroom and I had to balance the mirror on the bathroom sink, which was difficult.  Magnification of separate parts of the face was good, but missed having a full face view.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and the light is very brite.  So much so that if she looks into it for too long, she has a flash bulb after effect where she sees a circle of light at the edges of her vision in dimmer light.  The adjustable arm doesn&#x27;t adjust much.  The mirror is only magnified, there is not a flip side with normal.  There is distortion depending on how close you hold the mirror, of course.  But the magnification is huge, the light is VERY bright and overall, it seems to be a good unit.</li>
    <li> I love the mirror.  Perfect size.  Great magnifier.  Highly recommend this mirror if you are looking for table top style.</li>
    <li> Love this lighted mirror.  I am really impressed with the amount of light it gives.  The magnification is great also.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  It is a little concave and magnified so much that you can put your makeup on to perfection.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to pluck the errant chin hairs that my old face seems to grow.  Excellent light and magnification...however, seeing that much detail of my features is a bit frightening.  As a side note, my cat jumped onto the bathroom counter and was shocked to see a large image of her face looking back!  Funny!  I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  I&#x27;ve owned this for 6-9 months with no issues at all.  I use it  at least 2x per day.</li>
    <li> I have own this mirror for seven years and love it so much I purchased  one as a gift. The lighting on it is very illuminating, bright as a matter of fact, you could use it in a dark room and have no problem putting on make-up or plucking your eye brows. Doesn&#x27;t hide a thing on your face so be prepared. The stem of the mirror slightly tilt back and forth and the mirror itself slants up and down too making it convenient for any counter. It is electric which means you do need to place it near an outlet. I recently brought it traveling (a little bulky for travel but we were driving) and my sister was totally amazed at what she could see. If your eyes are having trouble or starting to have trouble seeing the small stuff, this is the perfect vanity mirror and well worth the price. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I Love this mirror. I bought one several years ago and the bulb is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Great magnification. Just bought my second one because first one was such a good purchase. One for upstairs bathroom and one for downstairs bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> My previous Floxite hung on the wall; this one does not, although that info is not available in the description.  The lighting is just fair.  You must stand ver close because of the high magnification.</li>
    <li> Its just not for me.  I thought it would have different levels of magnification.  The Customer service was exceptional as once I selected return my account was credited immediately.  Would use this company again.</li>
    <li> I gave 1st one to my sis best mirror I have ever owned.i am almost legally blind and able to apply makeup with no problems. First one 4 yrs old and is still perfect. Made sure could still. GET it before giving to sister. Will never be without this mirror best purchases I have ever made.  Do not hesitate got it  3 days after ordering and still paid no shipping. Told sister HAVE MIRROR WILL TRAVEL. PRICE WAS  EXCELLENT. No distortion in either mirror.</li>
    <li> 10X is a bit too close for general use but helps in applying eye makeup and inserting contact lenses. It is well constructed. My only dislike is that it is rather big and hard to store in my small bathroom.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this mirror yesterday.  After I plugged it in for the first time, the light flickered and then turned off. It will not turn on again, so I will be returning the mirror. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Recd the mirror very quickly — it is exactly as shown and works very well.</li>
    <li> enlarges too much for my liking</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a different mirror on Amazon to replace this one. It was made better but the mirror magnification and light source was poor. This has a good light source and great magnification. I will tell you after a few years it will wear down - and ours eventually needed a new light and then the neck simply snapped. It&#x27;s plastic and not made to last. That&#x27;s why I tried to change mirrors but went back to this one once I made compared it to what was out there. If they could make this mirror in metal I would pay double.</li>
    <li> If you are the type of person who likes to pick and pluck, you must get this mirror! I first saw this mirror in Bed, Bath, and Beyond on display and it was for sale for $60. I turned it on &amp; looked at my face and was horrified; you can see every hair and pore (and I have great young eyes, don&#x27;t wear glasses, etc). I bought one for myself, later one for my mom, later one for my mom in law. Bed, Bath, and Beyond stopped carrying them, so I was so excited to find it on Amazon, and for a lot less! My mom left one overseas so I bought her another one, and one for my niece. I tell everyone about how great it is! Magnifies 10 times and the light is sooo bright. I think it comes with an order form if you ever need a new light bulb but I have had mine for at least 10 years and the original light bulb is still going strong. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have spent over $125.00 on make up mirrors more than once and this one is far superior to any of them combined. I can&#x27;t see well close up due to getting older and this mirror is large, clear, bright, and has NO distortion. I will never order any other so I hope it stays in stock forever.</li>
    <li> I chose this mirror for applying make-up and its LED lighting and magnifying power are perfect.  BUT, the magnification blurs and distorts unless you look at it from a precise angle, yet the mirror doesn&#x27;t adjust position - only the stem does and even the stem only goes into three positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a table that&#x27;s precisely the right distance and angle from your face, it&#x27;s good.  But for me, it&#x27;s just a very large and clumsy hand-mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not tilt very well and reflection is odd. Not great for makeup or tweezing. Recommend you go with something higher quality.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror. I bought the same one last year and recently the back started to melt. Somehow it overheated. But the lighting and magnification are just what I need so I ordered a second one and will be extra mindful of the over-heating possibility.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great!  I can finally see.  Putting on makeup and  tweezing eyebrows became easy.  I only wish it had another side that didn&#x27;t magnify.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror.  The size is good, and the distortion is much less than my last mirror, especially on the sides.  It is important to me to have the &amp;#34;daylight&amp;#34; feature.  I thought I would need more magnification, but it is nice and clear.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup mirror ever.  I use it everyday and it is a great size and quality.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t cheap, yet not too out there. There are so many to choose from and I&#x27;m glad I found this one.</li>
    <li> doesnt illuminate the whole face have to move from side to side to side, read this on review and didnt think it a problem but it is, cant look straight in middle and see anything the light doesnt reach the center</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am so pleased with this mirror that I had to this time.  If you want superior lighting this is the mirror to buy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY ADJUSTABLE and wide enough to see almost all of your face.  You can also replace the bulb, what a plus.  My last mirror cost twice&lt;br /&gt;as much and once the bulb went out.............well kiss it goodbye.  I would highly recommend this mirror.  It&#x27;s a definite &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great light...good price...would buy again.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really helpful!  It provides clear light, similar to outdoor, that allows me to quickly check for areas that need attention.  Tweezing is a lot faster and more accurate with this mirror.  The style is pretty basic, but it&#x27;s small and doesn&#x27;t stand out in a bad way.  The only problem is needing to resist the urge to obsess over all the detail it reveals!</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THIS MIRROR BEFORE...I THINK IT WAS 6 YEARS OLD, WHEN IT STARTED TO BREAK DOWN!  I ORDERED THE NEW VERSION, AND LOVE IT!  I COULD NOT PUT MY MAKEUP ON WITHOUT IT!  THE LIGHT IS PERFECT...NOT TOO BRIGHT!  I AM SURE I WILL HAVE THIS NEW ONE FOR YEARS TO COME!!  THANKS!</li>
    <li> This product arrived defective. I felt like I got a used item because of the wear and tear on the box and mirror.</li>
    <li> I love it! It bends over for my height!&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is perfect when my&lt;br /&gt;Lenses are out! The light matches the&lt;br /&gt;Outdoors so you are not over done.</li>
    <li> This is just not a good choice if you want to use it for anything besides plucking. I cannot recommend this mirror, it was misleading by saying it is good for makeup application.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous mirror that allows me to see everything I need to see when getting ready in the morning without the use of my glasses.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  I&#x27;m 55 and it&#x27;s great for plucking eyebrows, etc.  The lighting is perfect.  Because of the 10x magnification, you have to get up close to it to eliminate the distortion, but this is expected and not a problem.  It&#x27;s heavy and of very good construction.  This will be a permanent fixture on my vanity.  It is worth every dime I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I had one before for years and it finally died.  Got this one and it is just as good as the last one.  I can see as I am putting on my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love it. I can see everything little thing was able to apply makeup with ease</li>
    <li> I was having trouble seeing to put my make up on without my glasses..very hard to pluck eyebrows, do liner, etc.  You can see every pore on your face with this mirror.  I just love it!  &amp;#34;Nuff said!</li>
    <li> As I have diminished vision, I use this handy mirror every day to apply my makeup. I wish they made this mirror in a 15x as it would then be perfect.</li>
    <li> My second Floxite mirror.  The other one I owned for 8 years.  They do sell replaceable bulbs, but I was very happy buying this one.  Great lighting and magnification.</li>
    <li> I am blind in Left eye so this does help me to get make- up on with the light is helps a lot.</li>
    <li> This mirror is not messing around. The 10x magnification is intense! I have spyder veins on my face that I didn&#x27;t know existed! YIKES!</li>
    <li> Got my mirror a while back and am quite satisfied with it.  As per other reviewers, you do have to stand quite close to it to see clearly but it totally works for me.  No problems there.  I wish that it could be adjusted a little better but I have figured out the best position in order to see my face so it has worked out O.K.  I have even used it to see moles and skin aberrations on my legs and arms and it has been great in that respect.  The light is very good....no complaints.  I must have read about 800 reviews before I bought this mirror and for the price, ($47.00 U.S. through Amazing Deals) I am very satisfied with the product.  One thing to note before you buy.....this mirror needs to sit on something if you are using it at a bathroom counter or you will be bending over quite far down to see your face.  I found an old plastic container, turned it upside down and used it as a base to sit the mirror on.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> Actually,  I already did review  this, but happy to do it again. I now own 4 of these  and they are the best . I can&#x27;t  say  enough  about  these. I have used them for yrs ordered  new ones one for each bathroom.  And one I leave  at my sons. So I am  never  without one. 100 percent  happy. Thanks  to  Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mirror is scary good, literally.  Be very prepared to see things on your face you had no idea were there! OMG! Where did all those age spots come from and the wrinkles, bumps, discolorations?  Did they just pop up the day I got this mirror?  I think I could even see my DNA strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember &amp;#34;Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who&#x27;s the fairest of them all?&amp;#34;  The Queen did NOT want to know the truth, right?  Really, are you ready for this much information?  If you are, this mirror will reveal all!</li>
    <li> This was not what I was expecting at all. I wanted this as a vanity mirror to put makeup on with, etc. The magnification is such that when I was about 18&amp;#34; away from it, for whatever reason, it was showing me being upside-down! I can only surmise that it&#x27;s due somehow to the strength of the magnification. It only seemed to work the right way if I was really close, and then I couldn&#x27;t see my whole face, just a small portion of it. It&#x27;s possible mine had a defect, because I purchased this based on so many positive reviews! I had to return it and got the Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three Panel Mirror as a replacement, which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if you expect it to last.  It dies one month after I received but interestingly enough beyond the return period.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job of showing EVERYTHING including things I didn&#x27;t want to know were there. Makes plucking eyebrows a much easier task than it ever was before.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror.  This is the second one she has gotten over a 10 year period.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  You can see everything.  Not like those dim hotel mirrors</li>
    <li> I ordered this item twice from two different sellers, and received a mirror that does not resemble this one at all. Not even close, and not useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to have this item, but since I&#x27;ve received a different model twice I have to conclude that it is perhaps no longer made.</li>
    <li> I have the same mirror and want another for my second home. I found it here at a good price. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This will change your life.  Actually, this should come with a warning that it may cause the owner to see WAY more than is necessary to maintain and/or makeup a face.  However, as we age our eyesight does weaken and that makes no difference when applying makeup with this great mirror.</li>
    <li> Good mirror but sometimes the light has to be clicked on a few times.  Not sure what is going on with it.</li>
    <li> OMG you can see more detail than you ever thought possible! Great for tweezing &amp; inspecting every square inch of your face. Thank God I&#x27;m typically too busy to spend much time in front of it obsessing, lol. The lighting is excellent as well. GREAT product!!</li>
    <li> Great size, perfect lighting (simulates daylight), angle of mirror adjusts up or down.  I can see every pore and hair on my face.  Love, love, love.  I wish they made a smaller version for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad originally. But I took it over and just love it. I use it to put eye makeup on</li>
    <li> I turned the light on and BAM!! I see more flaws clearly and am glad that I found it. When I need to remove the facial hair, I won&#x27;t miss it for it magnifies the strand real good. I wear glasses and sometimes I still need to keep them on to see better.</li>
    <li> This 10x magnifying mirror makes a cinch for putting on makeup even if you have a tremor.  It is attractive and stable with sufficient light.  The size is large enough to see your whole face but not so large it takes up too much space on a makeup table like so many do. It was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It was just what I was looking for! The magnification is very good. Would recommend to a friend or anyone over 50 needing this type of magnification.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother who has macular degeneration and has a hard time seeing to put on makeup,  etc. This mirror has nice magnification and the circumferential lighting limits shadows. This mirror is great for her.</li>
    <li> You can see everything. Stuff you wouldn&#x27;t even notice when looking in regular mirror. My sister had one and once I looked in her mirror, I knew that I must get one. Best magnifying lighted mirror ever!</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I read some reviews that the concave design makes it difficult to see if you&#x27;re too far away, and that is definitely true.  I do like the magnification (strong).  You do have to be right next to it to be able to see though, because otherwise everything is out of focus.  The light is nice and bright though.  It works for what I wanted, so I&#x27;m happy with it, but not sure I&#x27;d want it for a makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> Great light, great mirror. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gives the room so much bright light, and it&#x27;s really nice looking on my face</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!! I finally found one that magnifies large enough for my vision, without glasses. As I get it older it&#x27;s getting harder &amp; harder to see to put makeup on or do eyebrows. I love the light! That is a huge help too. Certainly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, Very bright light, evenly lit all around (not dark areas like some) Very nice lamp, but the 10x magnifier was too strong for me, I can only see a couple inches at a time- no full face view. Good for someone that has poor close-up vision. It doesn&#x27;t reverse to 1x like most do:  but I didn&#x27;t realize it until after I Rec&#x27;d this, had to return it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is quite good.  However, after very little use (a total of less than 2 hours), the bulb burned out.  The replacement bulb costs over $20 including shipping.  I asked the seller to replace the bulb given the limited life, but the seller refused. Beware that you may be purchasing a $50 mirror but may need to replace the bulb for an additional $20 in a very short time.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the perfect size, well illuminated and has no extraneous buttons. ON/OFF that&#x27;s all I need accompanied by an excellent magnification.</li>
    <li> Tried to find a lighted mirror locally to tweeze stray hairs on my face.  The cheap one I bought at WalMart did not do it for me, so I started looking online for a better one.  Found this one and thought it would be exactly what I need.  I am not disappointed at all.  It magnifies so well, I can see every pore  on my face and the light is bright enough for my aging cataract eyes to see well enough to tweeze.  I highly recommend this Floxite Daylight Vanity Mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Lights up my mug just right.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s fine but it&#x27;s so bright you can&#x27;t see your face</li>
    <li> Good mirror for the price. Need to be very close to it in order to see yourself focused.</li>
    <li> I have super far-sighted vision, and it&#x27;s different in each eye.  I haven&#x27;t been able to see to put on eye makeup for years and years and years until I got this.  Open the eye you&#x27;re working on, close the other -- wow!  Sharp, brilliant focus, well lit, I can see to do eye makeup!</li>
    <li> According to the woman. It&#x27;s overall good at close ups, expected mire further away and close ups. Also she and I  were expected it to be mobile not plugged in and stationary type.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR PUTTING MYSELF TOGETHER !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is only a magnifying mirror, there is no normal view. If all you want is a mirror that shows every pore and only focuses when you are within 3 inches of the surface, this is for you. If you want a normal view mirror look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My eyesight close up is terrible as I age. I can barely see the hairs on my face or eyebrows for plucking. I got back from vacation and I was in shock once I put on my glasses in my bathroom mirror.  My bathroom mirror is great but I need my glasses in order to see. I just received this product today, and I just tried. I was able to see all my hairs on my eyebrows and lip even the light small hairs. I could see my pores. I plucked my eyebrows perfectly. This is fantastic. I did not need my glasses which is the most important issue, because I can&#x27;t get to my eyebrows with my glasses. It is also very good to see my makeup and eyelashes. Glad I listened to the reviews! I can&#x27;t live without this light up mirror. I don&#x27;t need my glasses with this mirror so I am able to see everything on my face and it is great for doing makeup. It is the only time that I do not need to wear my glasses!</li>
    <li> This mirror works really great for people that need good magnification.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The magnification is so strong  that it is just too much. Your face has to be nearly an inch from the mirror or your reflection is literally upsidedown! It is just not good for me.</li>
    <li> Good mirror with high light.  If I had seen what was going on with my face before this I would have been horrified.  I think it&#x27;s actually too highly magnified because it makes it hard for me to focus.</li>
    <li> Best mirror ever!!  Love it! Thank you seller :)</li>
    <li> I looked all over local stores and searched the Internet looking for a makeup mirror to replace my old one that recently quit working.  I found this Floxite mirror and ordered it and have never been happier with a purchase!  The quality of the mirror is superb, the light is just like daylight, and the magnification is great.  I would recommend this to anyone with &amp;#34;less than perfect&amp;#34; eyes who wanted to see what they look like when they get outside.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the mirror, it&#x27;s good quality for under $100.  Although my light bulb needed replacement after only 3 months, and why make it so difficult to access the bulb in order to replace it!</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted, it shows what she wants but not like my 15X that shows absolutely every ugly pore.  The mirror is also big enough that you can see your face rather than just a small part of it.</li>
    <li> It is very magnifying and it will help you to see Everything on your face.  Great product...</li>
    <li> I  am used to a magnification light when I put on makeup at home.  I always struggle with this when I travel.  This is a little bulky, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup looking crazy becuase I can&#x27;t keep my reading glasses on while applying eye makeup.  It also has a regular magnifcation size so my son uses it to put in his contacts.  For a day or two travel, I have a small mirror.  For anything over 3 days, this baby comes along with me.</li>
    <li> After trying several different mirrors, this is by far the best!  I&#x27;ve had mine for several years with no problems, bulb or otherwise.  The mirror is larger than most that I&#x27;ve seen, the bulb stays cool and the lighting is even.  Have just purchased two more as gifts. The only problem I have is spending far too much time inspecting my face.</li>
    <li> This lighted makeup mirror was just what I was looking for!  Great light, appropriate magnification,</li>
    <li> too much magnification, had to put nose next to mirror too focus. couldn&#x27;t see face in mirror. certainly not a makeup mirror,</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected.  The mirror is perfect for plucking and close observation of your face. My daughter has even started using it too.</li>
    <li> Great light.  Love this mirror.</li>
    <li> Nothing sadder that someone not being able to see to put on their makeup well.  Anyone over 40 can appreciate the lighting and ability to see any hair out of place.  Excellent product, excellent purchasing experience!!</li>
    <li> If you are not afraid to see what you really look like, I recommend this mirror.  It lets you see every detail imperfect clarity!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it this mirror, you can only see your face in big dimensions, if you want to use it to check your chest to try to remove some white hair ( I&#x27;m a man ) or even some blackhead it is totally useless, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> .This is very basic, and works great. the light is bright, and the magnification is just right. There are all kinds of fancy mirrors like this, some with touch on and off, and some that use some weird bulb. Many have a light that cast a yellow, or orange incandescent glow. This one is bright white in every way. It is made well, the first one is still in use and working perfectly after 4 years. The new one replaced a large metal mirror that had touch control. We simply hated it, and it was a mild irritation that finally reached a point where we said the heck with it, and bought a second Floxite Daylight. It is the best  “bang for the buck” in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this light because I have a hard time seeing my eyebrows to keep them tweezed neatly. WOW...problem solved. I will say, however, that if you wanted to use this mirror for application of makeup, you might struggle some, because for me at least, I have to be RIGHT up next to the glass to be able to see clearly. This is fine for tweezing however; I can see even the finest, tiniest hairs. I love it!</li>
    <li> be careful . replacing the bulb is COSTLY!!</li>
    <li> Does not focus your face when you look at it.</li>
    <li> Does the job I need. Light is not very bright and batteries run out quickly.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for about 10 years now. Purchased another one for my daughter, my son, and my mom.  If you need a magnifying mirror, this is the one! I could not live without this mirror! It is crystal clear and you often see more than you really want to. Haha.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, is as described, no complaints, would recommend</li>
    <li> I like the Floxite 10x magnifying mirror.  There is no distortion in the glass, light is bright, and base is stable. It is adjustable up and down but not sideways.  This 10x shows every facial flaw, which is what I was looking for, so I can easily apply makeup or concealer as needed, pluck eyebrows, put on eye liner, etc. without my glasses.  This mirror is not as compact as my previous Floxite 8x with detachable mirror that I used for years, and the 10x is too bulky to try and pack in a suitcase.  The base is also taller and thicker so it takes up more room.  This is not a concern for me, but it might be too big to fit in a small area.  Hopefully, the bulb will last a long time since the replacement price listed is $20 inclusive of shipping. The cost was a bit high for my budget, but I know Floxite makes a good product.  There is a wide variety of Floxite mirror styles available with varying magnification strengths; it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the one that fits your needs.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a great big magnifying mirror to start your day. You can see every little hair on your chinny chin chin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot about these mirrors, but my wife says it works great and she is extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This mirror has been a miracle find and a money saver.  I was having my brows waxed every week because I could not see the hairs in my old mirror.  Now, I haven&#x27;t waxed at all and I can see every hair and every pore. I love this mirror</li>
    <li> the light is bright, the mirror is strong.  It doesnt look attactive on paper, but looks great in your home.  I got it as a gift and the recipient told me they love it!</li>
    <li> Bulb not properly seated. Had to open up and fix.</li>
    <li> Nice product and pretty fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift because I already own one. I purchased other mirrors that do not compare with the light on this mirror. They were dim. The lighting and the magnification on this Floxite Vanity Mirror is great for plucking those hard to see stray eyebrow hairs or for putting on make-up. The arm tilts back and forth and the mirror itself tilts too. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble seeing small things and would not waste time looking at any other product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is what I needed.. It is wonderful.  It is weighted and stays perfectly on my counter. I can put on my makeup I can do my eyebrows.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things.  I do love this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this mirror.  I use mine to put on mascara, pluck stray hairs, and check overall makeup.  My eyes are aging so they really help, but even before I needed glasses, I used it daily.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. My makeup comes out perfect. It looks terrible in this little mirror and I feel frustrated, then I look in the bathroom mirror and am stunned at how flawless my face looks! It is insanely close up. You will see every hair on your face and every pore. It is crazy. You have to buy one. My kids love it, also. They like to look at their faces. I showed my dog his face in the mirror and he scared himself.</li>
    <li> I am very farsighted and I need good magnification and good light in order to put on my eye makeup and other makeup.  My one quibble (and it&#x27;s a minor one) is that I think the base should be just a little bit heavier.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror and like the magnification, lighting, size of the mirror surface, and price, but I am returning it. Why? It is too short. I am of average height, but have to hunch over to use it. The construction is satisfactory, as well as the design. It is simple and functional (except for the height).</li>
    <li> You have to get too close to this mirror to see without distortion. I couldn&#x27;t even get my make-up brush between me and the mirror. Awful!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Floxite mirror. As I got older I&#x27;ve needed to go with stronger and stronger magnification. What I always look for with their mirrors is the larger diameter, and this one is a good size. Because I have used these mirrors for almost 20 years (yikes) I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see my whole face at once. But that&#x27;s not an issue for me since I&#x27;m only needing it to apply eye makeup, or pluck my eyebrows and other stray hairs (double yikes), etc and this mirror helps me zero in on these areas. Regarding the light, it&#x27;s too bright for my eyes, so upgrading to this Daylight model was a waste of money for me. My bathroom is bright enough that I can do what I need without the blinding light in my eyes. Since I don&#x27;t need or use the light, I didn&#x27;t deduct a star for being &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; bright. All in all this mirror has met all my needs.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror, very sturdy, nice lighting and magnification- I ended up returning it because I was looking for a taller mirror for my counter for makeup application, but if height is not an issue, this mirror is really great!</li>
    <li> Good product… It is very bright and magnifies quite a lot!  Can see many details in your face.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is not a great make up mirror. The glass is a little difficult to look into and the light isn&#x27;t quite bright enough. It looks big but doesn&#x27;t seem all that big when you look into it.</li>
    <li> You cannot do makeup in this mirror. It&#x27;s good for tweezing, but you can only see using the magnification. If you&#x27;re looking for a make up mirror get something else.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it--you can see every last ugly hair and detail!  It is nice and big and I like that it plugs in, not battery operated.  Your delivery speed was lightning fast.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best magnifying mirror out there. Have bought two.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just what I needed to try to pluck my eyebrows with having poor eyesight.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this product years ago I am thinking about buying it for my adult daughter. she is be amazed at how good it works.Thanks again and the delivery was spot on. Thanks again very very good product I LOVE it !!!!</li>
    <li> Love, Love this mirror. This is my second one and They work great for putting on your make-up and for doing your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I carry it on any trip I take.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic. Cheap product. The electrical connections is very cheap too. I had to open it to check the light connections. There was no light when I connected it to the power and turn the switch on. The magnify glass very distorted. I do not recommend it at all. There are others for the same price with better quality.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and processing was very good but who wants a fast service of a bad product.</li>
    <li> Great price for a mirror that is quite clear and magnifies really well.  I keep it in my walk in closet as it is not a decorative mirror for a vanity.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My favorite make-up mirror. It&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t live without! I always use it, I even travel with it! Perfect!</li>
    <li> This one is the best product for the price. My last one lasted over a decade.</li>
    <li> works well - slight distortion at the edges - but has a large surface area</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing what you can see/find with the amount of light this mirror puts off...almost scary! After looking into it the first time, I was happy I got it because why didn&#x27;t anyone tell me I have a long black hair growing out of my chin! Love the long power cord. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really really good mirror.</li>
    <li> How do you replace the bulb? I have one and the light went out.  I love the mirror</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because its not soft white</li>
    <li> Very good.  Now I can see to do my make up.</li>
    <li> The magnification is incredible! The lights are so bright! This mirror is exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent! It really is 10x and I do have to get right  up to it, but I catch all the little hairs before they can be seen in &amp;#34;real life&amp;#34;! It is easy to swivel and adjust and has a glowy not harsh light. I highly recommend it. Just be sure you are ready to see every flaw and deal wih it. I used a makeup mirror in the past but nothing as good as this and was surprised at the sun damage this mirror revealed. Oh well...</li>
    <li> Need to see my face for makeup and cleaning</li>
    <li> Great price!  Great mirror- as described!</li>
    <li> Yikes!  There is nothing scarier than a 40+ year old woman looking at herself in a 10x magnification lighted mirror!  And while it will take years of \\&quot;therapy\\&quot; with a dermatologist to get past the shock, this really is a fantastic mirror.  It is true that the distortion at 6 inches or greater from the mirror is pronounced, however I bought this mirror to manage my eyebrows (...and now, apparently, my chin, thanks to the 10x magnification).  The distance needed for [absolute, shocking] clarity is perfectly fine for me.  If I could give more stars, I would</li>
    <li> A surprisingly excellent product. More compact than it looks, yet the mirror is huge and the lamp surrounding the mirror is really bright. My mother&#x27;s reaction has been \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you buy this for me 10 years ago?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> exactly what my wife was looking for. Bigger than we thought but that is not a bad thing.</li>
    <li> I researched many different mirrors before deciding on this one. I was looking for a brushed silver but this one better met my needs. I have low vision and need a good light for make up application. This mirror is light weight yet sturdy. It has a replaceable light bulb. The height was right for me and it is adjustable. It is not a two sided mirror but that was okay for my needs. The 10X magnification is what I needed. There is no distortion. I think it would be a plus if this mirror was also available in an oval style. I recommmend this mirror for low vision individuals who need good lighting and good magnification.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror, the light really helps see every pore in your face. It is adjustable and helps with plucking eyebrows and putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  The light surrounding the mirror is excellent and I&#x27;m able to go hands-free when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my vanity at home, and it&#x27;s really too small to use unless your sitting  very close to it. I have since bought the same brand in a larger size for home and put this one in my travel bag. ( even with the bigger one you have to be close to focus, but you have more area.)</li>
    <li> The light was bright on this one.  However, with a 10x  you cannot see your whole face.  This was not what I needed.  If you only need to see a small portion of your face very close up then this would work fine.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Just be prepared! You will see EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s scary. That&#x27;s what a good mirror is all about. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Other than it&#x27;s a bit strong, it is a really nice mirror.  When getting my cataracts removed, a website said that one would need a 10 x....but I think an 8 would&#x27;ve been much better.</li>
    <li> A gift to my wife she really enjoys. Very useful and well made.</li>
    <li> Love, love it.  This is the second one I have had in many years.  Works great for my aging eyes.</li>
    <li> The magnification is staggering.  Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want to see every pore, hair and imperfection on your face.  I find I must adjust the distance I stand from the mirror in order to focus my image.  As scary as I look, I&#x27;m grateful I can finally see well enough to get the very fine, wayward brows.  It would not be a good choice for general makeup application.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to use.  I love this mirror!  (is that fair?)</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  Good quality and light.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. My eyes are getting older, but I don&#x27;t believe it offers an accurate 10X Magnification.  I wish I would have waited and bought a better quality mirror. I will need to buy a better quality 10X magnification mirror. I&#x27;ll simply give this one to my daughter.</li>
    <li> you can see every pore and line on your face. its so close up it helps me put in my contacts and false eye lashes. i read in one review it wasent bright enough. it only has one type of light, daylight. but this light is plenty bright. you will need to have another mirror to check your makeup over all. because this mirror is very close up.</li>
    <li> This lamp is bright enough for my sad sorry eyes.  It is not as tall as I would like, but the adjustability and tilt help compensate.  The 10x magnification is more than I&#x27;m used to, but I am adjusting to being able so see every pore in detail. I can do my eye makeup without glasses!!!  It sits in front of my regular wall bathroom mirror, so I can easily do the rest of my makeup and hair with no magnification.</li>
    <li> Just received this mirror and it is great! Wonderfully bright lighting and high magnification leaves no flaw unnoticed. I was amazed by what I hadn&#x27;t seen before. Great for finding those pesky chin hairs that go unnoticed in dim light (thank goodness). In any event this is a very good product. Wish it came in a nickel bronze color as it would match my bathroom settings though. It even has a twisty neck so that the mirror can be tilted at different angles for convenience.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Extra bright and easy to see no matter what time of day or how dark the room is.  Definitely the best mirror I have seen.</li>
    <li> One must risk burning their cornea in order to use this product. You need to bring your face so closely to the mirror that the light is overwhelming.</li>
    <li> the best mirror you will ever buy</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife for Christmas, I should have let her pick it out!  The 10X mag was too much for her taste and I have to agree.  Who needs to know that much about one&#x27;s skin pores - really!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few mirrors that has 10x. It is great mirror! No distortion, much less expensive that the ones I use to get at H.S. That had a faulty switch design and ver difficult bulb replacements.&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this light.</li>
    <li> 10X daylight cosmetic mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my mirror.  Transaction was easy and everyone very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience with purchase, very helpful.</li>
    <li> It says that it is a Daylight Cosmetic Mirror.  Silly me.....I thought that meant that the light around it was like daylight.  Not the case at all, the light is not bright, leaves a lot of shadows.  The trick is that you have to USE it in the daylight.  That kind of defeated the purpose for me since I&#x27;m using it in a windowless bathroom.  It does magnify well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom for Christmas.. She has a hard time seeing to put her makeup on and this is so easy for her to use. She can carry to any location in her home and loves to use it!</li>
    <li> 5 stars! I do! I LOVE it! I think every woman should own one of these! So awesome when you find that you made the right choice! A little about this item. Don&#x27;t worry what the measurements say, this thing is plenty big enough, I mean, it&#x27;s big. The light bulb is replaceable. It&#x27;s a round fluorescent bulb and this mirror is designed to be able to replace the bulb, which is more than I can say for some of the other mirrors that are for sale. It&#x27;s sturdy. NOT a hunk of junk! i love that it plugs in. No lack of power here! It&#x27;s bright, daylight bright, just like it says. It&#x27;s heavy, it kind of suctions to my counter. I love that. The mirror swivels to any position you need it to. Nice power button. Easy on, easy off. This mirror is about 50 to 75 percent less expensive than most of the other mirrors out there and worth every penny! My complexion is 75% better than it was before I bought it. I find hairs I never knew were there and when applying make up, I find all these small areas that I missed before, all these pink spots that I missed on my face and also small globs of make up that didn&#x27;t used to get blended mostly in my nose and eyebrow area, lol. If you work with the public, you seriously need this.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works really well. Beings adjustable makes it easy to use. The mirror is a good size and the light is bright.</li>
    <li> I have had a floxite compact mirror for years.  Loved it.  I like this one but wish it had the cosmetic bottom like the portable.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mirror if you really want to see every pore.  It&#x27;s a little frightening and could ADD time to your makeup routine simply based on what you&#x27;ll notice in comparison to standard mirrors.  However, the 10X magnification was far too powerful for me.  (I probably should have tested a similar strength mirror at a store.  Also, If it matters, I don&#x27;t yet need reading glasses, but I do wear contact lenses for nearsightedness.)  As a previous reviewer warned, I really did have to lean in until I was a highly uncomfortable 1-2 inches from mirror.  At that distance, I could only do a small section of my face at a time which led to a bit of a headache and rather disjointed makeup job.  I like to have a full view of my face even if I&#x27;m only doing my eyes; it keeps me from going clown-like on one quadrant of my face...  On the upside, this mirror offers some powerful lighting - a welcome change from so many of the poorly lit vanity mirrors out there.  That&#x27;s why I took a chance on this mirror.  I read that this one actually delivers the noticeable and useful light.  Obviously I can&#x27;t recommend this particular product, but I&#x27;m hoping to find a similarly lit and priced mirror by Floxite.  I don&#x27;t love the white plastic, but the lighting and price were/will be enough for me to overlook the somewhat lackluster aesthetics.</li>
    <li> Nice size, good light and excellent magnification. Would purchase again if I was looking for this same item. Good price.</li>
    <li> I had another mirror similar to this one for years and loved it but nothing lasts forever and it was time to get another. I did read some of the reviews that were rated very low just to see what sort of problems existed but apparently they were not familiar with this type of mirror. The lighting is great and there is no distortion at all when used properly.  Because of the magnification you are limited to how far away you can be but that&#x27;s the point. This is a great product and would recommend this mirror to those who are familiar with magnification mirrors.</li>
    <li> Buy this mirror. Good product, but needs to have an option of magnified AND regular reflection. This only has the magnified which can make you dizzy with time. Good to pluck eyebrows without glasses on and see every wrinkle. As I said, it needs the added option I mentioned. since one cannot see your finished made-up face in this mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfirend and going through numerous reviews.  You tube had a review and test on several. this is the one recommended and they were right. good quality. verty good magnification and super light and bright</li>
    <li> Shows every nook and cranny. Bright mirror shows you everything you want to see and more. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> This mirror is all that it promised. The light and magnification are great. I love it! Wish I had bought one sooner!</li>
    <li> I had one almost like it (no vents) for maybe 8 years. Dropped it. Oh and I never had to replace the light. Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. But we get pretty seasick-ish around it.&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t right infront of it with your nose almost touching, you&#x27;ll throw up from how dizzy it makes you feel.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> I had this mirror for quite a few years and when I couldn&#x27;t find a bulb to replace it I got this mirror. I paid a whole lot more at a beauty supply store! My eyesight is super bad so this mirror is important for me if I want to see how I truly look. Don&#x27;t freak out when you first look at yourself!! Haha. I had a couple of people that wanted to use it while at my home and they all jumped back and said &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!!! You can see every single pore with this mirror. Not kidding. There is absolutely no distortion with this mirror! Your makeup will look so much better because you will be able to see how it looks and how other people see you as well. I am keeping my old mirror for a back up. I am still going to get a new bulb for the old one.Also, The price of this mirror is so much lower than the other stores. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Brilliant we have an older version this is superior</li>
    <li> Love this product so much that I bought my grown daughter one, too...and they&#x27;ve both lasted about 7 years and still look great (and we haven&#x27;t even needed to replace a bulb!).  This purchase was to finally replace my daughter&#x27;s mirror because the power cord became worn where it attaches at the base of the unit (probably because she moves the unit each time she uses it--I do the same, but reinforced mine with white electrical tape so it&#x27;s still okay).  Maybe a &amp;#34;swivel&amp;#34; cord at the base would prevent this?  We love this mirror--especially good for tweezing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Mirror seems good. I don&#x27;t think it is as bright as an older model we had but it works. If light was brighter I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you truly want to know what your face truly looks like, this mirror is for you!  It gives a scarily accurate portrayal of your skin.  The light is nice and bright.  The mirror is not distorted.  It tilts to several angles and holds tight.  The only thing I would have liked is if it had a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mirror on the backside.  But it definitely does the job I hired it to do.</li>
    <li> The lighted mirror worked fine.  The short neck from the base to the lighted mirror made using it difficult.  I found a brushed metal lighted mirror with a longer neck for half the price at Costco.  I have returned this mirror and happy to write that Amazon.com has refunded my purchase.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Blindingly bright.  But bright is what I wanted.  Just hope it doesn&#x27;t damage my eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to help her put on makeup.  The light is great and mirror works fine.  The only problem we found was that you can&#x27;t see anything until you are about 12 inches away from the mirror.  Once you get very close, you can see VERY close, but anything beyond that distance, was blurry.  Not good for just a general upclose view.</li>
    <li> After using something similar in a hotel, I needed one of these.  It makes applying make up so much easier and accurate.  And, I don&#x27;t need my eye glasses!</li>
    <li> My wife loved the mirror so much that when her old one died (after 20+ years) I had to find one exactly like it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lighting! VERY EASY to apply make-up because of the magnification. I love this!!! It fits on my bathroom counter easily and doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all. It&#x27;s sufficiently weighted to not tip over. The white color makes it look nice and clean and its easy to wipe. The price was very reasonable. I believe it was an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I use this every day to put on my make up.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This mirror is the most incredible item I own! Cannot live without it!!! VERY bright.  You can see everything perfectly. Apply makeup flawlessly,  shape your brows, even get an eyelash out of your eye. Especially if you are over 50 and your vision isn&#x27;t all it used to be, you will be able to see and then some. Get it. You will be glad you did! !!</li>
    <li> Great mirror, I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my mother and it didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality mirror. Lighting is good. I ordered it a few months ago and decided to get a 2nd mirror as a gift.</li>
    <li> Best makeup mirror I have owned.  Super bright to see your entire face.  Love it.  Bought one for a gift at Christmas</li>
    <li> This mirror makes it very easy to see details close up and personal! I love it because I am middle aged and my eyes don&#x27;t see close details like they used to. It makes it really easy to put on eyeliner and where to put the concealer...! Once the light went out and my husband took it apart with ease, and replaced the bulb that he got from the local hardware. I highly recommend this mirror if you are wanting to see your skin up close, and in &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; light. It always look good after walking away from this mirror.</li>
    <li> wife wanted a good makeup mirror, I surprised her with this one , now she wishes she had it sooner,  made very well does not scratch easily</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for our needs.  we have plenty of counter space so the fact that is sits on the counter instead of a wall mount is no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The light provides plenty of light to see those little hairs etc you want to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;i had an loose eyelash that was under my eyelid and was very irritating, and i couldn&#x27;t see it in a regular mirror.  With this mirror i was able to see the lash and remove it safely.  The magnification is perfect and is a real help to see all my imperfections.</li>
    <li> This mirror is more than I expected. Great product!</li>
    <li> Every hair, pore, wrinkle, yikes! This is a great mirror. The light is bright as long as you are in a lit room, will not stand alone in the dark. It is lightweight but the base is heavy enough that it won&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
    <li> I would recommend mirror for some one needing a magnified and lighted mirror, bends to different angles and very sturdy</li>
    <li> This mirror was a great gift for the holidays! We had one in the past for decades before Super Storm Sandy came and swept it away! Great mirror only wish it was cordless! Super fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> the lighting is suffient not great. It ok . I am able to see the tiny hairs on eyebrow. so the mag is good</li>
    <li> No other mirror for us older folks.</li>
    <li> Purchased this one year ago as gift for mom and haven&#x27;t had to change bulb yet even with daily and nightly use. She wears glasses and can&#x27;t see without them, so putting on makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc is a chore. Due to super magnification, she doesn&#x27;t need her glasses to apply makeup. Some folks complain that they can only see one portion of face at time and can&#x27;t get the big picture. It&#x27;s no issue once you get used to it and a small sacrifice in order to have perfectly applied/one shot makeup. I&#x27;ve used it before and discovered that I actually am applying too much makeup due to the poor magnification and light from my old makeup mirror. The light is bright as well... Even with just the one setting. My old makeup mirror comes with three settings and isn&#x27;t as bright as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Truly makes for a great gift or to buy for yourself. Even if you already have the standard cosmo mirror that you love and are afraid to part with (that&#x27;s me), this mirror by its side will not go unused!</li>
    <li> I accidentally dropped my hairdryer against the mirror and broke the bulb inside (not the mirror, though). I ordered another and now see that I can order a replacement bulb for the old one, for about $21. I&#x27;m going to do that, and then I&#x27;ll have one for my boyfriend&#x27;s house. It really shows me what my pores and hairs are doing, especially with some reading glasses (optional). Great for eyebrows, controlling blackheads, etc. Once you&#x27;ve had a mirror like this, you won&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
    <li> The  Floxite Daylight Cosmetic Mirror, 10x Mag is a very good product!</li>
    <li> What a great mirror!!  Very bright light...let&#x27;s you see the tiniest details.  Wish it had other light settings and was a little more portable for traveling.  Other than that, if you want bright and close up detail, this is the mirror for you.</li>
    <li> Perfect Cosmetic Mirror!  This mirror is amazing.  The 10x maginification is perfect for plucking eyebrows, examining pores and complexion, and getting makeup just right.  The light is very bright but also soft on the eyes.  Not glaring and harsh like other mirrors.  Also it is nice and big.  Much bigger than it looks in the picture, and plenty big enough to see your whole face.  It is also very sturdy and seems well made.  Only downside is it is 10x, so obviously it cannot be your only mirror.  You also need a standard mirror to style your hair and also see your whole face at a distance to check balance.  I got a separate cosmetic mirror that has a 3x on one side and standard on the other side, which is good for doing my hair.  So i have both mirrors side by side on my vanity table.  But for makeup and facial care, this mirror is absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very good mirror with grat lighting</li>
    <li> I read All the reviews, &amp; Still Bought.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Glad I Did!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Very Pleased with Product &amp; Sellers Delivery!</li>
    <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the negative reviews which mostly seem to be from people who didn&#x27;t comprehend what they were buying.  The quality of this mirror is superb, and it is magnifies as described without distortion.  The light is excellent and mimics daylight.  Great find.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  It probably works best for people who wear glasses.  I could see that it might be too much if you don&#x27;t even need reading glasses.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror before and my niece loved it so much, that I gave it to her.  I had to get myself another.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Talk about magnification!  It is bright and you can see everything.  This mirror is for getting really close.  It you need a bright light and you need to see things up close and I mean really up close well this is the mirror for you.</li>
    <li> Saved over 15 dollars on this from what bed, bath, and beyond priced this at.  The lighting is wonderful, the magnification is awesome.  Very good looking mirror, and wont rust like my last one.</li>
    <li> I only use Floxite make-up mirrors. It&#x27;s distortion free and exactly what I ordered and expected. The 10x magnification allows me to see everything I need to see. When the eyesight goes, this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Plenty of magnification for everything you need!  Expensive, but worth it to me.  Actually bought second one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> This mirror was delivered to me 30 minutes ago.  I am so happy that my old mirror&#x27;s light went out, because this 10X mirror is superb.  I had purchased a similar mirror before, and taken it back, because the light was so dim.  Not with this mirror.  Because of the prior experience, I hesitated, but the lighting and the mirror are great.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t be without this for makeup application and for cleansing</li>
    <li> I had an old Floxite light bulb type mirror and it finally wouldn&#x27;t work anymore even with a new bulb; so I went online and found this one.  It is the new LED lighted mirror type plus it has a regular plug not the one with a big heavy plug in thing plus it magnifies 10X which I need.  The price was nice too compared to some other ones that I saw online.  Great buy and great mirror!</li>
    <li> Too magnified! Need to return. Good for impared vision.</li>
    <li> Great for close work, very bright lighting with no distortion.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Much larger than wanted. Sitting at a bath counter does not make this right even after adjusting. This mirror is also top heavy and 10X is not good enough for my mild prescription to have clear view.</li>
    <li> Wife REALLY loves this. You can really see everything, and the daylight bulb is perfect color temperature to see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also doubles as a nice desk or nightstand lamp anywhere while you are not grooming...</li>
    <li> This was absolutely the worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought from Amazon.  The magnification was so strong I had a very hard time even finding my face.  To look at a specific area it was necessary to close one eye and even then was unable to see anything clearly. The combination of the extremely bright light and intense magnification resulted in dizziness and rendered the mirror totally useless. I have no idea why this product has received such high ratings. I am looking for another mirror on Amazon as I have usually been very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a zero star rating.&lt;br /&gt;0 Stars</li>
    <li> Great lighting, mirror is useful and I like the ability to move to an angle that you need.  Negatives...design is very bland to almost looking cheap.  The feet on the bottom leave black marks so I used felt pads to stop that from happening.  I just can&#x27;t get excited about this product but it does do the job.</li>
    <li> Its an excellent product that does exactly what its supposed to. The plastic does make it seem a bit cheap but its held up well over the last year or so. The only downside is it makes you obsess over the size of your pores and all the minute imperfections of your face. I suppose that means that it does its job!</li>
    <li> Best Lighted Mirror with 10X Magnification&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something to be said for losing your close-up vision in your forties - you don&#x27;t see the makeup errors, lone hairs popping out of odd places, large pores, aging skin and discoloration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day you look in your rear view mirror with the daytime light casting on you at the perfect angle, and you GASP at the site of poor makeup blending, not enough coverage and the fact that you are growing a mustache and a beard! (Do I sound like I&#x27;m talking from experience? maybe....but no beard as of yet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when you realize that you need a much closer view with good light. This mirror has good lighting, 10X magnification and fantastic reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time that you lay eyes on yourself with 10X magnification will be SHOCKING! Magnification mirrors are a necessity after 40 in order to spare your friends, family and co-workers the sight of those ghastly hairs on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is 9 inches wide and perfect for plucking and makeup checks, and has good lighting to boot. I can recommend this one since I now have this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that you could avoid buying a mirror by only hanging out with people your own age since they can&#x27;t see up close either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT just for women - men may not have poor makeup blending, but they do have hairs popping out on their faces in places where the razor does not go</li>
    <li> This mirror is ONLY 10x magnification....if you don&#x27;t know what that looks like, then you probably don&#x27;t want this mirror.  You have to sit 3 inches from the mirror in order to see anything clearly because the magnification is so strong.</li>
    <li> There is too much gare when lit.</li>
    <li> It says no distortion but I have to get 3 inches away for reflection to come into focus, so close it is hard to get hand in between to do makeup, and only a tiny portion of face is visible, and it is scary distorted- makes my nose look like Pinocchio. Nice lite though.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and the quality is very good.  The magnification is excellent - no distortion or variation in the field of vision.  My only wish is that the mirror were a little bit larger so that I could see my entire face more easily.  But I&#x27;ve learned to work around that and am truly happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> If the light on this mirror were brighter, it would be fine.  But it is a little too dim for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror. The magnification is OK, but a little weird. Since this is the first such mirror I&#x27;ve bought, don&#x27;t know if this is normal, so won&#x27;t discount it on that. BIg problem is the lighting is totally insufficient. Tried it in the house-too dim. By the window on a sunny day-too dim. Outside on my porch on a sunny day-too dim. Finally held a small flashlight up to my face to have it lit well enough to pluck my eyebrows. This wasn&#x27;t easy, holding a flashlight in one hand. Now looking for a magnifying mirror with a light that is adequate. This one&#x27;s most definitely not.</li>
    <li> Great lighting, prefect magnification. It has a long cord so it can go any where. I would buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I just pushed the wrong button.  This mirror works great.  It&#x27;s more flexible that it&#x27;s predecessor.  Be careful not to leave it on too long as it is a fire hazard.  It will melt and burn from the inside.</li>
    <li> This light doesn&#x27;t generate enough light for what I needed.  It is also big and bulky--not at all acceptable for travel.  I was just disappointed in what I got for the money I spent.</li>
    <li> I have one of these that I purchased a couple years ago and I love it.  Wanted another one for a vacation home.  The quality has deteriorated quite a bit.  Weighs less than the original-very cheap feeling, mirror has a wavyness to it that mine does not and the light is different, not as bright.  Very disappointed and returned the product.</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror. I can see what needs to be &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; without taking reading glasses on and off.Would like the light to be brighter.</li>
    <li> This lighted mirror was a gift for one of my sisters and she loved it.  My other sister even tried it and thought it was perfect.  The light from the mirror was just right and the magnification perfect.  I&#x27;m going to get one for myself.</li>
    <li> This is quite a good vanity mirror and you can see all the&lt;br /&gt;eyebrow hairs and other things on your face.  A little prices&lt;br /&gt;but works ladies!</li>
    <li> Since turning 50, my eyes aren&#x27;t as good as they once were.&lt;br /&gt;This mirror gives the perfect amount of light and magnification that I need</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is ok, but it only reflects 10x nothing else &amp; for that price it should.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for seeing your entire face up close. The brightness of the light lets you see easily to pluck eyebrows...etc.  I highly recommend this mirror especially if you have trouble seeing in lesser light.</li>
    <li> The light is bright. You do have to put your face close to the mirror to see your eyebrows or whatever you need it for. I seen hair in places I didn&#x27;t know I had. You could possibly use it for makeup if you doing a dramatic look for your eyes. It would not be good to put on foundation. I love this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is great for plucking our eye brows and for tiny hairs for precision.  I didn&#x27;t read the full details when I ordered.  I was actually looking for a double sided mirror but this is great the close ups.</li>
    <li> This mirror is brighter than most makeup mirrors so it helps you to see all the little hairs on your face.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! The mirror is clear, the magnification is just right to see your face.</li>
    <li> light is too bright &amp; I wish it had a mirror with half of the magnification strength on the other side</li>
    <li> This was a great find.  The magnification is great and lighting is great. it works best if it sits on a table, a little more difficult to hold in your hand.</li>
    <li> I just had cataract surgery which enabled me to go from being extremely nearsighted to having almost normal vision.&lt;br /&gt;The down side to that was that I can no longer get really close to the mirror to put on my mascara.  I purchased this mirror and it magnifies 10x, which enables me to see what I am doing up close.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to purchase this item again for my friend for her birthday. I know she will love it!</li>
    <li> I mirror is great, love it, good price, looked all over for one and found it here.  Love the light</li>
    <li> This mirror is a plus for all of us daily make up girls.  You can leave it out or put it up.  I leave mine out.  It is the greatest.</li>
    <li> This mirror distorts everything outside the very middle. Basically, if you want to see the side of your face, good luck! If you are only interested in the area from your eyebrows to your chin, then it works. The light is not very bright. Seems to work best if you tilt it up towards the ceiling so your own lights can give you enough light to see.  I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… and I didn&#x27;t realize just how powerful 10x is!  My plan was to be able to see that one, maybe two, wild chin hairs… but no, I won&#x27;t even try to count them at this point.</li>
    <li> This is the best lighted makeup mirror I have seen. Many lighted mirrors are just night bright enough. This one is great. I also purchased a small 15x magnification suction cup mirror. I stick it on this mirror, and the light allows me to use the 15x for those tiny little hairs it&#x27;s hard to get. I&#x27;ve bought a second one after years of use because I broke it. I also bought one for a friend.</li>
    <li> This item is the second one in 12 years.Having others using it ,it has held up very well.It has met all of our needs so we felt it&#x27;s best  to stay with a sure thing.Some things one doesn&#x27;t want to change and this mirror it &amp;#34;the thing&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I returned this mirror, only the very center was clear, no way could you do your makeup with this.  I think it would only be good for tweezing eyebrows or putting on eye liner, the rest of it, forget it.  the light is super bright, that is the best thing about this mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great.  Daylight bright with a large 10 x mirror, but it&#x27;s not bulky. The shipping was right on time and it was packed properly. I bought 2.  One for my house and one for our motor home.</li>
    <li> As I age, my facial hair has really become a problem together with the fact that my close up eyesite isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  This solves the problem.  The combination of the magnification and the light allows me to see those things that need to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved!</li>
    <li> Love the mirror.  My family all have one.  I have purchased four of them.</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror to see every little thing in.  it is a little stiff when bending back but the angles it moves are very helpful.  dust and debris gets trapped at bottom of mirror and is hard to clean. overall an excellent buy and would recommend for use.</li>
    <li> If you need to see really close-up (be careful what you ask for!), this mirror does the trick. I would not advise it for normal makeup application or using as a mirror for viewing from a foot or two away. It is strictly a close-up mirror with good light for tweezing and that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> This is one of those items I wish I didn&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; to purchase....but with age....came some facial hairs that need this level of magnification to see so I can pluck away. I only wish it let me see my neck a little better.....a bit of distortion, but it&#x27;s better than another mag mirror my mom has so I think this is one of the best out there.</li>
    <li> Very good mirror for doing makeup and getting up close. Very bright light is great. If u can make urself look good in that light then you ll look good in any light. I had this mirror before and it broke on me. I searched for it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it in store. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, very bright light, i can see how to put my makeup on now .</li>
    <li> The light is nowhere bright enough. Returned same day and got the incandescent mirror instead.</li>
    <li> It really magnifies &amp; the lighting is perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect to get my contacts on!!!</li>
    <li> The best magnified lighted mirror I have ever owned. If this one ever breaks I will definitely get another one just like it!</li>
    <li> ease of use;&lt;br /&gt;magnifcation factor;&lt;br /&gt;construction (sturdy)&lt;br /&gt;replaceable bulb;&lt;br /&gt;source manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product and meets or exceeds expectations.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great to pluck your eyebrows, put on your makeup and see every flaw you have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to find the one that I dropped. This one is more substantial.</li>
    <li> I had one just like this before and it lasted for many years. Its great when getting older and not able to see as well as you used to.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror! You do see every single pore on your face! Has nice lighting. Great for applying eye make-up! If you don&#x27;t want to see every wrinkle/flaw in your face you may not want to order this mirror!</li>
    <li> The mirror was delivered and I immediately set it up. The mirror itself was too small for my liking and I could not focus. Between the magnification, lighting and the actual mirror size, I found it useless. I sent the mirror back the next day. Still searching for the right mirror. Too bad the light on the mirror I bought at Costco broke.</li>
    <li> The light is too bright. It knocks me out., The magnification is too big. I hate using it. If I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> Love the light! It is the right size and very bright.  My only wish is that there would be a reverse non-magnifying mirror, but overall it is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> One can see and address problems without glasses.  I&#x27;ve had mine for at least 12 years and purchased another one for a gift.  I can easily see to floss and clean my dental implant.  The light is not too bright - just right.  Couldn&#x27;t be without this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is not a make-up mirror. My husband got it for me as a gift. I don&#x27;t think he realized that the mirror could not be less than a 10x magnification. Therefore, you can&#x27;t see your whole face in it at all. One has to be very close to the mirror to even see a small part of the face clearly. Perhaps this would be good for eyebrow tweezing but this was not my need. I don&#x27;t need to see every pore in my face. I would not recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a gift from me to me. I really like the design. The package came quickly  nothing was wrong  with the unit. It magnifies ! I can see freckles, wrinkles and facial hair I didn&#x27;t know I had. I can also really see my eyebrows to pluck, which is why I ordered this in the first place. In the long run, its saving money to not spend it getting facial waxing.</li>
    <li> I have had more than a few makeup mirrors over the years.  This Floxite 10X is my favorite and this is the second one I have purchased.  The bulbs last about two years. You can order a replacement bulb and it is easy to install. Bright but flattering light and the magnification is perfect for senior eyes.  I also purchased the travel size which folds flat and is easy to pack. It sits low on the hotel bath counter but I like it better than the other travel mirrors I have tried.</li>
    <li> The curved shape of the mirror and high magnification makes this really difficult to use. Your face has to be about an inch from the glass to see clearly- too close to tweeze eyebrows or apply makeup. For the price, I wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
    <li> Good mirror - has lasted over 2 years and I use it almost daily. Just be warned - you&#x27;ll see EVERYTHING in this mirror.</li>
    <li> Super bright!! Be careful of the brightness.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> Love (and hate) this mirror.  You can see absolutely everything. Excellent for grooming brows, facial hair, etc.  Definitely serves its purpose for me.  HIghly recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just fine but I do miss very much having a regular mirror on the back side.  I am pleased with the purchase.  I also like the travel mirror.</li>
    <li> The magnification is great and the lighting is perfect, now I can see my eyebrows for tweezing! My last lighted mirror lasted 5 years and finally quit so I was happy to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> This has been a great mirror for the last 2 years.  No problems.  Amazing magnification!  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a mirror as good as this for a long time. Why I need six more words is a mystery to me</li>
    <li> I received this make up light yesterday. The box of the item was broken and faded. The mirror&#x27;s light didn&#x27;t work plus the item was sold as new but, it was used. Terrible condition. I returned this mirror.</li>
    <li> Wish I had this a long time ago!  It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it would be.  The 12x mirror I got in the supermarket was very tiny.  This is big and bright!  I see things I didn&#x27;t know were there :-O</li>
    <li> Best Make-up Mirror ever!!  Just remember you will see every imperfection - but that&#x27;s why this mirror is wonderful.  You can adjust your makeup for a perfect finish!!  Ever since I purchased my first Floxite mirror, I cannot imagine trying to get ready in the morning or whenever without it!</li>
    <li> It certainly brightens things up and magnifies, but it is so bright I&#x27;m not sure if it is so good for your eyes. I plan to ask my ophthamologist about it before using it again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror!  I can see so much better to apply my makeup!</li>
    <li> I cannot get a full view of my face. I need to get my face very close to mirror to see my face clearly, and I have to move my face around to see each spot of my face. I think the size of mirror should get bigger.  Otherwise it is not bad.  You should try this product in store first before you order it online.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lighted magnification mirror for travel but only when I drive to my destination, as it&#x27;s too bulky for air travel.</li>
    <li> Much better than the one I used for 10 years. It&#x27;s brighter with stronger magnification and has a larger base so it doesn&#x27;t tip over. Love it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought 3 for Christmas presents. Great magnifying mirror...</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mirror before.  The only reason I bought a new one was because I blew mine out in Europe. I didn&#x27;t have the correct adapter for it.  It has the bright light I need and magnification is clear; no distortion.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The magnification sweet spot on this mirror is amazing.  My husband complains when he passes by and says this mirror gives too much information.  LOL.  I can now see to put on my mascara since having eye surgery.  Was having a problem trying to hold a magnifying mirror and put on makeup.  The light is a real bonus.</li>
    <li> Great lighting and magnification.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!  Perfect for plucking eyebrows and doing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This is not for Applying Makeup...only for blemishes.... Great stand powerful light I have had this for 2 years and will never trade it for a different product....</li>
    <li> Although the cord is long, being corded is a bummer otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic mirror. The LED&#x27;s are very bright, the mirror is large and perfect to see a large area of the face. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirror, especially for plucking eyebrows. I&#x27;ve had mine for over two years now and if it broke, I would go buy another one tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Very good! This one it brighter than the last one I bought.</li>
    <li> I bought this lighted makeup mirror about a year ago and absolutely love it - once I got over being able to see every wrinkle and flaw on my face! The light is excellent, the size of the mirror is good and the magnification is so helpful for these 50 year old eyes. I often take it with me when I travel and the size is cumbersome for fitting in my suitcase, but I love it so much that I don&#x27;t like to go without it. You do need a special bulb but I have not had to replace it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Two years later and I still love it - so much so I bought another one to leave at my vacation home. My adult kids call it the &amp;#34;ugly mirror&amp;#34; because you can see EVERY little imperfection on your face. I&#x27;ve not had to replace the bulb yet.</li>
    <li> love this mirror very clear  perfect/////</li>
