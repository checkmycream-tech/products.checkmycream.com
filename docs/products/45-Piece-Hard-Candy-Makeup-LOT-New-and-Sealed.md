      <li>I am mostly satisfied.</li>

<li> purchased these as bonus gifts/stocking stuffers to distribute amongst a few different friends for christmas, but I&#x27;ve already added another to my cart for later for myself!</li>
<li> I&#x27;d probably get way less next time</li>
<li> it was a total waste of my money!</li>
<li> There was hardly anything in the package that I will actually wear</li>
<li> were too dark</li>
<li> They even threw in a few extras.</li>
<li> and I am pretty disappointed about this...</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Beyond thrilled with the assortment. It just came in and this is better than Christmas morning!  Recommended it to many of my friends</li>

    <li> Got my package today and love love it great colors all products new awesome deal thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> It was awesome, got a great variety of very nice stuff, would have been sooooooo expensive sperately and it was fun getting stuff I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to buy, but will now wear! I&#x27;ll do this again!</li>
    <li> I got this to share with my daughter we loved it it did have a lot of duplicates and messed up products but she like them still and we just split them up so that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 otherwise it would will be buying this again</li>
    <li> It clearly says MAKEUP, now I&#x27;m going to school for makeup so I ordered this in hope is get a variety of MAKEUP.. I did get a lot of makeup but I also recieved 7-10 different nail polishes. Nail polish is not makeup I could have used 7-10 more items of assorted makeup which is what I thought I was buying.. But that&#x27;s not all 2 eye shadows were opened and hand a finger smear and two eye liners were broke. Completely unable to use so now in total there&#x27;s 7-14 items that I cannot use and will not use for this price I expected a lot more than I recieved.. Very upset I paid for items im not even goin to use</li>
    <li> Loved the variety. Loved the shipping speed. However, i only received 37 products. Its still a good deal but i was expecting 45 items not 37.</li>
    <li> WOW. just received my box, a day early. 49 pieces total...only one thing was a double, and I don&#x27;t even mind because the color of the eyeshadow is AWESOME! Maybe 3 things in the entire box that I won&#x27;t personally use, but that&#x27;s fine, they can just go in my work makeup kit.  Will be ordering another box on Thursday to start building my work kit now that I have PLENTY of personal makeup!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> They were all new and unused, I would definitely buy again! they are good products too!</li>
    <li> I did not like the product I recieved the foundations were too dark and I recieved several of the same products same color everything! There was hardly anything in the package that I will actually wear it was a total waste of my money! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This had a nice selection of everything.  It really depends on which vendor you order from as to what you seem to get.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t received duplicates,  but to avoid that I was told you have to stay with the 25 piece lot.  It had some great neutral pruducts as well as some of the crazy colors that Hard  Candy is known for.  Overall I would highly recommend this to any woman,  especially those with teenage daughters.  Or those who just want to experiment with lots of different kinds of makeup.</li>
    <li> Exactly what advertised as</li>
    <li> I am so happy with everything i was sent. So many colors and yet nothing i wouldn&#x27;t wear i also asked for light tones and received just light colors no dark so it was perfect. And they added some extras on top of the 45 so it was about 50 pcs thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Loved it great mix and they even added a few extra pieces</li>
    <li> Just got the items in today and all is awesome!!! I also received 50 items!!! very happy with my purchase and im sure my litte sister will LOVE her Christmas gifts ;)</li>

    <li> Omg i love it if came pretty quick everything was new and sealed and I even had some extras tooo like omg it sooo your money worth I will be buying again trust me</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.I am mostly satisfied. I receive 45 pieces more than half of it being double tripple and even 6 of the samething.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much ordered it again !</li>
    <li> Excellent lots .. I loved everything .. highly recommended ..</li>
    <li> 22 out of the 45 were duplicates and I am pretty disappointed about this... but for what I did get I liked just wished I had more color the majorities were brown.... I&#x27;d probably get way less next time</li>
    <li> Yes this is excellent quality makeup and I will order from them again sometime in the future</li>
