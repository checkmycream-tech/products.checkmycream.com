<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too thick and pasty for me, and didn&#x27;t really solve my super-dry lip problem</li>
    <li> It really does work. I have the worst peeling lips and this stuff really works. I will say that I agree with others that you need to use it at night. It&#x27;s thick like a lotion and white. Don&#x27;t wear it out in the daytime if you don&#x27;t want others to look at you funny. I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. The texture and color of my lips has improved. You do need to continue to use it but I have noticed that I can space it out once I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks. I have never used the burn lip cream but this works better than just regular chapstick. It does not have a weird smell or taste.</li>
    <li> Seems like just a high priced Blistex.  Very thick and white, which is fine, but didn&#x27;t do anything special to my lips.</li>
    <li> The Best! Makes your lips feel like velvet!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!  It&#x27;s all I wear anymore!</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on a review in a magazine two years ago and have used nothing else since. No over the counter lip balm works as well. Put it on in the morning under lipstick or lipgloss and it lasts all day. It hydrates so well, I think it makes my lips look fuller too, which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> sorry I purchased, a waste of $s, way too thick and stings my lips.</li>
    <li> BEST lip therapy on the market, hands down. I can not live without this stuff. I apply it every night at bedtime and it works like a charm. When I travel, I am always certain I have a tube of this packed. It is worth every penny to me and I have thrown the other 30 tubes I have in the trash. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just ok, not any better than your average store bought burts bees or any other</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm that I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent lip balm.  It&#x27;s very thick and stays in place all night.  I would love a version of this without the menthol, but it&#x27;s still great for dry lips!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my lips. It makes them so soft and they look sexy ;) My BF picks on me for spending $13 on \\&quot;chap stick\\&quot; (while he suffers with chapped lips), but let me tell you it&#x27;s SO WORTH THE MONEY! People spend $10-30 on lipstick/lip balm in the department stores and that stuff just dries your lips out. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! I&#x27;m addicted for life :D Also, you don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts long!</li>
    <li> Great item. Works every time</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry cracking lips for most of my adult life. Just about tried everything. This is a miracle in a tube!!!! Used it last night for the first time and I woke up with soft lips. I can visible see the areas healing. Love it!! It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It goes on smooth with a slight tingly sensation. I have an issue with constant dry, chapped lips and this is a life saver!</li>
    <li> Update- it has been several tubes and several dry winters since I first reviewed this glorious, magical stuff. And it&#x27;s still the only thing that will actually make my lips heal, instead of all the blistex/carmex/vasoline/whatever type products, that do indeed make them feel nice when on, then wear off quickly and dry your lips out more as they do. Totally worth the price, I don&#x27;t even hesitate to re-order when low, I use it every night. Sometimes I&#x27;ll misplace it or go on vacation without it (which is crazy, don&#x27;t get on an airplane without this stuff!) and always, always regret it and come running back. Cost has nothing to do with a product being good or bad, my favorite &amp;#34;daytime lip product&amp;#34; is a pot of ELF tinted balm that costs $3. If it works, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never detected much of scent, and am usually sensitive to &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; coverup chemical smells and such. Some don&#x27;t like it, that&#x27;s fine, but it hardly means the product is ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a crack in my lip that would NOT go away. It just kept re-opening over and over, no matter what products I slathered on. Three days of this and it is HEALED. I don&#x27;t care for the menthol-y scent, but it&#x27;s not as strong as say, Carmex, and doesn&#x27;t last. This will never leave my bedside table!</li>
    <li> One of the best overnight lip balms I have used and actually I use it during the day. It is thick but that&#x27;s what you want when your lips are chapped so it stays on for extended period of time. Worth the buy and lasts awhile!</li>
    <li> I think this balm was a bit over-hyped. It doesn&#x27;t heal as advertised(unless you constantly are using it) and it&#x27;s a small tube.</li>
    <li> I have chronically chapped lips. It&#x27;s not like this completely eliminates the problem but I do love it. So much so that when my first one came in I decided I needed a backup and have already ordered another. It has camphor in it so it&#x27;s kind of tingly, similar to Carmex. It&#x27;s thicker, like a gel gloss, but not totally disgusting and that&#x27;s just at application. Within a few minutes it will even out. I love it so much that I use it in the day too but when I put it on at night I can still feel it there in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this some more I have to say that it actually DID completely eliminate my problem. I do not EVER suffer from chapped lips anymore. Truly amazing. Never in my life have I found a product that could do this for me.</li>
    <li> Love how smooth it glides on, tingling is nice too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for about 15 years. It is hands down the best for treatment of chapped or dry lips !  I&#x27;m so glad I can continue to purchase it from Amazon</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only thing that gets me through the winter in New England.  I gave it to all my sisters and they swear by the stuff as well.</li>
    <li> I had a period of 2 weeks where my lips hurt and felt tight....not cracked but just all around sore. Started using This at night along with another product during the day and it has made a world of difference!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm but due to the price, I will only purchase in the winter months. It also the reason I gave it four, not five stars. It&#x27;s pricey for a tube a lip moisturizer although effective. Rest of the year I purchase Burt&#x27;s Bees. Is fine for spring, summer and fall seasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and my lips are never chapped. This is the best lip balm on the market. It may cost more but it&#x27;s worth it. And each tube lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to reorder this... Seriously best lip cream, I&#x27;ve tried them all</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype. I thought this would be a great solution during Chicago winters. It&#x27;s ok. It moisturizes about as well as carmex. Though it&#x27;s not quite as effective against the wind. I find carmex or Vaseline to better all around and more economical.</li>
    <li> Its truely amazing! Its the only stuff that works...pretty creamy so, I put it on every night and leaves my lips moist never dry.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry chapped lips for 20+ years.  I have tried all kinds of lip balms, ointments creams, etc.  I would wake in the night from dry lips and have to re-apply but with Qtica I put it on at bedtime and never wake to re-apply.  Awesome moisture and well worth the money.  I buy several tubes at a time to keep my purse and bedside stocked at all times, I never want to run out.</li>
    <li> Every claim is absolutely true!</li>
    <li> Fake Product! The box says &amp;#34;Lip Repair Balm&amp;#34; but the container inside the box says &amp;#34;Lip Therapy Balm&amp;#34;. I can find no record of &amp;#34;Lip Therapy Balm&amp;#34; associated with Qtica. Note: My photo shows 4 because I ordered 4, the default order size is 1.</li>
    <li> I use this daily- winter, summer, fall, spring, i dont care the season, i just love how this feels, how it NEVER leaves my lips dry, how it actually solves flacking and dryness, it actually moisturizes my lips from within- so even if i skip a day or a week my lips NEVER go back to being as dry as they used to be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not get through winter without this. Lanolin is just amazing and because of the miracle i saw this work on my lips i now use lanolin on my cuticles and hands and everywhere else where a dry skin might pop up. HIGHLY REC THIS.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever used. My lips stay soft and moisturized with 3 applications a day.</li>
    <li> Heals lips overnight like no other balm!</li>
    <li> I discovered Qtica Lip Repair at my manicurist&#x27;s table. She swore by it, and I tried it. The tiny amount that is dispensed from the opening means that it will last, without drying up, for a long time. I have several tubes of Lip Repair around my house, handbag and travel bag. I have given it as a gift to appreciative friends.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm!</li>
    <li> It is just okay.  I wouldn&#x27;t special order it again, as there are products that work for me in the local stores.</li>
    <li> This is ok lip balm, but nothing special. It does not fix my painful chapped lips, but has something that makes me focus on the tingling (not unpleasant, kind of like menthol) rather than my chapped lips. However, I do not like this lip balm because it goes on white and stays white for a while. White lips is not a flattering look.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a little thick, but not thick enough to actually have other people notice I&#x27;m wearing anything out of the ordinary. I haven&#x27;t found another balm since that repairs my lips as well as this.</li>
    <li> You guys. I never everrrr write reviews for anything but I have been so amazed and baffled by this product that I felt compelled to this time. I am convinced this stuff is made out of straight up MAGIC. I have been having an issue with my lips for months and months on end now; they have been chronically, drastically dry with no end in sight. The reviews for this balm looked promising so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Within a couple days my lips have finallyyyyyy become normal again. My lips had repeat dry patches in 3 prominent places that have finally somehow smoothed out due to this product. Buy it ASAP and tell all your friends. THEY HAVE FOUND THE CURE TO CHAPPED LIPS!!!!</li>
    <li> I have serious issues with dry/cracked lips. It&#x27;s refreshing to find a lip balm that can keep things under control. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I had severely chapped lips and I read the reviews on this one. I am glad I purchase it and will purchase again. My lips feel way better!</li>
    <li> I really like the staying power of this balm and the texture is smooth &amp; not too sticky.  The thing I really dislike is the extremely strong menthol...it tastes awful for the first few minutes &amp; is irritating to my lips.  I wish Qtica would. make the same balm without the menthol.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite chap stick! It really softened my cracked lips.</li>
    <li> I have tried every lip balm under the sun for my chronically chapped lips.  Read the positive reviews for this and hoped they weren&#x27;t written by marketers for Qtica.  I am very happy with this product.  I apply it at bedtime and within a few days, my lips were much, much smoother.  They are no longer chapped at all, after using it for less than a month.  I wish I had this product years ago, and will be keeping it in supply as long as it is being made.  I can think of nothing negative to say, except that I can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> Perfect lip healer and moisturizer , worth the money because you don&#x27;t really use a lot and the product lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I live in the Sonoran Desert.  It is so dry here, you can watch rain falling from the sky evaporate before it hits the earth.  Due to the extreme dryness, I have to keep my lips moisturized 24 hours a day.  I have tried every chap stick/lip balm I could find. This is the ONLY one that keeps my lips moisturized throughout the night.  Until I found this product, my lips would dry out and wake me up in the middle of the night in discomfort.  So every night of sleep was interrupted, just because I couldn&#x27;t find decent lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Qtica costs more than a tube of Chapstick, but it&#x27;s thicker, creamier, and stays where you put it.  And for me, being able to sleep through the night, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, so its worthy of its stars.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever! I have a bad habit of licking and chewing on my lips to point where they peel/crack. But helped them start healing the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This a very thick, balm that goes on white but once you rub your lips together it&#x27;s looks clear and makes your lips look so healthy. I love the tube applicator as opposed to a jar that I have to dip my fingers in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this stuff 24/7, under my lipstick or lip gloss. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more to keep in my car, desk, purse etc. Thank you Qtica</li>
    <li> Very excited to share the news that this stuff REALLY DOES work!! I bought a tube for myself and one for my husband, and within a few days we both were convinced that we saw a huge and positive difference in the condition of our lips. Our convictions remain several weeks later, and we will be loyal customers in winters to come. Worth every penny! -- a product that does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. If my lips are feeling dry or are peeling really bad, I put this stuff on at night and wipe my lips with a warm wet cloth in the morning... Perfection! My lips are then so soft and smooth. I&#x27;m about to order more when I finish typing this. Also, it lasts a good while ~6 months with almost daily use. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> The product works well but has a strong smell and taste after being applied.&lt;br /&gt;The texture also is too greasy, making it uneasy to use on working hours for example.&lt;br /&gt;For reference, ingredients are: Lanolin, water, Cpryllic/capric Triglyceride, Beeswax, Glycerin, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Mnethol, Camphor, Tcopheryl Acetate, Corn Oil, Retinyl Palmitate, Panthenol, Aloe Vera Gel, Laureth-4, Sodium Borate, Methilparaben, Propylparaben, BHA.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate, and have tried every lip balm over the years.  This product stays on, and I no longer have to deal with cracked, peeling lips.  Highly recommend this product. (Use only a pin head)!</li>
    <li> I have used blistex lip balms for years but decided to try this for excessive dryness and peeling.  It feels good going on, but then so does blistex- but for something called &#x27;intense relief&#x27; i see no difference.&lt;br /&gt;What I prefer to use now is Lush Sweet Lips lip scrub and then blistex or elta md sunblock for lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was worth a try but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a longtime lip balm addict. I have everything from Chapstick and Baby Lips to La Mer and Dior in my collection, and everything in between. I always at least 3 or 4 options in my purse. I&#x27;ve tried it all! About 2 months ago, I started Accutane and within the first two days my previously pampered pout went from soft and plump to dry, cracked, and flaky. No matter how much lip balm I applied, they still got so dry and cracked that they even bled one day. I tried everything; Aquaphor, Bite Beauty&#x27;s lip mask, olive oil, straight up Vaseline. I spent most days reapplying lip balm 20 times a day. Then a few days ago I got this. At first I didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s SUPER thick, almost sticky, and has a whitish look. I wasn&#x27;t able to blend it in the first night I wore it, so I just slathered it on generously and my lips immediately began to feel better. It was kind of gross because the flakiness of my lips made it pretty messy but whatever, I was going to bed. The following morning I still woke up to dry lips, but not as bad a usual. After going through my morning skincare routine I figured I&#x27;d try again, except this time I exfoliated my lips to reduce the flakes, and patted the product on lips instead of trying to smear it. It&#x27;s definitely a little tricky to work with, but it stays put and you feel like your lips are actually healing underneath. Since then I have not been without it. I have also used Dr. Dan&#x27;s Cortibalm, but since that has cortizone (a steroid) in it, I can only use it 2 or 3 times a day. The Cortibalm really helped but it wasn&#x27;t long-lasting. I feel like doing Dr. Dan&#x27;s a couple of times per day, and alternating with the Qtica has really rescued my lips. I still don&#x27;t think I can wear my favorite matte lipstick, but I definitely don&#x27;t have the crusty lips I was struggling with just a few days ago. A MUST-HAVE, especially if you&#x27;re dealing with accutane lips!</li>
    <li> I rarely finish a beauty product before it spoils, but this is my third tube of Qtica lip balm. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm is intended for use in conjunction with tanning beds, so it&#x27;s powerful stuff. I don&#x27;t tan, but it works well for other lip problems. You know that painful red ring around the mouth you get when you&#x27;re on day three of a head cold, and you are a mess from chin to nose? This balm fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and has a white sheen once applied, so I use it only at bedtime. When eating and speaking, people tend to inadvertently eat most of their lip product, so I prefer organic balms for day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like chap sticks that have the cooling effect. This one has that and did not specify that. Very annoyed.</li>
    <li> The only lip balm I&#x27;ll ever use. I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes and have one in my nightstand and one in my purse and at least one backup at all times. I can&#x27;t live without it. Seriously. I&#x27;ve tried so many lip balms over the years and have battled extremely dry, cracking and peeling lips through all of them. This is the only thing that has truly healed them. It&#x27;s miracle stuff.</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm!  The quality/value was vastly superior to more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have very dry lips since I have been on accutane, this is the only lip balm that stays on and that actually moisturizing my lips.  You can even drink water and brush your teeth and you still have the balm on your lips.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most amazing lip balm I have ever used. (and I have used a LOT of lip balm!) It is thick and luxurious - and it lasts so much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s hard to get out of the tube when it&#x27;s not warm enough (it&#x27;s a thick formula) but once on the lips it&#x27;s heaven!</li>
    <li> oh so satisfied . heals lips really fast . lips looks so moisturized, healthy, and supple ! yes its white but just rub in sufficiently .</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this repairing lip balm, as living in Utah with a dry and freezing winter has destroyed my lips. Nevertheless, upon repeated use of this product my lips are just as chapped and damaged as they were before. When using the product at night it feels like all it did was sit on my lips during the hours I slept, as I wake up feeling the thick moisture still sitting on my lips (I would hope that a balm that promises to repair lips would do its job effectively) -- after a shower and reapplying the product I experience the same thing, only to find my lips continuing to look horrible and hurt once the balm was removed due to drinking or eating. Not worth the money and definitely does not bring the healing that it advertises. Use your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I love it. I feel it, see it and believe it to actually work!</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick…very thick. I use it at night before bed and let it sit while I sleep, I love it. I have been using it since the weather is getting a bit more dry and cold and it&#x27;s amazing. If you are into thicker balms and like the feeling, you will like this. If you don&#x27;t like the feeling of stuff on your lips, this might not be for you. The scent is interesting as well. It is a cross between Vaseline and Carmex. Personally, I love it but some people might not which I noticed some reviews stated it has an awful smell. I don&#x27;t think so, but everyone is different. So, overall, if you want a heavy balm that will make your lips feel hydrated and don&#x27;t mind thicker balms, then you will like it.</li>
    <li> This winter has been especially harsh on my lips. I have spent a mini fortune trying to find something to soothe my severe cracked, peeling lips. From chaptstix, to blistex, to Neutrogena, to home remedies, to MAC, you name it I had tried it all. Last week I was at my wits end and I saw several reviews on Amazon and went for it. I received my Qtica lip balm yesterday and I applied right away and again right before bed. OMG!!! I was able to wear Matt lipstick today! This is incredible. I also ordered a lip exfoliator from smoochies to take away the dead skin but this product by far did the trick!</li>
    <li> i love the qtica lip repair balm as it has been better than any lip balm i&#x27;ve ever tried.  when i received this product online from pure essence health, the box said lip repair balm (looked legit) but the lip balm inside said lip therapy balm.  the ingredients on the box were totally different from what was listed on the actual lip balm.  the 1 star rating is not for the actual legit product.  it is for buyers to be aware of the fake product that you could receive.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this stuff.  My lips are generally chapped all winter, but when I put this on at night, I can get through the whole next day with nothing else.  It&#x27;s pretty thick and white, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My lips get so chapped they split and because this is so thick, it really stays on where you need it.</li>
    <li> Best and only lip balm I use. Never have dry chapped lips again. This balm is not greasy or stick and leaves a nice healthy shine. One can even apply lipstick or gloss over it.</li>
    <li> Good for chapped lips.  A little expensive.  A good moisturizer for the lips.  Some might think it is too heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had severe chapped lips including cracked, red, swollen skin at the corners of my mouth. I was getting desperate for relief. This lip cream finally healed my skin after a year of trying different products and seeing my doctor about it. It&#x27;s wonderful! If your lips are white after application, you are using too much. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> not much better than plain old chapstick - which is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where to begin but after years of Minnesota winters I had given up hope that anything would stop my dry, cracking, and often peeling lips from hurting until I found this stuff! Move over carmex, this stuff is the truth! I buy it in pairs now and apply it each and every night before I go to bed. It will work! It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on thick and white but if you put it on every night before bed in a mere 2-3 days you&#x27;re lips will be soft and supple like their brand new! I guarantee it! This stuff is absolutely magically. No nasty minty smell or menthol feeling either!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  It works great and stays on all night.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I live in Nevada and the climate is very dry here. If you don&#x27;t have a good lip balm in the winter time, your lips become an absolute disaster of a chapped mess! Thanks to this stuff, I can live to kiss another day! Get some. Your kissers deserve it! :D</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite of mine as well as my family&#x27;s for several years now.  We use it year round especially at night.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm. My lips peel and bleed constantly. This is nice and thick and really lasts on the lips. It goes on white but once it rubs in the white doesn&#x27;t show. You can put gloss or lipstick over it. My only complaint is that it is a tiny bit pricey and it hasn&#x27;t completely rid me of peeling. You really have to keep it up for it to continue to work. But so far it is the best I have found. Will update if I ever find anything better or if eventually my peeling completely disappears.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best lip balm on the market. It csn be used for so msny things. Love the little glimmer it gives off.</li>
    <li> I have lip issues year round and have tried so many different products and homemade remedies. Nothing has worked for me, until now. I could feel a difference the first time I used it. My fiancé is constantly telling me how soft my lips are now. It is super thick, so a little goes a long way. I plan on keeping an extra tube on hand just so I never run out. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Love this! only product I have found that works so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this balm for years. Mostly at night, or during the day if it&#x27;s a dry environment. My lips are never chapped. Never dry. Never cracked.  Always soft and plump. One morning my boyfriend woke me up and kissed me. He said my lips were so soft he almost couldn&#x27;t feel them....like cotton candy. He still says that. I&#x27;m 57 years old. That&#x27;s a lot of kisses</li>
    <li> THE BEST LIP BALM EVER. Last for hours and even over night if I put it on right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick so a little goes a long way. If you are hesitating because of the cost...trust me...I suffer every single fall with chapped lips that do not seem to want to heal...When I started using this..that was no longer a problem for me and I have literally tried everything else out there.</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips moist and smooth for hours.  I noticed a major difference after one day of use.  By far the best lip therapy I have used and I have  tried several.</li>
    <li> I really like how thick and minty this balm is! Perfect to keep by the bed and wear overnight. Makes lips soft</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for dry, cracked lips. Goes on real thick - like lipgloss but works magic. This isn&#x27;t your regular chapstick, this is heavy-duty repair genius in a tube.</li>
    <li> My lips have been dry and chapped for half my life.  Over the past 15 years I have had to carry chapstick with me at all times (I never leave home without it) because my lips need it all the time.  In the winter the skin on my lips peels and flakes off.  Its embarrassing and painful.  This stuff however works great.  It is very thick, but you would expect it to be in order to work.  I use it before bed but also have to use it a few times a day (better than 10-12 times a day with Eucerin, Neutrogena or Vaseline lip balm).  Now if I only I could wear lipstick (I don&#x27;t think my lips will ever be repaired to that point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I came across this by chance at my salon, as there was a sample tube and q-tips at the counter to give it a try. Living in MN and it being the dead of winter, my lips were beyond dry. Never one to pass up a free sample, I swabbed it on and went back to my stylist&#x27;s chair for my cut. I forgot I had the balm on while my stylist chatted me up, but as I was in my car on the way home I noticed my lips were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum. I ordered it off of Amazon soon after I got home. I usually put it on while I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning and at night before bed, and my lips have been nothing but butter since.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lip balms over the years and this is the best of the best. It soothes and remains on much longer than others I have used. It is pricey but worth the added cost.</li>
    <li> I would HIGHLY recommend! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, smells medicinal like blister</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Qtica&#x27;s cuticle repair oil before, so I had high expectations for this. It did not disappoint! I have probably the driest lips ever, they flake and they crack open and especially now that it&#x27;s the winter, it gets pretty painful. I used this for one day, and didn&#x27;t see much change. I was kind of disappointed, but by day 3 it was incredible how much this stuff had worked!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed better results when I did a few things. I exfoliated my lips lightly, got the dead skin off and that seemed to help. I also recommend putting this on before you go to bed, it works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry lips like me, you need this in your life. Qtica never disappoints!</li>
    <li> i love this lip balm although i really only wear it at night because it is super thigh but it is a really good moisturizer for your lips it works great in the winter</li>
    <li> Best friend in dry winter months!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip healing chapstick/balm I have ever used and I have tried a lot of stuff to get rid of cracking and peeling lips. I love this one and since it&#x27;s really thick you don&#x27;t need a lot so mine lasted a long time! I Definitely think its worth it!</li>
    <li> Yeah, I believe it’s fake or probably expired. The sticky white label applied over the package box, with an expiration date printed on it - 3 years from 2016 doesn’t imply its genuineness. The colour of the balm is white, and embraces a thick texture, which in turn also makes it difficult to spread. After a couple of minutes upon applying the balm, you’d be itching to go and wash it off!! It leaves behind a very repulsive reaction on your lips.. NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Especially during the winter months when my lips tend to be more dry. I put Qtica Intense Lip Therapy Balm on my lips at night and wake up and it has soaked in and my lips are extremely moisturized. This is my lip rescue remedy. Even when I&#x27;m doing massages (I&#x27;m a licensed Massage Therapist) I will add some with my facial massage sequence. I love this stuff. Its thicker than a normal lip remedy. That&#x27;s why I only use it at night. A little goes a long way. Also, another great point is that I have had this stuff for a couple months now and it still seems really full.</li>
    <li> Lips are smooth, no cracks, moistures them very well. I use this daily and nightly. Love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing lip treatment. One of the best</li>
    <li> This product is ok...its kind of like a thicker blistex lip balm. I mainly use it at night to keep my lips from drying out. For 6 bucks its a good buy, i just wish it did more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and was thrilled to find it for half the price I&#x27;d always paid in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dry, cracked lips my entire life, and have tried many, many products. Finding this so long ago was amazing. Instead of having to apply it all day, multiple times...I apply it at night only. My lips have never been softer, and they feel fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is tired of spending money on any other products that you have to reapply over and over, this is for you! PLUS...one tube of this lasts for SO LONG. Even when I&#x27;ve gone on trips to drier climates, and apply it more often, it lasts for MONTHS. Try saying that about some $4-$5 stuff you can get at a drugstore that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, try this...you won&#x27;t regret it. You&#x27;ll love it too, I promise. :) (Also...ALL of the Qtica products are awesome...my feet are awful too, and the creams they make are just as fantastic.)</li>
    <li> The best of all my lips were dry and peeling ,after one application I could feel and see the difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome lip balm that keeps my list feeling good for many many hours.</li>
    <li> It does make your lips super soft but it smells like carmex fyi</li>
    <li> In the fall and winter, I get very chapped, cracked lips.  It started early this year and I have an interview next week, and nothing was getting rid of the crack in front.  My lips just kept peeling, cracking, bleeding and being gross.  I wanted something thick that would heal my lips, and this did it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for a temporary fix but hasn&#x27;t done any wonders for my lips.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lip conditioners I hve used.  I t goes on smoothly, keeps lips smooth and moist and has a nice fragrance.  I use this lip balm at night.</li>
    <li> This goes on so thick, but I adore it!! Great to lather on at night, but I use it all day, I love the feeling :)&lt;br /&gt;A little pale in color but I just put a little gloss on top &amp; its perfect!</li>
    <li> This is my Holy Grail lip balm. It&#x27;s thick, has a strong mint tingle without being completely overpoweringly minty tasting and smelling like Burt&#x27;s Bees, which is why I had strayed from Burt&#x27;s Bees in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thickness of this balm is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t look or feel goopy to me, at least not any more than any other lip balm, and if you&#x27;re a compulsive lip fiddler and press them together absentmindedly like I do, this balm will last TRULY for hours. No reapplying every hour or two. Even when using a water bottle that has a sport top. Even in super dry Utah air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is everything I ever wanted in a lip balm, and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try. I&#x27;ll never use anything else ever again!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my Qtica lip repair in the mail. The first day I used it my lips felt so much better. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and enjoying it. Only draw back is it dries out too quickly. But overall good product!</li>
    <li> I have always had chapped lips all the time, no matter what i do or dont do. I was a little skeptical at first, but the first night i wore this, i woke up with soft healthy and NOT chapped lips! i dont think it is too thick to wear for every day use, when you first put it on it seems to be thick, but evens out in a few minutes very nicely. i think this is the same stuff as the lansinoh....</li>
    <li> While this is a good balm, it is not worth $10. It&#x27;s as good as any squeezable lip balm, honestly. Save your money and get something like Carmex or Burt&#x27;s Bees. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase but I won&#x27;t buy it again unless the price drops to about $5 or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels like really thick lip gloss and it&#x27;s kind of hard to spread on your lips. My lips are flaky, so once the flakes mixed with the goop it felt really gross. It&#x27;s also mentholated, so it may sting if your lips are really sore or raw. After using it every night for a few weeks, I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. I did find that it works well when exfoliating my lips. Just slather it on, and massage your lips with a warm, wet washcloth to remove the flakes. It also worked pretty well as a base under lipstick...but I already have less expensive products for those purposes. In all, I was pretty underwhelmed.</li>
    <li> The ad says it contains mint, tea tree oil and honey.  Guess what?  NONE OF THAT is on the label. (You can&#x27;t call camphor or menthol mint nor tea tree oil.)  I checked out the chemical names on the label (which by the way is impossible to see anywhere online).  In my opinion, this is purposefully FALSE advertising and the FDA should be looking into this product.</li>
    <li> A true life-saver for my EXTREMELY chapped lips. They go from chapped and discolored, to plump and healthy looking within minutes. My advice, stay hydrated throughout the day, and keep this handy. Let it absorb into the skin, there is no need to rub it in. Go on with your life, Thank you Qtica, you have given me my confidence back!</li>
    <li> So I am on a medication that insanely dries out my skin and this is the ONLY product that keeps my lips from turning into a giant racked and peeling mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It super thick and does not go on clear, so in normal circumstances,its not really great for day wear as someone pointed out. But since my lips fall apart without it, I am willing to tough through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE:&lt;br /&gt;Do not let this product melt or get hot, because its completely ruined. The ingredient separates and it won&#x27;t reform the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my one complaint about the Shipping. I live in Arizona, and when I ordered this in JUNE (ie, its self evident that its hot), they sent it to me without any climate controlled packaging and it was completely ruined when it got to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve reported it to them, and essentially there is nothing they can do about that, so if you live in a place above say 90degrees, I would not recommend ordering from Amazon. Sad to say because I love this site, but they just can&#x27;t handle this issue.</li>
    <li> I ordered the lip balm and they sent me the one for the nail, totally not happy, plus it did not smell good either, so wrong item, and smelly one, ugh..</li>
    <li> It is not worth the money for a lip balm.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything special.  Hard to go on your lips and doesn&#x27;t last even one hour.  Even Carmax does better job.</li>
    <li> This saved my lips from the historically wretched winter we have been experiencing. Soft and kissable lips are what I want. Now I have them again! Thank you! Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. I use lip balm ALL the time, so I have tried so many different kinds!! And this is the winner!! If I put it on at night before bed, my lips still feel moist in the morning!! I&#x27;ve never had that with any other product!! It&#x27;s kind of thick but not if you just put on enough to coat your lips. It also has a cool feeling to it which is refreshing. Not a &amp;#34;burning, my lips are on FIRE&amp;#34; kind of feeling!! It&#x27;s actually just the opposite. Just try it!! It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say but it works. My lips are chronically chapped, dry, and it is constantly peeling. Very unattractive. I hate having to re-apply my lip balm over and over throughout the day. With this product, I use it once before bed everyday and my lips stay soft, smooth, and perfect all day. Amazing!</li>
    <li> very thick and sticky i didnot like this at all i was hoping it would be better but too sticky and thick</li>
    <li> While this lip balm is adequate, it has a sticky consistency so I would probably not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a big QTICA fan so anything that they make I love.  This winter has been a great test for any kind of lip balm and this one passed with an A.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had chapped lips forever, due to allergies, weather..etc.so I tried this and I&#x27;m obsessed. My lips haven&#x27;t been chapped since and it&#x27;s beens a few months since I purchased this and I still haven&#x27;t run out either. Will be buying again and again!</li>
    <li> Great for nighttime use. Thick and seems to do a good job of hydrating my lips!</li>
    <li> I received this lip balm about a week ago &amp; must say I love it already. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have dry chapped lips no matter how often I put on chapstick/balm/etc. This balm seems to stay on really well even when I drink water, etc. I don&#x27;t find that its too thick for day use but you can always use it overnight if that&#x27;s a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has given my lips a nice rosy hue &amp; is taking away a lot of the vertical lines. And it definitely makes them look more moisturized. I would love it if this made them plumper too but it looks like from the reviews it is better for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again though for soft, rosy, very moisturized lips for &lt; $12 its well worth the purchase. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Menthol is a little overwhelming</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every lip conditioner on the market.  I take medications that dry my mouth, and I frequently lick my lips, which results in them being dry and cracked all of the time.  I had given up hope on ever having smooth, moisturized lips.  Then I found this absolutely wonderful product.  I would highly recommend Qtica Intense Lip Therapy Balm.  It truly is a miracle product for those of us who struggle with dry, cracked and red lips.  At first I was put off by the price, but considering the size of the tube in comparison to other lip conditioners, the price really is reasonable and IT WORKS.  I use it once a day before going to bed and no longer have &amp;#34;ugly&amp;#34; lips.  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> perfect for all seasons.... the ultimate lip repair</li>
    <li> This stuff is now my holy grail for my lips, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> I frequently moisturize my lips and Qtica Intense Lip Repair Balm lasts longer than other products I have used.  It is my favorite lip balm.</li>
    <li> I initially added this lip balm to my order to qualify for free shipping. However, once I received the product, I fell in love with it. I have chronically chapped lips and live on lip balm. I always have tubes of Carmex and assorted lip moisturizers. After using this lip balm, my lips were softer and didn&#x27;t feel as dry as quickly as when I use other products. It is very thick and a little bit goes a long way. With Carmex, I was applying it every couple of hours. With Qtica, I can go several hours before I feel like my lips need another coat. Great product and my new favorite lip moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m a lip balm addict. All day every day I have to have some with me and I use them countless times through the day and at night. This lip balm is VERY thick, in fact the thickest I&#x27;ve ever used...but in a good way! It stays on my lips ALL night. The first ingredient is Lanolin which is very moisturizing and will completely heal cracked dry lips.  I haven&#x27;t found Lanolin listed first in any other balm, and I&#x27;ve used tons! I recently had what I assumed to be some sort of reaction to a new (other) lip balm and my lips dried out and were peeling in layers every day for about 2 weeks. This is the only thing that fixed it and believe me I tried everything. I ended up resorted to buying this along with every other well reviewed intense healing balms from Amazon. This one takes the cake.  It does have a bit of a white tint to it so if you wear it during the day it has to be a light layer or use lip gloss/stick. I pile it on at night and when I&#x27;m home during the day. Overall I highly recommend this product! It&#x27;s heavy duty stuff.</li>
    <li> this is good stuff. I have very dry, chapped lips and this stuff really helps. especially in the winter months.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my cousin. I have tried several lip balms and this is my new favorite. I am never without it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a bout of chapped lips that just wouldn&#x27;t heal.  It turned out to be a mouthwash allergy, but this was the only thing that gave me relief.  Even though I no longer use that mouthwash, I still use this lip balm because it is so amazing.  A little goes a long way, in fact it can get cakey if you use too much.  I apply it before bed - it stays on all night and I wake up with very soft, healthy lips.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that this had menthol in it, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had it stated menthol, I do not like menthol products on my lips. Please change the description to state that menthol is in this product. It is very thick and goes on your lips white and keeps your lips looking white, no matter how much I massaged it in. It seemed to disappear quickly and actually made my lips feel more dry. So I just use a small amount of it and put a thin coat of Vaseline on top of it to make it feel more moisturizing. I am hoping that this product starts working, as I really wanted to love this product and justify the price of it. It seems to work for a lot of people, I guess my lips are just stubborn. It mixes with the chapping on my lips and just makes them feel gross. I don&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
    <li> Have had really dry lips this winter, and none of my other chapsticks were really helping much. Finally got this, and it has definitely helped. Still a little dry, but a lot better. Put it on at night before bed, and usually one more time during the day.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about trying this out but glad I did...I makes your lips feel a little tingly but has a thick, clear coating which feels really soothing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my lips feel great.  I use it over my lipstick and it makes my lips look plump and full.</li>
    <li> I have chronically horribly chapped lips. I drink 3-4 liters of water a day (not an exaggeration), but my lips are still always so dry! This is the only product I have ever been satisfied with. The littlest bit goes a long way and lasts almost all day.</li>
    <li> Product title says it all, Intense Lip Repair Balm. Really helps get dry and cracked lips back into shape.  Works well, especially when using overnight.</li>
    <li> Felt great when on, but did not make my lips feel any better when it came off. So tried putting Chapstick on first &amp; then this Qtica balm &amp; it was a tad better. The first &amp; main ingredient is Lanolin- much cheaper to just buy that on its own. This balm goes on like a white, super thick blistex. If you rub it in w your fingers it&#x27;s not so painted white looking. But plain ole Neosporin ended up fixing my severely chapped lips the most. Thats after purchasing about 6 of the top rated lip treatments here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> love this balm where have this balm been all my life I love it will always buy it for life</li>
    <li> Best product to protect your lips on these cold Michigan days/nights!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this lip balm according to the reviews,,,it&#x27;s not that great,,,Jack Black lip balm is much better,,going back to it,,,,this is too sticky,,,doesn&#x27;t last,,,,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this lip balm is anything special. When my lips are very dry there are a few others that I would use before this one. I am surprised at the lack of healing power when considering how thick it is.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Heavy but not greasy.  Not highly scented.  One try will make you fall in love with your lips again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I use other products from this manufacturer, so I thought the lip balm would be as good.  Unfortunately, it is not.  It does&#x27;t help with dry cracked lips at all.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would!! I am in Afghanistan and my lips were terribly chapped - skin peeling and bleeding. Of course, regular &#x27;ol chapstick only gives you temporary relief from the pain but does nothing to help the skin on the lips.  I used this three times the first day I received it and on the second day, my lips were 100% back to normal. I was shocked! This really is an amazing product and exceeded my expectations by far! I highly recommend this to anyone in need of relief from painfully chapped lips!!!!!</li>
    <li> it about a week of daily use to see the results, currently on week 3 and my lips look amazing! they&#x27;re this shade a pink that I haven&#x27;t seen in while. The vitamins &amp; oils infused in this balm are amazing. Definatley repurchase 😊</li>
    <li> After using this product for almost a week now my lips are a lot smoother and not cracked at all! Great for Southern California or any other place where your lips dry out fast!</li>
    <li> I like thick lip balms so this is right up my alley. It is very moisturizing and makes your lips feel plump and supple like pillows. Just a note, the smell is a bit medicinal and if you apply to much a white haze like that of a crackhead will be on your mouth. That&#x27;s why I took one star away.</li>
    <li> I moved to a colder part of the country and didn&#x27;t expect the toll it would take on my lips.  I tried drugstore chap stick (LipSmackers something berry) but it didn&#x27;t help and stung.  As soon as I put on this balm, BOOM -- instant relief.  It has a bit of a tingly/cooling feeling which some probably won&#x27;t care for.  The balm is quite thick, so a very light application will make this last a long time (as one should hope since it&#x27;s a whopping $10 for a tube the size of my index finger).  I hate Carmex because of the thickness and smell, but love this stuff.  After wearing for a few days, my painful, itchy dry lips are completely healed.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a large crack in her bottom that wouldn&#x27;t heal.  We tried multiple products and this was the only thing that worked!  After several nights of use her lip began healing. After 1 week the crack is almost completely healed.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but great product!</li>
    <li> I had a long term annoying problem with my lips peeling - tried Vitamin E, Coconut Oil, other products...all suggestions of my Dermotologist and of the woman who does my facials.  Received this product, opened, applied - cured!  That day.  Not kidding - fantastic.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Was very thick and not at all easy to spread over my lips, clumped up where I started to apply it. If the product was a little thinner I think it would probably work great.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best lip balm I have ever used. And I have tried them all!! I have large lips and it seems they are never moisturized enough. I always seem to have dry patches no matter how much lip balm I use. This stuff is a miracle! I put it on at bedtime and in the morning my lips are so soft with no dry patches whatsoever. I use it again in the morning and it lasts a loooooong time. I don&#x27;t have to apply more lip balm or gloss until mid-day! And I don&#x27;t need to reapply because my lips don&#x27;t feel soft, I just like the way a balm or gloss feels on my lips. This is WELL worth the money! I will be buying more so I have one for my purse, my nightstand AND my bathroom. You HAVE to try this! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve never found anything else to work as great as this. I have very bad lips so I have to reapply strong chap stick frequently. With this, I put it on before I sleep once a week and it makes it so that I only apply chap stick once a day.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm out there! It is creamy and last forever! It doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly like some of the cheap lip balms out there. It does have a tingle factor to it but it is not overpowering!</li>
    <li> I use this at night.  It stays put because of the ingredients used.  It hasn&#x27;t stopped my lips from drying and peeling during the day.  So I continue to use a lip scrub to exfoliate every few days.</li>
    <li> Goes on thick but very creamy and definitely not sticky. Turned my lips around when nothing else worked. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders, I absolutely loved it! It left my lips silky and smooth (lol, really). Clumsy me lost it though!! Must. Buy. More!!!</li>
    <li> It stays on my lips well and protects them</li>
    <li> Bought it one day in a beauty store in Hollywood and have loved ever since! I love chopsticks and lip balms and this is by far the best one I have ever used. Since I couldn&#x27;t drive always to Hollywood I bought from amazon few at a time because it is so worth it. It is a little thick and white but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from applying all throughout the day. I have darker lips and it blends in clear in no time. It conditions and gets rid of chapped lips within hours! I use it at night and when I wake up my lips are buttery soft and sometimes I feel like it made my lines disappear and my lips feel a bit bigger. My experience only I don&#x27;t know if that happens to everyone. Either way it is a fantastic product to have healthy soft lips and I have just run out so I have to buy more! :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all.which really bums me out cause of all the good reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it almost a month and my lips have not improved. Safe no say I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Hopefully others have better luck.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  Ready to order more.  Lasts a long time.  Need very little to get good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lip balm for about a week now. It&#x27;s not that thick as others claim going on, and it hydrates okay. It doesn&#x27;t have the same glorious effect on my lips overnight as it seems to have on the other reviewers. Nothing to rave about. I&#x27;d still have to apply it every few hours to stay hydrated.</li>
    <li> At first, I was disappointed with how small the tube was, but it lasted 4 months using it every night.  I definitely think it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviewers who say it is thick.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for night wear.  In the morning, I still have some on my lips.  For the day, it&#x27;s a little messy to apply evenly, but I&#x27;m sure you could still do it if you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The qtica hydrates my lips very well.  Soft and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the day, I use [[ASIN:B005ELOJPW Carmex VANILLA Stick Spf #15 : 0.15 OZ]] or [[ASIN:B005ELPUPU Carmex Ultra Moisturizing Lip Balm, SPF 15, Lime Twist, .15 oz]].  They have a bit of a medicinal smell (vics vapo rub), but the carmex are also very hydrating and not as thick as the qtica.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips look amazing from using these products!</li>
    <li> This transforms your dry, crapped lips into soft, supple creamy feel in under 1 hour!</li>
    <li> I have had dry lips since I was young. It annoyed me enough where I had to do something.&lt;br /&gt;I tried chapstick, burts bees, aquaphor, etc. etc. etc. This is simply the best. Dry lips is no longer on my mind and I can walk around feeling great. I feel a big difference and will be a continuous buyer. This product is AMAZING!! Some people use this only at night but I use a thin layer during the day and it provides moisture and relief better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My lips were constantly getting dry and cracked but now that I use this, my lips are soft and just great! I put it on every night before I go to sleep and sometimes in the mornings. I definitely recommend this product! I&#x27;m actually going to order more right now. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I would never be without this lip conditioner.</li>
    <li> Recovers my lips fast, I like it very much. I recomend it. Great product lip Balm Qtica recovery relief intense</li>
    <li> Great lip protection. Gives relief to sever chapped lips immediately.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have been using it for years and it is the only lip balm that keeps my lips from being chaped all winter.</li>
    <li> This is a fake!!! The real Qtica lip balm is clear and doesn&#x27;t smell like minty medicated crap. This is white and it smells like awful Bengay medicated stuff. Do not buy!!! You&#x27;ll be scammed. The real stuff is amazing, but not this fake stuff. They should be in trouble for this!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I have tried almost everything.  This is expensive, and you can really only get it online, which is a pain, but I can no longer use anything else.  This is the richest lip balm I have ever found, and it keeps my lips hydrated for hours.  I put it on at night before bed, and its still there in the morning.  I put it on in the morning and rarely have to touch up.  Nothing else seems to absorb like this does, and it has no aftertaste like chapstick or anything you buy at the drugstore or even Sephora.  Also, it has no color, so it works for guys or kids or anyone.</li>
