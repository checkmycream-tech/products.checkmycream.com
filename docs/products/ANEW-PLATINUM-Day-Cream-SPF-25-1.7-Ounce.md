    <li> This is a very good daytime moisturizer with SPF. I love the smell. It is not greasy and feels wonderful in the morning. The price on Amazon is cheaper than ordering from Avon directly.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok just another cream to add to my collection</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s hydrating,  leaves my skin silky. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Anew is my go to product but this is not a good product for me. It smells and breaks my face out. Seller was fine just not a product that I will order again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years.  Highly recommend it and the seller who shipped it.</li>
    <li> People have commented on how good I look since I&#x27;ve started using this.  The price was very good compared to other venues, also.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out. Didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>

    <li> I am so happy with my Avon products. I will be ordering more very soon.Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Avon.  It does work well.  I thought this was for the face. It says here will reshape the neck.  I have been using it now for a month and had to stop-it started clogging my pores and was burning my skin. there is a strong odor in it.  I liked what it did but not the smell or the stinging. Im reading Olay has good products, will try those.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is very light</li>
    <li> Eye make up cakes under this product! Inconvenient! I do not like digging my fingernails into the jar! Gave the full jar away!</li>
    <li> Use after shaving, a very nice cream.</li>
    <li> This was not I expected, wrong item</li>
    <li> less cost then if bought from avon some great product ....</li>

    <li> Great product. Have used it before. Best wrinkle reducer I&#x27;ve ever u sed.  The price from Amazon is half whatAvon will char g e. If you like smooth skin with less wrinkles, try this cream.</li>
    <li> Love it. Soft, gentle....someone negatively commented on the smell....I don&#x27;t find it bothersome at all.....and I have a very sensitive sense of smell. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it. Recently a friend of mine started a business selling very expensive &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; skin care products. To be polite, I switched. It could not compete with the Avon products I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Feels greasy on my face and under my makeup</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly.  I am allergic to many products but not this one and it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> this a great night cream &amp; it works very well. Will buy this again from Affordable Treasures4me  great people to buy from</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, was exactly what was advertized. Love that it&#x27;s not greasy on my face. Especially since you use it under makeup for the day.</li>
    <li> I love the cream but I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it. Hope it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad to everyone around me as it does to me.</li>
    <li> Have used Avon products for years. Their performance is always reliable.</li>
    <li> I love this product.and it softens my face and hands. I will continue to purchase more. Great price and value too. i do like the herbal smell too. very fresh.</li>
    <li> My mom has been wearing this day cream for quite some time now and she loves it. She&#x27;ll be 68 yrs old this year and her skin looks beautiful &amp; young. The spf added to the cream is a bonus too.</li>
    <li> Best cream, use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> I totally love this stuff!  Alot of other brands cause me to break out and when I finally stumbled on to the Avon Anew line of products, I was happy to discover they did not cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;  I used to order them through Avon, but it got to where I couldn&#x27;t always afford them,, but since finding them here on Amazon, I can now afford to keep using my favorite product!&lt;br /&gt;  Oh yes,, and it DOES work great.  Everyone says I never look anywhere near my true gae.&lt;br /&gt;:0)</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
