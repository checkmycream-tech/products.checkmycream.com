      <li>The colors are nice and blend in well.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to use the plastic hair cover because it will activate the product and help it give you a good result.</li>
      <li>Comes in nice looking shades.</li>
      <li>I missed the old Loving Care colors and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across yet.</li>
      <li>I was looking for Loving Care from Clairol for many years...</li>
      <li>So far, this is the easiest and has the best coverage that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>Very light gray coverage..</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE THE COLOR.  </li>
      <li>I love the color,,,,,,,,,,,,from</li>
      <li>Love Your color on Amazon read the reviews and tried it.</li>
      <li>One morning I just said that I needed to either go gray or give this a shot, so I made sure it was a weekday</li>
      <li>This product is extremely safe.  </li>
      <li>For my mother with allergies-this was much better</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair colored many times</li>
      <li>sure covers the scalp..should i use it to dye/cover the scalp?</li>
      <li>maybe that&#x27;s better...</li>
      <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>, I might have better quality hair if I hadn&#x27;t used products with ammonia and peroxide in them.  </li>
      <li>This color worked great for me so far.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use and covers those darn grays that keep re appearing in between coloring.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job...gradually fades while giving my color a boost for several weeks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried two different shades, and have been happy with both.  </li>
      <li>I was fortunate that I accidently found this product after months of searching and reading reviews.  </li>
      <li>Strong smell which goes away in a day or if you wash your hair after coloring which I always do just to make sure all the extra dye is removed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Dark brown (too dark for me but a nice color), the Medium Ash brown (nice color but did not last really long in my hair but lightened to a nice golden brown) and then this Medium brown which seems to be a perfect color.</li>
      <li>The color came out better than when I had it professionally</li>
      <li>Love the medium brown color wich is close to my natural color.</li>
      <li>and it came right away</li>
      <li>Not everything &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is safe, no matter how much you want to believe that natural is better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was going to give up and just live with being clean</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t get the same results as you would with permanent hair dye, this product stains the hair and will have to be applied more often.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a safer and gentle alternative for those who are allergic to permanent hair colors.</li>
      <li>It works, causes no allergic reactions and is gentle on the hair.  </li>
      <li>But, I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet to see how much may rinse out.  </li>
      <li>I did have to leave it in between 30-45 minutes to get a good cover due to resistant grey hair.  </li>
      <li>I can use as much as I want &amp; just brush on new growth as needed.</li>
      <li>But since I&#x27;m not using a whole lot of it at a time, and because application is essentially one step, it&#x27;s still economical and efficient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with a PPD allergy or even anyone who does not want to get involved with permanent hair color.  </li>
      <li>I am highly allergic to the PPD in all hair color.</li>
      <li>highly recommend Cosamo.</li>
      <li>Would HIGHLY vote this product</li>
      <li>would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Jury is out on the first shampoo, but because I have short hair</li>
      <li>I only used half of the bottle, so if I need more I have it.</li>
      <li>The color comes out just as I want it to and the conditioning pack leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that Cosamo makes 2 little cuts in the border of the conditioning pack which makes it easy to open in the shower, which is something Clairol did not do.</li>
      <li>As a gentleman who has had facial hair for most of the past 20 years, it was distressing to me when my beard starting going gray.</li>
      <li>Now, it does wash out much faster than permanent coloring (if I shampoo my facial hair regularly, the application will last about a week before needing to be reapplied).</li>
      <li>I was extremely cautious the first time and left the color in the minimum time.  </li>
      <li>It was definitely adding years to my apparent age.&lt;br</li>

<li> It was definitely adding years to my apparent age.&lt;br</li>
<li> Saves a lot of money and is not harsh like the other touch up kits on the market now.  </li>
<li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as semi permanent hair coloring</li>
<li> What I found out is that PPD is present in all permanent dark hair color whether from a salon or a local store.  </li>
<li> I used the color, medium brown #765, on my roots and let it sit for 45 minutes, it did stain the grey to blend in with the rest of my hair.  </li>
<li> I wish I had found it a long time ago.</li>
<li> The bottle lasts for a long time since you are not mixing it with anything.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t cover the grey and made my hair dry...</li>
<li> I tried henna but got a severe allergic reaction which was very frightening and lasted many days.</li>
<li> The only downside to temporary color is that it needs to be done approximately every 2 - 3 weeks, but I can live with that.</li>
<li> This is a non permanent color and will lonely last about 2 weeks if you wash your hair a few times a week or swim.</li>
<li> It will sprinkle, so you must be careful.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Tried the &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; coloring, which worked, but after a few colorings, it starting burning my skin.</li>
<li> Did not get too dark and causes no irritation to my scalp.</li>
<li> I apply it to the roots and brush it down.</li>
<li> I had to go over the roots again with my previous brand.</li>
<li> It definitely colored the hair with no physical side effects -- unfortunately that color turned out to be a moss green.</li>
<li> It does tend to fade a little on the purple side, and it doesn&#x27;t take for me as well around the face line, but then again, I&#x27;m washing my face twice a day, so</li>
<li> Not too messy.  </li>
<li> I guess my gray is not easy to cover.</li>
<li> Clairol packets were near to impossible and frustrating to open unless you brought a scissors to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Being anxious that I might still have a reaction, I waited months to try it.  </li>
<li> AT LEAST 12 SHAMPOOS.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m allergic to PPD, so finding a hair color that works has been beyond frustrating.  </li>
<li> broken hair strands besides that expensive every 5 weeks when the gray starts showing.  </li>
<li> but sadly they discontinued it.  </li>
<li> Until I found this, I tried various products like sprays, powders and gels which were awful.</li>
<li> My hair is thinning and I am afraid to use products with ammonia or peroxide.</li>
<li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> After having a very bad allergic reaction to salon permanent color, I did a lot of research.  </li>
<li> but nothing works.. :&#x27;(</li>

    <li> Excellent.  Covers must of my grays.  Not too messy.  It will sprinkle, so you must be careful.  Comes in nice looking shades.</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT and welcome find after Loving Care temporary color was no longer being made.  Until I found this, I tried various products like sprays, powders and gels which were awful. I tried henna but got a severe allergic reaction which was very frightening and lasted many days. Not everything &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is safe, no matter how much you want to believe that natural is better.&lt;br /&gt;I get excellent results with Cosamo and it has no ammonia or peroxide or PPD which may be a carcinogen. The color comes out just as I want it to and the conditioning pack leaves my hair soft and shiny. I appreciate that Cosamo makes 2 little cuts in the border of the conditioning pack which makes it easy to open in the shower, which is something Clairol did not do. Clairol packets were near to impossible and frustrating to open unless you brought a scissors to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Cosamo.</li>
    <li> GET COVERAGE AND I LOVE THE COLOR.  HOPE IT WILL LAST AT LEAST 12 SHAMPOOS.  IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD TOO.</li>
    <li> This product did not give me any allergic reaction. Now I know I&#x27;m definitely allergic to PDD. Now I just need to find a permanent one.</li>
    <li> didnt work on my grays at all.</li>
    <li> MOAN! i did the patch test..left it 45 min..DID NOT COVER THE GRAY AT ALL...sure covers the scalp..should i use it to dye/cover the scalp? maybe that&#x27;s better...but then i can&#x27;t use another product! OMG...what to do? i wanted to stop using permanent dyes but nothing works.. :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> wife says this is the best for her and it came right away</li>
    <li> This color worked great for me so far.  I&#x27;ve tried the Dark brown (too dark for me but a nice color), the Medium Ash brown (nice color but did not last really long in my hair but lightened to a nice golden brown) and then this Medium brown which seems to be a perfect color. Did not get too dark and causes no irritation to my scalp. I will buy this color again.  This is a non permanent color and will lonely last about 2 weeks if you wash your hair a few times a week or swim. I&#x27;ll trade the non lasting for no irritation any day.  I missed the old Loving Care colors and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across yet. Affordable and works.  Strong smell which goes away in a day or if you wash your hair after coloring which I always do just to make sure all the extra dye is removed. I did have to leave it in between 30-45 minutes to get a good cover due to resistant grey hair.  Be sure to use the plastic hair cover because it will activate the product and help it give you a good result. Just don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as semi permanent hair coloring and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> For my mother with allergies-this was much better</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I guess my gray is not easy to cover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to PPD, so finding a hair color that works has been beyond frustrating.  So far, this is the easiest and has the best coverage that I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve tried two different shades, and have been happy with both.  The colors are nice and blend in well.  It would be ideal if they could make a permanent color so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with coloring my hair every two weeks.  It does tend to fade a little on the purple side, and it doesn&#x27;t take for me as well around the face line, but then again, I&#x27;m washing my face twice a day, so that&#x27;s the way it is.  I will be reordering until I find a permanent solution.</li>
    <li> Great product. I wish I had found it a long time ago. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Loving Care from Clairol for many years...but sadly they discontinued it.  Now I found a great product that is great for touch ups on sides forehead and anywhere you are are starting to turn gray.  It is easy to use and covers those darn grays that keep re appearing in between coloring.  Saves a lot of money and is not harsh like the other touch up kits on the market now.  My hair is thinning and I am afraid to use products with ammonia or peroxide. Give it a try.  The bottle lasts for a long time since you are not mixing it with anything.</li>
    <li> I love the color,,,,,,,,,,,,from now on I will only buy CoSaMo. The color lasts longer than the others .Really a great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to work as it should.  Color is good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cosamo for 4 mos now.  After 3 allergic reactions to over the counter hair dye, and the last being severe, I will never go back to using dye with PPD or ammonia. Because Cosamo comes premixed,  I like that I can use as much as I want &amp; just brush on new growth as needed. It is semi permanent,  and with my gray, I need to reapply every 2 weeks. I am happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I am highly allergic to the PPD in all hair color. I fouind Love Your color on Amazon read the reviews and tried it. Love the medium brown color wich is close to my natural color. Best thing is no itchy bumps, rashes and no doctor visits. Would HIGHLY vote this product an A+++++. LOve it and will be using it again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used the color, medium brown #765, on my roots and let it sit for 45 minutes, it did stain the grey to blend in with the rest of my hair.  I will continue to use this product since I&#x27;m allergic to permanent hair dye. You don&#x27;t get the same results as you would with permanent hair dye, this product stains the hair and will have to be applied more often. My hair didn&#x27;t turn purple. It&#x27;s a safer and gentle alternative for those who are allergic to permanent hair colors.</li>
    <li> Covered the gray and I had no skin reaction. Nice product.</li>
    <li> But, I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet to see how much may rinse out.  I&#x27;ve had my hair colored many times and it always falls out, broken hair strands besides that expensive every 5 weeks when the gray starts showing.  This product is extremely safe.  My color I used is med brown.  It didn&#x27;t have any orange, purple or yellow tints and covered the gray well.  The color came out better than when I had it professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jury is out on the first shampoo, but because I have short hair I only used half of the bottle, so if I need more I have it.</li>
    <li> It works, causes no allergic reactions and is gentle on the hair.  I wish I had found this product years ago, I might have better quality hair if I hadn&#x27;t used products with ammonia and peroxide in them.  would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for several years. It does a great job...gradually fades while giving my color a boost for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use to give my hair a ombre effect. I apply it to the roots and brush it down. Looks amazing. It washes out after 4 shampoos, but I have plenty of product left. So it works well for this.</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.  After having a very bad allergic reaction to salon permanent color, I did a lot of research.  What I found out is that PPD is present in all permanent dark hair color whether from a salon or a local store.  Even some of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair dyes have PPD if you read all of the ingredients.  I was fortunate that I accidently found this product after months of searching and reading reviews.  Being anxious that I might still have a reaction, I waited months to try it.  One morning I just said that I needed to either go gray or give this a shot, so I made sure it was a weekday so I could immediately go to my Dr. if I had any sort of reaction, and gave it a try.  I was extremely cautious the first time and left the color in the minimum time.  I am happy to say that I have no negative reaction to this product and it works beautifully.  I have used it about 4 times and now have no fear and know the timing for my hair.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with a PPD allergy or even anyone who does not want to get involved with permanent hair color.  The only downside to temporary color is that it needs to be done approximately every 2 - 3 weeks, but I can live with that.</li>
    <li> As a gentleman who has had facial hair for most of the past 20 years, it was distressing to me when my beard starting going gray. It was definitely adding years to my apparent age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; coloring, which worked, but after a few colorings, it starting burning my skin. The redness and itchiness didn&#x27;t fully go away for months after my last use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a milder alternative, I tried out a Henna product. It definitely colored the hair with no physical side effects -- unfortunately that color turned out to be a moss green. Had to shave it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was going to give up and just live with being clean shaven (after a brief stint sporting just a &#x27;stache) until I starting reading up on alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this stuff, and have been using it for the last 6 weeks or so. Now, it does wash out much faster than permanent coloring (if I shampoo my facial hair regularly, the application will last about a week before needing to be reapplied). But since I&#x27;m not using a whole lot of it at a time, and because application is essentially one step, it&#x27;s still economical and efficient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed no itching or burning since use -- will update if that changes, but after 4-5 applications, no problems.</li>
    <li> Great product, does just what it promises, for a good price.</li>
    <li> Very light gray coverage.. I had to go over the roots again with my previous brand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover the grey and made my hair dry...</li>
</ol>
