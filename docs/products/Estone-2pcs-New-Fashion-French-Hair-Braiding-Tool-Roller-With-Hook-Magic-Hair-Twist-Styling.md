    <li> Takes an engineering degree to figure out where the hair goes!  Better buying a book and learning how to braid the old fashioned way...</li>
    <li> Broke with first use, cheap product</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ve had this before and like it.</li>
    <li> Impossible to do by yourself</li>
    <li> I just bought a useless piece of plastic....</li>
    <li> Useless. No instructions that we could make out. Just teeny-tiny photos that made no sense. We have no idea what to do with this now. I certainly can&#x27;t braid hair with it. It does nothing for me without legible instructions.</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than was expected!  In excellent condition!  Hoping to french braid my hair for Halloween.  I&#x27;m going as Mosad liason Ziva David :)</li>
    <li> An okay product if your woman has straight hair.  My lady&#x27;s hair is really curly so we gave this product to a friend who simply just loves it.</li>
    <li> I only received a pack with just the tool, not a two piece item like indicated.</li>
    <li> Is not as easy as it appears.  Hair gets all tangled. This definitely requires a second pair of hands.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that came with this thing were so blurry you can&#x27;t see the pictures and I can find nothing online that really shows how to use this. I also ordered a 2 pack, one light and one dark. I received a white one and a light grey almost white one. Shipping also took forever (from China of course).</li>
    <li> I used youtube to eventually learn to French braid my hair. There is no way to use this down the back of your hair by yourself. You have to be able to see it. It doesn&#x27;t come out after your hair is put through it. You can take it out of your hair when you take the braid out. That being said, my niece wanted to try different hairstyles for school, and she didn&#x27;t know how to French braid. She&#x27;s pretty good about watching a video and learning how to do something but the French braid was not one of those things. So her options were up in a pony tail as she can do by herself, or just brush it and leave it loose. Her mom wears her hair short and always has, doesn&#x27;t know how to do a three strand braid. There is no teaching her how to French braid!!! So I gave her these, and sat my niece down in a chair and I walked her through several times to learn to use them to fake a French braid. I also tried walking her through the real deal. Nope. But she mastered these guides so there was at least two things  they could do with her hair in the mornings until I could teach my niece herself how to French braid, which I did 2 weeks later. But until then she got lots of compliments at school on her French braid pigtails and her diagonal French braid.</li>
