      <li>I decided I would give it another try, and since then the product is exactly as it should be.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that goes limp with most volumizers.  </li>
      <li>I love it enough to order it online instead of buying one of the many similar products available at my local store.</li>
      <li>I have fine and very straight and thinnish short hair.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll never try others as long as this product is available online!</li>
      <li>It is the only styling product that gives my fine hair the body to hold the style throughout the day.</li>
      <li>plus I really appreciate ….</li>
      <li>I have had other mousses do this but also have had many that do not.  </li>

      <li>My hair stays in place and looks soft.  </li>
      <li>Bought it in a very small town at a local salon out of necessity and ended up loving it.  </li>
      <li>You really only use about a 50 cent worth to style (short hair), so one bottle lasts several months.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, non greasy, non sticky and works well on wet or dry hair!</li>
      <li>Recommended by a hairdresser as kinder to sensitive skin &amp; eyes &amp; definitely fits that description.</li>
      <li>it does give you volume, but makes your hair a little funny feeling.  </li>
      <li>i have been using this mousse for the past few months--after trying many other products i found this one to be fantastic--it holds your hair for the entire day without leaving it stiff and dry--i use all the neuma products and love them all</li>
