### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is one of the best deodorants I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>If you sweat like there&#x27;s no tomorrow, it&#x27;d be a great choice for every day use.</li>
      <li>Scent was great though, so its deodorant qualities were good.  </li>
      <li>Degree Clinical Protection for women is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>And, if you forget, which I have on occasion, you can apply it in the morning with results almost as good as at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but pretty good.  </li>
      <li>She was most happy with the scent, which she describes as lemony or citrus-y.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very, very pleasant fresh scent called \\&quot;shower clean\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Otherwise this is one product by an excellent company that has never failed me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
      <li>Degree&#x27;s deodorant is simply amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for an effective antipersperant for some time with no luck.</li>
      <li>I am even more delighted to report that it works in the blast furnace of Texas</li>
      <li>have found it effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, my wife liked this product.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent anti-perspirant with a light, clean scent.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing more to add except to try Degree Clinical Protection for Women today.</li>
      <li>So I rely on the opinion of my lovely wife the Rock Star.</li>
      <li>, I also enjoyed the scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>Sure, if the price is competitive.  </li>
      <li>If you try it you will love it too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Applying it according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions means applying it at night -- and this means thinking about it just before bed rather than just after a morning shower as I have done for so many years.  </li>
      <li>This Degree Clinical Protection has the potential to be great!  </li>
      <li>So I was pleased to have the chance to review this product.  </li>
      <li>The instructions suggest that for best protection the product be applied at night, following a shower.</li>
      <li>What more can you</li>
      <li>I kept turning and found there was a film over the holes on the top, see-through and not noticable.  </li>
      <li>Lasts throughout the day and more.  </li>
      <li>You turn a dial at the bottom and a foamy cream rises up from holes in the dispenser on top.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an overly feminine scent but many ladies will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It applies better than solids.</li>
      <li>Nice clean scent and</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is highly effective as an anti-perspirant with a wonderfully clean scent.</li>
      <li>I have used anti-perspirants for a long time and this one is excellent.  </li>
      <li>I figured this would be a great time to try out this new \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; product.</li>
      <li>But it does have a nice, mild scent and keeps odor and wetness away.</li>
      <li>It works very well as a deodorant, leaving a pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>So easy and convenient, I love it.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, it did not irratate my skin, as many deodorants can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Degree Clinical Protection is an excellent product that performed as well as expected.</li>
      <li>Seems to work well, I don&#x27;t sweat much, but even after being out and baout for 16+ hours, I still smelled good.  </li>
      <li>The scent is like a strong plastic smell, which I didn&#x27;t care for.  </li>
      <li>product went on easily and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>She has used Degree Clinical Protection Stick for months, and she reports that it goes on cleanly and works beautifully; also, she says the stick is empty and can I please get her some more?</li>
      <li>The product goes on smoothly and never burns or stings.</li>
      <li>(I suppose nothing&#x27;s free).</li>
      <li>But on the whole, I liked it, and it did its job.  </li>
      <li>that it might be cakey, or goopy, but it wasn&#x27;t, it went on really smooth.  </li>
      <li>If I hadn&#x27;t gotten it for free, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the xtra $$ in order to buy it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product especially with spring, summer, and warmer temperatures arriving.  </li>
      <li>What better recommendation can you have than if the reviewer (or his spouse) uses the product until it runs out and wants more?</li>
      <li>She describes this as a very fresh scent, without the often overpowering scent of soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tend to sweat more than most people, and this kept me dry even on a warm day when I was doing a lot of walking up hills.  </li>
      <li>This is now my new favorite product!</li>
      <li>I sure hope this product will work next week when I need it the most!</li>
      <li>I have always had a problem with sweat, especially since menopause, and this is the most effective and convenient product I have tried.</li>
      <li>and I like the clean shower scent.  </li>
      <li>Well after the first day, I noticed a significant differance!</li>
      <li>The shower fresh scent is relatively light.</li>
      <li>So you can actually forget to use it at all from time to time, and you&#x27;ll still get good</li>
      <li>This product is a strong deodorant that lasts throughout the day, even in hot weather.</li>
      <li>She mentioned that often in the mornings her underarm skin felt, for want of a more descriptive term, \\&quot;tacky,\\&quot; not horribly unfashionable, but more the tactile sensation of almost-dry paint, which is to mean she could feel the product continuing to work to prevent wetness, a day or more after its application.  </li>
      <li>While I refuse to wax lyric about a deodorant, this worked just fine this morning as I worked out at the gym.  </li>
      <li>This product kept me dry &amp; happy through a late-summer Midwest heat wave, so I have to say it works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than my normal antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this deodorant works any better then a normal deodorant.</li>
      <li>This semi-solid vent kind runs out too quickly for my tastes, and if you drop it and the casing cracks, you&#x27;re totally out of luck.  </li>
      <li>It takes a little getting used to to remember to put it on before bed instead of in the morning, but I have been really happy with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not one of those cute colored boxes or containers, that looks nice, but does little to help.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell, but it does lose one star for being the kind of deodorant you push up through a vent instead of a solid stick.  </li>
      <li>Moreover, one need only dab a bit on for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>Since my hot flashes have begun I sweat a lot and this does greatly cut down the sweat produced under my arms.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not usually one who cares too much about the kind of deodorant I use, but thought this one might be useful for some days in the hot, humid weather we get in the South.</li>
      <li>as for keeping my dry, it seems to work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It started right with the first use.  </li>
      <li>It left no residue on her clothes, and did not clump, flake or ball up, which was very important for sleeveless tops.  </li>
      <li>She admitted that she couldn&#x27;t really tell if it offered a great deal more protection than anything else she has used in the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to be so picky because I just don&#x27;t sweat very much, even when I&#x27;m doing perspiring-type activities.</li>
      <li>After your shower at night you just apply the deodorant, it is easy to apply and goes on smoothly, then you are protected the whole next day.</li>
      <li>It seems to work better than the regular anti perspirants.</li>
      <li>Oh - I also love that there is no white residue on my clothes with this product</li>
      <li>Better than regular over-the-counter products.</li>
      <li>It does leave your skin soft and smooth as well.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t break out, I had absolutely no ill effects whatsoever.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a week, I still feel some itching when I first apply this, and at times during the day.  </li>
      <li>But before going further, it&#x27;s important that before using this, READ the instructions!  </li>
      <li>Degree Clinical protection deodorant works as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve used (most recently Suave&#x27;s natural Cucumber melon).</li>
      <li>This also was a highly positive factor for this</li>
      <li>The women in my family found this to be about the same as most decent antiperspirants.</li>
      <li>Well, I tried Secret Clinical first, but wasn&#x27;t happy...</li>
      <li>Certain Dri A.M.</li>
      <li>My husband has used the male counterpart, and I reviewed it quite favorably - great scent, nice application control, and little mess.  </li>
      <li>(and it costs twice as much).</li>
      <li>\\&quot;It works!\\&quot; she said, and very well.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>I found that CertainDri would stop it, but it caused so much irritation and itching that I couldn&#x27;t keep using it.  </li>
      <li>You might like it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much one can say about deodorant,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product kept me dry &amp; happy through a late-summer Midwest heat wave, so I have to say it works pretty well.  I was a little concerned when I saw it was a white semi-solid, but it left no streaks on my clothes -- even the black sleeveless sweater was OK!  The scent is a bit medicinal, but not overwhelmingly so.  I would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with perspiration and odor, and used Ban roll-on for years.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but pretty good.  However, I wanted to try the convenience of a stick anti-perspirant/deodorant, so I tried various ones including Ban solid, Mitchum for women, degree, arrid, and Secret.  Well, I tried Secret Clinical first, but wasn&#x27;t happy...it just never dried and I felt sticky all the time.  Scent was great though, so its deodorant qualities were good.  With Degree Clinical...it was pretty much the same.  It never seemed to dry, and when it did (after a LONG time), when I perspired it did NOTHING.  The scent is like a strong plastic smell, which I didn&#x27;t care for.  The applicator top is a trip...with little holes that the product comes out of.  You have to turn the wheel quite a few times to get much to come out.  The item itself is packaged in a top heavy plastic container with a thin tube of the product actually in it.  The price is a rip off.  It&#x27;s no better than the regular Degree.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, I don&#x27;t sweat much, but even after being out and baout for 16+ hours, I still smelled good.  It does leave your skin soft and smooth as well.  I have sensitive skin, which did not seem bothered.</li>
    <li> The women in my family found this to be about the same as most decent antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why everyone rates this so well. I definitely do not think it is worth 5 stars. I don&#x27;t think this deodorant works any better then a normal deodorant. I have not noticed a difference between it and my normal deodorant, I even think this might be worse then the normal Dove deodorant I usually use. (and it costs twice as much). Also, It smells like mens deodorant. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This does work for stopping some persperation though heavy sweaters will gain no help here. I would suggest [[ASIN:B000FD23FW Certain Dri A.M. Scented Roll-On Underarm Refresher - 2.5oz]] as I find it to be surperior, though you will find that you will sweat more in other areas (I suppose nothing&#x27;s free).</li>
    <li> This Degree Clinical Protection has the potential to be great!  But before going further, it&#x27;s important that before using this, READ the instructions!  It&#x27;s not like others where you open it up and put it on.  Set aside time and read them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An option in the directions is they write about putting it on before you go to bed at night.  However, they don&#x27;t think what if you take a shower in when you wake up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave you with that \\&quot;wet sticky\\&quot; underarm feeling.  Nor does it leave a white residue on materials.  And it does not drip down your side.  It&#x27;s a dry feeling.  Lasts throughout the day and more.  During hot, humid days in the summer, this is one that will keep your underarms dry and leave you odor free (you won&#x27;t be smelling under your arms to see if it&#x27;s still working).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would of given it five stars.  But what left me not is that it looks like only one scent is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you&#x27;re getting a regular white stock box and container.  It&#x27;s not one of those cute colored boxes or containers, that looks nice, but does little to help.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product is that it has .5% LESS of the active ingredient than my SECRET scents.  I didn&#x27;t like is smell, so I ended up using my Secret anyhow -- as for keeping my dry, it seems to work pretty good.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than my normal antiperspirant.  If I hadn&#x27;t gotten it for free, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend the xtra $$ in order to buy it.</li>
    <li> Degree&#x27;s deodorant is simply amazing. It is one of the best deodorants I have ever tried. There is no harsh smell or white residue that tends to land on certain areas of your shirt. I was really pleasantly surprised and you will too.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the price is a bit steep. Otherwise this is one product by an excellent company that has never failed me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> This is an excellent anti-perspirant with a light, clean scent. It definitely will keep one dry. Though a little on the pricy side, if one needs stronger than usual protection, this one will do the trick without having to get a prescription. Moreover, one need only dab a bit on for it to be effective. So, do not be deterred by its small, travel friendly size.</li>
    <li> Degree Clinical protection deodorant works as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve used (most recently Suave&#x27;s natural Cucumber melon). It applies better than solids. The scent (shower clean) is stronger than I prefer or need and my next purchase would be an unscented version. The instructions suggest that for best protection the product be applied at night, following a shower. This is a difficult habit to adopt and I apply in the morning, like any other brands.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies, I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t personally vouch for how well this product works. After all, I&#x27;m a guy! So I rely on the opinion of my lovely wife the Rock Star. She has used Degree Clinical Protection Stick for months, and she reports that it goes on cleanly and works beautifully; also, she says the stick is empty and can I please get her some more? What better recommendation can you have than if the reviewer (or his spouse) uses the product until it runs out and wants more? There&#x27;s nothing more to add except to try Degree Clinical Protection for Women today. That is of course if you are lucky enough to be a woman!!!</li>
    <li> Degree Clinical Protection is an excellent product that performed as well as expected. And, in view of the manufacturer&#x27;s promises, I certainly expected quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly effective as an anti-perspirant with a wonderfully clean scent. Most importantly, it did not irratate my skin, as many deodorants can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you are looking for an ultra-effective anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have used anti-perspirants for a long time and this one is excellent.  After your shower at night you just apply the deodorant, it is easy to apply and goes on smoothly, then you are protected the whole next day. So easy and convenient, I love it.  I have always had a problem with sweat, especially since menopause, and this is the most effective and convenient product I have tried. If you try it you will love it too.</li>
    <li> This product is a strong deodorant that lasts throughout the day, even in hot weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one who cares too much about the kind of deodorant I use, but thought this one might be useful for some days in the hot, humid weather we get in the South. They recommend you put it on at night, and that it will last through your morning shower, but if you&#x27;re forgetful like me and put it on in the morning it seems to work good still. Doesn&#x27;t leave white marks - a necessity these days.</li>
    <li> For those people who have overactive sweat glands this product is a godsend.  Traditional products act marginally, but this product offers reliable protection against odor and wetness.  Better than regular over-the-counter products.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve noticed my regular deodorant sometimes doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day, to put it delicately!  So I was pleased to have the chance to review this product.  I must say, overall, I am not that impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say, though that I think for the main purpose, keeping dry and odor free, it seems to work.  By the end of the day, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that during the week I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a few other things have bothered me. It started right with the first use.  Although I had saved the box and instructions, as often is the case in the morning, I couldn&#x27;t locate them.  But I figured just opening it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.  Well, it was.  I turned and turned and turned the dial at the bottom and it seemed nothing happened.  I wondered if I was turning it the wrong way.  Finally, I did see something come out of the top just a little.  I kept turning and found there was a film over the holes on the top, see-through and not noticable.  I took it off and finally the cream style product came out the little holes.  I prefer solid deodorant, but I was willing to try this style.  It seemed to go on fairly smoothly, but almost right away it made me a little itchy.  Nothing severe, but nothing I&#x27;ve really noticed with other products.  With the cream, also, it&#x27;s hard to tell if you&#x27;ve put on enough or too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, I still feel some itching when I first apply this, and at times during the day.  I might just be sensitive to some ingredient, but normally I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at this compared to my regular deodorant, and I guess the difference is a slightly higher amount of the active ingredient.  The difference in performance isn&#x27;t enough for me to put up with the fairly minor annoyances, so I will stay with my old style!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;It works!\\&quot; she said, and very well. now she&#x27;s buying it. What more can you say?&lt;br /&gt;No problems to report.</li>
    <li> This is now my new favorite product! I have been searching for an effective antipersperant for some time with no luck. I saw a commercial for this product and decided to give it a try. I was pretty cynical that this would work any differently than the other 10 brands that I have at home. Well after the first day, I noticed a significant differance! I live in Las Vegas - it was 113 yesterday and I stayed dry the entire day - no wetness at all! I am so imazed. The real test will be next week when I need to make several presentations (I get nervous and sweat under my arms) I sure hope this product will work next week when I need it the most! Oh - I also love that there is no white residue on my clothes with this product - I hate that!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It works really well and I like the clean shower scent.  Goes on well.  I am used to stick type of deoderant, but this one has a twist with a cream type gel that comes up out of holes in the tube.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it, that it might be cakey, or goopy, but it wasn&#x27;t, it went on really smooth.  Good product.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very, very pleasant fresh scent called \\&quot;shower clean\\&quot;. It&#x27;s not an overly feminine scent but many ladies will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found it effective. I put it on at night before going to bed. It does protect against perspiration for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to to remember to put it on before bed instead of in the morning, but I have been really happy with this product. I have been helping my husband with some demolition around our house and would  expect to have been sweaty partway through the project but the antiperspirant did its job well, keeping me dry. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This will definitely work, but if you have sensitive skin, use caution.  I have sensitive skin and it did bother my skin a bit and cause irritation.  But it does have a nice, mild scent and keeps odor and wetness away.</li>
    <li> This is a great product especially with spring, summer, and warmer temperatures arriving.  It has a fresh smell, and seems to last all day.  However, it needs to come in a clear formula as it does leave white residue under your arms and clothes.  If you work a physically demanding job or you just sweat a lot, this is a product that you should try.</li>
    <li> I write this review on my wife&#x27;s behalf; she was the consumer of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife liked this product.  She was most happy with the scent, which she describes as lemony or citrus-y.  She describes this as a very fresh scent, without the often overpowering scent of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product went on easily and smoothly.  It&#x27;s not a liquid, so dried quickly, which was a plus for her.  It left no residue on her clothes, and did not clump, flake or ball up, which was very important for sleeveless tops.  This also was a highly positive factor for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no skin irritation or other reaction to the product.  She mentioned that often in the mornings her underarm skin felt, for want of a more descriptive term, \\&quot;tacky,\\&quot; not horribly unfashionable, but more the tactile sensation of almost-dry paint, which is to mean she could feel the product continuing to work to prevent wetness, a day or more after its application.  She admitted that she couldn&#x27;t really tell if it offered a great deal more protection than anything else she has used in the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she purchase it again?  Sure, if the price is competitive.  Will she go out of her way to seek it out?  Probably not, although she said if she saw it in the store she&#x27;d probably pick it up once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a guy&#x27;s point of view, I also enjoyed the scent of this product.  It&#x27;s a little different and distinctive, which I like, definitely not soapy, and yet not overpowering; this kind of product should never compete with a woman&#x27;s perfume/cologne.</li>
    <li> My usual mode of antipersperant is whatever&#x27;s on sale at the supermarket. My second criteria is how it smells.    I don&#x27;t have to be so picky because I just don&#x27;t sweat very much, even when I&#x27;m doing perspiring-type activities. The usual stuff works fine for me.    I decided to put Degree to the test. I applied it as per directions (the night before) so my armpit pores would be hermetically sealed in time to do a day of heavy yardwork.  Even a non-sweater like me would be perspirationally challenged with 10 hours of cutting, raking, bagging, and all the other stuff you do when you&#x27;ve ignored it all summer.    I can report that not an iota of sweat appeared! I didn&#x27;t get any underarm stickiness at all, and I do mean AT ALL. I didn&#x27;t break out, I had absolutely no ill effects whatsoever. The only effect was no sweat, period.    If you sweat like there&#x27;s no tomorrow, it&#x27;d be a great choice for every day use. But for the average woman - unless she&#x27;s a stevedore or works on a chain gain - this product on a daily basis is probably overkill.</li>
    <li> I tried the Degree Clinical Protection TriSolid antiperspirant and deodorant for a week. It goes on in a dry format and isn&#x27;t sticky. It did in fact keep me dry, but I&#x27;m not a big armpit sweater. The shower fresh scent is relatively light. I also put it on my sweatier areas and ran 2.25 miles. I did sweat less in those areas. If you have a problem with wetness, I think Degree Clinical Protection will work well for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m don&#x27;t normally have a problem getting overly sweaty, but a couple of weeks ago I started daily workouts at the local rec center with my 14-year-old daughter. I figured this would be a great time to try out this new \\&quot;clinical protection\\&quot; product. I must say this antiperspirant and deodorant works as advertised. I come out of the weight room with shaky legs, but I smell like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t an old-fashioned roll-on deodorant with a ball. You turn a dial at the bottom and a foamy cream rises up from holes in the dispenser on top. The product goes on smoothly and never burns or stings. I haven&#x27;t noticed any white marks on my clothing.</li>
    <li> My husband has used the male counterpart, and I reviewed it quite favorably - great scent, nice application control, and little mess.  I was excited to receive the female version for myself. And yes, I like it a lot. Nice clean scent and I especially like that it does not seem to stain fabric - often a problem with anti-perspirants! I just wish it came in a little bit smaller container so it could fit in a small purse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Since my hot flashes have begun I sweat a lot and this does greatly cut down the sweat produced under my arms. It seems to work better than the regular anti perspirants. I would reccommend this. I have had no allergic reaction to this either and I apply it in the morning, not at night.</li>
    <li> While I refuse to wax lyric about a deodorant, this worked just fine this morning as I worked out at the gym.  No complaints.  And I do like the consistency....it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I started using it six months ago and this is the only anti-perspirant/deodorant I will ever use.  After a few weeks of initial use, I find I don&#x27;t need to apply it every day or night. I would apply it about once/twice a week or when I go dancing.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from hyperhydrosis for years.  I found that CertainDri would stop it, but it caused so much irritation and itching that I couldn&#x27;t keep using it.  I next tried Drionics, which work but require a lot of time sitting around holding the units in your armpits.  I&#x27;ve also tried Secret Clinical Strength, which decreased but didn&#x27;t stop the perspiration.  Degree Clinical Protection actually stops my persiration when applied the night before.  I also reapply it in the morning (because that&#x27;s when I usually shower or bathe).</li>
    <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much one can say about deodorant, other than does it do its job?  The answer for this product is yes, it does.  I tend to sweat more than most people, and this kept me dry even on a warm day when I was doing a lot of walking up hills.  It doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell, but it does lose one star for being the kind of deodorant you push up through a vent instead of a solid stick.  This semi-solid vent kind runs out too quickly for my tastes, and if you drop it and the casing cracks, you&#x27;re totally out of luck.  At least with a stick, you can still save the pieces and use those until you have time to go buy more deodorant.  But on the whole, I liked it, and it did its job.  4 stars.</li>
    <li> It works very well as a deodorant, leaving a pleasant fragrance. However, it dries into a flaky white residue that can leave markings on dark clothing.</li>
    <li> Degree Clinical Protection for women is a good product.  It was a little awkward at first because I&#x27;m use to solids but it works well.  It isn&#x27;t wet feeling and it lasts all day.  I&#x27;ll purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> If there ever was a trial by fire for an antiperspirant, it&#x27;s testing it in Texas.  Here it&#x27;s not only hot but damp as well, so the opportunity for sweating is boundless.  Because I really hate being soaked in sweat and having sticky underarms during my bike rides, I was delighted to have the opportunity to test this antiperspirant.  I am even more delighted to report that it works in the blast furnace of Texas heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Slight Problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions means applying it at night -- and this means thinking about it just before bed rather than just after a morning shower as I have done for so many years.  However, the results mean that it is worth the small effort to change a habit.  And, if you forget, which I have on occasion, you can apply it in the morning with results almost as good as at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Couple of Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This antiperspirant lasts.  So you can actually forget to use it at all from time to time, and you&#x27;ll still get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it leaves no messy white streaks on your shirt.  The formula apparently soaks into the skin, and the small amount applied with two clicks leaves no visible residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in an area where heat is a problem, I&#x27;d suggest trying this antiperspirant.  You might like it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four and a half stars!</li>
