      <li>I highly recommend this product the best price you can get even comparing in the stores.</li>
      <li>Very easy to figure out.</li>
      <li>It works but leaves residue so be sure to have your cotton ball and grapeseed oil handy to wipe away.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product because I loved the now discontinued strip free sally hansen face wax.</li>

      <li>I love the convenience of this product.</li>
      <li>I guess I need more practice, but, I spread the wax and it did not rip off in one pull-  but pieces.</li>
      <li>Would be better if it included the spatula too.</li>
      <li>Any hotter and your skin will burn so you want to make sure the wax is creamy but not water-like.  </li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great Price, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The more I let the hair grow in, the better.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have something underneath the bottle while using.</li>
      <li>I used the Sally Hansen strip free wax, and while I liked my results, I did not like the price.</li>
      <li>It is better than others i have tried.  </li>
      <li>Would gladly do business again.</li>
      <li>I just wanted to express my love for this product. :)</li>
      <li>This wax doesn&#x27;t give me any rash, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>GiGi Strip Free Wax is great because it&#x27;s versatile, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a fantastic deal</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use:   1.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I got this to &#x27;clean up&#x27; in between visits to save money.</li>
      <li>You may have to go in an pluck in between or to clean it up a bit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really sticky even after you wait the appropriate time to pull off.</li>
      <li>This is true of any waxing system.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be super messy, but surprisingly, it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t put up with these particular containers anymore, although the wax is okay.</li>
      <li>Also, the hair left is still sticky, so it starts to come off more and more as I reapply the wax.  </li>
      <li>(I use a popcicle stick),  wait a couple minutes for hit to harden, grab a end and quickly pull it off.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Gigi strip free wax!</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m super satisfied with this product!</li>
      <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I use this with muslin strips, just to give me a handle, and it never fails!</li>
      <li>It does take some practice to get right.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used a strip free wax I was very apprehensive.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best wax, and I will only use this wax, and will only buy from this seller from now on.  </li>
      <li>really loving how long the hair stays gone (almost 4 weeks).</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use it right after a hot shower where your pores are all opened up.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need fancy equipment and it&#x27;s pretty easy even if you&#x27;ve never been professionally waxed before.</li>
      <li>No mess, easy application.</li>
      <li>The main reason i love it though is because it is really gentle (as gentle as wax can be haha)</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s watery, it&#x27;s most likely too hot for your skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;other than the above stated reason i love this wax</li>
      <li>, i love that there are no strips needed, i love that i can heat it up in the microwave ( usually take 1 minute in my microwave)  </li>
      <li>I find this is more than enough.  </li>
      <li>It contains no weird chemical names.</li>
      <li>I was worried because my skin is pretty acne prone, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin or cause break outs.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get the wax too hot.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I thought the first one was a fluke, but when it happened again, I got a refund from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Great as usual!</li>
      <li>The product says it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;strip free&amp;#34;, but doesn&#x27;t really have enough gripping power to get the job done without having to go over the same spot more than once.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy, not very messy.</li>
      <li>Using a rag as a sort of potholder, I reach in and pick up the votive full of melted wax, then let it sit on the counter for just a minute till it is cool enough to tolerate on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian and have pretty fine hair.</li>
      <li>Make sure the area is dry.</li>
      <li>on my super sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>No one else made a product with as pure ingredients that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried home sugaring systems like MOOM, which worked on coarser hair but couldn&#x27;t pull out my fine hair (like on the eyebrow or upper lip).  </li>
      <li>Once a week, at my own convenience, I heat up this little tub of wax and pull out the sticks to apply.</li>
      <li>The next container formed a huge bubble on one side of the bottom, which made it tilt and fall over, spilling wax onto the dish I put it in to microwave it just in case there was another mishap.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Gigi Strip Free Wax works well on facial hair</li>
      <li>Unless you enjoy wearing ice on your bikini zone to hide the torn open skin</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>
      <li>(Amazon page doesn&#x27;t list the real ingredients for some reason.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>REALLY:</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years for some light facial waxing---upper lip, side burns and chin.</li>
      <li>It does its job very well.</li>
      <li>I bought this wax hoping it would be more convenient and neater than other microwave wax formulas.</li>
      <li>- It&#x27;s pretty cheap compared to other kinds of GiGi.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on very thick, so it doesn&#x27;t really form a good &#x27;strip&#x27; to pull off.</li>
      <li>Received exactly what I expected, quickly.</li>
      <li>- If you&#x27;re doing a large part of your body, you need to keep microwaving it to keep the wax soft unless you&#x27;re using a wax warmer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for small areas but larger areas I would not recommend.</li>
      <li>I was able to cover the areas I wanted (underarms and bikini line) and the results were decent, but the wax wasn&#x27;t hard enough or strong enough to get the results I wanted.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This wax stuck to everything and smelled awful.  Would not buy this product again.  I will stick to what I usually use.</li>
    <li> This is the wax I&#x27;ve been using for years.  Strips are not necessary.  Just heat it up, put it on (I use a popcicle stick),  wait a couple minutes for hit to harden, grab a end and quickly pull it off.  You won&#x27;t believe how well it works.</li>
    <li> I compared ingredients among products; and this one has very little else besides bees&#x27; wax &amp; resin. It contains no weird chemical names. It also costs less per use than all their comparable products, as well as the competitors&#x27; products that I saw. No one else made a product with as pure ingredients that I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS REALLY: Rosin, Beeswax, Glycerin, Honey extract. (Amazon page doesn&#x27;t list the real ingredients for some reason.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. I have heavy-duty hair. I usually have a small percentage of leftover hair to tweeze afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have little trouble removing the residual wax, often using nothing but warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is NOT messy. Smells nice to me. Faintly honey-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I opened it, I microwaved the tub and poured it out into small votive candleholders. Whenever I want to use the product, I take one of the little candleholders full of hardened wax, set it inside a small crockpot that I use for wax only, add a small amount of water on the bottom of the crock pot (not sure if that is necessary), and leave it for an hour. Using a rag as a sort of potholder, I reach in and pick up the votive full of melted wax, then let it sit on the counter for just a minute till it is cool enough to tolerate on my skin.</li>
    <li> A coworker complimented me on my eyebrows and asked where I get them done. I told her my secret... I do it myself with the GiGi Honee Wax. Once a week, at my own convenience, I heat up this little tub of wax and pull out the sticks to apply. It&#x27;s fast, easy, not very messy. The more I let the hair grow in, the better. But obviously, sometimes you just can&#x27;t get away with that. It&#x27;s not going to grab the short hairs, just like any other wax. You may have to go in an pluck in between or to clean it up a bit. That&#x27;s what they do at salons, also, except you don&#x27;t have to worry about salon prices or tipping if you&#x27;re doing it yourself.   Beware, you CAN burn yourself. Don&#x27;t get the wax too hot. Keep it at a honey consistency, if you overheat it, it&#x27;ll be thinner. Let it cool down before you apply.   Beware, you may break out. Don&#x27;t use it right after a hot shower where your pores are all opened up. Or a good workout, for that matter. Wait it out.   Beware, you CAN screw up and get the wax in hair you didn&#x27;t want to pull out. Be very careful when doing your eyebrows!!. You CAN make a total mess of things.   I&#x27;ve been using GiGi for several years and can&#x27;t imagine doing anything else. A tub of this stuff lasts for years, by the way, if all you do is your eyebrows like me.</li>
    <li> Good product for doing Brazilian waxes. The tip is to put the product on thickly. You might need to re due an area twice but its not that painful.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, I tried it before buying from the store that&#x27;s why I got it again, didn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture, that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4, wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective and longer-lasting hair removal method and I think I&#x27;ve found it! GiGi Strip Free Wax is great because it&#x27;s versatile, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive. I&#x27;m Asian and have pretty fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried home sugaring systems like MOOM, which worked on coarser hair but couldn&#x27;t pull out my fine hair (like on the eyebrow or upper lip).  It&#x27;s super easy to use:   1. Microwave the container  2. Spread the wax on with a popsicle stick in direction of the hair growth. Make sure the area is dry. You can use cornstarch or baby powder to dry the area if you don&#x27;t want to buy those waxing prep products.  3. Roll up a little tab on the edge of the spread wax (the tab is used to pull the wax off)  4. Wait for the wax to dry a little (but is still somewhat pliable)  5. Pull off the wax against the direction of hair growth. You want to wait til the wax is dry enough that it will come off in one piece. If you wait too long, the wax will become brittle and fragment into chunks.   It&#x27;s about as painful as taking off a band-aid and it feels less painful once you get used to it. The directions recommend pressing on the skin immediately after ripping the wax off. I don&#x27;t know if that calms the skin (as the directions claim) or just distracts you from the pain, but it works.   Waxing takes some practice but I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with the results. I personally think it&#x27;s less work than using muslin strips. To remove any wax that remains on your skin, put on some baby oil, wait a little, and wash the off with soap and water in the shower. I haven&#x27;t tried any wax remover products, but they seem unnecessary.  Pros:  - It&#x27;s easy! You don&#x27;t need fancy equipment and it&#x27;s pretty easy even if you&#x27;ve never been professionally waxed before. It does take some practice to get right.  - It&#x27;s pretty cheap compared to other kinds of GiGi. You don&#x27;t need to buy a wax warmer or muslin strips.  - It&#x27;s effective. It gets even fine hair if the hair is long enough.- It hasn&#x27;t made my face break out. I was worried because my skin is pretty acne prone, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin or cause break outs.  Cons:  - It&#x27;s sticky and messy. This is true of any waxing system. The wax is made of rosin, so of course it&#x27;s going to be sticky. Do have to be careful not to drip because the wax can be hard to remove.  - If you&#x27;re doing a large part of your body, you need to keep microwaving it to keep the wax soft unless you&#x27;re using a wax warmer.  The cons are not troublesome and are typical of any waxing system. Overall, I&#x27;m super satisfied with this product! It does its job very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third order of this Gigi product and will not be looking for another brand or type of wax!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST wax ever!! I have tried several different brands and this by far is the easiest to use and least expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought lots of these microwave pots in the pots.  This one is pretty small compared to the average size for the price but it&#x27;s one of the few to melt in the time stated on the pot, rather than much longer.  Would be better if it included the spatula too.</li>
    <li> Does not set up hard enough to work effectively.  The product says it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;strip free&amp;#34;, but doesn&#x27;t really have enough gripping power to get the job done without having to go over the same spot more than once.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It works but leaves residue so be sure to have your cotton ball and grapeseed oil handy to wipe away. It does take a little bit longer to set up before you can pull it off then some other brands I have used. Doesn&#x27;t take long to melt in the microwave that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Okay so this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used strip-free wax, and it&#x27;s GREAT!  It didn&#x27;t hurt at all!  I was expecting it to be super messy, but surprisingly, it wasn&#x27;t! I was also expecting to put it in the microwave constantly, but during the whole wax, I only had to put it back in the microwave ONCE.  This is by far the best wax, and I will only use this wax, and will only buy from this seller from now on.  This wax makes DIY waxing a breeze.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One user equates the pain level to ripping off a bandaid, but I say it&#x27;s less than that.&lt;br /&gt;Please refer to the other reviews about tips and how to use.  I just wanted to express my love for this product. :)</li>
    <li> Great as usual! I use this with muslin strips, just to give me a handle, and it never fails! No mess, easy application.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of this product. It&#x27;s great for your legs and arms. Just remember to put a little extra dab at the end of application so that it is easy to pull the wax off. The reasons for 4stars : 1. The label was placed on the instructions. When you try to remove, the ink of the instructions come off with it. So I had to take a guess. 2. I ordered multiple jars. One of them came in cracked. 3. The handle of the jar can also be improved upon.</li>
    <li> I like it so much It&#x27;s make my hair smoth and shine .</li>
    <li> the product is not as good as some of the others that I have tried but it will do the job. Just make sure you have something underneath the bottle while using. It&#x27;s really sticky even after you wait the appropriate time to pull off. Some of the wax stay on the skin and it&#x27;s irritating to get off. It&#x27;s messy but it works.</li>
    <li> Product is as stated. Fast and easy to use. I recommed this product for home use and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I made a mess in my bathroom trying to use this. I&#x27;ve been waxing for 15+ years, usually get it done at a salon. I got this to &#x27;clean up&#x27; in between visits to save money. It doesn&#x27;t go on very thick, so it doesn&#x27;t really form a good &#x27;strip&#x27; to pull off. It came off in pieces and I had to use a TON of baby oil to get the remnant wax off my legs. I had to really pile it on to get the wax trip going in a functional way, and basically used the entire container in one session as a result. I&#x27;d recommend just getting the pre-waxed strips from Veet at a CVS/ Walgreens/Rite Aid if you need it for touch-ups between waxes like I did. I can&#x27;t imagine using this for a regular wax...it totally wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years for some light facial waxing---upper lip, side burns and chin. I love not having to fuss with strips, even for brazilian waxes, which I do not do myself!</li>
    <li> I bought this wax hoping it would be more convenient and neater than other microwave wax formulas. It works well, but I had trouble getting the wax to harden enough to pull off cleanly, so my experience was mostly picking it off in small pieces and leaving a lot of wax behind. I was able to cover the areas I wanted (underarms and bikini line) and the results were decent, but the wax wasn&#x27;t hard enough or strong enough to get the results I wanted. Cleanup wasn&#x27;t too difficult -- the wax is water-soluble -- but there was a lot of cleanup to do.</li>
    <li> This wax doesn&#x27;t give me any rash, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I give 3 stars because it takes awhile to dry after it applies to skin</li>
    <li> Gigi Strip Free Wax works well on facial hair, it is a little on the soft side when cool, but it gets the job done! Unfortunately I have to downrate it because I have now had 2 containers melt in the microwave using the recommended settings... wax everywhere, a complete mess. I thought the first one was a fluke, but when it happened again, I got a refund from Amazon. It might be just a recent batch with defective packaging because I have never had this problem before, but I will look elsewhere until they get this sorted out.</li>
    <li> Terrible hard wax! It breaks while pulling it off! Which is especially terrible when you&#x27;re waxing your bikini zone! Don&#x27;t do it! Unless you enjoy wearing ice on your bikini zone to hide the torn open skin</li>
    <li> I have been using GiGi products for years. my warmer went n i decided to try this. don&#x27;t. would not come off. had to use the hottest water tolerable &amp; baby oil. ruined my night.</li>
    <li> I like the fact you don&#x27;t need the strips to use this wax.  I don&#x27;t wash my skin prior to using the wax, I use a toner to cleanse the skin instead.  I take the lid off, then microwave for 30 seconds, take it and swirl the wax a little with the wooden spatula, then put the wax back in for another 15 seconds.  I only do 15 second intervals in reheating.  I find this is more than enough.  Any hotter and your skin will burn so you want to make sure the wax is creamy but not water-like.  If it&#x27;s watery, it&#x27;s most likely too hot for your skin.  I redo the parts that still have hair left on them.  It won&#x27;t hurt my skin if I keep the wax creamy, not watery, when I am redoing the waxing.  Also, the hair left is still sticky, so it starts to come off more and more as I reapply the wax.  My upper lip is usually the toughest, I redo it about 3 times and it stays pretty hair free after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I am done with the waxing, I use a mix of raw organic shea butter mixed with some jojoba oil, as a skin cleanser/conditioner.  I apply with my finger tips, then use some tissues to wipe the lotion away along with the residual wax.  Works great and my skin is nice afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I always wax the night before and never apply makeup afterward and go out into the sun.  My skin feels it needs a break after the waxing and putting makeup on it would probably burn like crazy.  The waxing leaves my skin sensitive so I make sure I let it rest overnight.  I don&#x27;t use any type of soap on it either after the waxing, just the shea butter and jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> Usually purchase these at the local beauty supply store. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve tried so I was happy when I found it on Amazon but unfortunately the quality of the product is not the same. The wax doesn&#x27;t harden enough so it ends up pulling on the skin. I&#x27;m used to waxing but this product damaged my skin badly...</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I loved the now discontinued strip free sally hansen face wax. But this product requires you to use wax strips to remove the wax. I was really disappointed, especially since I had already put it on my face!</li>
    <li> Avoid it ! It is claimed to be without strip, but the wax does not dry enough so it can not be removed easily.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the worst wax I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> The first time I used a strip free wax I was very apprehensive. I used the Sally Hansen strip free wax, and while I liked my results, I did not like the price. This wax is about a dollar more expensive for about 4 times as much wax so it&#x27;s a fantastic deal and it works incredibly well! I&#x27;m never going back to the more expensive brands! I highly recommend Gigi strip free wax!</li>
    <li> I used the GiGi Strip Free wax for years, but the last four (4) containers (plastic jars) have melted down or blown up in the microwave.1) The bottom melted out of one while the majority of wax left in the container was still hard. 2) The next container formed a huge bubble on one side of the bottom, which made it tilt and fall over, spilling wax onto the dish I put it in to microwave it just in case there was another mishap. 3)  The third one exlpoded in the microwave spewing hot wax all over the inside. I spent hours cleaning up that mess, but of course there is still bits of it in hard-to-reach places, 4) The last one did what the second one did - bubbled on the bottom on one side, tilted, and spilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ridiculous that something that has to be melted to be used is in a container that melts before it does. I follow directions to the lette!r for everything I use. And, the microwave is maybe a year old and works flawlessly. So, that leaves the containers, themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t put up with these particular containers anymore, although the wax is okay. I&#x27;m going to try something else.</li>
    <li> No problem with delivery.  I have used the product for 5 years.  It is better than others i have tried.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great for making hairy candles!</li>
    <li> I really do love this ax but there are a few things that make it only 4 stars instead of 5&lt;br /&gt;- Wax breaks apart sometimes and is hard to peel off(seems to happen more if skin is slightly oilier in that area i.e t-zone)&lt;br /&gt;- Wax stays to soft sometimes too it will peel off without grabbing hair ( still can&#x27;t figure out what causes this as it only happens every once in a while)&lt;br /&gt; - sometimes I have to go over an area 2x to remove all the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than the above stated reason i love this wax, i love that there are no strips needed, i love that i can heat it up in the microwave ( usually take 1 minute in my microwave)  The main reason i love it though is because it is really gentle (as gentle as wax can be haha) on my super sensitive skin.  I have never had any bleeding or rashes or redness that lasted longer than 1 hr, which has never happened with any wax i have ever used.  So for these reasons i put up with the bad things about the product, because the good for me out weighs the bad</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I&#x27;ve had different wax that pulled hair easier. It&#x27;s good for small areas but larger areas I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product the best price you can get even comparing in the stores. The packaging is perfect if needed for a gift. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Save a ton and wax your own eyebrows.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 20 years now and have probably saved thousands by doing it myself.  Very easy to figure out.</li>
    <li> started waxing a few months ago (1st time really hurt). After that the roots were smaller each time I use it. It gets easier and faster. really loving how long the hair stays gone (almost 4 weeks). plus the hairs are getting finer and finer and some not coming back at all. Great Price, fast delivery. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I use this on my nose hairs. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using the GiGi microwave bikini wax formula which is green and much easier to handle than this one. I guess I need more practice, but, I spread the wax and it did not rip off in one pull-  but pieces. I gave up. I use the bikini wax on my face and underarms and it works like a charm. I&#x27;ve spent $ on this, so ill practice practice practice until I&#x27;m perfect at it</li>
    <li> Received exactly what I expected, quickly. Would gladly do business again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> A real waste of money.</li>
    <li> Used for years, the best best best, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else, I use at home, many over heat In there microwave, I heat about 40 secs n see If It&#x27;s liquid In the middle, I don&#x27;t recommend heating the whole jar to a liquid, I&#x27;ve been using over 10 years,</li>
