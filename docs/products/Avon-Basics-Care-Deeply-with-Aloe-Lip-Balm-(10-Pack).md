      <li>The value of this purchase is excellent.  </li>
      <li>This is the BEST lip balm ever made!</li>
      <li>The best chapstick ever</li>
      <li>This is the Best lip balm on the market.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>Great service.</li>
      <li>Great to have.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not always easy finding a sales rep, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This lip balm lasts when applied and provides good coverage.  </li>
      <li>If you have a dog, don&#x27;t leave it within their reach because they love it too!</li>
      <li>It is absolutely the best I have ever used</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>So glad I could get this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and do not have anyone that I know that sells Avon anymore.  </li>
      <li>I love Avon&#x27;s chapstick.</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>Always satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>Avon got this right!</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and have to order for the whole family as they say nothing compares to it.</li>
      <li>It feels great and really sooths dry lips.</li>
      <li>I buy these for my wife and it&#x27;s the only kind of lip balm that she will use.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>so I ordered it right away.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it works the best, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>this is the only lip balm I use -- I love avon products</li>
      <li>I have tried many different lip balms over the years.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find the results nourishing - it simply hangs out on the top of my lips until it gets rubbed away.</li>
      <li>I simply like this product and have used it for many years.  </li>
      <li>There was even a bonus included which I appreciated.</li>
      <li>Personally, I find Avon&#x27;s Dew Kiss to be a more pleasant lip balm, because, though it&#x27;s no more &amp;#34;deeply&amp;#34; nourishing than Care Deeply, it lacks the perfumey taste.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft and it won&#x27;t hurt wounded lips plus a sunscreen!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always surprised that I seem to be in the minority on this lip balm.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Amazon</li>
      <li>Other brands that you buy in the store are too thick and this is very smooth.</li>

    <li> Best lip balm ever. Great service.</li>
    <li> Not much to say... Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I simply like this product and have used it for many years.  The value of this purchase is excellent.  This lip balm lasts when applied and provides good coverage.  I just plain like it, always have.</li>
    <li> This is the Best lip balm on the market. There is no flavor it&#x27;s soft and it won&#x27;t hurt wounded lips plus a sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have to order for the whole family as they say nothing compares to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and do not have anyone that I know that sells Avon anymore.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Amazon so I ordered it right away.  I have to have one of these everywhere because I don&#x27;t like dry lips.  Other brands that you buy in the store are too thick and this is very smooth.</li>
    <li> We use these all the time.  Great to have.</li>
    <li> I love Avon&#x27;s chapstick. I&#x27;ve tried everything and I always go back to Avon&#x27;s Care Deeply. But it&#x27;s not always easy finding a sales rep, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. My family knows that I have a stash so it often gets raided. If you have a dog, don&#x27;t leave it within their reach because they love it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always surprised that I seem to be in the minority on this lip balm. For me, it&#x27;s just okay. I dislike that it has a perfumey taste - it doesn&#x27;t SMELL like perfume, but if you happen to get any in your mouth, it&#x27;s foul. I don&#x27;t find the results nourishing - it simply hangs out on the top of my lips until it gets rubbed away. Personally, I find Avon&#x27;s Dew Kiss to be a more pleasant lip balm, because, though it&#x27;s no more &amp;#34;deeply&amp;#34; nourishing than Care Deeply, it lacks the perfumey taste.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. Keep some with me always.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lip balm ever made! So soothing! I don&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different lip balms over the years.  Nothing beats this for me</li>
    <li> The best chapstick ever and I will never use anything else. There was even a bonus included which I appreciated.</li>
    <li> this is the only lip balm I use -- I love avon products</li>
    <li> So glad I could get this lip balm.  Very happy with order and delivery</li>
    <li> I have used Avon&#x27;s Aloe Lip Balm for as long as I can remember. It is absolutely the best I have ever used and I will not be without it. I have it , at my desk,in my purse,at my bedside ,at my chair where I watch TV and in my kitchen. That is why I order 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It feels great and really sooths dry lips.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. No waxy, greasy, messy nonsense! Avon got this right! The wife got me to try this due to my some what dry lips (ya, I&#x27;m a dude). Anyway, it works the best, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my wife and it&#x27;s the only kind of lip balm that she will use.&lt;br /&gt;She swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;The one time a year that I ever use it, I have no complaints either.</li>
    <li> It says I would receive 10 chapsticks &amp; i only received one. Not Happy that I paid $13 for one chapstick!</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with this product</li>
