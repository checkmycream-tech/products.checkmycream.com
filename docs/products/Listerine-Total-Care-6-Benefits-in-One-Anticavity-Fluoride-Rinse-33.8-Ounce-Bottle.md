### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Everything is Awesome!!!</li>
      <li>but I find this product to be wonderful, AND a deal when you buy it in bulk!</li>
      <li>However, when I tried to eat some delicious barbeque potato chips I noticed something amiss.</li>
      <li>and this is a great supporter.</li>
      <li>The burning sensation is not unbearable, and my mouth feels great once I spit it out.</li>
      <li>I have had great dentist visits for years</li>
      <li>This is a great mouthwash.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems good to update the review to state that my mouth has stopped burning.  </li>
      <li>I had heard so many people say that Listerine is great for gingivitis, so I went to get some.  </li>
      <li>It tastes like grape soda, but make sure you keep in mind not to swallow it!</li>
      <li>I liked it and continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>Where the heck did they ever get that kind of number from?   </li>
      <li>The FDA has determined that sodium fluoride is effective in preventing cavities but has not found this ingredient to be effective in removing plaque or preventing gum disease.\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>When I saw this particular brand, I thought awesome.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love the refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>I get better reports from my dentist now.</li>
      <li>The taste is pretty good.</li>
      <li>A month later, I went to my orthodontist for quick checkup and to talk about a plan and he was impressed that my teeth had improved.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because I found this product to be extremely effective at dissolving plaque and therefore keeping my gums much healthier.</li>
      <li>However, the CS of Amazon is pretty nice to fully refunded me for the purchase and just let me keep it.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t be able to return this item or contact amazon via the normal channels since it is considered a hazardous material.</li>
      <li>the taste easily surpasses &#x27;the rinse&#x27; historically available in the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>For a great germ fighting mouthwash use regular or Advanced Listerine.</li>
      <li>so i pay for 6 and get only one,not happy</li>
      <li>So far I am having good results with this modification of use.</li>
      <li>I good rinse with this right before bed will kill all the germs that grow overnight and let you wake up still feeling pretty fresh.</li>
      <li>At first I liked it because that fresh breath feeling lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>At first I thought okay</li>
      <li>Amazon, to their great credit, made good on this false advertising by both Johnson &amp; Johson and Target and refunded my $$ including shipping &amp; tax.</li>
      <li>I have to go to a special orthodontist for help.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s freaking me out more because one of the ingredients is phosphoric acid (corrosive acid in cola), but this stuff is just too intense to use as directed.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, this is the only mouthwash I&#x27;ve found that is supposed to be good for your gums AND teeth.  </li>
      <li>Now it may be because its my first time trying this product out, but your mouth will feel VERY clean and fresh after wards.</li>
      <li>I liked this product at first, but after a week of use the inside of my mouth became very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>But, I will have to test more products to see which one will work for extremely sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>then I buy it because it can be worth the convenience.  </li>
      <li>I used it as advised on the bottle, and was trying to ignore the persistent burning sensation, and my gums felt even more sensitive.</li>
      <li>The three companies include Johnson &amp; Johnson which manufacturers the popular Listerine Total Care mouthwash.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, maybe that is a good thing for people trying to curb their night time snacking.    </li>
      <li>Right?</li>
      <li>right when I wake up, then I brush after breakfast.  </li>
      <li>Or I guzzed hot chocolate right after they gave it to me at Starbucks.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I am a glutton for pain, but I personally find this formulation of Listerine wonderful and have seen improvements at my dental checkups over the past year I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
      <li>but like I ate really really hot soup without blowing on it.</li>
      <li>In addition, the FDA took issue with the fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson included the phrase \\&quot;total care\\&quot; on their product, as it implies this version of Listerine can help treat more than just cavities.  </li>
      <li>I first used this product as a sample from my dentist.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too harsh and I don&#x27;t think it did that good of a job.</li>
      <li>And I also didn&#x27;t like the taste that much.</li>
      <li>It absolutely fries my mouth</li>
      <li>After brushing, you&#x27;re supposed to swish it around your mouth for a whole minute...</li>
      <li>Thanks, will buy again</li>
      <li>I really like this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>The company explicitly recommends that they have access to something else until they are older.</li>
      <li>That pretty much leaves me using it only in the morning,</li>
      <li>After a few more days, the inside of my mouth felt like it had been burned.  </li>
      <li>Not the normal 10 minute numbness</li>
      <li>I think the most I&#x27;ve seen it for in stores is about $8, and it&#x27;s hard for me to fork over even that much.  </li>
      <li>because it is still a fluoride rinse, it isn&#x27;t something which very young children should have access.</li>
      <li>I mean of course you get good breath, but for overall health?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on once a day and my tongue constantly feels like I just ate scalding hot soup.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive teeth, this is not the mouthwash for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to just completely write my review, even though its been like 2 years, but damn this thing burned my mouth and stripped away everything.</li>
      <li>The back of the label tells you to rinse for 1 whole minute.</li>
      <li>I do not find the sting to be nearly as sever as the mint Listerine formulations.  </li>
      <li>I wonder if all the people complaining about their mouths burning maybe have sensitive mouths because of bacteria or gingivitis?  </li>
      <li>Being an inquisitive person, I wondered if the product would be more satisfactory if I used it once a day and only a few times a week.  </li>
      <li>and then when I wake up I have stagnant, slightly sweet, but not unpleasant Listerine trapped under the thing, possibly strengthening my teeth all night long!</li>
      <li>Due to the fact that I&#x27;ve had more problems with my gums than my teeth over the last 20 years, I thought this would help aid my gums, and the dry mouth feeling.</li>
      <li>I have no way of verifying the claims on the label, except to say that it does improve my breath, but no better than the original Listerine.</li>
      <li>If I discover any negative long term effects I&#x27;ll be sure to update.</li>
      <li>- it foams up and the bubbles pop, sending drops all over your face (and in your eyes, if not careful).</li>
      <li>I bought this item thanks to its low cost relative to a multi bottle package of similarly sized bottles of 6-benefit Crest.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never experienced the \\&quot;scalded tongue\\&quot; sensation, but I definitely sometimes wish the flavor didn&#x27;t last so long because nothing tastes good when you&#x27;ve got purple mint in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>This wonder product may be the only mouthwash which we end up needing in between regular professional cleannings.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, my gums feel even more sensitive than before using this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving what&#x27;s left to an unsuspecting family member and going back to my old antiseptic.</li>
      <li>It seemed extremely harsh at first, so I thought I&#x27;d use it just once a day until I got used to it.</li>
      <li>I have to admit, this stuff burns your mouth like hell the first couple of times, and actually turned me off using it for a few weeks.   </li>
      <li>YES, it burns a little, it has alcohol in it, what do you expect really?  </li>

<li> I have to admit, this stuff burns your mouth like hell the first couple of times, and actually turned me off using it for a few weeks.   </li>
<li> YES, it burns a little, it has alcohol in it, what do you expect really?  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s like that feeling when you consume hot soup too fast and your mouth just feels weird.    </li>
<li> After a recent visit to the dentist, this product was recommended for my teeth, gums, and dry mouth.</li>
<li> I complained to my dentist, and he recommended the Listerine Total Care to me as he claimed it has much less alcohol than the other versions of Listerine (true or not?).</li>
<li> Additionally, I have read that long time usage of mouth wash that contains alcohol, which this does, can increase the risk of mouth cancer.</li>
<li> I wrote a long review there too.</li>
<li> This does not burn my mouth leaving that white scum feeling like other brands do, nor does it leave much of an aftertaste for me.  </li>
<li> This is a single bottle of Listerine and not a 6 pack as indicated.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I got a weird case of gingivitis.  </li>
<li> Icy mint(I bought this one).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been getting small toothaches recently because I need a root canal.</li>
<li> According to a press release from the FDA, \\&quot;These mouth rinse products contain the active ingredient sodium fluoride.</li>
<li> While I am not certain of the veracity of that claim, the taste alone makes this mouth wash less than desirable.</li>
<li> In the end, I would have to say the savings was not worth it in this instance.</li>
<li> Although, I didn&#x27;t like having to wait a half hour to eat and rink.  </li>
<li> I like feeling the burn and knowing that germs are being killed.</li>
<li> First of all, while it doesn&#x27;t taste like chocolate, the flavor is not -that bad-.</li>
<li> I usually use Listerine Vanilla because I like the taste</li>
<li> Each of the three companies are now required to correct these violations, or in other words, discontinue making false claims, within 15 days.\\&quot;    </li>
<li> This stuff may taste bad but that DOES NOT mean it works</li>
<li> Hard to find out after it leaves your mouth parched from the burning.</li>
<li> Shoddy practice....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this item thanks to its low cost relative to a multi bottle package of similarly sized bottles of 6-benefit Crest. Unfortunately, while this seems to work, it tastes foul, and burns. In the end, I would have to say the savings was not worth it in this instance. Additionally, I have read that long time usage of mouth wash that contains alcohol, which this does, can increase the risk of mouth cancer. While I am not certain of the veracity of that claim, the taste alone makes this mouth wash less than desirable.</li>
    <li> I am a person who HATES the faste of mint. Brushing my teeth with grown-up toothpaste makes me gag, but it has to be done. I really like this mouthwash. First of all, while it doesn&#x27;t taste like chocolate, the flavor is not -that bad-. secondly, you can feel it working! The burning sensation is not unbearable, and my mouth feels great once I spit it out. Once thing I noticed that that I do need to spit multiple times, but I try to do so without rinsing with water and the directions suggest. If you have sensitive teeth, this is not the mouthwash for you.</li>
    <li> This is more than a mere mouthwash. Strengthening enamel, it attacks cavities head on--even reversing the process. It&#x27;s also helped my gums too. This wonder product may be the only mouthwash which we end up needing in between regular professional cleannings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the taste easily surpasses &#x27;the rinse&#x27; historically available in the dentist&#x27;s office. Using it is not an unpleasant task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because it is still a fluoride rinse, it isn&#x27;t something which very young children should have access. The company explicitly recommends that they have access to something else until they are older. Fluoride is poisonous if swallowed.</li>
    <li> This is a single bottle of Listerine and not a 6 pack as indicated. You won&#x27;t be able to return this item or contact amazon via the normal channels since it is considered a hazardous material. This is one of those times when there is a total breakdown in the way online purchasing works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Listerine fan and have been for years. I like feeling the burn and knowing that germs are being killed. The problem with this variety of Listerine is the inclusion of fluoride. I thought it lessened it&#x27;s germ fighting power because it didn&#x27;t feel the same in my mouth when I used it. It felt weaker. And I also didn&#x27;t like the taste that much. For fluoride I recommend brushing with toothpaste with fluoride in it and using ACT mouthwash. For a great germ fighting mouthwash use regular or Advanced Listerine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a very big fan of mouth washes. I&#x27;ve been using them on and off for years, but I never found them to work well, plus they made my breath stink because of all the alcohol. I complained to my dentist, and he recommended the Listerine Total Care to me as he claimed it has much less alcohol than the other versions of Listerine (true or not?). I have to admit, this stuff burns your mouth like hell the first couple of times, and actually turned me off using it for a few weeks.   I tend to have a problem with plaque build up, which occasionally causes inflamation...this encouraged me to give the Total Care another go. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I found this product to be extremely effective at dissolving plaque and therefore keeping my gums much healthier. Despite the fact that it tastes and smells nasty, it actually improves my breath. It&#x27;s like Buckley&#x27;s cough syrup, it tastes terrible but it works. If I discover any negative long term effects I&#x27;ll be sure to update.</li>
    <li> I suffer from gingivitis.  I have to go to a special orthodontist for help.  He told me that I may need surgery.  After my last appointment, I decided to get this in hopes of improving my teeth.  A month later, I went to my orthodontist for quick checkup and to talk about a plan and he was impressed that my teeth had improved.  So, I am going to keep up using the Listerine.      The sting was not that bad.  Although, I didn&#x27;t like having to wait a half hour to eat and rink.  Still, if this will help my teeth, then I&#x27;m for it.    Thank you.</li>
    <li> I tough 6 pack but they sent only one,no information about customer service or phone number  so i pay for 6 and get only one,not happy</li>
    <li> I just brought this at giant an hour ago, came home and used it. The taste is pretty good. It tastes like grape soda, but make sure you keep in mind not to swallow it! I&#x27;ve been getting small toothaches recently because I need a root canal. Before I resort to the dentist, I&#x27;m changing my diet to toxin-removing foods and herbs. I found out that I can help the body get rid of the bacteria and this is a great supporter. The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that it burns after about 15-20 seconds. The back of the label tells you to rinse for 1 whole minute. At 20-25 seconds. I had to spit it out because it burns. Now it may be because its my first time trying this product out, but your mouth will feel VERY clean and fresh after wards. You&#x27;ll love the refreshing feeling. They have 3 flavors. Regular mint. Icy mint(I bought this one). And cinnamon I believe.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s freaking me out more because one of the ingredients is phosphoric acid (corrosive acid in cola), but this stuff is just too intense to use as directed.  After brushing, you&#x27;re supposed to swish it around your mouth for a whole minute...no way I could do that.  It absolutely fries my mouth and I have to spit it out by 10 seconds.  Not ADA accepted either.    I&#x27;ve found the only way I can even swish it 15 seconds is if I don&#x27;t brush before using it.  That pretty much leaves me using it only in the morning, right when I wake up, then I brush after breakfast.  I sometimes get in another swish later in the day, but not after brushing anymore...yikes.    ...and don&#x27;t even try gargling with this stuff - it foams up and the bubbles pop, sending drops all over your face (and in your eyes, if not careful).</li>
    <li> This is a rip off. When I ordered the title specifically said Pack of six. I received one bottle that cost me ten bucks. NO I did not misunderstand the wording. This was supposed to be a sale from target through Amazon.  Shoddy practice....</li>
    <li> I first used this product as a sample from my dentist.  I liked it and continue to use it.  I get better reports from my dentist now.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash.    I wonder if all the people complaining about their mouths burning maybe have sensitive mouths because of bacteria or gingivitis?  Eventually the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; goes away if you use the product regularly.  I&#x27;ve never experienced the \\&quot;scalded tongue\\&quot; sensation, but I definitely sometimes wish the flavor didn&#x27;t last so long because nothing tastes good when you&#x27;ve got purple mint in your mouth.  On the other hand, maybe that is a good thing for people trying to curb their night time snacking.    Anyway, this is the only mouthwash I&#x27;ve found that is supposed to be good for your gums AND teeth.  That simplifies my life.   But don&#x27;t pay $36!  Where the heck did they ever get that kind of number from?   I think the most I&#x27;ve seen it for in stores is about $8, and it&#x27;s hard for me to fork over even that much.  I always compare Listerine prices to ACT.  Listerine Total is always more expensive, but if it seems like it&#x27;s not too much more expensive then I buy it because it can be worth the convenience.  Before I got this product I used to use one mouthwash in the morning for gums and a different one in the evening for fluoride. I have to wear an anti-tooth-grinding thing when I sleep and if I don&#x27;t rinse before bed with this stuff I wake up with FUNKY bad breath because of the stagnant spit trapped under the anti-grinding thing.  Instead I put the thing in my mouth and swish the Listerine and then when I wake up I have stagnant, slightly sweet, but not unpleasant Listerine trapped under the thing, possibly strengthening my teeth all night long!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week. It seemed extremely harsh at first, so I thought I&#x27;d use it just once a day until I got used to it. I&#x27;m still on once a day and my tongue constantly feels like I just ate scalding hot soup. I&#x27;m giving what&#x27;s left to an unsuspecting family member and going back to my old antiseptic. I have no way of verifying the claims on the label, except to say that it does improve my breath, but no better than the original Listerine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from target fulfilled by amazon as pack of 6, which eventually comes to be only 1. However, the CS of Amazon is pretty nice to fully refunded me for the purchase and just let me keep it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. I usually use Listerine Vanilla because I like the taste and I have a severe case of halitophobia.     When I saw this particular brand, I thought awesome. Since I&#x27;m going to rinse with listerine anyway, I may as well whiten my teeth and prevent cavities. Right? Wrong.    I&#x27;ve only used it twice. At first I liked it because that fresh breath feeling lasts for hours. However, when I tried to eat some delicious barbeque potato chips I noticed something amiss. My tounge was numb. Not the normal 10 minute numbness u feel after Listerine, but like I ate really really hot soup without blowing on it. Or I guzzed hot chocolate right after they gave it to me at Starbucks. I read in a reply that you aren&#x27;t supposed to gargle this product. However, it doesn&#x27;t say not to on the package. There are no warnings that it will feel like your tongue has been scalded. Also, my sense of taste is diminished. I&#x27;m kind of afraid this won&#x27;t go away, but I definitely know that I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff may taste bad but that DOES NOT mean it works: 9/29/2010: \\&quot;The makers of Listerine may need to wash their mouths out with soap for misleading consumers.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that it is going after three big mouthwash manufacturers for making unfounded claims that their products remove plaque and strengthen gums.  The three companies include Johnson &amp; Johnson which manufacturers the popular Listerine Total Care mouthwash. According to a press release from the FDA, \\&quot;These mouth rinse products contain the active ingredient sodium fluoride. The FDA has determined that sodium fluoride is effective in preventing cavities but has not found this ingredient to be effective in removing plaque or preventing gum disease.\\&quot;    In addition, the FDA took issue with the fact that Johnson &amp; Johnson included the phrase \\&quot;total care\\&quot; on their product, as it implies this version of Listerine can help treat more than just cavities.  Each of the three companies are now required to correct these violations, or in other words, discontinue making false claims, within 15 days.\\&quot;    I bought (on Amazon) the advertised six(6) 33.8 oz. bottles from Target for their \\&quot;bargain\\&quot; price; they sent me one(1) bottle and would not allow returns. Amazon, to their great credit, made good on this false advertising by both Johnson &amp; Johson and Target and refunded my $$ including shipping &amp; tax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I got a weird case of gingivitis.  I used peroxide off and on as directed and the gingivitis just wouldn&#x27;t go away and my gums kept flaring up.  I had heard so many people say that Listerine is great for gingivitis, so I went to get some.  I have had great dentist visits for years and I know that this flare up was just hormones.  The Listerine corrected the issue, as the peroxide didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay for Listerine.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I am a glutton for pain, but I personally find this formulation of Listerine wonderful and have seen improvements at my dental checkups over the past year I&#x27;ve been using it.  YES, it burns a little, it has alcohol in it, what do you expect really?  I do not find the sting to be nearly as sever as the mint Listerine formulations.  This does not burn my mouth leaving that white scum feeling like other brands do, nor does it leave much of an aftertaste for me.  Perhaps I am just used to alcohol-based mouthwashes as I have been using them since I was a teenager but I find this product to be wonderful, AND a deal when you buy it in bulk!</li>
    <li> After a recent visit to the dentist, this product was recommended for my teeth, gums, and dry mouth. I used it as advised on the bottle, and was trying to ignore the persistent burning sensation, and my gums felt even more sensitive. Due to the fact that I&#x27;ve had more problems with my gums than my teeth over the last 20 years, I thought this would help aid my gums, and the dry mouth feeling. Unfortunately, my gums feel even more sensitive than before using this product. However, I tested it using the sample my Dentist gave me, so I didn&#x27;t lose any money. My daughter can use this product, with no problems. But, I will have to test more products to see which one will work for extremely sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> I hate waking up with a nasty tasting mouth. I good rinse with this right before bed will kill all the germs that grow overnight and let you wake up still feeling pretty fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to just completely write my review, even though its been like 2 years, but damn this thing burned my mouth and stripped away everything. At first I thought okay that&#x27;s how it should be, but after I tried ACT, no way it should be like this.    It&#x27;s too harsh and I don&#x27;t think it did that good of a job. I mean of course you get good breath, but for overall health? Hard to find out after it leaves your mouth parched from the burning. It&#x27;s like that feeling when you consume hot soup too fast and your mouth just feels weird.    Try ACT instead for overall oral health. I wrote a long review there too.</li>
    <li> Thanks, will buy again</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first, but after a week of use the inside of my mouth became very sensitive.  After a few more days, the inside of my mouth felt like it had been burned.  I have discontinued use of the product.  You may not experience these symptoms, but I have quit using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems good to update the review to state that my mouth has stopped burning.  Being an inquisitive person, I wondered if the product would be more satisfactory if I used it once a day and only a few times a week.  So far I am having good results with this modification of use.</li>
    <li> Everything is Awesome!!!</li>
