      <li>Great for chlorine and hairspray build up.</li>
      <li>Works great every time.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s concentrated, removes chlorine, and is also a good deal.</li>
      <li>Just follow up shampooing with a really good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The cleansing after washing with this shampoo is excellent, it really strips away all the chemical residue from the chlorinated water.</li>
      <li>I also make sure to use a good conditioner with it-</li>
      <li>now looks shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s Shampoo 2 is an excellent clarifying shampoo, so I&#x27;m a little baffled why the company feels the need for this one.ffled why the company feels the need for this one.</li>
      <li>This product worked beautifully and left their hair clean and smoooth</li>
      <li>But it does a fantastic job cleaning my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and will enjoy purchasing this on line.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three for many years with very satisfactory results.</li>
      <li>Then, we used it up too quickly so that it will be nice to have a big bottle of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer another more traditional shampoo scent, but I guess it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Used to use SwimAway, but this works far better and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in the hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it as a clarifying shampoo, not when there are so many other options out there that do the job so much better.</li>
      <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t clean effectively; it most definitely ISN&#x27;T</li>
      <li>OTOH, I actually NEED a leave-in conditioner on the ends of my hair in order to be able to brush through it.</li>
      <li>I only wash my hair about 2 times a week, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this any more than that.</li>
      <li>Perhaps its stating the obvious, but it&#x27;s either that, or you will be left with a delightful broom-like hair that&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>Thanks Much!</li>
      <li>However, I would strongly recommend conditioning to ensure your hair is not left exposed.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great if you live in an area with hard water or you swim everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>removes the chlorine very well and gives my hair volume</li>
      <li>This shampoo works really well with getting the chlorine out.  </li>
      <li>I use this on my daughter after going swiming &amp; they put to much chlorine in the pool.</li>
      <li>Whatever ingredients in this shampoo that makes my hair look oily apparently do nothing at all to make it smooth or easy to work with; it leaves my hair a tangled mess.</li>
      <li>But the main reason I rely on this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to trigger any of my allergies.</li>
      <li>I suppose that would have been very useful for steel mill workers 90 years ago, but even though I live in a large, urban area, there simply does not seem to be so much pollution that I need a special shampoo to regularly remove it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you swim a lot.</li>
      <li>One strange thing: it smells like sweet tarts, the candy.</li>
      <li>Finally a product that really works!  </li>
      <li>If you are a frequent swimmer, you might use this to remove chlorine, but you would need to follow it with a 2nd shampoo&amp;rinse step with a standard shampoo that would actually clean your hair.</li>
      <li>I have 2 daughters who swim and this is the only shampoo we&#x27;ve found that really gets the chlorine smell out of their hair.</li>
      <li>It does say that it removes chlorine and &amp;#34;impurities,&amp;#34; so it supposedly has chelating properties for frequent swimmers.</li>
      <li>It does not remove any natural oils or conditioners from my hair.</li>
      <li>I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My son the swimmer finally has his hair color back to normal.</li>
      <li>For me, Ultraswim was better, though not great.</li>
      <li>and it took the green right out.</li>

    <li> The only shampoo I can use now. Keeps all grease away!!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for swimmers. Great to buy in bulk for savings. But the main reason I rely on this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to trigger any of my allergies. It has been a great relief to find a product without fragrances or ingredients that irritate my nose or skin.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  Thanks Much!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well, especially getting pool chlorine out.</li>
    <li> We are a repeat user as we have swim team swimmers in our house. I have a blond who swears by it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> removes the chlorine very well and gives my hair volume</li>
    <li> Have kids that are on swim team.  Pool uses LOTS of chlorine.  This shampoo works really well with getting the chlorine out.  Just follow up shampooing with a really good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo: it&#x27;s concentrated, removes chlorine, and is also a good deal. One strange thing: it smells like sweet tarts, the candy. I don&#x27;t know why, and I sometimes forget until I pour it out to wash my hair, and it&#x27;s always so strange. I&#x27;d prefer another more traditional shampoo scent, but I guess it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and will enjoy purchasing this on line.  We had a hair stylist who sold it but we no longer get our hair done there so I was very happy to see it on line with amazon.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that really works!  I have 3 girls that swim, and chlorine build up in the hair is a big problem.  This product worked beautifully and left their hair clean and smoooth again.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I could find a conditioner that worked as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product following the recommendation of my hairdresser, it actually works! I swim almost every day, and now I do not have a chlorine smell with me all day long! I tried another brand - but found that I am allergic to it. Will continue to use this one.</li>
    <li> Used to use SwimAway, but this works far better and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in the hair. Price at Amazon is unbeatable. Highly recommended if you swim a lot.</li>
    <li> My hair goes green if I even look at chlorine pools.  This is the only shampoo that seems to actually get the green out and keep it at bay.  I am over 40 and have never had luck with other products.  It is not the chlorine that turns the hair green.  Chlorine damages the hair which allows the minerals to get into the hair and turn it green.  Whatever this shampoo does works.</li>
    <li> I have 2 daughters who swim and this is the only shampoo we&#x27;ve found that really gets the chlorine smell out of their hair.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; service!</li>
    <li> My son the swimmer finally has his hair color back to normal. Love it!</li>
    <li> excellent product for swimmers</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this shampoo after we go for a swim. The cleansing after washing with this shampoo is excellent, it really strips away all the chemical residue from the chlorinated water. However, I would strongly recommend conditioning to ensure your hair is not left exposed. Perhaps its stating the obvious, but it&#x27;s either that, or you will be left with a delightful broom-like hair that&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> Always use it to remove odor of hair dye. Works great every time.</li>
    <li> Great for chlorine and hairspray build up.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I feel like the quantity is not exactly 33.8 ounces. I&#x27;m cheated.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great if you live in an area with hard water or you swim everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I do both and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Shampoo Three is great at getting impurities out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It now looks shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought the small size of this product for my 3 daughters and I to use after we swim. Then, we used it up too quickly so that it will be nice to have a big bottle of it. I have compared the price of this at ULTA and it is a lot cheaper here online and when you buy the bigger one.</li>
    <li> Great for removing hair spray build up. I use this on my daughter after going swiming &amp; they put to much chlorine in the pool. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair gets so disgustingly oily, and this does a great job of removing that. I only wash my hair about 2 times a week, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this any more than that. I also make sure to use a good conditioner with it- lately I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil brand conditioners. But it does a fantastic job cleaning my hair. I also used it while lifeguarding and it took the green right out.</li>
    <li> One star doesn&#x27;t indicate, &amp;#34;I hate it;&amp;#34; it simply indicates that this shampoo did not work, at all, for me. I swim twice a week and after a month of using this shampoo my hair was markedly worse. Even my hair stylist commented that it was like cutting through wire. For me, Ultraswim was better, though not great. Trying Triswim next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo three for many years with very satisfactory results.</li>
    <li> I am a regular pool swimmer.  This product has kept my hair from getting that chlorine damaged look.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using this on and off over a period of several weeks, and I&#x27;m not certain what it&#x27;s supposed to do specifically. It certainly doesn&#x27;t clean effectively; it most definitely ISN&#x27;T a &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoo, regardless of what&#x27;s printed on the label. It does not remove any natural oils or conditioners from my hair. By the end of the day, my hair feels as if I used a conditioner that I neglected to rinse out sufficiently even if I used no conditioner at all. It makes my hair look and feel greasy and makes it hang in dull and dirty strings. OTOH, I actually NEED a leave-in conditioner on the ends of my hair in order to be able to brush through it. Whatever ingredients in this shampoo that makes my hair look oily apparently do nothing at all to make it smooth or easy to work with; it leaves my hair a tangled mess. It does say that it removes chlorine and &amp;#34;impurities,&amp;#34; so it supposedly has chelating properties for frequent swimmers. The directions don&#x27;t specify what other impurities that your hair attracts that this shampoo can remove so I&#x27;ll assume they are referring to pollution. I suppose that would have been very useful for steel mill workers 90 years ago, but even though I live in a large, urban area, there simply does not seem to be so much pollution that I need a special shampoo to regularly remove it. I use other clarifying shampoos that work well enough; another one is superfluous. If you are a frequent swimmer, you might use this to remove chlorine, but you would need to follow it with a 2nd shampoo&amp;rinse step with a standard shampoo that would actually clean your hair. I ended up dumping the rest of the bottle. I can&#x27;t recommend it as a clarifying shampoo, not when there are so many other options out there that do the job so much better. In fact, one of the best comes from Paul Mitchell: it&#x27;s Shampoo 2 is an excellent clarifying shampoo, so I&#x27;m a little baffled why the company feels the need for this one.ffled why the company feels the need for this one.</li>
