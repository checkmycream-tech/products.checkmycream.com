### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Good price!!</li>
      <li>This is perfect.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this moisturizer in conjunction with my pre-makeup regiment, and will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m imagining this, as I spend a great deal of time in the sun kayaking.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice day cream with sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Because it really is as good as all the hype.</li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>Nice feel, good moisturizer, but nowhere on the box or container does it claim to have sunscreen on it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and safe, good price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a &#x27;miracle cream&#x27; but it does what it claims, it moistens your skin and provides a sunscreen, I personally love it.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial moisturizer with SPF I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Still on the hunt for something more lightweight.</li>
      <li>Favorite moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>My skin is nice and smooth after using this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Use a lot of their products and love but this one is like a lot of moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried..</li>
      <li>but I imagine they&#x27;re pretty good as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horribly pricey, and easy to find.</li>
      <li>Light on skin, good moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is light, not greasy, has no odor</li>
      <li>This product is light weight and does not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>The price is competitive and I was happy to find it on Amazon after going to my local health store and they were out of it.</li>
      <li>I also really like this brand&#x27;s product line - not as chemically-laden as some with some great products for the very inexpensive price point.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, I don&#x27;t break out yet feels good, not dry.  </li>
      <li>Still put some sunblock on top of this cream just because in CA the sun in very aggressive</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy, it protects my fair skin from burning enough for daily use, it goes great with the glycolic acid, and also works really well with the primer under foundation and make up.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is non greasy and blends quickly into my face.</li>
      <li>With the free-shipping, it is very reasonable in price.</li>
      <li>Goes on super clean, you don&#x27;t need much, and after just a couple of weeks there is a really marked difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thick cream but for women like me with dry skin, is perfect.</li>
      <li>Does this cream really provide sun protection?</li>
      <li>Shipping and fulfillment from the seller was fast and convenient.</li>
      <li>I use the night cream by the same brand on a regular basis and I felt really good about the fact that it was truly all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>While like most sunblock creams it is not as moisturizing as other day creams, it does the job.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>What I noticed about all Reviva products that you need just a very little for the application, which is good because it&#x27;ll last longer .  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s working out very well.</li>
      <li>I wear Bare Minerals makeup -- first using Bare Minerals Skin Rev Upper, then my Reviva SPF 25 moisturizer, then follow it with Bare Minerals Primer on top before the makeup.</li>
      <li>Finally a face moisturizer that has absolutely no perfume and no nasty odor.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this cream for a week only, so far I can say I like it.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and wanted a product that was gentle, offered protection from the sun and did not have harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and absorbs instantly so I can wear my regular makeup over it.</li>
      <li>While the label doesn&#x27;t reflect the SPF, I&#x27;ve been wearing this all summer under my make-up in North Florida and have never gotten so much as pink while being out and about on a normal workday, including morning walks outdoors.</li>
      <li>Amazing that such simple things you expect to get in a facial cream is so difficult to find.</li>

    <li> I bought this specifically for the SPF 25 factor--it&#x27;s hard to find face creams with higher than 15.  While I like the cream, the company has removed the SPF designation from the container.&lt;br /&gt;I challenge them to explain this.  Does this cream really provide sun protection?</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working out very well.</li>
    <li> Finally a face moisturizer that has absolutely no perfume and no nasty odor. I can use it all over my face without my eyes burning or watering! Amazing that such simple things you expect to get in a facial cream is so difficult to find. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;miracle cream&#x27; but it does what it claims, it moistens your skin and provides a sunscreen, I personally love it. It makes my skin soft and absorbs instantly so I can wear my regular makeup over it. Its not greasy or oily and like I said it doesn&#x27;t stink!! That&#x27;s an A+ for me.</li>
    <li> This is my third jar (purchased twice from another online company). This moisturizer is non greasy and blends quickly into my face. I wear Bare Minerals makeup -- first using Bare Minerals Skin Rev Upper, then my Reviva SPF 25 moisturizer, then follow it with Bare Minerals Primer on top before the makeup. It sounds like a lot of layers, but everything seems to work well together for me. Initially, this moisturizer was so creamy that I expected my mineral makeup to leave streaks, but not so with Reviva (the primer helps!). I am very happy with this moisturizer in conjunction with my pre-makeup regiment, and will continue to use it.  With the free-shipping, it is very reasonable in price.</li>
    <li> Use a lot of their products and love but this one is like a lot of moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.. A little thick and smells like sunscreen. Still on the hunt for something more lightweight.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Lightweight cream protection. Just what I needed for my morning regimen. I wanted a moisturizer with sun protection. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> I began using this moisturizer last year. I had bought it for my daughter, who never used it. So when I ran out of my regular moisturizer I decided to just try this. I was pleasantly surprised by it. Goes on super clean, you don&#x27;t need much, and after just a couple of weeks there is a really marked difference in my skin. Less blemishes and an overall smoothness I haven&#x27;t gotten from anything else. It&#x27;s not horribly pricey, and easy to find. I&#x27;ve tried using others afterwards, but nope. Ended up back with this. I haven&#x27;t tried any others by this company but I imagine they&#x27;re pretty good as well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  Not greasy, I don&#x27;t break out yet feels good, not dry.  Good price!!</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed to get this cream and see that it has quite a few toxic ingredients in it. I use the night cream by the same brand on a regular basis and I felt really good about the fact that it was truly all natural ingredients. This is not the case with this cream. t does protect from the sun quite well, though.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer with SPF I have ever used. It soaks into my skin and does not have that heavy greasy sunscreen feel. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a week only, so far I can say I like it.  It has no or very little smell.  What I noticed about all Reviva products that you need just a very little for the application, which is good because it&#x27;ll last longer .  Still put some sunblock on top of this cream just because in CA the sun in very aggressive and I already have brown spots on my face.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and safe, good price</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. I have sensitive skin and wanted a product that was gentle, offered protection from the sun and did not have harsh chemicals.

    <li> This product is light weight and does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Favorite moisturizer.  Light on skin, good moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I really love this product. While the label doesn&#x27;t reflect the SPF, I&#x27;ve been wearing this all summer under my make-up in North Florida and have never gotten so much as pink while being out and about on a normal workday, including morning walks outdoors.

    <li> This is a very nice day cream with sunscreen.  It&#x27;s a thick cream but for women like me with dry skin, is perfect.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go outside (during the day) without it!  A definite repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy, it protects my fair skin from burning enough for daily use, it goes great with the glycolic acid, and also works really well with the primer under foundation and make up. Highly recommend. Because it really is as good as all the hype.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, good moisturizer, but nowhere on the box or container does it claim to have sunscreen on it. I still use it on my face, while the rest of my body I use other sunscreen. It seems to keep the sun exposure at bay easily enough.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m imagining this, as I spend a great deal of time in the sun kayaking. I do wear a hat each time, but sun still reflects onto your face, so I&#x27;m assuming this &#x27;sun protective moisturizer&#x27; is working.</li>
