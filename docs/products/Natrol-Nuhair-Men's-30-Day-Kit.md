### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, I hope that NuHair is the best medicine I&#x27;ve ever known to the problem of hair loss .&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>And it didn&#x27;t hurt that Amazon had the best price!</li>
      <li>then I found \\&quot;TakeHerb\\&quot; A great store with a great price for all three!   </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I also you rogaine and the 2 together are great.</li>
      <li>I take this for a precaution and my hair is thicker,shines and feels great.</li>
      <li>Nu Hair works great</li>
      <li>I am not a spokes person for this product who is trying to trick anyone into buying it, I&#x27;m just a happy consumer.  </li>
      <li>But shipping and price through Amazon is great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the dht blocker and regrowth formula for three weeks, and I&#x27;ve seen great improvement in hair thickness and length.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>I panicked and stressed a great load during that time</li>
      <li>I used to have great load of hair hence the nickname, Aladdin.</li>
      <li>The product works but I could never find steps one through three at a good price before now.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job with faithful use...  </li>
      <li>and I felt it start getting good results</li>
      <li>This product is no longer a good value in a cost/satisfaction ratio.</li>
      <li>The hair serum is as good as I&#x27;ve seen</li>
      <li>I would think if you have a good diet, these won&#x27;t be needed.</li>
      <li>an \\&quot;OKAY PRODUCT\\&quot; with a good pricing.</li>
      <li>Honestly... i don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>so people who is experiencing what I was, can have an unbiased honest review.</li>
      <li>So the product is effective, however, it contains an ingredient that may cause liver problems.  </li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price so far.  </li>
      <li>Since it causes increased blood flow to the scalp, it also causes more DHT to flow to the scalp which causes more hair to fall out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m unsure how many of these reviews are from the makers of this product...</li>
      <li>Will buy more and give more ratings on the product.  </li>
      <li>The price alone is a phenomenal deal.</li>
      <li>but I stopped taking DHT and kept living a healthy lifestyle.</li>
      <li>Ok product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not damage hair or cause more to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried everything under the sun, simply the best thing out there when done as perscribed, you will be amazed.</li>
      <li>Maybe the issue is more with genetics as established beliefs would have one think, however my brothers don&#x27;t have any male-pattern hair loss as I do.</li>
      <li>But i am sure it will benefit you psycologicaly.</li>
      <li>The idea of taking rogaine for the rest of my life didn&#x27;t seem appealing.</li>
      <li>I know you have 30day kit, but I would love to have the 60day Kit.   </li>
      <li>This stuff works magic.  </li>
      <li>most results are supposed to show around the four month mark</li>
      <li>I love this NU HAIR PRODUCT, Ive tried them all on the market and none work with results like NUHair.</li>
      <li>I got a better deal on Amazon and started buying it here.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was this</li>
      <li>and I find more hairs on my pillow and in the shower.</li>
      <li>Shipment came early and packing was good also!</li>
      <li>To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know if I trust giving this product more time.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend purchasing and have a full bottle that I would love to return.</li>
      <li>All the products are drug free thats what they have claimed on the pack.</li>
      <li>Great overall product.</li>
      <li>What I noticed was my eyelashes were twice the size, not what I was expecting, but it confirmed the product did what it said.</li>
      <li>I know itw weired but its true.</li>
      <li>the only thing is you have to keep using it until the hair that is receding is full but other wise its a great product.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve very glad to have rolled the dice on this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap, so</li>
      <li>but I guess it&#x27;s better to be healthy than having a few more hairs on your head.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty clean</li>
      <li>Natrol Nuhair men&#x27;s kit is worth trying...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>According to my research, within 60 months of hair loss it should be possible to regrow hair using EFFECTIVE treatment methods.</li>
      <li>Since, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years, originally buying from Walgreen&#x27;s and finally finding this 30 day kit, that was originally around $19 on amazon, I can&#x27;t really say for sure it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;rejuvinating”</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this product, as it is effective, but also recommend that you buy one box first and try it out.</li>
      <li>I really noticed my hair become nourished and full and because of the DHT blocker it stopped hair from falling out.</li>
      <li>They sent it very fast.  </li>
      <li>Guess the results may vary based on hair type and make up but for me the first month show some promise but after using it for 6 months I see not progress.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After two years of consistent use, this product has no effect on hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tried it with no improvement in first 30 days.</li>
      <li>Using it every day, seeing more and more tiny hairs starting to sprout.</li>
      <li>Really wish I had found this sooner!</li>
      <li>currently it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
      <li>and absolutely there was no progress!</li>
      <li>No one looks at my hair anymore (which is a positive thing, in my case).</li>
      <li>i was looking at the 30 day kit for men and was wondering if anyone has bought that and know exactly what the kit contains i see on other websites that it contains all three stages but wasn&#x27;t sure so if someone could help me out and let me know that would be greatly appreciated thanks.</li>
      <li>I did not see much or any imporvement in my receeding hairline or quality of the hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment and well packed.</li>
      <li>hi i found that this product is very helpful in rejuvinating my hair loss.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much regrowth</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I saw the Hair Serum at Whole Foods and decided to take a chance at trying it.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using the whole 30 day</li>
      <li>I purchased this item back in November 2013 and worked fabulous.</li>
      <li>Figured I would give it a try because it was so much cheaper on here</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;ll depend on how much you have to work with.</li>
      <li>thanks to those who have created NuHair</li>
      <li>I think you really have to take this product for over a couple months to really notice any change.</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t know how much of that was what I wanted to see vs. reality.</li>
      <li>but the price for all three was too much for my pocket</li>
      <li>I do not care what negative comments anyone have to make about their experiences, I do know from my own experience, it works when you use it consistently as instructed.  </li>
      <li>Its clear there is a new set of hair growing in which is really exciting.</li>
      <li>I have taken things that worked for friends but did nothing for me, as well as the opposite being true.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to try a natural route first.</li>
      <li>It took about another month or so to get my sexual lifestyle back in its place of a young college adult.</li>
      <li>The results aren&#x27;t positive, however  I&#x27;ll weigh the benefit if the product slows down any prostate and DHT issues from becoming problems.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, what happened was that I started growing new hair along my hair line!</li>
      <li>My hopes were so high for this product.  </li>
      <li>I am going to give it a few more months of trying this product.  </li>
      <li>Since the product tells you have to use it at least 4 months to get results,  it&#x27;s still to early to tell if is good or not, so far I have not seen any changes.</li>
      <li>So, no  big exciting break through to announce.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it will help the new hairs to grow that much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had a widow&#x27;s peak in the front center of my hairline and the back top of my hair was thinning for years and figured it was just meant to be since I am aging.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff consistently for about 6-7 months now and the only change is that my hair keeps falling out at a faster pace.</li>
      <li>Currently I&#x27;m in stage 3 out of the 7 stage &#x27;Hamilton Norwood&#x27; scale hair loss stages where I have hair loss in the front and developing a pretty noticeable bald spot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for six months currently...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nu Hair works great the only thing is you have to keep using it until the hair that is receding is full but other wise its a great product.</li>
    <li> hi i found that this product is very helpful in rejuvinating my hair loss. i was looking at the 30 day kit for men and was wondering if anyone has bought that and know exactly what the kit contains i see on other websites that it contains all three stages but wasn&#x27;t sure so if someone could help me out and let me know that would be greatly appreciated thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a user of Nuhair now for four months. The product works but I could never find steps one through three at a good price before now.  Like I said it works but the price for all three was too much for my pocket then I found \\&quot;TakeHerb\\&quot; A great store with a great price for all three!   Get the kit with all three steps for the price of just one of these products.  Shipment came early and packing was good also!</li>
    <li> Figured I would give it a try because it was so much cheaper on here then it was in the store</li>
    <li> Used NuHAIR for about 2 weeks and saw noticeable improvement in the thickness of my existing hair. After using it for 2 months my hair is the thickest it&#x27;s been in years. Really wish I had found this sooner! All natural, no bull @ under $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who was COMPLETELY bald since this product will NOT magically regrow hair that isn&#x27;t there. It can only help the hair you have left. Currently I&#x27;m in stage 3 out of the 7 stage &#x27;Hamilton Norwood&#x27; scale hair loss stages where I have hair loss in the front and developing a pretty noticeable bald spot. NuHAIR has gotten me back to maybe a 2 1/2 on the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, this product works, no doubt. But it&#x27;ll depend on how much you have to work with.</li>
    <li> I took the product for a couple months and noticed a lot of growth; my hair looked thicker and healthier. But I didn&#x27;t know how much of that was what I wanted to see vs. reality. I wore a lot of hats and didn&#x27;t ever let on that I was insecure about my hair or taking any products for it. After I got my hair cut, the first comment I got was from a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in months: \\&quot;You actually look presentable now. It looked like you were balding when you had long hair.\\&quot; As of now, my hair looks like I reversed time about 4 years.   Obviously, if you&#x27;ve been bald for awhile, your hair follicles could be dead. And nothing short of transplants or future stem cell treatments will bring that hair back. Also, DHT is not the only cause of balding. Overall, I&#x27;ve very glad to have rolled the dice on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dht blocker and regrowth formula for three weeks, and I&#x27;ve seen great improvement in hair thickness and length.  I don&#x27;t want to make false claims about new hair, but I do believe I have had some new hair growth.  So the product is effective, however, it contains an ingredient that may cause liver problems.  Since you are supposed to take four pills a day, I believe this is a serious risk.  I am only posting because this affected me personally, and I ordered two months supply before trying it out.  I definitely recommend this product, as it is effective, but also recommend that you buy one box first and try it out.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working after 4 months</li>
    <li> Simply does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years of consistent use, this product has no effect on hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try other vitamins.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this product for almost 2 months now. After about two weeks I did notice that my hair was starting to get thicker. After about 4-5 weeks I notices that I had a few hairs in the front where I was balding that were not there before. My wife is a hair stylist and she cuts my hair. She could tell when cutting my hair that it was not only thicker but there has been more of it. Before taking this prodcut I could look in the mirror and see through my hair and at this point I cannot. I have not noticed any side effects. For me this product is working. I use all three products in the box as directed. I am curious to see what it does at the 6 and 12 month points. I wish the price was much lower overall.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item back in November 2013 and worked fabulous.I&#x27;m only 20 and started noticing my hair fall out. I used to have great load of hair hence the nickname, Aladdin. I really noticed my hair become nourished and full and because of the DHT blocker it stopped hair from falling out. The serum does not work! Either do not buy the package with the serum or simply don&#x27;t use it. One side effect of the DHT blocker I did notice around January low libido and erection. Which really scared me because of my age and active lifestyle. The kit ended by January so I had already stopped taking DHT. It took about another month or so to get my sexual lifestyle back in its place of a young college adult. I panicked and stressed a great load during that time but I stopped taking DHT and kept living a healthy lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Ok product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better that its all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not damage hair or cause more to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend as long as one had realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Its no miracle cure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff consistently for about 6-7 months now and the only change is that my hair keeps falling out at a faster pace. At least Rogaine kept what I had mostly in. I would strongly recommend not to try this or use Rogaine simultaneously with this at least. I plan on asking for a refund from the company, we will see how much their money back guarantee is BS or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff works magic.  It has helped stop my hair loss.  I combine it with He Shou Wu extract in concentrated powder form as well as saw palmetto pills and it&#x27;s great.  No growth, but it has stopped hair loss.</li>
    <li> may help keep what you have</li>
    <li> They sent it very fast.  I cannot yet comment on the effectiveness of the product yet.</li>
    <li> Hair seems thicker healthier! Have used newhair for almost a yeast... And it didn&#x27;t hurt that Amazon had the best price!</li>
    <li> I tried Minoxidil without researching the product and how it works.  Since it causes increased blood flow to the scalp, it also causes more DHT to flow to the scalp which causes more hair to fall out.  My hair was literally flying off my scalp but I was afraid to stop using it because supposedly you will have major shedding if you stop after you start.  However, I started taking the Nu Hair DHT Blocker and within 2 weeks my hair stopped shedding.  I am no longer taking Minoxidil and my hair is NOT falling out.  The other products in this kit are definitely causing my hair to grow back faster and thicker and some of the thinning areas are filling in.  I&#x27;ve only been taking this for about a month but several people have commented about my hair filling back in and they didn&#x27;t even know I was taking anything.  This is a legitimate product for a bargain price and I would recommend it to anyone looking to help with losing their hair.  I am not a spokes person for this product who is trying to trick anyone into buying it, I&#x27;m just a happy consumer.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results 6 months from now.</li>
    <li> I was starting thin and crown and wanted to prevent damage before it got too bad. I switched the shampoo to Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo and started this kit around the same time. My hair loss has stopped but there hasn&#x27;t been any growth/regrowth of what was lost. Guess the results may vary based on hair type and make up but for me the first month show some promise but after using it for 6 months I see not progress.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair thinning about 2 years ago. I looked into alternatives but I wanted to try a natural route first. I came accrross these online and decided to give them a try. That was almost a year and a half ago. I haven&#x27;t stopped using this prodect. No one looks at my hair anymore (which is a positive thing, in my case). I notced the product working about 3 months after use. What I noticed was my eyelashes were twice the size, not what I was expecting, but it confirmed the product did what it said. I also you rogaine and the 2 together are great. It&#x27;s pretty cheap, so it&#x27;s worth a try. I only use the step 1 and step 2 pills, I just buying however they are cheaper (in the case, the 30 day kit was cheapest). Great overall product.</li>
    <li> Tried it with no improvement in first 30 days. Hair fall is the same, noticeable increase in loss since start. To be honest, I really don&#x27;t know if I trust giving this product more time. It was a last attempt before considering rogaine.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll reorder again, unless I plan to take in addition to rogaine.  By the way, my hair did not grow any faster or stronger.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 11months  and it does not work well at I would say it has helped from 1 to 10 rate it a 4 helps keep the hair u have like rogaine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unsure how many of these reviews are from the makers of this product... I am 24 years old and have noticed substantial hair loss recently. According to my research, within 60 months of hair loss it should be possible to regrow hair using EFFECTIVE treatment methods. I have been using Nuhair for over 3 months and have yet to see any progress. I have continued to lose hair regardless of using this products twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything.</li>
    <li> Honestly... i don&#x27;t know. i&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now but I think I will cancel my subscription. Not sure that it&#x27;s doing anything really. All those pills (4 a day), liquid treatment every night and I still can&#x27;t say that I see any difference. I wish I have...</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I think my hair looks stronger and thicker quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t think it will help the new hairs to grow that much.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I use the hair fiber make up products to help filling those non-growing spaces.</li>
    <li> No results what-so-ever. I&#x27;m very tired of these snake-oil hair-growth products.</li>
    <li> I love this NU HAIR PRODUCT, Ive tried them all on the market and none work with results like NUHair. I just want to know when will you be selling the 60day kit?  I know you have 30day kit, but I would love to have the 60day Kit.   Thanks</li>
    <li> I was really surprised with this product. Firstly I was worried, maybe irrationally that my hair was thinning since I&#x27;m a male heading into his 30s. I wanted to try to deal with aging as naturally as possible. The idea of taking rogaine for the rest of my life didn&#x27;t seem appealing. Anyhow, what happened was that I started growing new hair along my hair line! Its clear there is a new set of hair growing in which is really exciting. I was worried about thinning hair but turns out my hairline had slightly receded. I think you really have to take this product for over a couple months to really notice any change. I&#x27;m going on to month 4 and don&#x27;t want to stop the progress. I just wonder how long you&#x27;re supposed to take this, and what happens if I stop?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I should give this product 5 stars because it did help my hair thickness, but no regrowth.</li>
    <li> I only use 5 weeks and I felt it start getting good results , I hope that NuHair is the best medicine I&#x27;ve ever known to the problem of hair loss .&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to those who have created NuHair</li>
    <li> I have tried everything under the sun, simply the best thing out there when done as perscribed, you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and I&#x27;ve been using the whole 30 day Nuhair kit for about a couple years.  I swear by this product.  I do not care what negative comments anyone have to make about their experiences, I do know from my own experience, it works when you use it consistently as instructed.  I have had a widow&#x27;s peak in the front center of my hairline and the back top of my hair was thinning for years and figured it was just meant to be since I am aging.  I saw the Hair Serum at Whole Foods and decided to take a chance at trying it.  After I used it for a while, looked it up on Amazon and saw there were companion products that make up a kit of Hair Rejuvenation for Men and DHT Blocker.  I got a better deal on Amazon and started buying it here. I even purchase the Foam and use these products as a part of my regular vitamin regime.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve become a Nuhair spokesman because I can shout it from the rafters.  IT WORKS.  I&#x27;ve been planning to leave a review for quite some time, but was always too busy.   I&#x27;m doing it now so people who is experiencing what I was, can have an unbiased honest review.</li>
    <li> Does a good job with faithful use...  For me the combination of this kit is less than expected but not a waste of time or money.  I recommend you give it a chance..  The hair serum is as good as I&#x27;ve seen and it&#x27;s pretty clean</li>
    <li> I bought this product Month ago from Kuwait city I think that it helps the hair to grow ,  i hope it will stop hair loosing but when I saw the difference between the rate  here and the rate in amazon ....... I ordered through amazon  almost 80 percent sheap ....</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much regrowth but I have only been using for 2 months. I do feel like my rapidly declining hairline has at least slowed in terms of loss, which is encouraging. most results are supposed to show around the four month mark and I plan on at least giving it five months before deciding whether it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am encouraged though.</li>
    <li> This is the one vitamin I found that works, after a few months I have a few hairs in the sink apposed to a dozen and lots of new growth. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was this so I quit taking it and after about a month I was back to normal. So, I started taking it again and the hairs shredded are minimal again. I&#x27;ve tried every hair growth vitamin I&#x27;ve seen and this is the only one with a noticeable affect. I did try Rogain but it just made my head itch and I did not see any difference in the number of hairs that fall out. I would definitely recommend Nu Hair</li>
    <li> The amount of grey hairs has dramatically reduced.&lt;br /&gt;The amount of hair loss has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;A few new hairs have grown in, but no real difference.&lt;br /&gt;When I stop taking them, the grey hairs come back in and I find more hairs on my pillow and in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 months without fail. I&#x27;ve taken the vitamins, used the serum and absolutely there was no progress! My hopes were so high for this product.  I wasted my money and my time. I don&#x27;t recommend this. : (</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works, only time will tell.  The formula is basically contains vitamins.  I would think if you have a good diet, these won&#x27;t be needed.</li>
    <li> I tried the product for 30 days and didn&#x27;t notice any improvment. Maybe if I was on it for 60 or 90 days it might have worked... Not sure. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Natrol Nuhair men&#x27;s kit is worth trying...I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for six months currently...The results aren&#x27;t positive, however  I&#x27;ll weigh the benefit if the product slows down any prostate and DHT issues from becoming problems. I have hair loss  and so far during this trial no new hair is appearing to grow (yet). After six months miracle weren&#x27;t expected. I&#x27;m looking to  see if the product will curtail further hair loss and thicken up the remaining as the product claims in its description. So, no  big exciting break through to announce. But, the product is apparently all natural and may aid hormonal issues relating  to the prostate, DHT, etc.  Hopefully give further feedback after about a year.    Started using in August 2013, it&#x27;s now August 2014.    UPDATE: I utilized these Nuhair kits continuous for one year religiously. The results are less than marginal. Realistically, I&#x27;ve seen no hair regrowth and my hair appears to continue to thin and fall out. The use of Nuhair kit didn&#x27;t seem to help either situation. And, the effects of using the DHT blocker didn&#x27;t seem to help prevent prostate enlargement or nightly ventures to the bathroom as there were supposed herbal health benefits in using the tabs. If there is any benefit to using Nuhair it may be some unnoticeable health affects. The affects I was expecting would have been noticeable...like some hair regrowth...Didn&#x27;t happen.  Small expenditure...No gain. No big loss but no gain either. Would&#x27;ve considered using for longer if there were some noticeable benefit, but one year is enough to weigh the facts...May work for others, didn&#x27;t for me.    UPDATE It&#x27;s now Feb. 2015: Continuing to update on this Natrol Nuhair Kit for men. After continued use of this product for 18 months, I&#x27;ve seen no progress at all in any hair regrowth. I do like the idea of using the tablets for prostate issues, but seen no reasons to believe this product will grow or regrow hair. Maybe the issue is more with genetics as established beliefs would have one think, however my brothers don&#x27;t have any male-pattern hair loss as I do. Me thinketh this product is over-hyped for the reasons it is marketed. I don&#x27;t believe Nuhair stops air loss. The only positive thing about this product...currently it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this item acording a recomendation from a freind, and it is working so far. Still waiting till finishing the cours.</li>
    <li> The product did not do anything to help with my hair loss.  I do not recommend purchasing and have a full bottle that I would love to return.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for about 2 months. I don&#x27;t see any results, therefore I am skeptic about Nuhair&#x27;s claims, plus I didn&#x27;t like reading about the possible side effects, which are liver damage. I don&#x27;t like to see my hair line receding but I guess it&#x27;s better to be healthy than having a few more hairs on your head.</li>
    <li> The price alone is a phenomenal deal. The whole kit is the same price as buying just one of the products by itself. 3 Items for the price of 1. Using it every day, seeing more and more tiny hairs starting to sprout. Even to the point that others take notice. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it does work. I will say that everybody is different. I have taken things that worked for friends but did nothing for me, as well as the opposite being true.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since 4 months now. First 3 months i used hair growth (orange pack) medication, and from the fourth month i started using dht blocker. I did not see much or any imporvement in my receeding hairline or quality of the hair. But i am sure it will benefit you psycologicaly. I know itw weired but its true. I have also applied its liquid (serum) which does not help but it will not harm you as well. All the products are drug free thats what they have claimed on the pack.All toghether an \\&quot;OKAY PRODUCT\\&quot; with a good pricing. Before i forget to mention i was very particular about my doze (everyday twice during your meals).</li>
    <li> Since, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years, originally buying from Walgreen&#x27;s and finally finding this 30 day kit, that was originally around $19 on amazon, I can&#x27;t really say for sure it&#x27;s been &amp;#34;rejuvinating” my hair and since I don&#x27;t have concrete proof, I finally decided, it&#x27;s not worth paying double for something that&#x27;s questionable if it is working or not. I&#x27;ll just stick to biotin, rogaine and multivitamins. This product is no longer a good value in a cost/satisfaction ratio.</li>
    <li> Since the product tells you have to use it at least 4 months to get results,  it&#x27;s still to early to tell if is good or not, so far I have not seen any changes. My hair is still thin and I&#x27;m still loosing few strands avery day, I hope it&#x27;ll improve.</li>
    <li> Great product. I take this for a precaution and my hair is thicker,shines and feels great. I recommend this product for thinning hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 year, and will keep using.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now.  Started off buying from Walgreen&#x27;s.  Amazon has the best price so far.  Don&#x27;t buy off Ebay, I got ripped off with less quantity in the kits.  But I have NOT seen any results as of yet.  The product claim that you can see the result after 4 months.  I am going to give it a few more months of trying this product.  I am only giving 3 stars to the product as for neutral.  Will buy more and give more ratings on the product.  But shipping and price through Amazon is great.  Fast shipment and well packed.</li>
