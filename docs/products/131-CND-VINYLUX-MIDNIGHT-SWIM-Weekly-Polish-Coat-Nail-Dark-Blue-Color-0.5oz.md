      <li>Great color.</li>
      <li>A great alternative to the cost of gel polish manicures.</li>
      <li>CND has colors in both formulas, so it&#x27;s great for fixing one nail if the gel peels off or for having a matching mani</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>So glad this stuff came out!</li>

    <li> This is a great compromise between shellac or gels and regular polish. I think it works well. Comes off without too much struggle and lasts for a week. The topcoat is a must with this type of polish.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite winter colors!</li>
    <li> Great color, and this polish really does stay a week with out chipping. A great alternative to the cost of gel polish manicures.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t match the color of my previous Midnight Swim polish.  More of a dull blue.  Liked the other shade better</li>
    <li> Much easier than Shellac. Dries quickly! Love it! Will definitely be buying it in more colors! So glad this stuff came out!</li>
    <li> Long lasting as promised.</li>
    <li> Two coats of polish and one coat of top coat - lasts for at least 10 days.....no chipping, peeling, etc.</li>
    <li> I really like this polish idea. It&#x27;s supposed to wear longer than regular polish, and I think it does for most people. I&#x27;m one of those that have a very flaky nail and I never wear gloves while so the dishes. With that said my polish never wears like it does for others. Shellac is the only thing that stays on and looks good for any amount of time. I can patch up my tips with this polish and it looks fine. You do need there too coat in order for this polish to work properly.</li>
    <li> I wore this color for a week and then another color.  Nails started to get weak and break.  I would like to return this product</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts up to two weeks. Can be somewhat difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> love the CND Vinylux but will never purchase it from this seller ever again, i received this nail polish it was very clumpy i thought it i shook it, it would go away...it went away a little bit but made the application so hard beings it would clump as im putting it on i had to sake the bottle after each nail, i have used this nail polish before and NEVER had that problem</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my recent purchased of  CND Vinylux Midnight Swim  Polish Coat Nail Dark Blue Color Lacquer.  It really works on my nails, so that I have my seven days manicure, in a perfect way</li>
    <li> Great nail polish.  This polish lasts me about a week and a half. Standard polish lasts me about a day or two.  Comparison done through dish washing and typical house cleaning.  This blue has a bit of sparkles in it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful dark blue color, not to mention the polish lasts and lasts without chipping on your nails. even over a week.  The best polish brand I have ever used, period!</li>
    <li> This polish was suppose to stay on two weeks without chipping but it did not any longest the opi polish I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the vinylux weekly polish.  I like this color but it looks almost black instead of navy.  The sparkles are there but hard to discern.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The color is indeed dark blue. My first experience with this brand and I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> great Nail polish! Love the color and durablity! Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need 100% acatone to easily remove!</li>
    <li> Nice color- lasts a few days longer than regular nail polish as long as you use the top coat!</li>
    <li> I love this blue. It is between a navy and deep royal and has some sparkles. The nail polish did not last as some of my other cnd weekly.</li>
    <li> Cool color!  Arrived timely and as described!</li>
    <li> This color is to die for!!</li>
    <li> The picture makes this look like it would&#x27;ve been a dark sapphire blue.  Once I revived this item it was almost black. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend! She loves the color of the nail polish and was very happy that it didn&#x27;t take all day for it to dry!</li>
    <li> Very dark blue-- but it is beautiful.  I go back and forth with Vinyalux and gel.  CND has colors in both formulas, so it&#x27;s great for fixing one nail if the gel peels off or for having a matching mani /pedi.  It lasts forever on your toes.</li>
    <li> Not like gel sorry..chips just like regular nail polish you get for 2.99....very thick takes awhile to dry...not great just ight</li>
    <li> Love CND Vinylux as it drys quickly and I love the fall colors.  BUT, need to use acetone to remove.  I wrap each nail with a small bit of cotton dipped in remover and cover with alum. foil.  Leave on for 5-8 minutes and the polish will be easier to remove completely.  Or, take to your local salon and let the nail tech deal with it.  I&#x27;m retired so don&#x27;t mind doing myself.</li>
    <li> Great color. Love the compliments I receive while wearing the color. Long lasting, great quality.</li>
