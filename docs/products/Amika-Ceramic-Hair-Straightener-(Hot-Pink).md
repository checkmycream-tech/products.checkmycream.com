      <li>Girlll, I cannot tell you how nice this is.</li>
      <li>I had seen this brand many times and knew it had a good reputation</li>
      <li>I love this product it does wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>My wife had one of these irons and really enjoyed it until it broke.  </li>
      <li>I have had used this hair straightener for 8 years -  just re-ordered one because I dropped mine one too many times and one of the plates cracked.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It has adjustable heat settings and seems to be more durable than a chi</li>
      <li>PLUS, it was free shipping!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love. ...</li>
      <li>This was amazing and cheaper than the price you bargian for at the mall, it has settings, and gets very hot if you let it.</li>
      <li>it work fine till a couple months ago when it fell of my dresser and broke.</li>
      <li>I was leery about paying so much for a hair product, but love the results!  </li>
      <li>Worth the price...am glad I bought it when.</li>
      <li>My initial expereince with amika was remarkable, but I ordered this one and it doesn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as the one my friend let me use, it might be to do with the plates.  </li>
      <li>At first when I saw that PaylessBeauty was selling their Amika Ceramic Hair Straightener for $70, I thought \\&quot;What a great price\\&quot; &#x27;cause all the other sellers were selling them for more.</li>
      <li>Also came really quick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be waiting for a quick response.</li>
      <li>One whole day is a HUGE deal.</li>
      <li>I purchased it right away and waited for it to arrive.</li>
      <li>best flat irons, hands down....</li>
      <li>We have trouble getting the volume and curling to really work, but it is still a great product.</li>
      <li>I love it, definitely recommended.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried hot tools, conair, Revlon, and Chi....</li>
      <li>The best flat irons I&#x27;ve tried for African American natural hair, gives results as if your hair is relaxed</li>
      <li>It makes it super straight and soft.</li>
      <li>After I opened the package, I saw the cute pink Amika box it was packaged in.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see it here on amazon but to my curiosity it DONT work as my last one.</li>
      <li>Really was excited about this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m sad it finally had to go, a 6-year lifespan on a hair straightener is excellent in my book.</li>
      <li>SURE ENOUGH, I&#x27;m pretty darn convinced that this product is not new when I PURCHASED it new.</li>
      <li>and I was looking to get a high quality straightener.</li>
      <li>Opened it and sure enough, I saw these scratch marks all over the sides of the flat iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it the entire time it worked, and was always left with smooth, shiny, straight hair.</li>
      <li>The plastic casing was rough textured and opening and closing it seemed cheap like it would break.</li>
      <li>While the quality is just good enough to get past the 12 month warranty, this product is not a value by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
      <li>Is this BRAND NEW?</li>
      <li>I bought one in new york about 4 years ago</li>
      <li>My only regret about this product is that I paid so much for it at the mall when it&#x27;s more than half the price here.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully for long thick curly hair, comes out silky straight in less time than others!</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly/frizzy hair - this straightener is the only one that gets my hair 100% straight.  </li>
      <li>I got this needing to replace my old Chi</li>
      <li>Color was pink but played and cord are black which looks even better than pictured.</li>
      <li>Best purchase for my crazy crazy hair :)</li>
      <li>I first bought my Amika Zebra flat iron in 2008, and it lasted 6 years before finally dying yesterday.</li>
      <li>So I decided what&#x27;s the point of even using this flat iron when it clearly said \\&quot;New.</li>
      <li>This iron keeps my hair straight and silky without using hairspray, AND I only have to use it after I wash my hair (which is every other day since my hair is pretty dry).  </li>
      <li>but mostly I was just not happy paying for a product</li>

<li> but mostly I was just not happy paying for a product</li>
<li> I noticed that one of the papers were really old just because the sides of the manual was getting white and worn... and the other one had a star cut out of it in the middle of a paragraph.</li>
<li> Bought flat iron for 100 in the mall...broke after 2 weeks and, of coarse, I cannot find my receipt.</li>
<li> and I use it as often as my hair will allow me to use any flat iron though.</li>
<li> I have returned the flat iron and waiting for my refund.</li>
<li> As for the black plastic where the flat iron sat in, it was old and ripped...</li>
<li> /&gt;It is ceramic base good for straightening.</li>
<li> Waste of my time especially when it didn&#x27;t even arrive on time.</li>
<li> When I finally got it I was disappointed with how cheap it felt.</li>
<li> I looked for the manual and other papers it would come with.</li>
<li> The pink cord had dark black marks on it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping my hair from getting frizzy, and used to depend on hairspraying it after using a flat iron.  </li>
<li> but i usually keep it in the middle and it works wonders and takes less time to straighten my thick hair.</li>
<li> I tried it a little</li>
<li> My secret - I wash my hair the night before - let it air dry while sleeping and use the straightener in the morning.  </li>
<li> Also - you must straighten your hair in small sections.  </li>
<li> thats not good.  </li>
<li> worse part ...</li>
<li> So incredibly disappointed.</li>
<li> I have nothing bad to say!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife had one of these irons and really enjoyed it until it broke.  Now we have replaced it and it is great.</li>
    <li> QUESTION: Since there&#x27;s no way to contact Amika/Amazon about this iem... Is this BRAND NEW? Does it come in the box with clips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be waiting for a quick response. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Better than a chi!!!!!!!!! I used a chi all my life and then switched to this one and I&#x27;m never going back. It has adjustable heat settings and seems to be more durable than a chi</li>
    <li> This was amazing and cheaper than the price you bargian for at the mall, it has settings, and gets very hot if you let it. but i usually keep it in the middle and it works wonders and takes less time to straighten my thick hair. I absolutely love it. plus the two styling clips were a great and helpful add-on</li>
    <li> So much better than Chi! Color was pink but played and cord are black which looks even better than pictured.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener 5 years ago at the mall for $200.  I was leery about paying so much for a hair product, but love the results!  I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping my hair from getting frizzy, and used to depend on hairspraying it after using a flat iron.  This iron keeps my hair straight and silky without using hairspray, AND I only have to use it after I wash my hair (which is every other day since my hair is pretty dry).  My only regret about this product is that I paid so much for it at the mall when it&#x27;s more than half the price here.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this item specifically after doing research.  We purchased for a very good price of $75, but after 13 months, it blew and so I decided to contact the manufacturer.  I found out that the warranty is for 12 months and that you have to pay to send the item back to them and a check for $22.50 for return shipping.  That would be about $40 to obtain warranty on a device that broke after 13 months!  While the quality is just good enough to get past the 12 month warranty, this product is not a value by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully.  Amika makes a good product, which is why I&#x27;ll always replace it with another Amika just like this one when I wear it out. Will never go back to the standard ones you find in drugstores.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love. ...best flat irons, hands down....I&#x27;ve tried hot tools, conair, Revlon, and Chi.... and nothing compares to the results of the amika....The best flat irons I&#x27;ve tried for African American natural hair, gives results as if your hair is relaxed</li>
    <li> I have had used this hair straightener for 8 years -  just re-ordered one because I dropped mine one too many times and one of the plates cracked.  Make no mistake - this product is durable!  I have naturally curly/frizzy hair - this straightener is the only one that gets my hair 100% straight.  My hair looks amazing when I use this.  My secret - I wash my hair the night before - let it air dry while sleeping and use the straightener in the morning.  Also - you must straighten your hair in small sections.  20 minutes max on my hair in the morning to straighten it - and I am out the door looking amazing.</li>
    <li> I got this needing to replace my old Chi and I was looking to get a high quality straightener. I had seen this brand many times and knew it had a good reputation so I ordered with out even using an Amika before. When I finally got it I was disappointed with how cheap it felt. The plastic casing was rough textured and opening and closing it seemed cheap like it would break. I tried it a little but mostly I was just not happy paying for a product the felt so low quality then I returned it.</li>
    <li> At first when I saw that PaylessBeauty was selling their Amika Ceramic Hair Straightener for $70, I thought \\&quot;What a great price\\&quot; &#x27;cause all the other sellers were selling them for more. PLUS, it was free shipping! I purchased it right away and waited for it to arrive. It met it&#x27;s last day of arrival and still did not receive it. I received the package the day after the estimated date... After I opened the package, I saw the cute pink Amika box it was packaged in. Opened it and sure enough, I saw these scratch marks all over the sides of the flat iron. The pink cord had dark black marks on it. As for the black plastic where the flat iron sat in, it was old and ripped... I looked for the manual and other papers it would come with. I noticed that one of the papers were really old just because the sides of the manual was getting white and worn... and the other one had a star cut out of it in the middle of a paragraph. SURE ENOUGH, I&#x27;m pretty darn convinced that this product is not new when I PURCHASED it new. So I decided what&#x27;s the point of even using this flat iron when it clearly said \\&quot;New. Excellent!\\&quot; online from PaylessBeauty. That&#x27;s all LIES. Don&#x27;t trust Payless Beauty. I have returned the flat iron and waiting for my refund. Waste of my time especially when it didn&#x27;t even arrive on time. One whole day is a HUGE deal. Last words: DO. NOT. PURCHASE. FROM. PAYLESSBEAUTY!</li>
    <li> Worth the price...am glad I bought it when. It was on sale...perfect</li>
    <li> I first bought my Amika Zebra flat iron in 2008, and it lasted 6 years before finally dying yesterday. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it the entire time it worked, and was always left with smooth, shiny, straight hair. Although I&#x27;m sad it finally had to go, a 6-year lifespan on a hair straightener is excellent in my book. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> It Dont work as the original!!!!! I bought one in new york about 4 years ago it work fine till a couple months ago when it fell of my dresser and broke. I was excited to see it here on amazon but to my curiosity it DONT work as my last one. I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for long thick curly hair, comes out silky straight in less time than others! Best purchase for my crazy crazy hair :)</li>
    <li> ordered for a gift and it met all the needs of the person who recieved it as the gift. yay</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener.</li>
    <li> Not only does this work well, my hair and my daughter&#x27;s is actually healthier and shinier than ever. We have trouble getting the volume and curling to really work, but it is still a great product.</li>
    <li> It is very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and not to damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is ceramic base good for straightening.</li>
    <li> My initial expereince with amika was remarkable, but I ordered this one and it doesn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as the one my friend let me use, it might be to do with the plates.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while and I use it as often as my hair will allow me to use any flat iron though.</li>
    <li> best straightner ever</li>
    <li> Bought flat iron for 100 in the mall...broke after 2 weeks and, of coarse, I cannot find my receipt. So incredibly disappointed. Really was excited about this flat iron.  Zebra and 100% ceramic...should have lasted longer than 2 weeks.  worse part ...in that 2 weeks..I used it 4 times. the outside has a burned looked by edges after 4 uses...thats not good.  what a bummer</li>
    <li> This is literally the best thing I have ever bought. Its amazing. It straightens and curls amazing. I will never buy another brand again. Also came really quick.</li>
    <li> I love this product it does wonders for my hair. It makes it super straight and soft. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this to get my &#x27;swag&#x27; on to go to parties. Girlll, I cannot tell you how nice this is. I have nothing bad to say! It makes my hair look beautiful, shiny, glowy, it doesn&#x27;t make it break or hurt. I love it, definitely recommended.</li>
