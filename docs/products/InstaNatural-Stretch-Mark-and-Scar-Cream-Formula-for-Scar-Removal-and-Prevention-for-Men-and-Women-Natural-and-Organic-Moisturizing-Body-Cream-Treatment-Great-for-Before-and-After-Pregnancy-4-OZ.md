<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft and nourished throughout the day. Also smells really good. Better than using almond oil because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I just started using it recently so I&#x27;m hoping it will help with preventing further pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
    <li> daughter just had baby .Works well</li>
    <li> This stretch mark and scar cream does a fabulous job of reducing the appearance of both stretch marks and scars. I recently had knee replacement surgery and used this cream as soon as the knee was healed enough for me to apply it. You can barely see the scar and it was a BIG one! I recommend it for anyone who wants to prevent scar tissue from forming. I&#x27;ll have to try it on some old scars to see how it works on those.</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free and in exchanged I’m providing my honest opinion.  When I was pregnant, I used several stretch mark lotions to help get rid of my stretch marks. Like anyone who’s been pregnant, they are often hard to get rid of regardless of what you use. For me, it’s hard: I gave birth to a 9 ½ (1st child) and a 10 (2nd child) pound babies. So my stomach has been stretched to maximum capacity.  The lotions I’ve used during my pregnancy and after giving birth doesn’t compare to what I’ve experienced with InstaNature Stretch Mark Cream. I’ve used it for several weeks and it’s been great; it gave me an extra moisturizer and my skin was very smooth and it can be felt all day long. I’m not sure if the product has diminish the appearance of my stretch marks because I have many so it’s hard to see the progress. I hope the long term uses of this cream will give me the results I’m looking for. I also know that my body will never look like it did before my two beautiful girls were born. But getting rid of some is good enough with me.</li>
    <li> Just finished this container tonight. Smells amazing, applies like lotion. I combined this with shea butter and another stretch mark cream. I can say that my NEW scars DID go away, however, the scars are still somewhat visible but faint. All in all its a good product, but I will be sticking to organic shea butter and coconut oil!</li>
    <li> It faded the stretch marks on my wife a little they over exaggerated about the product thou.</li>
    <li> Softens and lightens stretch marks. Evens skin. Love this stuff! Another great InstaNatural product!</li>
    <li> I honestly believe that when I finish the jar I will be unable to see stretch marks. Mine were white to begin with and now after almost 2 weeks I can tell that this product works.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t work as I thought but great moisturizer</li>
    <li> love this..not too heavy</li>
    <li> Saw no difference at all unfortunately. Would love to find something that actually works with these stretch marks after having my baby!</li>
    <li> I was using this while pregnant. I had stretch marks with my first child and with this second pregnancy i didn&#x27;t have much new stretch marks till the last month. It didn&#x27;t really work for me as far as stopping it from forming as I still had new red marks showing (since this second pregnancy was bigger that my first). It did feel nice though and i didn&#x27;t mind the smell. I was worried it was going to smell bad but it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
    <li> I tried it and did everything the vendors suggested for a month, meh. The vendor reported it could take up to 2 jars or more to see improvement. I was hoping for some improvement with one jar to motivate me to buy a second jar, sorry. I have fresh stretch marks on my tummy from after having a baby. Smells great and it is a great moisturizer but not for my needs. Vendor also reached out to see how I had liked it, great customer service I must say.</li>
    <li> I have used this stretch mark cream on some problem areas as well as on a scar on my leg. I have noticed the scar got lighter, though it is still there. InstaNatural sent this to me for review, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it in hopes that I&#x27;ll continue to see improvement on the scar.  So far, indications are positive!</li>
    <li> I want to say first and foremost, that I have used InstaNatural products in the past and they have yet to fail me. I only let you know that first because I always have high expectation for a company that delivers good products, therefore I would be looking at the product I am reviewing even more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today I am reviewing InstaNatural&#x27;s Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream (Prevention and Reduction). Now to I thought that the price was not attractive only because normally for the size it would run around $19.99 but then again stretch mark creams are in abundance and do not usually work as I have tried many after having my second kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have had a chance to use this product and give my evaluation. Lets start with my overall feel ------- LOVE IT!!!... It started to show results quick. I have literally waited months for a product to show me results without success. This is not true for this cream, after a week or so I saw a difference. I used it predominantly on my tummy and butt and sometimes thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream offered me a boost of confidence when I saw that the stretch marks appearance was reducing almost to the point that I felt comfortable in a 2-pc bathing suit again (ALMOST)... To start it contains many ingredients that are helpful in minimizing appearance and moisturizing your skin. From vitamin c, cocoa butter, rosehip oil, mango butter and aloe vera, your skin becomes more youthful and healthier. I have been applying morning and night and the results have only been getting better the longer I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> After amonth and s half I&#x27;ve seen my scars becoming lighter some are almost gone</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to ! InstaNatural’s stretch and scar cream truly does work. It is natural and smells great. I have a lot of new to fairly old scars due to my puppy. He is GSD that loves to jump on me, mouth me, and leave beautiful work while doing so. Unfortunately my body is not the place I would like to see these scars. I was really curious to try this product because there are many products that mention that they diminish the look of scars and stretch mark but I highly doubt they do. I have tried some and I was not too happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest once I applied this cream to my some of my scars old/new I noticed the appearance of the scars lessening after only about 2 or 3 uses. It was a great surprise to me but obviously a good one. I do some stretch marks that I need to be more  persistent on trying. But I can say that it does not irritate my skin being that I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed my stretch marks fading. They have gone from red to almost skin color or white, they aren&#x27;t going to disappear and that doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it does fade them and it leaves your skin silky soft. I am only halfway through the bottle and only use it on stretch marks so I will update when I finish the bottle on how much lighter my stretch marks got. I think this might be better for preventing them or if pregnant Than for trying to remove old ones but I like it, and it smells way better than the cellulite cream.</li>
    <li> I had gastric bypass a little over a year ago and I have some scars that are left over from the surgical tools. They aren’t big but they are still pretty dark in color.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the InstaNatural stretch mark and scar cream to try in return for an honest unbiased product review.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural has become one of my favorite brands of skincare products. I have used a huge amount them and have never been disappointed. The bottle of the scar and stretch mark cream was huge. You are definitely getting your money’s worth! I started using the cream right away on my scars so I could make sure that I had ample time to test the product. I used 2-3 times daily for about a month and I have noticed a huge reduction in the darkness of my scars. They are must less noticeable! I love the smell of the cream is very thick and luxurious so it goes on easily and rubs in nicely so you are not left with any residue. After using it for almost a month there is still a ton left in the bottle. I will continue to use on my scars to lighten them even further!</li>
    <li> This serum goes on easily. It also absorbs relatively quickly. I love that the ingredients are all natural. It does not have a strong like some of the other stretch mark creams do. This is not a quick fix. It does take a little time and using this as instructed but it does make progress with diminishing stretch marks. This gets an A from me. I am glad I had the chance to review this item.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I have super dry skin lately and so far this stuff has done what no other has without making me break out. I have also been using on stretch marks, but I think that it is too soon to tell if this lives up to the potential of the stretch mark reducer and/or fade beyond appearance. Still, cheaper than a lot of other moisturizers that I have purchased in the past that had left me very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream to review on my blog. This product contains ingredients such as Grape Seed Oil, Vitamin C, and Cocoa Butter. It is designed to deeply moisturize and thus fade old stretch marks and scars, as well as prevent new ones from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this product was that it smells heavenly! Sort of a light sweet scent - a little fruity, a little floral. A little bit goes a long way! This product isn&#x27;t super thick - but it isn&#x27;t runny either. It is the perfect consistency, in my opinion. The fact that it is nice and smooth and not too thick makes it easy to spread. This cream absorbs quickly. I actually started using it all over my body - not just on scars and stretch marks. That&#x27;s because it works! This is an amazing moisturizer. I give it two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> it makes your skin smoother for a fact but it does take a while for stretch marks to seem less noticeable. I&#x27;m halfway through the container and i barely see any difference but it works well as a moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Never saw a difference after using the product for a few months.</li>
    <li> Second review: I am very unhappy: they increased the price and decreased the volume of cream by 20%: scandalous! Moreover, the product itself is different than in the pump version that I received previously. I want my money back!  First review: I have been using the product for about two weeks so I cannot see any change yet. The texture is really nice and I love the smell. It is a rich cream but it penetrates pretty fast and it keeps my skin hydrated the whole day. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love all the products of InstaNatural. I have tried [[ASIN:B00K2O3NV2 Hyaluronic Acid Serum]],[[ASIN:B00H93NJLS ORGANIC Argan Oil For Hair, Face, Skin &amp; Nails]] and [[ASIN:B00KCFAZTE Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles &amp; Bags]]and now I try this [[ASIN:B00O14R17Q Stretch Mark Cream]] and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. There products are all natural and they really work. I use this for 2 weeks as prevention and I love how fast goes truth my skin. I hate to be all sticky but this is perfect. Also my husband use it for a while and he got some marks that you can see started reducing..slowly, he need to wear it a lot more, but is doing what it supposed to. Defiantly recommend it and this would be a must when I get pregnant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot;*&lt;br /&gt;*I receive this product to review it, but all opinions are my own.*</li>
    <li> The cream is very good and I love the pump dispenser, why did you change it???????? That was one of my favorite features and what differentiated you from the rest! Bad move, I hate not having the pump dispenser, that&#x27;s actually why I bought this one vs body merry&#x27;s in the first place.  Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> Pros: I have tried many stretch mark creams and scar creams in the past but none of them were as effective as the one from InstaNatural. I have only been using it for a little over a week and the scar I had from 2 years ago has faded a lot (The original color was a dark brown). It is not as dark as before and looks like it will almost be back to my natural skin color soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the stretch mark areas, they are also not as bright and obvious as before on my leg in the spot I have been using it. The InstaNatural Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream works really well to my surprise and I would recommend buying this if you have scar marks or stretch marks that are noticeable and want them to disappear even if they are scars/stretch marks from over a year ago. This cream is also very moisturizing and won&#x27;t dry out your skin. The scent of this cream is a little on the floral side but it is not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The only slightly bad thing about this cream is that when you pump it out, the cream and the oil comes out separate. The first time that I used it, I don&#x27;t remember this happening but so far every time afterwards the cream comes out this way. You have to be careful that the oil doesn&#x27;t leak off your hand and fall onto something else like the floor. I have tried shaking the bottle to see if maybe I could mix the oil back into the cream but it didn&#x27;t seem to work and it still pumps out as cream and oil. :/ Other than that little issue, I think this product is great and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works so good!! Can&#x27;t find this in stores with this price!! Will be ordering again!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I got the opportunity to test this stretch mark cream. As a pregnant momma, I know what a stretch mark looks like. As most of you will agree, they are not pretty.  Using this cream has not only made my stretch marks disappear, but it has also helped by keeping them away. I have used the cream on my tummy for about two weeks now and I can really see a difference. The cream stays on your skin. Like a shield. It does not rub off on clothing. My skin has felt softer and healthier. I also love the smell of the cream. The cream dispenses easily from the bottle and is white in color.</li>
    <li> Now this is a product I&#x27;ve been waiting on for so long!!! A stretch mark formula that actually works!!!  I  have marks in my stomach, thighs, and my arms. The marks on my stomach is really what I&#x27;m most embarrassed about so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m mostly targeting. They were wide, dark and all over the place, but they&#x27;re actually starting to fade out and lighten up matching my skin tone. I&#x27;m so impressed with this cream!! I was thinking if cocoa butter didn&#x27;t work for me then this cream wouldn&#x27;t either, but the results are so amazing! I&#x27;m definitely using this until I get the results I&#x27;m looking for! This was a free product used for review purposes!!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of mothers that would benefit from this! Love it.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Works great. I put it on in the AM and the PM and it fades them away.</li>
    <li> Jan 19 2016&lt;br /&gt;Was really, really skeptical that this cream was going to work. I have been working hard to lose my baby and lazy weight, but the dark stretch marks around my belly button were not lightening and I was developing new marks from the weightloss. I have been using this cream at least once a day with the instanatural hyaluronic acid and a derma roller(every 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;the result have been fantastic! Drastic lightening and lessening of all the marks. What&#x27;s even better? I still have half of the jar left and I&#x27;m using it over a large area, my stomach and my hips. This cream goes a long way for the price of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, it tends to react to just about everything I put on it. I have not had any adverse reaction to this cream nor any other InstaNatural product!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discount for honest, unbiased review* AND I am so happy that I did!</li>
    <li> I was using it during and after my 3rd pregnancy.  The stretch mark I have been living with for almost 5 years has faded.  I can hardly notice it now.  It&#x27;s not greasy and does not have strong smell.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet smells good and you get a good amount for the money I&#x27;d order again but to early to tell if it works but</li>
    <li> I applied it to my stretch marks, and feel it is absorbed very fast, and moisturized them. I love it!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
    <li> This is a tough one.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with the positives.  I love the way that this cream looks.  It looks exactly like a slightly melted buttercream frosting - creamy with little spots of oil throughout.  It smells fine but if it smelled like a vanilla buttercream I would have rated this 5-stars as a body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard for me to consistently use a stretch mark cream, and this one is no different.  The product must be applied twice a day for months if you expect to see results.  My stretch marks are the silvery cracks of thin skin on upper outer thighs following pregnancies.  This cream doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly, so following a shower in the morning, I apply the cream and find my pants sort of sticking to it after I get dressed.  Same routine at night, where my pajamas cling to the heavily moisturized areas.  Not the greatest feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been about a month, and I do not see a visual difference in the appearance of my stretch marks.  Nor do I expect to.  I can&#x27;t see how a cream could actually repair the type of stretch marks that I have, where the skin has literally cracked into these crepey indentions in my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a moisturizing cream, and I suspect that if you have the red-stretch marks or &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; marks it could work, but my marks are so old I think that it is hopeless.  But I will continue to use it as it is super hydrating and creamy!</li>
    <li> After trying all types of creams and lotions with no success, I will admit I was less than optimistic on how well this cream would work. After all what&#x27;s so different about this specific cream? What did it have that others didn&#x27;t? But nonetheless, I was going to try it and hope for the best. Let me be the first to say, I am so glad that I did because I have already seen a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and already the appearance of my stretch marks have begun to diminish. They are by no means completely gone, but they are a lot less noticeable and that&#x27;s more than I could say after trying any other cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; to read my full review visit my blog meandmyminime.com</li>
    <li> No changes. :( I thinks it&#x27;s just my diet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week but I&#x27;m already noticing a change in the texture of my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, my marks dissappeared like magic....</li>
    <li> This works wonders on stretch marks! Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> Noticed a change in scars in the first few days &amp; a greater change after one month.</li>
    <li> This product, hands down, is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Will post a before and after soon.</li>
    <li> I had a baby 15 months ago now and have used numerous products now, I also had many scars for surgeries as well. I have had visible results since using this product. It has a nice rich creaminess to it without an order. Would recommend to someone!</li>
    <li> I received my instaNatural Stretch Mark Cream well packaged. .I do luv d smell and d fact DAT it absorbs quickly on d skin, however Its too early to tell if it works so am going to give it bout a month to c aw it goes. I do av very bad stretch marks. Am planing on using it twice a day 4 a month.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the way it makes your skin feel so soft!  I am seeing results after only one month!  I religiously put this on morning and night after a shower!  I am already on my 2nd bottle and will continue to use this amazing cream!  The price is actually really affordable as well!  Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it for too long but I have to say it leaves my skin very smooth and soft. So much better compared to the other stretch mark products I used. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I just gave birth 3 months ago and imagine the scary stretch marks you can see, this literally decreased the amount of lines in my tummy. I love this better than oils/other promising lotion to take stretch mark away. I wish I have done a weekly review for this but I just realized I already used it all up. I have really seen diminished lines from my post pregnancy to up to now. The smell? Better than any lotion I have bought. My husband told me that he also loves the smell.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would. Does not work does not smell good...nothing...pure garbage.</li>
    <li> Well, so far I am not seeing any results. I continue to apply it in hopes I will see improvement. The company seems to care very much about the quality of their product and I commend them for that. I saw that others were having very good results from using this so I guess that&#x27;s why I still have hope. 8/28/15 Well, I gave it my best shot. Did not work at all. Won&#x27;t buy again. Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Significant difference within 3 weeks. Smells good. Thin and smooth. Kinda goes fast tho</li>
    <li> A month in so far minor results but results I think you have to continue use at least 3 months to see significant results</li>
    <li> I have used about half the jar and I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant reduction in my stretch marks. However, it is very moisturizing and it may do well at preventing stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This product is like magic my stretch mark was starting to fade with in 3days.love it</li>
    <li> The first jar of this that I got was wonderful. Almost no noticeable smell, and seemed to work really well. I just reordered, and the new jar has an absolutely UNBEARABLE rose perfume smell. I&#x27;m talking about to the point that even after applying it at night and getting a full night&#x27;s sleep, the next morning the scent was STILL overwhelming on me (and I usually like scented things!). I am certainly disappointed as I know it is best to avoid heavy fragrances during pregnancy, and the first jar was so great.&lt;br /&gt;As far as efficacy, like I said, the first jar worked. I have yet to notice a stretch mark after using it for months 4-7. Sadly, I will not be able to comment on its continuing use as there is no way that I could stand to use the replacement jar and I am afraid to reorder and waste more money.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, this can double as perfume once that baby comes!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. Ive been using it a few months daily with no inorovement. I used it for scarring. If it was for stretch marks I&#x27;d be uncomfortable since its very hard to pump enough to cover my mark areas! Anyways the customer service is stellar and they do offer a full guarantee but the product does not work and I&#x27;d feel guilty returning something I used already. Gave it a shot. It doesnt work. Thanks to a great company though I will try other products by them since they do seem to have the best service ever.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it helped me or not since I have nothing to compare to. I have been using it my whole pregnancy and I only have a couple of stretchmarks</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  It has helped diminish my scars already!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product when I originally reviewed it but I felt the need to add more as time has gone by. The product is very effective for preventing stretch marks from getting worse and even making them better. The reason you really want to buy this product is the customer service. I&#x27;ve never dealt with better customer service than with this product. They appreciate their customers as much as I appreciate them providing me with such a reliable product</li>
    <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
    <li> So far so good. My honest opinion is that I have been using it on my stomach twice a day for two weeks. My stretch marks are less visible. I would say about a 25% improvement. I really like the product. I plan on using it with a derma roller over the next three weeks and updating my review.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth trying! I noticed a slight change within the 1st month. I plan on continuing to use &amp; buy this product faithfully.</li>
    <li> No change in new or old pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
    <li> It does make stretch marks diminish. I like it to use as a lotion to. I wish I had this when I was pregnant with my first child 9 and a half years ago. I think it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Insta Naturals doesn&#x27;t test their products on animals and it&#x27;s made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> This did not prevent stretch marks but it did fade them in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my 2nd trimester and postpartum.</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen any signs of my scar diminishing. I have not used to entire jar yet. As soon as I am, I will write an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Edit: For some reason my review for this was something else!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great at reducing strechmarks, and scars. The formula is light and airy, goes on smooth. Non greasy, or leaving a residue.I have noticed a change in my stretch marks since using this. . Complementary product received for review</li>
    <li> Great creme for the old stretch marks that are hard to get rid of. I bought another bottle of this for my sister too because it worked so well for me. It makes them a lot smaller and a lot less noticeable. great for new moms :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with dry body brushing and a salux cloth for added exfoliation. I started seeing results in about 2 weeks of using this once sometimes twice a day. Consistency is key. I&#x27;m very happy with the way this is making my stretchmarks look so far!</li>
    <li> Again, I did not receive this item free or at a promotional price.  I am on my third container.  Thank Heavens that they redid the packaging on it because I always felt like I was not getting all I could from the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, with persistence, patience and exfoliation, this product has made a difference in my scars and stretch marks.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The cream is easily absorbed by the skin without oily after feel. The cream smells &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and is not too heavily fragranced. I&#x27;ve used a whole jar on my growing belly and I do not have new stretch marks from this second pregnancy. The jar lasted for about 1.5 months, two applications a day on my belly. As my stretch marks from my previous pregnancy had turned white already, I cannot comment on how it performs on new, angry looking, purplish red stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because I got stretch marks after pregnancy, I&#x27;m using it twice a day but I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> I got this cream because i read good reviews but so far i hardly see any improvement  on my stretch marks they still are noticeable and I&#x27;m halfway of my first jar</li>
    <li> I love this product my its getting softer.</li>
    <li> About a month using this and there has been no improvements.</li>
    <li> Buying this for my pregnant wife to prevent stretch marks and she swears buy the results! She loves it and plans to use this to help with the c-section scar after the healing process. Shipping is very fast and don&#x27;t forget to read down to the description section as there are a couple promo codes there to save a couple bucks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this over 2 months now, I&#x27;m not sure if Ive see any great result as yet, but I&#x27;m still trying to see what can happen within 4 months.. But for some reason I like this product and also the smell.. Great customer service too and that&#x27;s what matter to me the most beside getting  rid of these ugly stretch mark 😀 Will keep you guys up to date!</li>
    <li> So far I been using this cream for 1 day only lol but I&#x27;m loving it. Love it&#x27;s gentle aroma, good for sensitive skin. I put it on and instantly my skin feels soft and hydrated. I will continue to use and later on I will update my review :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> It really does work!  Thanks for an excellent product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about two weeks on recent scars and old stretch marks.  It&#x27;s made a visible improvement in the appearance of the scars, but it hasn&#x27;t changed the look of the stretch marks.  Maybe it only works on recent marks?  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been very pleased that this product is actually working!</li>
    <li> Wow... was just giving this a try, but it really works! Before I used cocoa butter, it works at some point, and eventually just stop at some point. But this thingy continue repair all the works that cocoa butter left behind, I am seeing some of my stretch marks going away now, for only 2 weeks! They became a lot lighter, probably will not be completely gone, but a lot better than it used to, a few of them are barely visible at the moment. Thank you InstaNatural!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE InstaNatural products. This product smells so fresh and delicate I love it. I apply this on my inner thighs because they occasionally rub together when I&#x27;m wearing shorts. I don&#x27;t get that weird &amp;#34;skin rub&amp;#34; feeling, instead, I get a smooth feeling and I am obsessed with this product! It also does wonderfully to smooth and moisturize the skin. It gives you that &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; feeling. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin or with skin that rubs together!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a reduction in redness and my skin feels smoother and less ridged. The cream is just the right thickness and easily rubs in to the skin with out an oily or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> Most know if you gain weight very fast you gain stretch marks. O boy don&#x27;t we love them not. Sorry had to be a joke in there. Did you know if you loose a lot of weight fast too you will get them also. See you learned something today. For women most will get them during or after having babies. They are found on hips, stomach and breasts. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! It is apart of life for women to get them on breast, but what would you do if you could help with those. Well this stretch mark cream will help with disguising them. I can not say yet if they will prevent them, but if it can then it is truly a miracle bottle. Now not only do women get it men too. So think about the men in your life too.</li>
    <li> I had a few stretch marks on my abdomen and now you can barely see them. I brought this product a few times because I was using it twice day for 4 months in order to get results.</li>
    <li> daughter using it for stretch marks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as an all-over moisturizer, including on some scars I have.  The ingredients are so very nourishing - my skin looks young, supple, moisturized, smooth, and my scars are actually beginning to soften and fade into the same shade as the surrounding skin!  I will definitely recommend this to anyone with stretch marks or scars.  It&#x27;s a product that will need to be used consistently in order to see results, but in just a short amount of time results are showing!</li>
    <li> I ordered this one after reading all the reviews. I wanna know if its really work. Just a week of using it and already saw  result.  My SM shrink fast and less and less noticeable each day. maybe because i&#x27;m also using another SM cream( stretch marks and scars defense cream). I used the two cream at the same time. And the results was unbelievable. My mistake was not having before and after photo of my SM. when i bought this i still have doubt thats why I didn&#x27;t bother to take a pic. I need to buy another one since the jar was small and not enough for a month of use. I love this cream.</li>
    <li> Great product works well.</li>
    <li> You have to use it consistently for a few weeks before seeing results but it does a great job at lessening the appearance of stretch marks.  Again, another great product from InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> Does not work waste of money</li>
    <li> Using as a scar cream, smells great and makes skin feel super soft!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet since its only been 2 weeks. But it has a wonderful scent and it seems to be firming up the skin so far!</li>
    <li> The stretch mark cream didn&#x27;t live up to the reviews. I did some research and found an It Works Distributor through Instagram and decided to order their stretch mark cream. It&#x27;s a little pricier but WORTH IT!! My 5 year old stretch marks have diminished and so have my wrinkles on my chest! Her website is kmstarks.myitworks. com and all orders ship directly to my home!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help me. I&#x27;m black and it didn&#x27;t so anything for my skin.</li>
    <li> hasnt done much at all for my pregnancy stretch marks except maybe make the skin feel less dry.  will continue to try though!</li>
    <li> Seriously this will really get rid of your marks I used everything and nothing worked I thought it was just another cream but no it really does work I used this with a dermaroller and emu oil I&#x27;m really really happy</li>
    <li> Still don&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> This cream feels sooo nice! It is smooth, smells GREAT and makes my skin soft like baby&#x27;s. It takes long time for stretch marks to leave and I have used this for just two weeks. It makes my skin lightly itch which means that something is going on, being repaired. It is not &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; itch, but good itch if you know what I mean. It is natural, free of bad ingredients and I am happy I have it!&lt;br /&gt;In few months I will update my review to describe any changes to my 15 year old stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I am 18 years old and I have really bad stretch marks on my breasts. The stretch marks formed from the rapid weight gain when I was 12. I ended up losing the weight over the past two years and I went from a size 12 to a size 2. Now that I am comfortable with my body I want to show it off. However my stretch marks make me self conscious. So I typed in stretch mark cream on Amazon, and I read the reviews. So, I said why not. I ordered InstaNatural Stretch Mark Cream, and all I can say is wow! I have been using the cream for 4 weeks now and my white stretch marks are starting to fade. I apply the product twice a day, once in the morning, and once at night. I am really happy with the results. This product may be expensive for some, but it is well worth it! The cream also smells really good! Great product InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> As a young male who had stretch marks after gained weight from a serious injury, it was awesome to find something that could help reduce the size and bad looks of stretch marks. I still have them of course, but after using this product for a month, they have definitely improved and that was the goal. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I have only been using it for a few weeks so im not 100% sure it works yet, but I will continue to use it and wait for the results. I have a few stretch marks from having a baby I would like to get rid of soon</li>
    <li> So far nothing. Half way done.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me, but the customer service from the company was pretty awesome!!</li>
    <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this is working for the stretch marks as mine are faded and old - but I sure love it as a lotion overall so I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference, but scars seem to be less noticeable</li>
    <li> I used while pregnant and still after. Yes I got some stretch marks but I wasn&#x27;t expecting not too and I didn&#x27;t get as many as with last baby but my skin felt great. my older stretch marks are not as noticeably red and I love the gentle smell of the cream.</li>
    <li> So far so great!!!! I have used it for about 2 and a half months and I&#x27;m liking it a lot. No new stretch marks and the old ones have reduced considerably.&lt;br /&gt;I will get more cuz im only on my second trimester so there&#x27;s more changes to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cream for 3 days and after the first day I noticed a visible change in my stretch marks (the more fresh ones) I&#x27;m hoping that this cream will help reduce the appearance of my older stretch marks too. I will be buying more of this product and hope that others will try it too, I can honestly say this cream works very well!</li>
    <li> Light weight and not a strong smell.  Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t stick to my clothes after a couple of drying minutes. I put it on after every shower and before every run.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make it hotter when I run like some heavier creams do.  I am currently 5 months pregnant and so far no new stretch marks.  Of course its a bit too early to tell.</li>
    <li> I mean didn&#x27;t work for me. Dermaneedling and exfoliating are the way to go</li>
    <li> Used for a month, 2 times a day, haven&#x27;t seen any change at all</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement after a few weeks of use. The company does email you and let you know it can take up to 2 months for results, however I did not want to pay another $30 since I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement thus far.</li>
    <li> Not working for me. Don&#x27;t see any difference!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but I can say its helping with some light colored stretch marks. I&#x27;ll update again after i&#x27;ve used the whole jar.</li>
    <li> I thought it would help reduce stretch marks but in the last 2 weeks i did not see no difference.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Stretch marks stayed the same.</li>
    <li> Using this product on my belly stretch mark from giving birth. I can tell the difference now...Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream! So much better than smelling coco butter all the time :) it&#x27;s not sticky, or watery. It rubs in really well and leaves you skin feeling really smooth and refreshing! I have noticed my stretch marks have lightened a bit since I&#x27;ve been using this cream</li>
    <li> This product does not work! Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now. Did not see any result and on top of that. It makes my stretch marks more visible.  Going back to use mama mio butter cream. Even though it&#x27;s more expensive but it helps minimize my stretch marks about 60% before and after pregnancy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unusual for me to get excited about products like these but this one actually works. It faded the stretch marks on my arms and belly. I really thought it was just another beauty industry gimic but it works. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the consistency but the formula is okay, the consistency is that of an oil based lotion. I love that I was able to use up the entire bottle because of the awesome pump the product features. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. This has no bearing on my review. I have shared with you my honest experience and opinion on the product. The detailed review of the product is on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> i have been using this stretch cream for about a week and already notice my stretch marks disappearing  i will continue to use it and would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> It is wathry to give it try&lt;br /&gt;Very respectful company</li>
    <li> Very hydrating, great scents, still trying this product.</li>
    <li> I have stretch marks from, who knows where. But I do, and they are on my buttocks, stomach, and legs. I now know that this can happen to anyone at anytime, no warning, rhyme or reason. So I was glad to have found this cream. I have been using it now for about five days and it is not harsh on my skin, at all. After only about a week of regular use of the cream, I begin to notice results. I used it every morning after my shower. I have had no allergic reactions, breakouts, burning or any pain due to using the cream. No unpleasant odors here either. I am quite pleased with this cream thus far and can honestly recommend giving it a try, to anyone. If you want to at least reduce your scars or stretch marks, get this. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
    <li> Few weeks after, it still hasn&#x27;t worked. Boo.</li>
    <li> I’ve fallen in love with this product. It smells nice and leaves my skill feeling soft and oil-free. It appears to be doing its job as I don’t have any stretch marks yet. :)</li>
    <li> I had stretch marks on my legs and they are completely gone and I still have a lot of product left over. I will definitely recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super thick and I have no idea how well it works yet. Only been using for a couple of months. However, I can say that it ABSOLUTELY hydrates my skin and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Will update after pregnancy is over.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural continues to impress me with every product they offer! I have been using their scar cream on some deep scars for almost a month now. I know better than to believe that a cream will magically erase any sign of scarring, but this cream really did improve my skin so that the scars &#x27;blend&#x27; into my &#x27;normal&#x27; skin. While I will always see my scars, I am not nearly as self conscience of them anymore due to them becoming much less pronounced. The cream is full of quality ingredients that you find in scar creams, and then even more that I hadn&#x27;t seen before. The cream is a nice consistency that stays the same at varying &#x27;room&#x27; temperatures. It works great at keeping your skin moisturized, and it has a very light pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I continue to use InstaNatural&#x27;s cream, and after a couple of months I do notice a difference, especially in the &#x27;smoothing&#x27; of the deep scars. The scars themselves are still fading, but the scar having a smoother &#x27;finish&#x27; is a very nice change, and really makes the scar itself less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have had a chance to use this for about two weeks now an ladies I wish I had before and after pic of my thighs, its not an overnight process but it does work and work wonders, it smells great, absorbs into the skin and leaves the skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Just received this product in the mail from Marco. I have used several of their products and love them all. I have had stretch marks on my belly, butt and thighs from having 2 kids years ago so they are light but I have plenty of them. I REALLY REALLY hope this cream will lighten them even more. I wear swimsuits but would like these marks to be less noticeable when I go on vacay in a couple of weeks. At 1st use I can feel the cream working and it smells divine. Here&#x27;s my before pic. I will be back with a 2 week pic to show if there&#x27;s any difference.</li>
    <li> My stretch marks have lightened so much I can hardly see them anymore I love this product!</li>
    <li> was excited for the reviews , I bought 2, and still no progress. I put it on more than 5 times a day and still nothing</li>
    <li> smell really good and work great, I have 8 month already without stretch mark :)</li>
    <li> I just finish my 3rd bottle and I still don&#x27;t see any effect yet.</li>
    <li> The products that works. I like it. Few applications and you already see the results. The packaged arrived quickly and sealed properly. I use this product to lessen the appearance of my stretch mark in my belly due to pregnancy. So far, I am satisfied with the result. I am still using it as of now. I will definetly recommend this to my friends. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product before they changed to this new one. First, they went from 5oz to 4oz for the same price. Next, the cream was perfect in terms of scent. Now they messed it up. The scent in my opinion smells horrible and too strong. Very dissapointed. I have to return now. Hopefully in the future they will go back to what they had before.</li>
    <li> nice thick lotion and it smells nice, but did nothing for my stretch marks</li>
    <li> I had my daughter six years ago and have always been embarrassed of my stretch marks. I&#x27;ve used this for 1 week and can tell a major difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see (not see) the difference by the end of the month. Very impressed</li>
    <li> Feel nice on the skin but doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> was a baby-shower gift for a friend...she said it was a nice product</li>
    <li> Like how this is in a tub. Leaves no greasy residue. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! I&#x27;ve never had anything work so great!! I got really bad stretch marks from my boys and within a week they are already getting better!!!</li>
    <li> Have yet to see results but it smells good!</li>
    <li> It works I going to order it again my skin is smoother and some of my maker are disappearing</li>
    <li> If I used this stuff everyday like I should, it would prob work better. But I don&#x27;t...so it doesn&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s a good product, so it deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> There is no hope for old stretch marks. I used the whole bottle as directed and saw no results. Maybe it would help new stretch marks but I can&#x27;t testify to that.</li>
    <li> I got this cream 1 week back and have been applying diligently.&lt;br /&gt;Initial thoughts - smells yummy , very light non greasy formula goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect this magically erase my pregnancy induced stretch marks in a week. I will update the review after a month on the improvement</li>
    <li> I used this for a month and there is a big difference in my belly!!! I have two baby&#x27;s and omg my stomach was terrible!! And now they are almost fully gone!! I was scared at first to buy it because I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work but it DOES:))) love it and I am going to continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to update this review. The more I use this cream the more I like it. My C-section scar is fading and this works great on scabs too.</li>
    <li> Odd but not offensive smell. I have yet to notice a real difference after a couple weeks usage. Otherwise it&#x27;s an ok moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I  know that you have to use this kind of stuff for a while to see any results, and I was willing to give it a shot. I could not take the smell. It just did not settle well with me at all. I used it for about a month and could not see any results either so I went back to the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product just been one week and I can see the diferente&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;And smells so good</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, I feel that it is only for people who have small amounts of stretch marks mine are to embedded into my skin in which case I didn&#x27;t see much results. It&#x27;s not a bad product it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I really regret not taking a before and after picture of my stretch marks to show everyone really how amazing this product has been to me. I don&#x27;t even use it regularly and still, my stretch marks have faded almost completely after being bright pinks and dark purples stretched across my skin after only two months. I was so skeptical of a stretch mark cream because this was my first round of ever having them, and with me having such fair skin, I was almost positive nothing would work so well.. but I&#x27;m SO happy I spent the money on this. The only thing that could even be considered negative about it is that it separates over time, but a quick shake mixes it all back together. It&#x27;s going to last me for at least another year I&#x27;m willing to bet, and when I run out, I will be buying more. Thank you to the creators for giving me back my confidence.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this cream recently in my home. The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. I wanted to try this cream on my scars to see if it would lighten them. It worked quite well, I have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for three weeks on several scars and it lightened them considerably. This cream contains Vitamin C (15%), Cocoa Butter,Rosehip Oil, Mango Butter, Grapeseed Oil, and Evening Primrose Oil to provide intense moisturization and improve skin’s elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who just had a baby and needs to get rid of the stretch marks from it and people who have scars they wish were lighter. It also smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any progression. On the box specifically states to give it 2 months use before seeing improvements.</li>
    <li> First of all i&#x27;ll start by saying I am so DISAPPOINTED with this product . I&#x27;ve been searching for a stretch mark cream for years &amp; after reviewing all the reviews for this products I decided to buy not only 1 BUT 2 of these . I did as the instruction said , applying it on both nights &amp; mornings but instead of seeing the marks diminish they seemed to show MORE &amp; More. Once I stopped using this product my stretch marks seemed to show less . So at this point , I am just confused .</li>
    <li> I have an 20 yr old scar on my leg from shattering it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but the stretch cream helped. I feel like this is a product that needs to  be used longer to see the full affect. I was offered this product at a reduced price to give my unbiased opinion. I LOVE the InstaNatural skincare line!</li>
    <li> Im on my second week of use and I started to see a reduce in the coloration of the strech marks I&#x27;ll continue the use and update when I get more results</li>
    <li> As a Mama of 5 boys we get a lot of scrapes in this family!  Yes, some stitch scars too!  I plan to use it on my sons after my own successful trial:  I used this a couple times on myself on an angry red burn scar (from bumping a hot oven rack), and WOW!!!  It greatly improved in 24 hours!  I LOVE the natural ingredients!  I am impressed with the quality of this product!  Instanaturals makes another terrific NATURAL product!  LOVE your stuff!  5 stars to you!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream!!!  Been using it twice a day for about two weeks now and can already feel a change in my skin texture.  I just wished it came in a bigger jar.  It also helped with the itching.  Highly recommend it for any moms to be :)</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing. hasn&#x27;t changed the look of my stretch marks at all. So i&#x27;m using it as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend really loved it, started fading after 1st use! I received a complementary 2nd tub of this stuff! For just giving them my feedback! Great company, she wants to try there cellulite cream too.</li>
    <li> I know you can&#x27;t see change over night, but this cream is amazing! I look forward to see the long term results.</li>
    <li> Best stretch mark cream I have found. I have triplet babies and have stretch marks to prove it. :/ I have seen a dramatic improvement already and more than I have with any other product. I spent $90 2x on a scar serum from a local plastic surgeon and this works better. Hard to believe this little $20 bottle works better but it really really does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month, twice daily, and with a derma-roller. I have to say, I didn&#x27;t expect results but a long time, pre-existing scar has become smaller and turned from red to greenish. (more looking like a bruise instead of a scar) As for the stretch marks on my stomach (from pregnancy) they went from a purple/deep red color to pink, and have become smaller and less noticeable. No, they are not completely removed, but I could say that now I will feel more comfortable putting on a bikini. Whether old or new, you should definitely (routinely) buy Instanatural.</li>
    <li> i honestly put it on morning and night for 3 weeks on new strech marks i did not see a difference</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any visable results from this product but I haven&#x27;t been using it long.</li>
    <li> I have been greatly impressed with this product. I have stretch marks from quick weight gain and found that this mark has reduced them exceptionally quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This product is a scam. Dont buy</li>
    <li> I never thought any cream could reduced my 8 years old stretch marks but this cream did.</li>
    <li> Last pregnancy I used the Palmers coca butter stretch mark cream. I used it religiously every night starting at about 10 weeks. My stretch marks were What I consider mild, but the smell was awful and it never rubbed in no matter what I did. I am starting my stretch mark cream much earlier this time and I already love this product. The smell is crisp and it rubs in very nicely. I can already tell that my skin feels nicer. I&#x27;ll update later about the actual prevention or fading  of stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over half a year now for my buttock region (I have zebra stretch marks that are quite prominent).  I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously, in hopes that they will go away, and I even have bought this product multiple times to give it a fair try.  I&#x27;m on my third jar, and so far I&#x27;ve only seen very little progress.  I&#x27;m giving up on this product after this last jar...</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really works, seems like you have to buy several bottles to possibly have a chance of results.</li>
    <li> After five weeks post pregnancy, my stretch marks are fading quite noticeably.  Had a couple large, dark ones, and a few more small light ones.  Most of the light smaller ones are completely faded.  The larger, darker ones are fading, and I&#x27;m confident that after a few more weeks of use, I&#x27;ll notice even more results.  Worth every penny in my opinion, and probably more.  Love the consistency of the cream, and it even has a pleasant scent.  Love that it&#x27;s natural, too!</li>
    <li> Its a good cream that will moisturize well.  But it did not decrease my stretch marks any.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all...</li>
    <li> I met with devastated accident and having lot of scars. I tried many products i.e. Madera, bio oil, Scar gel Etc. By luck I found this product and its really working good. I am using this product last 9 months scars are fading out. Even my doctors are impressed after seeing my scars, they also recommending to other patients.</li>
    <li> Beware of this product if you have a darker complexion. After using this product a few times I had an allergic reaction to it. I used this product on several places and ended up with dark spots about the size of a pin head all over. I had two new scars on my leg from my cat scratching me ...I used this product on one scar and Bio oil  on the second scar. The Bio oil lighten up significantly, and the scar  that I used  this product is darker....much darker. I will use Bio Oil to correct the damage to my skin from this product.  Forget the money back refund.....Amazon won&#x27;t refund after 30 days. So don&#x27;t fall for that scam that this company &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I used this product religously twice a day for two months on my old white stretch marks, and while it is a great moisturizer, I saw no difference in my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Save your money, this is fake. Mine came unsealed smh. Used it and my stretch marks seemed to have gotten worst smh</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good words to say about InstaNatural and its products. I have a big fan of their eye cream and skin care line – and this stretch mark and scar cream is in the same league as their other products! I have been using it on my legs because sometimes, razor nicks from shaving can’t be avoided. I also use it on my arms because I cook all the time and sometimes, minor burn marks are inevitable. I love InstaNatural and its products – they always work me and are all very gentle on my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> ok so i got this and opened it as fast as i could, i have streach marks all over from when i had my kids and of course i have marks from chicken pox on my face and a few other scars which i am so glad i got a chance to try this, there fading fast! just like they were never there to being with! i&#x27;ve even used this on my psoriasis on my leg where i had still some left and scaring from scratching and that is fading too! Goodbye marks hello beautiful skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The InstaNatural Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream comes in a good sized bottle and has the easy dispenser again.  When I first used this, I was slightly worried as it came out quite oily but I remembered that I needed to shake it up!  Once shaken, the product came out as a silky cream.  This cream has a really fresh smell to it and rubs in well.  I haven’t noticed a change on my stretch marks (yet) but It has reduced the appearance of a couple of oven burn scars that I have on my arm.  Review powered by Brandbacker!</li>
    <li> I truly love this company and brand i have had the pleasure to review and use many of their full size products and i am always satisfied for many reasons they smell amazing and use many natural great ingredients that i truly adore i love how i can see that my stretch marks are starting to get lighter and slowly fade  and iv only been using this for a few weeks can wait to see how they will look after a few months! this is my honest and truthful opinion! #sponcerd</li>
    <li> Stretch Marks are like a nightmare that can&#x27;t be avoided! What the hell do you do with them? They definitely don&#x27;t discriminate, so like most you try every thing on the shelve and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is rich and smooth and very absorbent, most importantly it&#x27;s not greasy so your clothing won&#x27;t get messed up. What I love about this is that it&#x27;s similar to a body lotion and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects from the cream. My skin felt smoother I am excited to see continued results.</li>
    <li> I am honestly the skeptical kind when it comes to creams that will  help diminish scars and stretch marks. I have used so many in the past, all of which didn&#x27;t produce any visible results. I have been a long time fan of InstaNatural, and I found that their products work wonderfully for me, so I decided to give this product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of losing weight, and while the pounds are dropping, I of course have some stretch marks from my years of being overweight. And of course I have some scars on my body that just never went away. So this cream really had its work cut out for it! I began using this as directed on my stomach and arms for the stretch marks. Those areas are my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas. I also applied some to a scar I have on my finger that I got as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this daily for a month now, and I am very pleased with the results I have thus far. The scar has diminished about 20% I&#x27;d say. Although that number isn&#x27;t too impressive, it is a very old scar, at least 15 years old. So I didn&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles and work fast. However I do see improvement and this has only been a month. Without a doubt I am going to keep using this to maximize results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my stretch marks, in the past month I have noticed a 50% difference in their appearance. Some are quite faded away, others are a work in progress. I am just astonished at how amazing this stuff works on my scars and stretch marks that aren&#x27;t fairly recent, or new members on the block sorta speak. If this is working that well for me, I cannot imagine how incredible this product would be for new mothers looking to say goodbye to those new stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a product like this, give this one a shot. You have nothing to lose. It contains fabulous ingredients that will benefit your skin, and make those pesky scars and stretch marks less visible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.ry to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome , it really works, day by day I&#x27;m seeing changes</li>
    <li> I like how moisturizing the cream is. I started the cream at 30 weeks pregnant (currently 36 weeks). The cream has not stopped the stretch marks, but it is keeping the itching at bay. I&#x27;ll probably buy another bottle for post pregnancy to help diminish the appearance of the marks as I go back to my normal size. Overall, I like the cream and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> smells delicious!! I use it twice a day but I really don’t see a big difference</li>
    <li> I love how easily this stretch mark cream glides on, how quickly it dries and that it really works. Also, the pump mechanism on the dispenser a great delivery method because it dispenses the same amount of product, thus reducing waste. The product is pleasant smelling, only needs to be applied twice a day to work and really moisturizes skin. I like also that the product uses natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other stretch mark creams, since, you know, I have stretch marks from pregnancy, and it is much more pleasant to use than the other creams which makes me more likely to apply it which makes it more effective in treating the stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the products for review free of charge. I was not compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand  of Stretch Mark cream many time because I know its work than other product that I had in  the past.&lt;br /&gt;1 month  using it its Reduce stretch marks &amp; scars that i have..&lt;br /&gt;Not only that its really good because its full of natural and organic ingredients that&#x27;s why my skin start become healthy because its moisturized the skin after using it it&#x27;s like you apply some lotion even it&#x27;s not.  Completely amazing, this brand of product is way way different than I had before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream a few days,skin is soft moistured, I see the marks improving, I&#x27;ll give it a little more time,but so far I am happy with the progress</li>
    <li> this product gives me a little itch everytime I apply it to my stretch marks. I don&#x27;t have that much but it helps lighten my skin but it will still goes back to normal color. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful cream! The scent of it is so nice! I have been using this cream for six months now! What a difference! I have four kids so I HAD unsightly stretch marks on my waist they are barely noticeable now! So happy with results!</li>
    <li> Very hard to rub in and has an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it. No difference noted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had stretch marks since my freshman year of high school. They have been a problem and I do not like the way they look. Then I found my holy grail. This cream smells very good and I apply this twice daily, once in the morning and at night. I have noticed that my problem area (my hips) is much more smoother and my stretch marks are less visible. I am currently trying it out on my belly button piercing scar. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvememnt yet, but hopefully it will improve.</li>
    <li> I had my first child 14 and a half years ago and I have had the stretch marks to prove it for just as long.  They are not as noticeable since I started using this.  I was skeptical at the beginning but I recieved this product for free so I thought why not.  I have since started recommending this to all of my friends because it works.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of InstaNatural products and had successful results so I was really excited when given the chance to try their Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream. I have had two abdominal surgeries, a baby, and experienced weight loss and gain which means scars and stretch marks have painted their way across my abdomen. Needless to say, my tummy is my least favorite part of my body; it is anything but pretty. I also have a few stretch marks on my legs but generally, I focus on my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the company’s guidelines for daily use and noticed that my stretch marks have faded some but unfortunately, they are still well defined. My scars on the other hand are another story. I have had great success with my scars. I have a few rough spots from “the point of entry” during surgery, some of the cuts that have been made, and who knows why else and the Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream has reduced the redness and softened the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the success that I have had with my scars when it comes to the cream I will continue using the product and perhaps will see better results for my stretch marks in the future. My husband and I are also in the process of trying to get pregnant so perhaps this will prove beneficial for future marks; as the company indicates. As an added bonus, the cream has moisturized my skin and made it feel silky smooth and it has a pleasant, earthy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out as far as stretch marks are concerned but I recommend this product to reduce scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received free product to facilitate this review. Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Well, I do have a few stretch marks right now from a previous child, who is now six years old, but since I&#x27;m pregnant, I&#x27;m probably going to be getting a bit more in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different creams and oils on my stretch marks before and although some of them have helped some of my stretch marks fade, none have ever made them disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t make them completely disappear either. I tried it on a few of the scars that I hadn&#x27;t treated with any other cream on my upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottle that this product came in. It&#x27;s a pump top like the kind you would probably find on mousse or shaving cream. It is easy to pump a bit of the lotion out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the ingredients that are in the formula.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light but smells alright. I have tried some awful smelling stretch mark creams and am so relieved that this doesn&#x27;t smell terrible at all.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick, but not too thick and is extremely easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;It is so great for moisturizing and yes does minimize the appearance of darker stretch marks. My lighter ones didn&#x27;t seem to fade as much, but luckily they are light any way.&lt;br /&gt;This cream also didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am anxious to see how well it will work on any future stretch marks I may get during/after this pregnancy. Maybe if I catch them early this time I will have some success in making them disappear or fade before they become too noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid product tester/reviewer, I was sent a complimentary bottle of Stretch Mark Cream from Instanatural. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff works great!! I have a pretty bad scar on my knee from a surgery 16 years ago and I have always been self conscious of it. When I was given the change to review this product for testing purposes, I jumped at the chance! This stuff after has a very nice smell and I wish I would have had more time to review because I think there would have been a more noticeable difference! You can totally see a difference in my review, click here if you wanna read my review and see my before and after pics, just search for Tina&#x27;s Coupon Swap and Reviews!  InstaNatural did a great job with this one!! I love it and I would totally recommend getting this if you have a nasty scar you want to get rid of. I can&#x27;t wait to see my scar at the end of the bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this product, its slow with results, but it works great...!</li>
    <li> Very LiTtle Smell Which I Love. But It Takes A few Minutes To Soak In. I Have ReciEved ThIs Product in Exchange For My Honest Review</li>
    <li> I love it. It works fast</li>
    <li> I have used this product over a month now and havn&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
    <li> I love this creamy is working just fine.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, Fast working if applied right, love the smell</li>
    <li> The stretch marks I would love to erase are the ones on my abdomen and legs from my 3 pregnancies.  It has been years since I had given up on getting rid of or reducing them until I had a chance to try out this product.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am seeing improvement in the skin.  I think all the natural oils that are in the product are firming up the skin which reduces the appearance of the stretch marks.  The light scent is nice and it is not greasy or oily, the cream rubs in evenly and I am very happy that this is all natural and made in the USA.  I did receive the product for free in return for my opinion and I have to say that out of all the stretch mark products I have purchased throughout the years, this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a month or two, but i&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference already in my stretch marks.  Must apply liberally and often, but so far i think it&#x27;s worth it! Not a strong odor, either; very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it regularly like I should, but when I do use it I see that the marks are fading, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I must admit I would never believe that there exist cream that would erase my 10 yo stretch marks. I was so skeptic that I also bought another cream that suppose to be even better! (Setavan stretch mark cream). Now, I don&#x27;t even need to use it because this cream did the job!! My red stretch marks are slowly disappearing. Love it!!! Check eBay before you order it here. I got it for $15 including shipping :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 products from Instanatural because of the high ratings, and the natural ingredients attracted my attention. But the InstaNatural Stratch Mark cream did not work for me. I know it doesn&#x27;t take away stretch marks it helps reduce them but I have almost finished the bottle and have not seen a difference.</li>
    <li> seeing results after 2 weeks &amp; it smells great!</li>
    <li> Makes skin soft, fairly new in using product... will repost results in 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister, whose skin stretched very badly with her first pregnancy, leaving her with a &amp;#34;kangaroo&amp;#34; pouch. This cream has help to tighten her skin and reduce the texture of the stretch marks. Great product...thank you!</li>
    <li> Loved it to the core .. A must have !!!</li>
    <li> So after reading some reviews of this item I decided to order for my pregnancy stretch marks. I have very bad marks, and after using this product I&#x27;ve felt better feeling skin texture. The marks I really can&#x27;t tell much because my marks are bad. But I will order another bottle of this item because I want to continue using and I feel I will see change.  I also ordered the cellulite cream from Insta Nature brand and that was very good.</li>
    <li> No notable difference.</li>
    <li> Smell excellent, have been using it day and night on my problem areas for two weeks now with slight improvements in visibility of stretch marks. however it is almost gone.... Would be great if it came in a larger size</li>
    <li> A myriad of thanks for this product! I bought this one for my scars because my skin is a scar former. Few days ago I have so many bug bites that looks like a big pimples, so itchy and very red. I worried a lot and don&#x27;t know what to do. Few minutes later this product InstaNatural Stretch Mark Cream came. So when I read the ingredients looks to healthy and promising. So I gave a shot rather than putting some chemicals on my skin. After few minutes the itchiness subsides and the red slowly gone. I can&#x27;t believed at first but I&#x27;m very hopeful I thought it&#x27;s only for stretch marks. Then I keep applying it to my bug bites and 2 days later it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s working wondrously. Now I&#x27;ll use it for my stretch marks and waiting for the results. I super love this product and I can&#x27;t wait how this work for my stretch marks. Thank you and thank you:)</li>
    <li> I have seen a great improvement on my stretch marks since I started using this product but like with any product, it takes time.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for about a week now, and Ive noticed SLIGHT differences in the consistency of my old stretch marks. They are softer, less defined. I still have dark color to them, but that may diminish over time. Its a great moisturizer for the skin, in the least! I will update as I have more time to use it!</li>
    <li> Daughter using it pregnant with twins. Easy to apply</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week and have already noticed a difference in my stretch marks. This stretch mark ream has reduced the color of my stretch marks and, after having two kids, I was in desperate need of a product to help with that. I have been very impressed with this product and have bought several other products from this company as well!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;seems to be working. I feel great about this stuff. thanks so much!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and rubs in well. Nice scent. Hoping to see results and will update after a month.</li>
    <li> The consistency and scent of the product are great! I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my stretch marks but the product really does mosturize the areas and I can&#x27;t want to see the long term results. So happy I was able to use a promotional discount to purchase these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks but I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t used it twice a day like the instructions say to which could be a reason I am not seeing much of a difference.  However, this cream smells pretty good so I intend to continue using it.  I&#x27;ll try and make more of an effort to use it per the instructions and update this review with the results after.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients. Softens scar lines. Seems to be working as advertised.</li>
    <li> This cream works, I have seen a tremendous change on my stomach. I apply it everyday and my stretch marks are surely going away. I am in love with this product it is the best</li>
    <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This cream is really nice and absorbs well into the skin without feeling greasy. I feel like its definitely helping to soften and help renew my skin.</li>
    <li> Has yet to do anything for me. It is oily, but does have a pleasant smell. I&#x27;m kind of feeling ripped off &amp; cheated though because the product didn&#x27;t do what it said it did. I&#x27;ve purchased over $200 in creams that make these claims,  yet have not seen a single result in my stretch marks. I&#x27;m just going to save my money &amp; get the surgery.</li>
    <li> I am a 20 year old guy who has gone through rapid weight gains and weight losses in the past. As a result I have stretchmarks and hyperpimentation covering areas on my lowerback and thighs. On top of that, having olive brown skin makes those old white stretchmarks really stand out.  I was kind of skeptical when i ordered the cream online but decided to give it a try since it only cost 20 bucks and had great reviews. I  love the creamy consistency and rich floral smell. Most of the ingredients are natural oils which makes my skin feel soft and supple. I have been applying this cream everynight for the last few weeks before i go to sleep. On top of that, i exfoliate the area with loofah every 3-4 days. I have been very pleased with the results. The discoloration has started to fade and stretchmarks have started to blend in with my skin tone. I will continue using this product. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good! Def feel the skin tightening now to just wait and see what kind of result it has in the long run, I&#x27;ll let ya know.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing! I used it one day and already see a small but noticeable difference. Used on stomach and around the shoulder area and it definitely does it&#x27;s job! A+</li>
    <li> Bias opion...It smells so good. Not over powering of coco butter like other brands. Using this for stretch marks and other marks and I think it just may work. The ingredients of grape seed, vitamin c, coco butter, mango butter and a few more. I really think I may have a winner.</li>
    <li> it is smells good. put on skin can feel comfort. because short time, have not seen final result yet</li>
    <li> I had four kids and after the last two, I notice few stretch marks here and there. On top of that, getting older also contributes to the noticeable stretch marks. While I have yet to find a product that could get rid of the stretch marks 100%, I found a few that do contribute to reducing the appearance of them and this is for sure one of those products.  It is very lightweight and I like the fact that it’s all natural and leaves my skin naturally soft and not greasy. Please don’t expect to see a change overnight, its’ not possible with any product. I have notice a change by only using InstaNatural stretch mark &amp; scar cream for a few weeks. Recommend this product for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I really feel like this is fading my scars and stretch marks.  I know they will never go away, but this has faded them pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product over a month now and havn&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
    <li> I was contacted by Insta Natural to try out some of their natural beauty products. Once I saw what they offered I jumped at the chance to try out their Insta Natural Stretch Mark and Scar Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As far as a daily moisturizer I loved this. It is very lightweight and comes in a HUGE bottle. I like that it is all natural and leaves my skin naturally soft and not greasy. Also a little goes a long way. It is very non-irritating to my sensitive and dry skin. It also lasts for a long time I could feel my skin soft over six hours after application. I only used it for a couple of weeks so far, but as far as my stretch mark scars, as well as acne and bruising/surgery scars I saw a great reduction especially in their color. This definitely makes them blend in really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Insta Natural&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream can be used as a preventative as well. I was not able to test it that way, but I liked the non-greasy, no fragrance as what I used when I was pregnant did not smell very good and was very oily. This was perfect and even dispenses in small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Insta Natural strive to have their customers 100% satisfied. Their logo is actually &amp;#34;we truly care about you&amp;#34;. The majority of the ingredients are oils, vitamins and organic herb blends. It is good for two years in the bottle, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product. Insta Natural&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream is an effective treatment to minimize the appearance of current marks, while also preventing the forming of new ones. It heavily moisturizes the affected areas and enhances the elasticity of the skin. The key ingredients for Insta Natural&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream are Vitamin C, Cocoa Butter, Rosehip Oil, Mango Butter, Grape Seed Oil and Evening Primrose Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I loved Insta Natural&#x27;s Stretch Mark and Scar Cream and will continue using it in the future.

    <li> My free bottle came quickly and it is a 5 oz (150 mL)  container with a  pump applicator.  I found this cream to be wonderfully scented ~ I am assuming that is the tranquil sea fragrance ~ and it is a thick cream, which I prefer to use only at night instead of twice daily ~ that might mean that  I won’t see any visible results for several months, but in the meantime, I am enjoying the rich, velvety creaminess of this moisturizer.  I am applying to my surgical scar and I hope that it will reduce the ugliness of it.  It has a great pump applicator and the the lotion is very thick, rich and creamy and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instanatural back all of their products with a lifetime 100% money-back guarantee and will refund your purchase price if you aren’t satisfied.  This cream is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a smaller size but it is not for all over body use.  It is designed for the targeted areas where you wish to reduce the appearance of existing stretch marks and scars and also prevent new stretch marks from forming by keeping those areas very hydrated and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full List of Ingredients:  deionized water, organic aloe vera, glyceryl stearate, vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate), cetearyl alcohol (plant dervived), safflower seed oil, grape seed oil,  vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate), steric acid, sunflower seed oil, kosher vegetable glycerin, organic mango butter, organic cocoa butter, organic rosehip seed oil, organic evening primrose oil,  tranquil sea fragrance, avocado oil, macadamia oil, palm oil, tamanu oil, noni (morinda citrifolia), decyl glucoside, glyceryl captylate, sodium carbomer, sodium hydroxide, antioxidant tocopherol, ethylhexylglycerin, honeysuckle flower extract (lonicera caprifolium), honeysuckle extract (lonicera japonica)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran this list thru cosDNA‘s site and there are a lot of antioxidants, emollients and moisturizers.  There are some products that will cause acne, but since this is going on mybody and not my face, I am not concerned about that.  This is a great hydrating cream and I hope to see improvement over the coming months!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion for little while now and can honestly say it is a nice moisturizer though it&#x27;s pretty oily which will keep your hands oily for a while so I just get a cloth to remove some of the oil since don&#x27;t want to leave oily prints on things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help with making those ugly scars or stretch marks be less noticeable?  I used it on both old and new scars, I had surgery on October 23, 2104 and it does seem to help with blending the scar to my normal skin tone.. as far as for the older ones, I haven&#x27;t been able to tell a significant difference...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it though as I do like the fact that it does moisturizes my skin which is the reason I purchased it, having scars be less visible was an added bonus.</li>
    <li> So my overall opinion of the product was good I noticed smoother scars and stretch marks, but i know continued use i will see even better results. I love the smell of the product, I love the consistency of the product. Some things that I didn&#x27;t like about the product was that it leaked when I received it and it keeps leaking when I use it. But other then that I love the product and good results I am seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Oh my god LOOOOVE . It makes you feel soo silky. And the marks are lighter on my thighs. But I was using it as a lotion for my arms and chest as well. The smell is lovely too. I already have to buy again because I went through it so fast. But I definitely noticed a difference in the texture of the skin, and it&#x27;s not oily. your&#x27;e just gonna have NICE creamy skinn!!!!!!! They should make these in larger bottles!!!!@</li>
    <li> I found the cream to have a nice rich texture, but not too heavy. I&#x27;ve also been using it the past few days and love it! Also it holds moisture pretty well, and should be used two or more times a days as needed. I also found this cream smooths over any scars and stretch marks on the body, great  news!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which is nice and absorbs nicely into the skin without being oily or sticky. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of this product over a longer period of time!</li>
    <li> This stretch marks cream is insanely stunning.&lt;br /&gt;You can even see that contain oils too which is good for skin.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice too!&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a pump applicator--way cool!!&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging- travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Absorb so well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;received the sample for free.</li>
    <li> It does not work ! SAVE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 2 weeks and still don&#x27;t notice any change in my stretch marks. I guess I should give it more time. But I notice my skin more smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have had the same stretch marks for several years. Both hips and slightly around stomach. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week and I am beginning to notice results. The marks are already mostly all &#x27;skin color&#x27;, beginning to blend in. I use it twice a day as recommended. I can&#x27;t wait to see 2 months from now. Thanks for making this as natural as possible too. Just another huge plus. Not greasy or oily, it rubs right in and is light and &#x27;airy&#x27; as some other reviews mentioned.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for two months, and I have noticed a difference (obviously, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t keep buying it!). I just received a jar in the mail today... This one came in a jar instead of a bottle, and this jar has a fragrance that the previous bottles didn&#x27;t. Too strong and floral. I gave three stars because so far the product has worked well for me but the jar/fragrance combo is disappointing. I can&#x27;t see myself spending this much money on what I just received, so this may be my last.</li>
    <li> I have used many InstaNatural products and been very satisfied. This stretch mark and scar cream is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all it has a very mild to little scent at all. Which I really like. I can&#x27;t stand all the extra fragrances and additives that many companies add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second the cream isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. It absorbs into the skin very quickly and easily. It also moisturizes my skin well so I don&#x27;t have a need to put on any additional lotion where I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third it works pretty well. I know a cream can&#x27;t perform miracles. Some scar and stretch march damage can&#x27;t be reversed, but, this cream helps them to fade and take the redness away. Makes them less noticeable. So in that regard I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product.  My wife has been putting on the lotion regularly for about 2 weeks and thinks she sees a little improvement.  Due in July, so I will post more after the baby is born.</li>
    <li> Works for the most part but the container is small</li>
    <li> Shipping is extremely fast, and product is awesome! I have been using it on my tummy and although I&#x27;ve started treatment with other creams in the past, this one isn&#x27;t as sticky. It&#x27;s very moisturizing as well. Company is great, and their products are always honest and work well! I do think the packaging is a little weird though to be honest.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product out of curiosity as I have tried and reviewed other Insta Natural products and have been extremely satisfied.  The stretch mark and scar cream was no exception to the high quality of products the company produces.  It was a generous sized pump container which dispensed the cream very nicely.  (5 fl oz)  The cream came out of the pump smoothly and has a clean scent, but not too overpowering or soapy. It claims to have a &amp;#34;tranquil sea&amp;#34; fragrance.  The more I smelled it the more I tended to feel that the scent could be described as tranquil.  The color is an attractive pearl white and spreads nicely.  It did work on diminishing some of the marks and it hydrated my skin at the same time.  The dual purpose was a nice surprise.  I think that the cocoa butter and rosehip oil as part of the ingredients was responsible for this added bonus.  As in any such product, you cannot expect results overnight.  Gradually, over time, you will see a noticeable difference.  This product will become a favorite to keep on the dresser. #InstaNatural</li>
    <li> GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and I hate the fact of having stretch marks. I must to say that I&#x27;m really skeptical when it comes to this type of creams as based on what I&#x27;ve read, even skin care professionals can guarantee that once you have stretch marks, even with all the money in expensive treatments and all that, there&#x27;s no way to get rid of them... NOW... I&#x27;ve only used this cream for 1 week, I have white stretch marks, the strongest ones, and I&#x27;M SO SPEECHLESS WITH THE INCREDIBLE RESULTS I&#x27;VE SEEN SO FAR. I do understand that they will not go away like definitely, but so far, when it comes to the appearance, this cream is working great! My sister started to seeing results since the first day she used it, just like I did and just to be clear, my sister had a baby, therefore her stretch marks are even more and stronger than mines. I highly recommend this cream, it definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! If yhu follow directions on the tub like your sapposed to it reallii works i put mine on right after a shower n on every morning and night my stretch marks have faded drasticall.  I did not think it would work so i dint realli do any before and after pics but i can surely tell  try it its worth the money</li>
    <li> Item Works Great. Have Tried other products with no results. A must Buy item.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and if you continue to use it, you will see results. Simple</li>
    <li> What can I say about this other than TRY IT because it works! I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my arms and stomach since high school and my pregnancies later. I never thought I would find anything to make them fade so there are certain articles of clothing I would not wear. When I saw the opportunity to do this review, I said &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried everything else so what else can I lose?&amp;#34; Apparently, the stretch marks. While they didn&#x27;t completely fade, they are less noticeable and that&#x27;s just with one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very thick but easily absorbed into the skin. Plus the ingredients leave your skin feeling nourished, hydrated and soft, not oily or greasy as with other products I&#x27;ve tried. I will have to try another bottle and see just how far I can get them to diminish.</li>
    <li> Thick, creamy and smells divine. I have been using the product for over a little over a week as direct and although I haven&#x27;t seen a major change I have seen some improvement. The description says it will take up to two month to see any major changes, I wish it was faster. My skin felt softer after each application. It dries very slowly, but the benefits are worth the wait.    *Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> As a fan of natural products, I was excited to give this product a try. I have a scar on my knee from an accident when I was younger, as well as some scarring on my hands from working in a fast food restaurant in college. It does seem to be a long process, but after continued use, I can see that the scars are starting to lighten. These are older scars, so I&#x27;m actually quite happy to see any improvement. Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> I Received This Product Free Of Charge For An Honest And Unbiased Review To Try InstaNatural Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream In Exchage For My Truthful Review Of This Product. It Comes In A 5 Ounce Pump Dispenser Which I Loved. It&#x27;s Formulated With All Natural/Organic Ingredients Like Vitamin C &amp; E, Cocoa Butter (\\&quot;Which You Can Smell Right Away\\&quot;), Rosehip Oil, Mango Butter Sunflower Seed Oil, Avocado Oil And Grape Seed Oil. It Improves Natural Elasticity In The Skin And Helps Diminish Those Tiger Stripes And Ugly Scar Lines. Also It&#x27;s A Great Product Especially For Someone Who Has Extremely Sensitive Skin! I Have Gotten My Stretch Marks From Weight Gain But Since I Have Losted That Weight It Lefted Marks Behind And I Have Been Looking For A Product To Help Me With This For Several Months And Might I Say This Cream Is Very Gentle And Soothing For My Skin, It Went On Evenly And It Didn&#x27;t Take Alot To Cover The Area I Would Say 2-3 Pumps Is Plenty To Cover An Area And Has A Pleasent Light Scent. I Have Been Applying It Every Morning And Evening  (Twice A Day) For 2 Weeks Now, And The Stretch Marks Are Getting Lighter In Appearance. While It&#x27;s Definitely Not An Overnight Wonder Cream It Has Made My Stretch Marks Fade Away Little By Little Day By Day. It Has Also Made The Skin On My Abdomen, Where I Have The Most Stretch Marks, Soft And Smooth.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit skeptic when I first received this product. It would require me time to apply it everyday at the right time, religiously speaking. And truthfully, there were days that I normally would forget and I did. There was a week though that for everyday I have been using it every night. I gave it a month to review so that I can see some changes and I can definitely see some fading and evening of skin tone. The application leaves a smooth surface on the skin covering the stretched ridges of the skin. I was doubtful how this product works but when you rub your hand against your skin, it almost feel velvety! The product is very buttery but not greasy. Almost dries to touch after massaging and kneading it into certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also says it will prevent stretch marks in the future. I am currently applying the cream every night to see if it will since I don&#x27;t have lots of stretch marks on my belly. I used this more often on my scars and to tone my arms and legs. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now. I saw a small change in my old stretchmarks.</li>
    <li> I really like the formula of this product. It&#x27;s thick but soaks in well and is not greasy! I haven&#x27;t been using it very long yet to see results but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I think it will help a lot.</li>
    <li> Works really well I would recommend this for anyone.:)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I like to use it on my cooking scars and my C-Section scar. Anyone that has had any type of surgery knows that the scar gets dry and itchy. This stretch mark cream alleviates that feeling all day. I also had a fresh cooking scar from a couple of weeks ago that I&#x27;ve been applying it on and it is barely visible now.</li>
    <li> I, unfortunately have stretch marks so I was super excited when I received this strectch mark cream for review. My problematic areas include the side of my thighs, my butt and my lower stomach. I assume we all at some point in our lives develop stretch marks as we gain and lose weight, but thankfully there are solutions to diminish the appearance of these pesky marks. I am medium skin toned and my stretch marks are white, but I do know of people with purple and deep hued stretch marks. This cream is working wonderfully with diminishing the appearance of the stretch marks I have and is toning my skin. I also use this cream on scars and have noticed a slight diminishment in the appearance of them. The scars are still visible, but they are less visible now. Maybe with continued use they will disappear forever! Definitely worth giving a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with InstaNatural&#x27;s Scar Gel and their Vitamin A retinol acne clearer and this stack has been working wonders. I&#x27;ve used their retinol serum for about 2 months now which got rid of all of my acne and i haven&#x27;t broken out since. However, i still received some hyper-pigmentation due to my skins inflammatory response. So that&#x27;s what encouraged me to use this product in conjuction with their InstaNatural Scar Gel and within 3 days of use the scars are already fading with a twice daily application. I strongly believe in this company and they have PHENOMENAL customer service. They&#x27;ve emailed me after each purchase giving me instructions on how to use their products for the best results. Definitely 5 stars for both their service and products.</li>
    <li> Not much improvement on strechmarks if any</li>
    <li> Amazing my stretch marks are about gone wonderfully product</li>
    <li> I love when products work! And I love when the products are natural and don&#x27;t effect my skin in a negative way. I started using the Stretch Mark Cream by InstaNaturals after it was suggested but one of my male friends that&#x27;s a natural guru. He let me try it and told me that if I like it to review it!&lt;br /&gt;Well I used this on old scars on my stomach from a gallbladder. I have 3 scars that I placed the cream on. Over the last 4 weeks I have noticed quite a difference. Both the texture and tone have improved and the raised scar has shrunk just a tiny bit. I&#x27;m not self conscious about the scars I have but it&#x27;s not as if I have embraced them either. The fact that they are less noticeable is a big plus to me. Thank you to my natural friend, you were right!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a big believe in stretch mark creams or scar creams.  I recently tried this \\&quot;stretch mark and scar cream\\&quot; and I&#x27;m starting to change my opinion.  I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate results on my stretch marks or scars, but I did immediately notice how great it made  my skin feel. This is probably better than just about any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin felt so silky after using  it. It&#x27;s very lightly scented and the scent lingers for a while. It&#x27;s also light enough that it won&#x27;t interfere with  any fragrance you choose to use.    I love that it has so many great ingredients that are good for your skin. The ingredient list is pretty much  amazing. I&#x27;m not going to list everything here, but the ingredients that are my favorite are vitamin C, rosehip  oil, Aloe Vera, mango butter, and cocoa butter. There are so many other great ingredients in it as well.    After about 2 weeks of using this, I noticed it helped to fade some of my smaller stretch marks to the point where  they were barely noticeable. I don&#x27;t know how well it will work for larger stretch marks or scars, but it does help  with small, fine stretch marks and scars for me. I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.    This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and does not have any funny smells. It smells pretty good to me. I like the fact that they put in a pump bottle. It great to sore away and does not take a lot of room. I have been using the Stretch Mark Cream on my hand where I have scratches. This lotion in a miracle lotion it started to fade away the deep red marks I have on left hand.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is unscented. I usually put it on twice a day, when I am getting dressed in the morning and again after I shower and dry of really well. I put it in my stomach and thighs and hand. I just rub it in really well. It absorbs quickly into your skin and leave your skin feeling soft and smooth. I love the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy. It didn&#x27;t make my feel greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt; I have been using it a few weeks and have noticed that my scars and stretch marks are disappearing. I got the product for testing purposes/ for free in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Stretch Mark cream for quite awhile since I received it.  InstaNatural&#x27;s Stretch Mark &amp; Scar Cream is a great cream for using on scars and  stretch marks, since it helps to minimize the appearance of old ones and helps to prevent the formation of new ones. The cream is great moisturizer to heavily treat  the affected ares, like the hips, arms, and stomach/abdomen area! The key ingredients in this cream :&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C (15%), Cocoa Butter, Rosehip Oil, Mango Butter, Grapeseed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil; they all help to give nourishment and elasticity to your skin! It absorbs into your skin so easily!It&#x27;s one of my favorites now!</li>
    <li> Used for awhile and seen some difference in older scaring. Product does have a unique order but isn&#x27;t overpowering or significantly unpleasant. Has an odd feel when applied but after it sets in the affected area does feel softer.</li>
    <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I am a petite build that got a lot of stretch marks during my last trimester of pregnancy a year ago. So when I got this product, I&#x27;ve religiously put this on twice a day for about 1 1/2 months now. At first, I was going to give this product a 1 star review thinking that I didn&#x27;t see any difference or improvement on my stretch marks. However, luckily I have taken a before picture from the first day I started using the product just in case and then decided to take an after picture at 1 1/2 months later. I put them side by side and surprisingly enough there IS a noticeable difference between them! My stretch marks on my left side of the stomach has gotten a lot lighter! So if anything, I would highly encourage you taking a before picture so that you can truly compare the difference because being that you see yourself everyday, it&#x27;s hard to notice the difference. And if you&#x27;re like me, people tend to expect almost instant results and for it to be completely gone. So when we don&#x27;t see that right away, we would typically assume that the product doesn&#x27;t work. So luckily I went back to make sure that I am truly comparing for accurate results and sure enough there was indeed a difference! I would just advise that if you decide to purchase this product, don&#x27;t expect immediate results. It DOES work, but it&#x27;ll take some time. Just make sure you take pictures at incrementally. That way you can truly appreciate what the product does!</li>
    <li> Seems to do what it states, stretch marks that are 13 years old faded. Has a good aroma to it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a month day and night and haven&#x27;t seen results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product approximately a month and I already see an improvement to my stretch marks.  They were pretty dark and now have faded in color.  You can still see them but they are more white now which is less noticeable. My skin is so soft after using it.  The pump bottle it comes in is very nice, it disperses just the right amount of product. I would buy again especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Slight smell, very loose gel like texture. Felt like i would get it on my clothes and anything i touched. Used it while prego and after and didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> The first one I ordered smelled nice and left my skin moisturized. This second one smells off and doesn&#x27;t even come close to leaving my skin smooth and moisturized like my previous order. Very disappointing as I was really hoping to give a good review after receiving my second order.</li>
    <li> It helped my old stretch marks but has yet to getrid of tthe ones from having my baby</li>
    <li> I thought the other reviews were an exaggeration, but they weren&#x27;t. By boyfriend noticed my tiger marks going away. Not totally gone, but a visible difference.</li>
    <li> My daughter saw that her marks got significantly lighter! I had my doubts it would work but im pleasantly pleased it did. This product worked for her!  Noticeable difference in about a month of using it consistently</li>
    <li> I am only giving this 3 stars as of now until I can use it longer and see if I notice results. As far as the way it feels and application I like the product!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I did not have many stretch marks just on my sides and stomach from pregnancy &amp; this has been making them completely fade away for about four months now. I give 4 stars because it used to be in a better bottle and now it has a different scent and color.</li>
    <li> i will be buying this one all the time now!!!</li>
    <li> amazing product, my skin is freshner now, not only stretch mark even wrinkle was reduce,thank</li>
    <li> I had a baby 3 months ago and I wanted to try this. With a combination of tanning and using this product in the morning and after showers at night,  it has made the color fade. Obviously you can still feel the stretch marks and see the indents but the redness is fading and will hopefully shrink once I start losing the baby weight.</li>
    <li> The product did work well but I haven&#x27;t used it as directed to see a big difference. The smell is okay and it does a good job with keeping the skin moist.</li>
    <li> Really works , you have to be consistent with it .</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING!!! :D I am absolutely in love with the scent! I will definitely be buying more of this stuff, first of all it is so much better than lotion, regular lotions that leave you feeling greasy and slimy. This is thicker, creamier, and just amazing feeling. I put it on my tummy and then rub the rest into my knuckles and elbows!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my previous pregnancy stretch marks, but I plan to buys ome more for my next pregnancy.</li>
    <li> good product easy absorb</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my old C-section scars and stretch marks. It seems to work at softening the scar tissue and diminishing the stretch marks. I would say this is a pretty sound product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and it is as described ..I&#x27;m excited to use it :) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any stretch marks at 27 weeks....yet. This cream is so great and makes my skin feel so smooth! I&#x27;ve gone through 3 containers already!</li>
    <li> Need to buy more product. One bottle is not enough</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast! It arrived about two days after I ordered it. This stretch mark cream smells amazing! It feels very good when out on your skin and does not leave it feeling greasy. I have only used this 3 times so I don&#x27;t really see any results yet! I will update if I do!</li>
    <li> Even though I only been using this nourishing cream a few weeks, I am definitely noticing a subtle difference in the appearance of my scar area, and an increased suppleness of that skin.  This cream is not just for pregnancy, nor just for women.  I have some very deep, very old scars that I thought nothing would touch.  But, this cream has.  My son had a huge growth spurt last year and has some stretch marks.  It seems to be working even faster on his much younger, more supple skin.  I have used several of InstaNatural products and have never been disappointed.  Though I was more skeptical of a stretch mark cream, after trying others over the years, this cream works.  It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing.  I will be ordering more soon. I have very sensitive skin and I also scar very easily.  I also have a form of eczema and psariosis.  So, this has been my holy grail. I just wish their was a bigger option to purchase from them. I apply it twice a day and exfoliate twice a week. I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.It goes on smooth, absorbs well and makes my skin feel silky!</li>
    <li> I just started using this so don&#x27;t know how well it works yet .But it smells good !</li>
    <li> Not yet used product&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived as expected</li>
    <li> seeing a slight difference in short amount of time so I will continue and see how this works</li>
    <li> works good, noticed stretch marks are starting to fade</li>
    <li> Love the product, use it rarely but does work</li>
    <li> I love this product! After only a few applications, my stretch marks from my pregnancy were much less noticeable!</li>
    <li> I have high hopes :) Great ingredients and pleasant smell and consistency.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results yet but I do have to make a review so what I do like about it is the thickness that the lotion is. I like that it feels like your actually putting something on your skin. I comes with a lot so I know that if I put this one for at least a month 2 times a day it will last, then I will hopefully see some results.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I was kind of worried that it might stink but it actually is nice</li>
    <li> Noticing improvement so continuing use</li>
    <li> I can see my stretch marks fading</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks now, and I am not sure how effective it is at clearing stretch marks, although I had quite a bit after my pregnancy. It does have a pleasant scent, however, and is moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Been using regularly and haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in my stretch marks. But the product smells good and isn&#x27;t oily, so maybe I just have to keep using it!</li>
    <li> I put some on last night before bed and I can already tell that they got lighter. Hopefully, in a few weeks they will start to even out. Pretty impressed so far though.</li>
    <li> Got this for someone. The changes were so obvious. This works like magic &amp; quickly too!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Haven&#x27;t seen results yet ( I have been using it for a week).</li>
    <li> Highly emollient! Great for use on dry skin as well as stretch marked areas. There appears to be some fading of the darker marks after a few weeks of moderate use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give their Stretch Mark and Scar Cream a try for two areas. The first was to see how it would help the stretch marks I have from my pregnancies. My stomach really isn&#x27;t all that bad, but my butt is. (Apparently my stomach was more forgiving when it came to the weight gaining and growing baby pulling at my skin. My butt looks like a cat attacked and clawed it!) These marks left from pregnancy have faded completely, though can be faintly visible. I wanted to see if they could be improved by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The next area I wanted to test this product is my right leg. Earlier in the year my leg was operated on, and I have probably around a dozen little scars from different incision areas. Some of these have faded to a pink color, others still look new and purple.&lt;br /&gt;For best results, InstaNatural recommends using the cream twice a day, morning and night. I have used it for a couple of weeks now, and have seen improvement. First, I will say I really like the pump feature on the bottle. This makes it easier and more convenient to get the desired amount of cream quickly. The product itself is very thick and creamy and has a clean and mild pleasant scent. With just a single pump I was able to cover a large area of my leg. To get great results, it is important to keep rubbing in the product over the affected areas until it is absorbed. Because this cream is so thick and moisturizing, it will still have a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling even after the skin has absorbed it. I have used lotions in the past where I ended up applying a second layer because my skin still felt a little dry. You won&#x27;t experience that with the Stetch Mark and Scar Cream. After applying and rubbing into your skin, it will take a few moments for your skin to dry. I say &#x27;dry&#x27; meaning not a wet surface feeling to the touch, because it will still feel very smooth and moisturized. The cream gave me moisturizing results compared to some of the lotions and body creams I have for dry skin. (Beingin the sun all day here in Hawaii, I can get dry and itchy skin easily.) On top of the moisturizing benefits, I also saw a change in the scars/marks.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the greatest change on my scars on my leg. The purple scars faded to a light pink, and the faded pink marks faded to almost skin tone- slightly darker. This made me happy and feel not so self conscious with wearing shorts. Previously I felt uneasy when I had pink and purple marks on one leg that were easy to spot. It feels wonderful watching them fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;For my stretch marks, I didn&#x27;t have the same results. I can only assume because they are older, and from multiple pregnancies. They were already faded pretty well, so I didn&#x27;t notice a change in color appearance. However, they do look and feel much smoother, which does help them blend in better with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;On both of my areas I tested this product, I saw improvements. I did see a greater improvement with my scars versus my stretch marks. I do think this is because the scars were new and recent from surgery, rather than old stretch marks from combined pregnancies. I think this would be a great product for prevention during pregnancy, and also something to apply while they are still fresh and new. I am less aware of my scars on my leg now that they have faded so much, less of an eye sore.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this for the moisturizing benefits alone! Hours after applying the product, my skin still feels very soft and smooth, one of the best moisturizers I have used to be perfectly honest. And once again, with InstaNatural you don&#x27;t have to worry about the ingredients and what you are applying to your skin. With InstaNatural you know you are using natural and organic ingredients. I love that they also offer a lifetime manufacture guarantee, so what have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps to reduce annoying stretch marks leaving you more confident and with beautiful skin! Highly recommend! Natural and safe!</li>
    <li> I have applied the cream twice daily for one month, I did not notice a change at all on my 20 year old stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I recently received this stretch mark cream to experiments and see if it would reduce the signs of my stretch marks on the sides of my legs and a scar on my foot from surgery. Since I have used it the past few weeks I see a slight reduction in the scars but not as much as expected. I believe that it will take awhile longer using the product for the results to really start showing, especially with large scars but I definitely have seen a difference in the darkness of the scars. I would say I would recommend this product but definitely give it some time for the results to show!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s after a birth in December last year and I thought it&#x27;s a good idea to take some action against the natural stretch marks she got during her pregnancy with our twins. I can say so far that she&#x27;s happy with this product. It does the job that it&#x27;s intended for.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is: We are both satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Have only used a few weeks so not sure when I will see results.</li>
    <li> its ok but i have not seen any differance</li>
    <li> When I got my bottle it was busted. I was very disappointed because the bottom half was dried out..</li>
    <li> great cream!very good for stretches</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review the InstaNatural Stretch Mark Cream. As soon as I opened the package I took a look at the ingredients and was impressed with the long list of botanicals, and short list of &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; things. It smells lovely, just like Jasmine. I don&#x27;t know if it made a huge difference on my stretch marks because I am terribly inconsistent at applying it, but I know that it&#x27;s nourishing my skin, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about toxicity. That&#x27;s huge to me.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. The cocoa butter scent is prominent and I like it.. I&#x27;ll see after two months what it will do on my post preggy stretch marks and the scar from the c-section  I had</li>
    <li> Usually i never review for any thing, but when i start using this cream on my stomach,  which have lots of lines like a zebra, and i didn&#x27;t use it twice a day, just off and on, still in few weeks i can see an amazing results, and now i am also recommending this in my salon to all my girls.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before and it&#x27;s perfect. I just hate that they&#x27;ve changed the bottle and when I opened it there wasn&#x27;t as full as its suppose to be. I saw the bottom of the Bottle when I opened it. The product itself is really good and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it this 1 star but the shipping was late and almost quarter of the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> This stretch mark and scar cream is a bit different than other InstaNatural products, and I can&#x27;t exactly say how effective it is at lessening my twenty years and four kids worth of stretch marks.  I can say I absolutely love using it as a thick body lotion.  It smells so good and moisturizes exceptionally well.  As anyone with stretch marks can tell you -they itch (even years later).  This cream took away the itch completely, and for that I&#x27;m so happy.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this free for testing purposes, but let me assure you, these are my own opinions.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell, absorbs well into my skin. I have some prominent scars from surgeries and stretch marks from multiple pregnancies. This eases itchiness and makes them less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!!&lt;br /&gt;Just had a few days and loving the moisturizer! !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for my puffy scar!</li>
    <li> The product comes in a nice and convent jar of 4 oz/120ml. It&#x27;s in plastic and doesn&#x27;t take too much space. When opened the product has a very nice smell and a very soft and fresh consistency, it would describe it as something between a cream and a gel consistency. It&#x27;s very light and gets absorbed by the skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Th cream main ingredients are: cocoa butter, reship oil and mango butter. All those ingredients are designed to increase elasticity of the skin and diminish the appearance of stretch marks and restore a youthful look. The skin feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The product is made in Usa and not tested on animals and has an expiration period of 24 months.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggests to apply the cream to  a clean and dry skin and to massage until the product is perfectly absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Better results are achieved when the cream is applied twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I personally liked the appearance of my skin while i was using the creams and day by day i started seeing some small improvements.&lt;br /&gt;I like all the main oils and butters used ( Vitamin C, Cocoa Butter, Rosehip oil , Mango Butter , Grapeseed oil and evening Primrose oil.&lt;br /&gt;The product is now on sale for just 19.95$ ( originally 59.95$).&lt;br /&gt;I saw the skin with stretch marks gradually fading and i would definitely keep using it in the following months in the process of getting into shape for summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product on exchange of an honest feedback/review .</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> I have seen some slight improvement in my stretch marks. It absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
    <li> So i have been using for about 2 weeks so far but have not seen a difference yet. It is moisturizing with not much scent. I would need a few more weeks to see if it makes a difference</li>
</ol>
