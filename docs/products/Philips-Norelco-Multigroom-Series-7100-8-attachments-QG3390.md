<ol>
      <li>perfectly also it doesn&#x27;t heat up while working and don&#x27;t affect the body</li>
      <li>It fits in the hand perfectly</li>
      <li>One great tool!</li>
      <li>This trimmer provides excellent beard, side-burn, and hair trim capabilities.  </li>
      <li>It still performs great even without turning the turbo</li>
      <li>and then I used the body shaver which was  great and so sleek on the skin.</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>Great one, I like it.</li>
      <li>Good, but not excepcional...</li>
      <li>so it has a good runtime and no battery recharge memory.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Love it !</li>
      <li>Great product , lots of attachments, easy to use .</li>
      <li>Perfect for me, battery and everything really works verry</li>
      <li>so far...no problems...works nicely</li>
      <li>I would really give it 4.5 stars because the quality of the trimmer itself seems very good.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product from Philips :))</li>
      <li>The trimmer is made of plastic and has a good grip, I don&#x27;t think it has a cheap feel</li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m very happy</li>
      <li>Very comfortable to use in all areas.</li>
      <li>but instead the plastic makes it very light.</li>
      <li>, I have not come to a conclusion if the Philips or Whal does better for manscaping, but I do prefer the Philips for my face over whal.</li>
      <li>totally love it</li>
      <li>I would like to see a more sturdy casing to keep everything together.</li>
      <li>Meh, it gets the job done for the most part, but it&#x27;s kinda week.</li>
      <li>thought this trimmer would be a bit better, but I&#x27;m still satisfied and will continue to compare</li>
      <li>It almost comes with too many attachments though.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use with many attachments.</li>
      <li>wonderful price.. very practical .. fast delievery</li>
      <li>Heads can be changed easily, with their twist-on head mounting.  </li>
      <li>The hair clipping is just as efficient and easy...</li>
      <li>, it was fast smooth and cuts even, no problem!!</li>
      <li>Great trimmer for beards and other more intimate areas.</li>
      <li>Great little trimmer.</li>
      <li>It works fine but for a top of the line product, my expectation was bigger...</li>
      <li>And just after first time use I can say it&#x27;s way better than my older Panasonic groomer.  </li>
      <li>But going to bare skin right now I find my braun series 7 does a better job getting closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives even trim and offers quick clean up.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent trimmer, the power lasts long and the trimmer works smoothly even with thick hair.</li>
      <li>Hold great, long lasting, charge.</li>
      <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the first impression.</li>
      <li>the attachments are nice, but sometimes I find it easier to use the beard attachment over the body as the comb seems to get in harder to get spots</li>
      <li>it makes the whole shaving experience fun and intuitive.</li>
      <li>I got it Yesterday, first I used the beard groomer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this a short time, I will update my review as I use it more to compare with my whal and braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my first cordless trimmer</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; and only need a beard trimmer then this is far more than you really need.  </li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>and I really like the easiness of shaving anywhere without the cord in the way.</li>
      <li>Thanks God</li>
      <li>It is also very underpowered compared to what I was used to.  </li>
      <li>I just used it for the first time and it is strong enough to shave a full beard in a few minutes without much effort.</li>
      <li>sure why Amazon has this same Multi-Groom 7100 kit in separate item listings but with different pricing, both sold by Amazon with prime shipping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Initially it is a nice looking buzzer, lots of attachments for different areas of the body, but it does feel a bit cheaper with the plastic compared to my other buzzers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier to use it cuts hair better, it&#x27;s safer on my skin because of rounded tips on the blades and it so versatile ( body grooming, beard trimmer and hair cutter to name a few )...</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt at all when used on sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>What I like the most is the body grooming attachment also the lengh of time between charges, what I like the least is the fragile look of the combs.</li>
      <li>i vould return it because it barely cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll get back about the battery performance in a few months, so far works really well.</li>

<li> I ended up purchasing another wahl and the difference in power and cutting is night and day.  </li>

    <li> This have been for aure the worst peoduct i have ever purchased.  Thanks God i vould return it because it barely cut.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me, battery and everything really works verry Well, and</li>
    <li> Meh, it gets the job done for the most part, but it&#x27;s kinda week.</li>
    <li> Great product , lots of attachments, easy to use . I like the lasting battery power it let me finish the job without recharging. Very comfortable to use in all areas. I would like to see a more sturdy casing to keep everything together.</li>
    <li> so far...no problems...works nicely</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a short time, I will update my review as I use it more to compare with my whal and braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially it is a nice looking buzzer, lots of attachments for different areas of the body, but it does feel a bit cheaper with the plastic compared to my other buzzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit to get used to, I have not come to a conclusion if the Philips or Whal does better for manscaping, but I do prefer the Philips for my face over whal. The blades do not irritate my skin and don&#x27;t feel like they would cut me. But going to bare skin right now I find my braun series 7 does a better job getting closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With manscaping the attachments are nice, but sometimes I find it easier to use the beard attachment over the body as the comb seems to get in harder to get spots easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this trimmer would be a bit better, but I&#x27;m still satisfied and will continue to compare</li>
    <li> Great one, I like it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for beards and other more intimate areas. Easy to use with many attachments. Hold great, long lasting, charge. Gives even trim and offers quick clean up. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Works well but not full size head, was disappointed takes my husband a long time to shave his head</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer that would complement the limited trim capabilities of a Norelco SensoTouch 3D electric razor.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This trimmer provides excellent beard, side-burn, and hair trim capabilities.  In addition, the trim combs provide measured-length hair trims, in addition to their advertised beard trim functionality.  Battery charge does last the advertised 50+ minutes.  Heads can be changed easily, with their twist-on head mounting.  The circular-cut nasal hair trimmer works well.  Overall, this trim system exceeded my expectations in every way.  Five stars for this product.</li>
    <li> What I like the most is the body grooming attachment also the lengh of time between charges, what I like the least is the fragile look of the combs.</li>
    <li> Love it ! And just after first time use I can say it&#x27;s way better than my older Panasonic groomer.  It&#x27;s easier to use it cuts hair better, it&#x27;s safer on my skin because of rounded tips on the blades and it so versatile ( body grooming, beard trimmer and hair cutter to name a few )...only time will tell how durable it is ...but so far I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Good product. It works fine but for a top of the line product, my expectation was bigger... Good, but not excepcional...</li>
    <li> wonderful price.. very practical .. fast delievery</li>
    <li> The reviews misled me.  I&#x27;ve used an electric groomer for years...wahl.  I bought this one because it&#x27;s wireless.  It is also very underpowered compared to what I was used to.  I ended up purchasing another wahl and the difference in power and cutting is night and day.  I will keep this as a back up for small cutting jobs....</li>
    <li> Amazing product from Philips :))</li>
    <li> This is my first cordless trimmer and I really like the easiness of shaving anywhere without the cord in the way. The trimmer is made of plastic and has a good grip, I don&#x27;t think it has a cheap feel but instead the plastic makes it very light. I just used it for the first time and it is strong enough to shave a full beard in a few minutes without much effort.

    <li> One great tool! I got it Yesterday, first I used the beard groomer, it was fast smooth and cuts even, no problem!! The hair clipping is just as efficient and easy... and then I used the body shaver which was  great and so sleek on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt at all when used on sensitive areas. It fits in the hand perfectly it makes the whole shaving experience fun and intuitive. It still performs great even without turning the turbo on.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the first impression. I&#x27;ll post updates if needed.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. Lots of features for the money. Very well made.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent trimmer, the power lasts long and the trimmer works smoothly even with thick hair. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I would really give it 4.5 stars because the quality of the trimmer itself seems very good.  It almost comes with too many attachments though.  If you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; and only need a beard trimmer then this is far more than you really need.  I specifically purchased this because it has a lithium ion battery so it has a good runtime and no battery recharge memory.  The way the various combs attach makes them difficult to adjust for length of cut but if you always use the same length then you will set it and forget it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why Amazon has this same Multi-Groom 7100 kit in separate item listings but with different pricing, both sold by Amazon with prime shipping.</li>
    <li> totally love it i try it under the shower and its work perfectly also it doesn&#x27;t heat up while working and don&#x27;t affect the body</li>
