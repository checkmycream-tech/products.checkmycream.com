      <li>I was sent this product for free to review and here is my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love all of their products.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Best stuff out there for reducing fine lines and making your skin supple and pores tiny!</li>
      <li>make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums.</li>
      <li>You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application.</li>
      <li>It does has a light smell to it, but it&#x27;s nothing added.</li>
      <li>Great product  --  Will definitely buy again !  </li>
      <li>Skin feels nice but with all the publicity on this acid serum plus the Vitamin C, I expected good help with lessening of wrinkles  </li>
      <li>Got my product on time as promised, first time I tried my skin felt smooth and soft, waiting to see how much better it works as I keep using it, I feel so good about it.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>First time using all three, I like how it makes my skin feel and look!</li>
      <li>Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is well worth buying, but like all serums like this,&lt;br /&gt;you should maintain use of them to keep</li>
      <li>so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin.</li>
      <li>The serum is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
      <li>It has worked for my sensitive skin and has addressed my fine lines and the sever dryness on my skin.</li>
      <li>I dropped it during my first use and the bottle stayed intact.</li>
      <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>Aloe and witch hazel as the first ingredients make it too drying for my skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a first.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Being young, I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to worry about just yet (thank goodness) but it&#x27;s never too early to start fighting them.  </li>
      <li>I much preferred a product that had H2O as first product and Hydralonic Acid</li>
      <li>Really plumps and moisturizers my skin.  </li>
      <li>Stuff really works.</li>
      <li>IT WORKS REAL GOOD,I LIKE IT</li>
      <li>My skin becomes dryer in the colder weather and this product really helps.</li>
      <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
      <li>When I first used this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt!</li>
      <li>Thanks New Radiance Naturals for your gift to the world!</li>
      <li>I love this serum and within a few days, I noticed just how soft my face felt while putting on my moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled</li>
      <li>All the blotchy spots are gone or near gone and</li>
      <li>The serum is all natural with no added fragrances.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the second product from this company that I&#x27;ve used, and they are consistently high</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of New Radiance Naturals&#x27; products because they always worked well for me and my skin</li>
      <li>next, w/ various fusions and oils next, which was the first hyralonic serum I tried.  </li>
      <li>The serum absorbs quickly and a little bit goes a long way with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other new radiance products and the quality and price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>

    <li> My friends have asked me what I have been using on my skin, it looks so radiant.</li>
    <li> One of the better hyaluronic acid serums I have tried.  It goes on smooth, make y skin feel really good, and after 30 days of use, I can say it made a difference in my skin tone.  All the blotchy spots are gone or near gone and my skin looks improved!</li>
    <li> Works great and feels amazing.!!! I&#x27;ve used other new radiance products and the quality and price can&#x27;t be beat. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Stuff really works. Good for healthy skin.</li>

    <li> You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application. You don&#x27;t want to use this in lieu of a moisturizer (serums are meant to be applied underneath serum). Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin. make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums. The vitamins in this are ideal for promoting skin cell turnover and diminishing free radical damage so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin. I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second product from this company that I&#x27;ve used, and they are consistently high quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount as a blogger, however all opinions expressed are 100% my own</li>
    <li> I love my Hyaluronic Acid based serums to boot! It has worked for my sensitive skin and has addressed my fine lines and the sever dryness on my skin. I use it in conjunction with other creams and treatments and I am very happy with the results that I have been getting! I am a big fan of New Radiance Naturals&#x27; products because they always worked well for me and my skin issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I have tried the product that the company has given me. I am not being compensated to review the product. All I can say is I love it! You can actually feel your skin tighten as the serum dries. I can hardly wait to see the results after the bottle is gone. I will definitely buy the product.</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there for reducing fine lines and making your skin supple and pores tiny! Combined with a good Vit C moisturizer, twice a day, you will see results in about a week or so!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for free to review and here is my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being young, I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to worry about just yet (thank goodness) but it&#x27;s never too early to start fighting them.  I love this serum and within a few days, I noticed just how soft my face felt while putting on my moisturizer.  The serum is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it&#x27;s very gentle.  Not only does the serum contain hyaluronic acid, but it has vitamin C as well. The serum is all natural with no added fragrances.  It does has a light smell to it, but it&#x27;s nothing added. The serum absorbs quickly and a little bit goes a long way with this stuff.  My only complaint is I didn&#x27;t know just how little I needed and feel I used too much the first few uses.  Other than that, no complaints here!  The bottle is extremely sturdy.  I dropped it during my first use and the bottle stayed intact.</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product. The results took about 2 months of daily use, but the puffiness around my eyes are gone .</li>
    <li> The bottle was empty whenever it arrived!!  This is a first.  I won&#x27;t send it back.  Just an unusual and disappointing experience.  I&#x27;ll reorder later</li>
    <li> First time using all three, I like how it makes my skin feel and look!</li>
    <li> Skin feels nice but with all the publicity on this acid serum plus the Vitamin C, I expected good help with lessening of wrinkles  This has not happened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I have this; it&#x27;s incredible and results are seen very quickly giving a very youthful, radiant glow.</li>
    <li> Results i way expected! I recommend</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product like this for decades....Seriously! I love the texture and the feel of this serum on my skin. I so nervous about not having it, I am tempted to buy an extra case of it in the event that there is a zombie attack, or a world catastrophe! Thanks New Radiance Naturals for your gift to the world!</li>
    <li> 2nd order and just what my wife wanted and uses!</li>
    <li> this  is a wonderful product which anyone interested in skin care should try.  I have used this for several month&#x27;s and would recommend women try. I got great results after using this product, I can see the fine lines around my eyes  not as visible as before using this procuct. with continued use  the results gets better. I will not give this product up.  I am 68 and plan on using this product always. when you find a good product for your skin keep using it</li>
    <li> I love this product! And the company is five star too!</li>
    <li> I use it daily saw a different will alway hav some</li>
    <li> Aloe and witch hazel as the first ingredients make it too drying for my skin.  I much preferred a product that had H2O as first product and Hydralonic Acid next, w/ various fusions and oils next, which was the first hyralonic serum I tried.  I will keep looking...</li>
    <li> My skin feels tighter and smoother since I have been using the serum.</li>
    <li> Love all of their products.  I use this morning and night.  Really plumps and moisturizers my skin.  I have dry skin and it feels good over the vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> When I first used this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt! I know that sometimes my skin can be finicky, but I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS REAL GOOD,I LIKE IT</li>
    <li> Got my product on time as promised, first time I tried my skin felt smooth and soft, waiting to see how much better it works as I keep using it, I feel so good about it. Thank you, thank you!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product, for testing&lt;br /&gt;purposes. After using the product for a few days&lt;br /&gt;these are my findings...&lt;br /&gt;First of the scent is fantastic!! It smells like a&lt;br /&gt;fresh bouquet of flowers... I just adored the&lt;br /&gt;smell... I am using this serum about 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;With this kind of product, I don&#x27;t think you can&lt;br /&gt;over use it! If you cleanse your face a  lot, then&lt;br /&gt;you should reapply it every time... I can already&lt;br /&gt;see my skin looking livelier!&lt;br /&gt;This is not an oily serum, it soaks into&lt;br /&gt;the skin well. It does not over dry...&lt;br /&gt;This is well worth buying, but like all serums like this,&lt;br /&gt;you should maintain use of them to keep&lt;br /&gt;the gorgeous benefits...</li>
