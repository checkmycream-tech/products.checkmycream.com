      <li>Thanks, Mr. Dean for the great products!  </li>
      <li>It is by far the best hair product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>in mind that even the best product will build up in time unless you give your hair the occasional change of regimen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the cucumber melon before and that one is way better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the replenishing mist.  </li>
      <li>I love Wen.  </li>
      <li>Love the product  </li>
      <li>I thought \\&quot;Sure, if I had that big money, I could get my hair to look great too.  </li>
      <li>Wen products are simply extraordinary and WEN® Replenishing Treatment Mist (Sweet Almond Mint) is no exception!</li>
      <li>I would encourage everyone to buy Wen or return it for a full refund but, since its worth more than money you won’t dream of letting it go.</li>
      <li>It is worth it to me, my hair &amp; my skin!  </li>
      <li>I think it would be wonderfully refreshing to spray on the skin in the hot summer time after a shower and experience that feeling.  </li>
      <li>The Sweet Almond Mist Replenshing Treatment is great, I mostly use it on my hair after it is dried.  </li>
      <li>Bath &amp; Body Oil of Sweet Almond Mint variety.  </li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B003SGRJVG WEN Sweet Almond Mint Replenishing Treatment Mist - 6 oz]]</li>
      <li>the prices for these products will be more reasonable.</li>
      <li>It smells really good, works very well, and it keeps my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>I got this with my wen order, it works great on my little boys hair.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps as the Wen line of hair care products becomes more available (like hopefully sold in stores which it currently is not)that</li>
      <li>It is fun &amp; tingly-refreshing to spray on your skin.  </li>
      <li>I keep a spritzer on my desk at work to keep my skin moisturized and fresh.</li>
      <li>One night I misted it on myself right after a shower and sort of rubbed it in</li>
      <li>I really like the Replenishing Treatment Mist!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>The bottle received is a larger amount than most purchases on line.</li>
      <li>When I do, I use the Replenishing Treatment on my hair strands first to avoid any chance of burning.</li>
      <li>I smells great, makes my hair shiney, soft without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>It feels great, especially in the winter time with the dry skin from heating the home, car, etc.  </li>
      <li>so, especially in high winter and high summer that can happen.</li>
      <li>It does smells nice, but other than that, it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to do that, as the Sweet Almond Mint Replenishing Treatment has not been out a full year quite yet, to my knowledge, the mist came out in the second half of 2010.</li>
      <li>I know this has read as an ad for the entire line of Wen products, but I believe that someone looking for a product that puts moisturizer in the hair without leaving a greasy feeling behind, removes frizz, refreshens the hair with softness &amp; a fresh smell, dries quickly, and can be safely used on the skin (muti-purpose) for softness, moisture &amp; refreshening will love this product.    </li>
      <li>Love Wen and use shampoo/conditioner every other day.</li>
      <li>I use it to wet down his hair after naps or in the morning to comb out the tangles in his hair, and it works great.  </li>
      <li>wish the bottle was bigger , but none the less good.......</li>
      <li>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a full rating is I can&#x27;t use it on my face like it says.</li>
      <li>I bought the SWeet Almond Mint Mist in a larger size bottle from Amazon (can not find a listing in that size, so I thought it would be OK to comment on the smaller size bottle offering, the product is the same.)</li>
      <li>I particularly like to use this product on my skin.</li>
      <li>whole line of product keeps my hair soft and fuller than it used to be.</li>
      <li>I live in a High Mountain Desert environment (in Idaho)</li>
      <li>A clear shampoo used now and then will do the trick.</li>
      <li>It detangles and refreshes your hair and make your hair soft and renewed.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>His hair always looked frizzy in the back from sleeping on it, and now its soft and wavy.  </li>
      <li>I live in Los Angeles, where it can get very dry.</li>
      <li>First of all, I have long naturally curly hair that when dry, but still curled reaches over two thirds of the way down my back.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, waist length hair and very rarely blow dry it.</li>
      <li>Just a little too much - um - moisture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is part of the Wen haircare/skincare line, and I am a big fan. I particularly like to use this product on my skin. I live in Los Angeles, where it can get very dry. I also work in an office where the air is recirculated. I keep a spritzer on my desk at work to keep my skin moisturized and fresh. It&#x27;s not the same a spritzing water on your face, as another review claims. It feels like instant skin renewal. And the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really like the Replenishing Treatment Mist! I spray it on my hair after towel dry (after my Wen \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; pump) and just let my hair air dry. I have thick, waist length hair and very rarely blow dry it. Some times I use a 1\\&quot; curling iron to straighten my hair and curve the ends. When I do, I use the Replenishing Treatment on my hair strands first to avoid any chance of burning. I also use it on my skin between body lotion applications when it is feeling dry, tight and itchy.  I live in a High Mountain Desert environment (in Idaho) so, especially in high winter and high summer that can happen. Spray, smooth in, ahhhhhh relief!&lt;br /&gt;Ummmm - one product, good for skin AND hair sounds good to me! The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a full rating is I can&#x27;t use it on my face like it says. Just a little too much - um - moisture.</li>
    <li> my favorite spray mist love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what is so great about this mist!  I just as well spray water on my face.</li>
    <li> I got this with my wen order, it works great on my little boys hair.  I use it to wet down his hair after naps or in the morning to comb out the tangles in his hair, and it works great.  His hair always looked frizzy in the back from sleeping on it, and now its soft and wavy.  Its a great leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like to call this my \\&quot;hair magic\\&quot;.  It is by far the best hair product I have ever used.  I spritz it on (liberally) while my hair is still wet and style with my blow dryer and round brush.  It leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  It also makes my hair easier to style.  Before trying this, I couldn&#x27;t even get my hair to bend anymore.  I order two bottles at a time now. I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> The smell is ok! The product works well but I&#x27;m not happy with scent. I&#x27;ve tried the cucumber melon before and that one is way better.</li>
    <li> does good job for hair</li>
    <li> Excellent rating!! Great price!&lt;br /&gt;Works well for long hair, takes care of the tangles and frizz. The bottle received is a larger amount than most purchases on line.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It does exactly what it says it will do.  I can use it whether my hair is wet or dry.  I smells great, makes my hair shiney, soft without weighing it down.</li>

A clear shampoo used now and then will do the trick.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect companion to WEN Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. My wife uses it when needed.</li>
    <li> I love Wen.  No doubt about it.  Sort of expensive to buy from the line.  However, I cringe if I think of all the products I have bought over the years, each time thinking \\&quot;Maybe this will be the helper or fix my hair problems / issues.\\&quot;  Only to find out that once again, I wasted money, time, and effort.  Grew more cynical &amp; skeptical with each try.  I admit, I must have watched for about three to four years the infomercial belonging to Mr. Dean &amp; the celebrities that promoted the item in the infomercial.  I thought \\&quot;Sure, if I had that big money, I could get my hair to look great too.  I would have a hair stylist to fix my hair every time I wanted or needed it for an event.\\&quot;  Anyways, I got tired of NOT KNOWING whether the Wen line was any good or not &amp; being skeptical because I did not know &amp; I decided to BUY THE PRODUCT &amp; CHECK IT OUT FOR MYSELF.  Rather than join an auto delivery plan, I came to AMAZON (and a couple of other sites) to buy some of the products &amp; try them out for myself.  I bought the SWeet Almond Mint Mist in a larger size bottle from Amazon (can not find a listing in that size, so I thought it would be OK to comment on the smaller size bottle offering, the product is the same.) &amp; the 4oz. Bath &amp; Body Oil of Sweet Almond Mint variety.  I absolutely love the replenishing mist.  I think it is great.  First of all, I have long naturally curly hair that when dry, but still curled reaches over two thirds of the way down my back.  My hair is also coarse and tends to be dry (even though I have only used a blow dryer on my hair ONE TIME in the past five years.)  The Sweet Almond Mist Replenshing Treatment is great, I mostly use it on my hair after it is dried.  It has a great smell that refreshes the hair with a bit of moisture (not leaving it greasy, just seems to take the frizz out) and it dries quickly, not leaving your hair wet for a long period like if you used a detangler type spray or just plain water on your hair.    It is fun &amp; tingly-refreshing to spray on your skin.  Sometimes I close my eyes and just kind of mist it in the air While moving my face towards the mist.  It feels great, especially in the winter time with the dry skin from heating the home, car, etc.  One night I misted it on myself right after a shower and sort of rubbed it in and I had the tingly chills (I can not accurately describe this feeling that it leaves on your skin!) for about 10 minutes afterward.  I think it would be wonderfully refreshing to spray on the skin in the hot summer time after a shower and experience that feeling.  I have not been able to do that, as the Sweet Almond Mint Replenishing Treatment has not been out a full year quite yet, to my knowledge, the mist came out in the second half of 2010. I started with Wen Products on my hair exclusively in November 2009, and I have NOT used anything else to cleanse with, standard shampoo &amp; conditioner since, and have no intention to discontinue using Wen.    I know this has read as an ad for the entire line of Wen products, but I believe that someone looking for a product that puts moisturizer in the hair without leaving a greasy feeling behind, removes frizz, refreshens the hair with softness &amp; a fresh smell, dries quickly, and can be safely used on the skin (muti-purpose) for softness, moisture &amp; refreshening will love this product.    It does feel pricey to me, but I use it sparingly &amp; cut corners on other things in my budget to have the Wen products to use.  It is worth it to me, my hair &amp; my skin!  Thanks, Mr. Dean for the great products!  The (thankful) Verminator  [[ASIN:B003SGRJVG WEN Sweet Almond Mint Replenishing Treatment Mist - 6 oz]]</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It detangles and refreshes your hair and make your hair soft and renewed.  Wish I would have gotten a larger bottle.  This would get 5 stars...however, it is too expensive.  Perhaps as the Wen line of hair care products becomes more available (like hopefully sold in stores which it currently is not)that the prices for these products will be more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a much better product from Wen considering that the Shampoo is what basically repaired my damaged hair, but unfortunately I can not say the same for this mist. It does smells nice, but other than that, it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I will continue my search for the perfect mist, and I will be sure to post my review.</li>
    <li> Wen products are simply extraordinary and WEN® Replenishing Treatment Mist (Sweet Almond Mint) is no exception! I would encourage everyone to buy Wen or return it for a full refund but, since its worth more than money you won’t dream of letting it go.</li>
    <li> I am a WEN girl, this spray is my MUST have on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the product  wish the bottle was bigger , but none the less good.......</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this line of products! Even tho I stopped using traditional shampoo awhile ago in favor of similar products, this saves money by replacing the add on crap I used to require to keep from lookin like I was put in ol&#x27; smoky electric chair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a great product to use to freshen up your do for a night out on the town.</li>
    <li> I have tried other replenishing mist and like this one. It revives my curls and smells pleasant without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> It smells really good, works very well, and it keeps my hair soft.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Love Wen and use shampoo/conditioner every other day. Thought this would work for the days in between, but it doesn&#x27;t. Would not recommend.</li>
