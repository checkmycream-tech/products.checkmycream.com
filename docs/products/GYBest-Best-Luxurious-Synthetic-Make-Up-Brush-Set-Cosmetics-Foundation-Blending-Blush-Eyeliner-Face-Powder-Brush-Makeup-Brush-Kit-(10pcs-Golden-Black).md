      <li>These brushes are incredibly soft and came in the mail within 4 days of my placed order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Soft brushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised I only gave them 4 starts</li>

    <li> These brushes are incredibly soft and came in the mail within 4 days of my placed order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the large ones to buff on foundations and concealers and the tapered on to use for powder highlight under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller ones blend eye shadows beautifully! Of course, you can use them however you please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean all my makeup brushes with a mix of olive oil and dish soap and it has always worked for me!  After two times of washing, these brushes began to come apart. Massive shedding from the larger brushes and handles began to fall off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I cannot complain too much.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, specially the blush brush!! :) will buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product at affordable price. Very happy. Soft brushes.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very soft, and good quality.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes in the mail bent and broken. Yes, it could have been from shipping but a lot of the brushes separated from their bases as well. But for the price it was expected.</li>
    <li> I just use the brush for a week but it&#x27;s  pulling apart already. Not very happy.</li>
