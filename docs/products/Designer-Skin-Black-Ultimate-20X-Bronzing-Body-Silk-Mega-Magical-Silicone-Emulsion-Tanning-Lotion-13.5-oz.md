<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this because of the high price in the salon and then after reading all of the rave reviews on Amazon, it&#x27;s not all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be. For the money and all of the reviews I had much higher hopes for this product. After finishing the bottle I ended up buying Australian gold instead.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion since I started tanning this year, (about 3 &amp; a half weeks ago) And I have already reached my tanning plateau with this lotion.  I know I can be darker, so I just ordered paint it black with 50 bronzers in it.  I guess if you use that, you can see your tanning potential and nothing else will come close.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and package well haven&#x27;t got a chance to use yet thoUgh, I hope it bring excellent results.. Can&#x27;t beat the price in the salon it&#x27;s double that</li>
    <li> This stuff sells for $120 at the tanning place I go to, so I figured I could try to get it on here for cheaper, and I did! $30? I had to buy it!! It arrived within 3 days and I couldnt put it on fast enough. Let me start out by saying Im pretty fair complected, but I&#x27;m able to tan.&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 2 months to use the bottle, tanning about 3-4x a week. The smell is great, it leaves your skin very silky smooth, but..... the tanning part is crap. The best tan I ever achieved is from the $5 bottle of tanning lotion I buy at wal-mart! Black 20x is nothing more than a great smelling silky smooth lotion, packaged into a beautiful, shiny shimmery bottle.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good tan, and dont feel like spending tons of money, seriously, just get the cheap stuff you see at the local store. As long as it says \\&quot;bronzer\\&quot; in it, you&#x27;re good. ;)&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY TANNING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FM</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer &amp; it got to me so quickly.  Buying it online was much cheaper than spending $114 at the tanning salon!</li>
    <li> Would not buy any other lotion.  Some of my friends use others that leave their hands stained.  This lotion does not and you get a great tan!</li>
    <li> It gives you really good natural color FAST (no hints of nasty fake orange unlike most) &amp; goes on super smooth -- not greasy or sticky!! Also smells great before and after tanning* will buy again!</li>
    <li> Ahhhmazing. I was scared at first bc ive heard do t buy tanning lotions online! And i had a bad experience not too long ago with one tanning lotion but i went for it and im glad i did. Fast service also. Thank u!:)</li>
    <li> Works just like the lotion you would purchase at the tanning salon. Smells amazing and definitely helps you get darker faster!</li>
    <li> This lotion works great and smells great. My tan is looking awesome. It was much cheaper than paying $100 at the salon   I am going to try the luminary next but I do love this one!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! It will definitely get you dark with no orange color or streaking. It makes your skin feel so soft like velvet. I could actually tell a difference the very first time i used it ( and I&#x27;m pale and freckled complexion)! I have used lots of tanning lotions over the years. This is the best so far!!!:)</li>
    <li> The silicone component of the lotion made the skin feel smooth but I am unconvenienced that it helps with tanning.</li>
    <li> It is a very good tanning lotion. I love that it may be used indoor or outdoors. It gives me a nice tan in a short amount of time without burning me. Also it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t do well with my skin. I&#x27;m fair skinned. This stuff turned me a gross hue of an orange! So I switched to gilded.</li>
    <li> FAKE!!!!!! This is not the real...... Do not buy!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the exact same product from the salon at a much better price.  Nice light fragrance and good color</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  So excited I got it. My skin feels like melted butter when I get out of the tanning bed!</li>
    <li> This lotion is real nice.  Smells good and makes a real nice tan. I use it for the tanning booth.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but I feel that it should of been darker than what it was.  It does work great even though it isn&#x27;t as dark as expected. Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> love this stuff!!! tanned perfectly for Hawaii in less time than I&#x27;ve ever tanned before!!!8 days</li>
    <li> I Still waiting for my last order from Ellie shoes and pleaser, I need to know if going to have my money back or my order.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Love this lotion so much.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so silky smooth and the bronzers work so good! I have never been disappointed with its results. Scent is very fresh and citrus. Better smell then luminary. The only complaint I have about this lotion is the stupid chain on the bottle broke off! But no big deal! still leaves me dark! Happy Tanning!</li>
    <li> This lotion worked very well for me. I like the way it made my skin so soft and helped me deepen the color of my tan.</li>
    <li> this lotion smells amazing and makes your skin feel like velvet not to metion a nice deeep brown tan.&lt;br /&gt;i will be purchsing this product over and over again!</li>
    <li> Worst after tanning smell ever. I had to go directly to the shower after using this product. Also I gave it a chance I used it for 2 months and I have a horrible splotchy tan worst ive ever had. Ive used kimono silk also by designer skin was amazing.. But then again I bought it in a tanning salon not on here. I think it was diluted w/cheap lotion or something unless it really just isnt a good lotion.. Ive gotten really nice tans w/Aussie gold so I just feel lucky I didnt pay retail price for this product which is about twice as much if u include shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about 10 days and got a really good base tan, I ordered this with my mother-inlaws reviews and it has given me that extra tan that i was looking for when the last one i was using seemed to stop.. Thanks</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
    <li> dont like smell and it doesnt tan like ad says it will. wasnt impressed at all. wont buy again at all</li>
    <li> Did not match. The coloring of the bottle differs from the product i buy from salons as well as the smell. not sure if it was actually what is being advertised</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this lotion as I had tried it at the Tanning salon so when I found it on Amazon I purchased it right away.  When I received the lotion the bottle was broken/cracked and the lotion had spilled all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the lotion also did not smell like the sample that I had tried at my tanning salon but this could be because the bottle was busted open.  I wrote the seller and I am awaiting a reply.  I would be interested in trying another bottle to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received a message back from the sellor and they are reimbursing me for the broken bottle.  That makes me a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased! Just what I wanted. And it helps you get a tan very quick!! I have used this same kind for two years now.</li>
    <li> I have used BLACK TANING LOTION for ever probably since its been on the market ,my favorite of all lotion</li>
    <li> I manage a full service salon, so I tan at least three four times a week. I&#x27;ve always been known for being dark but let me tell you: this lotion is literally the best $40 I have ever spent. I&#x27;ve been called a tanning god and my skin looks so dark it is amazing. Buy now!!!</li>
    <li> It smells great (grapefruity) and feels nice. Helps get a deep color, but due to the self tanning bronzers you HAVE to at least wipe your hands off after applying or you&#x27;ll get self tanner hands! A make up removing wipe, sanitizing wipe or baby wipe work great. Maybe sure you get in between your fingers with a wipe and you&#x27;ll have a beautiful tan</li>
    <li> Product not as in the first picture, label was fake and glued on. Designer Skin labels aren&#x27;t like that, they&#x27;re not attached but embodied. Lotion has no scent, which is unusual. And no silicone feel. Don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s fake product.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft, and the price is about $50.00 cheaper than buying in the salon. I buy them by the case because of how awesome it is.</li>
    <li> The bottle is a nice size, very sparkly, and the lotion smells great. This product came relatively fast and I am very pleased. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth. Would definitely order it again. Used it before and I know it works!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion is amazing! It was a great value compared to what the salon charges for it as well. I can definitely tell that the bronzers in this lotion work wonders on my skin. It also moisturizes my skin which I love. The packaging is super cute as well!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great,creates perfect tan &amp; it&#x27;s not itchy!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to absolutely everyone who does indoor tanning!</li>
    <li> This product is FAKE! It is not the right bottle Black should be in or the right color! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kinda pale so i prefer stronger bronzers than whats in this but as far as silicones! Amazing :) leaves your skin silky soft every time, softness that last all day, Smells great in the bottle but ones its on it has a little after tan odor. If you tan easily you&#x27;d LOVE this. Smells great, leaves your skin REALLY soft which is why i kept buying it for 2 yrs because I couldn&#x27;t get over how amazing my skin felt lol But I didn&#x27;t buy it for the bronzers thats for sure! Overall pleased with it though :) I&#x27;ve found some that finally beat &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; so i might stick to those from now on..This Has been my favorite for 2 yrs though. Great lotion.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! I have fair skin and this really helps! I can tell if I miss a spot cause not only do I burn but the other spots look great</li>
    <li> A good lotion ! Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> My order placed was for Black Noir. I got just the Black! It is a great product for a great price. It was just not the product I thought I was getting.</li>
    <li> I thought I would be a lot darker by now. I have been tanning for 2 months, using Black, for over a month, going 3+ times a week in a \\&quot;BRONZING\\&quot; bed. I will NOT be buying this lotion EVER again, seeing how it says my skin would be \\&quot;silky smooth and I would have a deep rich tan, with 20x bronzer.\\&quot; I will be trying something completely different.</li>
    <li> finally something that doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after you use it! and it keeps my skin really soft! don&#x27;t have to worry about drying out!</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion.  Makes my skin feel great and I get a great tan.</li>
