      <li>I took off one star because I wish you got more for the price.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>If you look at the ingredients, it does not have all of those things one might doubt are healthy for one&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of it and so does my skin.</li>
      <li>My acne is much better</li>
      <li>As a makeup remover, it does work well, although it requires you to tug on your skin a bit more than a liquid makeup remover, which I worry would cause skin to not age as well over time.</li>
      <li>I love to wear makeup.  </li>
      <li>Even those are better.</li>
      <li>I went to pick some more up at the store.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad to know</li>
      <li>My skin is also much more supple and softer.</li>
      <li>I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s more in the removal not</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many cleansers-</li>
      <li>I love this product as well as the ponds moisturizer.</li>
      <li>But the Mrs. and daughters all use it for years already and keep on asking for more.</li>
      <li>All in all, I have to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased with Pond&#x27;s :)</li>
      <li>Sometimes if you have on heavier make up you should use it twice to be sure you get all the residue off</li>
      <li>Tried many items specifically for eye-makeup and they do not even work.  </li>
      <li>I like it a lot! :)</li>
      <li>The great thing is that is it gentle</li>
      <li>2 more words</li>
      <li>love the product....been using it for years</li>
      <li>Most of my acne was gone after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>: I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin stays more \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; if I use tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i LOVE the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>but its more of a makeup remover i think.</li>
      <li>God bless :)</li>
      <li>well, not if you use \\&quot;PONDS\\&quot; :-)</li>
      <li>I purchased this cleanser and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, great smell, and very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product and see why it&#x27;s been around so long.</li>
      <li>The product itself is great for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The generic versions do not stack up against the original Ponds is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>is a very good cream used to wipe his face and moisturize at the same time, like all products recommend them POND&#x27;S</li>
      <li>loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list-</li>
      <li>It has given my skin a more healthy look and it has helped my skin tremendously in the winter.</li>
      <li>I find just rubbing this in is pleasant, and then washing it off with a warm rag is good enough to leave my skin very clean but soft.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have moderately sensitive skin and a few allergies, although I&#x27;m not so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use the vast majority of standard beauty products. But I am VERY allergic to this cold cream! Every time I use it to remove makeup, my eyes and skin get red and itch like crazy. I varied all the other products I was using and this was definitely the cause. As a makeup remover, it does work well, although it requires you to tug on your skin a bit more than a liquid makeup remover, which I worry would cause skin to not age as well over time.</li>
    <li> When I was 12 I met a friend&#x27;s mother who had such beautiful skin that I asked her what product she used. \\&quot;Ponds\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m near 60 now and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. You can go to my profile to see me. I&#x27;m not a raving beauty, maybe not even pretty, but even though the photo was taken on an exhausting day when I was so tired I just wanted to go to bed, I think you can see how little wrinkles I have. I live in the DRY, DRY desert of Arizona, been here 40 years. I&#x27;m told the desert turns your skin to wrinkled leather...well, not if you use \\&quot;PONDS\\&quot; :-) BTW my friend&#x27;s mom is 80 now, and she is GORGEOUS! I use my Ponds on my hands and feet, too!</li>
    <li> I use this as my only facial cleanser . . it&#x27;s very soothing and effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MaryKay facial cleanser for 25+ years.  My &amp;#34;dealer&amp;#34; moved, and I didn&#x27;t want to find another one. I logged in to Amazon to look at reviews for facial cleansers, and really liked what I was reading about Ponds. I bought this product, and do not regret my purchase at all!! I cleans well, and leaves my face soft. Will definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, left my skin sooo smooth, removed all my heavy face makeup. I have a dupe from the Dollar Tree and it works well but is thicker and doesn&#x27;t smell as nice. This is the original classic cold cream! I love it. I took off one star because I wish you got more for the price. It&#x27;s not an expensive product but just saying...I feel like I&#x27;m gonna go through it quick. Definitely buying the big tub next time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser.  I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream.  It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.    Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either.  I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product.  It&#x27;s really too bad because it is a good price and I can&#x27;t afford more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I stopped buying it after realizing it has Formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> First time using cold cream, it was okay. Very easy application, just dont think its for me.</li>
    <li> Great face cleaner.  It is extremely gentle on your skin but cleans quite well.  There are a few other cold creams on the market that are made by small &amp;#34;boutique&amp;#34; companies and yes those tend to leave the skin softer in my opinion.  BUT if you&#x27;re looking for a cold cream on a budget and is great quality overall you can&#x27;t beat Pond&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I bought this cream as a makeup remover. I don´t feel like it removes makeup as well as the other removers I have had and sometimes I have to use it twice in order for my skin to feel clean. It also leaves skin feeling very oily, so you can´t use it right before you put on new makeup. I feel like I can only use it right before I go to bed, because of how oily it is. It also has a very heavy rosy smell, which I don´t really like. I would not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I love to wear makeup.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a cleanser/makeup remover that won&#x27;t dry out my skin.  This is by far the best cleanser/makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Unlike other makeup removers, my skin feels soft and amazing after I use it.  It&#x27;s like using a mousturizer to cleanse your skin and remove your makeup.  My face has never felt so soft.</li>
    <li> ******UPDATE JULY 10 2013********&lt;br /&gt;Regarding my old review below, I WILL NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE. Sadly, they have changed the ingredients. It is loaded with chemicals now and I will not put them on my skin. If it helps any, I now cleanse with pure coconut oil, using same procedure! Hope my sharing helps you.&lt;br /&gt;God bless.&lt;br /&gt;********************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know why my grandmother swore by cold cream! If you have DRY skin this is hands down THE BEST moisturizing cleanser on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve have had to change my skincare routine because my skin is now DRY instead of normal. I&#x27;ve been searching for products to both make my skin look radiant and to actually improve it. I have found my cleanser: PONDS COLD CREAM. Who would have thought?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROCEDURE:&lt;br /&gt;I use Ponds to clean my face/take off my makeup in the evening.After applying it to my face I use several tissues or a damp cloth to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin stays more \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; if I use tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: If you&#x27;re wearing mascara it WILL get a bit messy! (You may prefer to use an eye makeup remover - I don&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks moist and I could NOT be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have as great of results as I did! God bless :)</li>
    <li> Love it, best thing ever. Grandmas skin always looked great so I went to cold cream. Major improvement.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  Wouldn&#x27;t  change it for anything&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the pond&#x27;s our grandmothers used. This is toxic sludge. It is not &#x27;suitable for sensitive skin&#x27;. I, along with millions of other women, want the original formula back.</li>
    <li> Ponds Cold Cream is the only cream I have used which not only cleanses the skin efficiently and without drying, but also removes eye make-up (even waterproof mascara).  I have a mature, fairly sensitive skin and I can use this cream with total confidence.  It also has a delicate Rose aroma in use.  &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am told it is being withdrawn from UK shops and it is getting increasingly hard to obtain.  Help!</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s really is good for your skin. My mother, her mother, and her mother before her started my Pond&#x27;s family tradition by using the cold cream for makeup removal. Right now I like it as a makeup remover, although my young oily skin finds it a little heavy for a stand-alone cleanser. I also apply it to dry patches on the elbows and feet. It&#x27;s a bargain and a great product. Although it isn&#x27;t oil-free, the oil in it is mineral oil, which ranks low on comodegenicity (e.g. is unlikely to clog pores). I was tempted to take off a star b/c it isn&#x27;t ideal for me, but it&#x27;s really made for more mature or dry skin, so I&#x27;ll go with the 5. Something tells me in 5 to 10 years this will be my saving grace.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this in store (BOGO, couldn&#x27;t resist) and I have to say that I LOVE it. The chemicals don&#x27;t really scare me that much, although I can see how they could be an issue for others. I have relatively sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t break out at all with this :) In fact, it left my skin feeling extremely soft and fresh. I also love the smell which (and this will sound weird) reminds me of something a Victorian woman would keep in her powder jar. It&#x27;s just a comforting scent to me, it reminds me of my grandmother and great grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day after I used it I was already getting compliments about how soft my skin was at work! Not that everyone at work touches my face on a regular basis xD All in all, I have to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased with Pond&#x27;s :) Granted, I&#x27;m only 19 and haven&#x27;t experienced the previous formula, but I think this will become a staple for me, especially at college when my pores seem to be clogged with all of the Universe&#x27;s dust xD</li>
    <li> This product seems to cleanse well enough, but it has a very oily feel to it. Not something nice like argan either. It&#x27;s like a fish oil and it smells bad too. Great for dry skin I&#x27;m sure, but for normal to oily it leaves a terrible residue behind</li>
    <li> one of the rare cosmetic companies that still tests on animals....saving a few bucks on research must be more important than ethics to them.  not to me.</li>
    <li> i LOVE the smell of it. smells almost likea rose type scent. either way its great. now i didnt read it correctly i thought it was just a face wash scrub but its more of a makeup remover i think. it gets the makeup off great and leaves my skin smelling good and feeling soft. so either way its great. it even gets off my eyeliner which i usually use hand soap to scrub it like crazy.</li>
    <li> Makes removing makeup easy and leaves your skin feeling really soft</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make-up but I use this to cleanse and moisturize my face. I love the delicate rose scent. This cold cream leaves my face feeling soft, clean, and moist. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The product has been around for years and has proven itself to be an excellent makeup remover.  I will continue to purchase it.  Amazon has very good prices and is prompt.</li>
    <li> I really like this as a winter cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like some others do. It smells good and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing some retro glam routine. I like to apply a liberal amount and work it around for a couple minutes to remove old make up and soak up the cream.</li>
    <li> I cannot be without this product.  Next time, will look for the larger size.  Good price here.  I have used it once or twice daily for many years, most.y to take off makeup.  Tried many items specifically for eye-makeup and they do not even work.  When you gotta get the gunk off, this and two tissues will do the trick.  It is also a good moisture barrier for during the day or night.  If I really need some skin treatment, I just wait a little while after using this to remove makeup, freshen with a little water splashing, then add the real skin food.</li>
    <li> What do I know about cold cream?! Nada! But the Mrs. and daughters all use it for years already and keep on asking for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many cleansers- clarien, Clinique, lancome, Kiehls, cremes, liquids, wipes,etc.  After all these years with all these products I&#x27;m back to the one my mom and my aunt used all those years ago - and it works, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing for this last six months at least with an increasingly bothersome eye irritation that my eye doctor could not explain. After researching the current ingredients, especially triethanolamine, I have decided to stop using Pond&#x27;s. I&#x27;m a senior citizen who has used Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream since I was 14. It has been an effective cleaner and moisturizer, and I have often been complimented on my &amp;#34;beautiful skin.&amp;#34; However, while dealing with a health challenge and surgery, I was not following my usual routine in 2013 and the beginning of 2014. When I restarted regular use of Pond&#x27;s in the spring, I noticed the change in name to Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser, but ads still spoke of the &amp;#34;classic formula.&amp;#34; i hope that the original formulation will be restored, as it fits perfectly with the movement toward natural and organic products. I can&#x27;t imagine what caused the change.</li>
    <li> This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about, but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever. It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell, so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother&#x27;s perfume. It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all, though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely, even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is, but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. This cleanses my skin without drying, or clogging pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had various degrees of acne since I was about 12. My oil-prone face has never completely cleared up, even when on prescription medication and using prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide face wash when I was 15. Recently, after running out of my face wash of choice (Biore charcoal cleanser) I went to pick some more up at the store. On impulse, I grabbed some POND&#x27;S Cold Cream Cleanser off of the shelf, too. I knew nothing about it, except that it had been around for a few generations. I always heard people saying their grandma had used it for years and years... so I figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I was one of those people who thought that a face cleanser was only working if your face felt tight and completely oil-free after washing. That was the point, right? To get rid of the oil and junk. So when I first used POND&#x27;S Cold Cream Cleanser, I was a little skeptical. I wasn&#x27;t convinced it had gotten everything out of my pores, especially considering that I wear makeup everyday so it had to cut through a layer of makeup to get to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was proved wrong! My skin loved the moisturizing quality of the POND&#x27;S Cold Cream and I loved how soft it made my face feel. Some people comment about the smell; I think it smells good! A little &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; but I prefer to think of it as &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; instead. ;) Anyway, my face is beginning to look beautiful after about three weeks of using POND&#x27;S Cold Cream in the morning and the Biore charcoal cleanser at night in the shower (plus moisturizing with Cetaphil lotion after the shower)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. I never used the old one before the reported &amp;#34;formula change&amp;#34; but this one works wonders. I am not concerned about any of its contents and have had no reactions or anything. Just soft, moisturized, skin that is finally clearing up after ten years.</li>
    <li> The cream is cooling and feels very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to wash my face each night.  I follow it up with a warm wash cloth, which really brings out the cooling effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels smooth in the morning, which is a great change from the tightness of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful eye make up remover. I use a small dap, sub and them wipe off with a cotton round. It takes off heavy eyeliner and mascara. Its slightly greasy so i always was my face afterwards with soap to take the oily residue off.</li>
    <li> i have seen the ads for this cream on TV and i decided to try it.  looking forward to the experience.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much. When reading the other reviews I was really concerned that I would end up getting some in my eyes and that it would hurt like mad, but I use it to remove my mascara and I haven&#x27;t had an issue yet. I only use this stuff at night, because it&#x27;s a bit too much for my skin to use as a morning and evening cleanser. I recommend it for oily/combination skin!</li>
    <li> yuck forget it don&#x27;t buy this crap too greasy , only plus removed powdered make up well . Not worth the price wish I  had not opened</li>
    <li> This works really well for removing makeup, but it does leave my skin feeling greasy even when only using a little bit of product and rinsing with water. However, I haven&#x27;t used anything else that gets mascara off of my lashes so well, so I put up with it and usually just wash my face with cleanser afterwards.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the current Pond&#x27;s cleansing products, this is the best for removing eye makeup.  It takes off everything, and leaves your skin moisturized.  Please note the size of this particular container - it&#x27;s very small.</li>
    <li> was thinking I got cleanser, but this works too, remember using it in the 60&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;still a great product.  It is a comeback for me from those expensive dept store items of the same.</li>
    <li> I needed a cold cream cleanser to take off some heavier makeup. Not only did it arrive fast, the cold cream took the makeup off and left my skin nourished and moisturized. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I was 16 years old ( 42 now) to remove my eye make-up ( and any other make up). Love it.  It&#x27;s always been a staple for me. I have literally used this stuff daily for close to 30 years. I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie and love to try new things...but this product I have stuck with. Product has been consistent in quality for all of these years!</li>
    <li> I like this product but this is a really small size.  No bargain.</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve heard about how horrible mineral oil is so I&#x27;ve just avoided it. It turns out my skin loves the stuff. I started washing my face with this after using a cream wash overseas that I could not find in the US. I had noticed that some eczema which I could not get to clear up started getting better after using cleansing cream as my face wash. I was put out by the heavy rose geranium scent (though if they use rose geranium oil it&#x27;s probably not so bad for the skin), but I find this does a great job of dissolving makeup and grease while leaving my skin soft.    I&#x27;ve tried the oil cleansing method before with a lot of success so I understand how oil can clean the skin well. However, I found the oil cleansing method to much trouble to keep up with. Cleansing cream dissolves just a little faster and easier and requires less heat on my face, which is good.    I find just rubbing this in is pleasant, and then washing it off with a warm rag is good enough to leave my skin very clean but soft.    I have not seen any increase in breakouts after using this, myself. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and see why it&#x27;s been around so long.</li>
    <li> My mom has always used Pond&#x27;s cold cream and she suggested I used it to remove my makeup along with cleansing my face. However, after a few days of use, I noticed that after applying the pond&#x27;s cold cream, my face would start to get red and splotchy. BE CAREFUL. Even though the spots eventually went away, it annoyed me that this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I am 17 years old and have normal/ dry skin. I would try sampling this product before use... I really wanted to like it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Cant live without this. the only makeup remover that really does the job and doesn&#x27;t dry your face. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Leaves my complexion feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
    <li> Ponds Cold Cream is great for make-up removal, dry skin and general moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;This cream will remove make-up including waterproof mascara, long wearing make-up and lipstick and concealer.  Knock on wood I haven&#x27;t found any make up yet this won&#x27;t take off.  Sometimes if you have on heavier make up you should use it twice to be sure you get all the residue off but that&#x27;s more in the removal not the product.&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my skin feeling fresh, moisturized and soothed from the silky cream.  The generic versions do not stack up against the original Ponds is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over many overpriced brands on the market sold at high end department stores.</li>
    <li> In my sun worshiping youth my mother warned me of the danger of wrinkles (before skin cancer was the primary concern).  Through the years, since I was 18, I have faithfully used Pond&#x27;s  cold cream each day.   &lt;br /&gt;Now, in my Social Security time of life, my hair is colored and there is excess baggage on my body, but I have no wrinkles. &lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU -  POND&#x27;S &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This cleanser is super economical and I appreciate not having to buy makeup remover every month or two when I have this on hand. It&#x27;s pretty heavily fragranced, though, and it has a tendency to irritate my eyes if I&#x27;m not careful. With that said, it gets the job done. I don&#x27;t wear foundation, just concealer and eye makeup, and this allows everything to wipe away with a baby wipe or facial cloth.</li>
    <li> I love Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser. What I did not expect, and I will blame myself for, is not noting that this product is 3.5 oz.  I had anticipated a &#x27;good deal&#x27; when I purchased this product at the lower price as I thought it was the 9.5 oz container. I have never seen this tiny jar of Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser so I felt rather duped when I opened the box and saw such a tiny Pond&#x27;s jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a very dry climate. I use the Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser to clean my face and I don&#x27;t come away with the feeling of a dry face. I find it great for removing make-up; although, I only wear make-up once a week.  If you look at the ingredients, it does not have all of those things one might doubt are healthy for one&#x27;s face. People often comment of my skin. I have used Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer for about 40 years.</li>
    <li> The familiar greasy cold cream feel. Does the job at a great price when on sale. I will purchase this on BOGO if they don&#x27;t have my top choice -&gt;&gt; WAY prefer the deep cleanser and makeup remover with cucumber extract.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described by seller and arrived in short time.  Very good packaging and excellent price.  I wanted travel size contsiners because I dont check luggage when I travel and this was just the perfect size</li>
    <li> I have used Ponds cold creme off and on since I was a teen, I am now in my late 50&#x27;s. I try new cremes but I always come back to Ponds, it leave my skin feeling soft. brenda</li>
    <li> I like the product but this is a teeny jar and priced at what you&#x27;d pay in the drugstore for a much larger size.</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s the old faithful. Great product. Unfortunately the scent is the same unpleasant scent it had 30 years ago, but perhaps that&#x27;s part of the old faithful formula that has continued to be effective through the years.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Ponds Cold Cream Cleanser and makeup remover, but received Ponds regular cold cream instead. Did not return it because my wife said she could use it anyway. This is the first time Amazon has sent the wrong product and I have been ordering products from Amazon for 10+ years.</li>
    <li> I love this product as well as the ponds moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I admit I havent tried this but I don&#x27;t have to in order to know it only derserves ONE star! I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin. I have gotten so tired of reading labels and having no idea what I am about to be putting on my skin (and as a result, into my bloodstream) I have sensitive skin which happens to also be acne-prone and have had a really difficult time with trial &amp; error on different skin care products. TIRED of wasting money! I want something affordable AND safe! Is this too much to ask???&lt;br /&gt;I loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list- Triethanolamine. After a little research on this ingredient I need not go any further with my Ponds Cold Cream research and will not be using this product!!! Here [...] a link to the alarming article I found on this ingredient:&lt;br /&gt;I would rather not risk it &amp; if you read the facts on it you probably won&#x27;t either!&lt;br /&gt;If ANYONE out there has any recommendations for skin products that are mostly natural &amp; non-comedogenic  (I mean ALL the ingredients are)(NO salicylic acid or any other FOR acne (DRYING) agents in them,&lt;br /&gt;I am open!&lt;br /&gt;PS-SOMEONE please create a fragrance-FREE, all natural, non-comedogenic, NON-drying face wash that also serves as a moisturizer (as cold cream does)!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product with the original 7 ingredients being the mineral oil, water, beeswax, ceresin, sodium borate, fragrance and carbomer. It was one of my safer conventional personal products that I used. I ran out of the origin Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream - the cool classic and went to the store and noticed the packaging changed. I was suspicious of a new formulation and sure enough, it had changed. This cream now contains DMDM Hydantoin which is a formaldehyde releaser and methylbaraben which causes cancer according to EWG (Environmental Working Group). Why Unilever decided to change the formulation is beyond me! The old formulation worked just fine! It pulled my eyeliner, waterproof mascara, bb cream and eyeshadow off so easily and never once caused me to break out and was a pretty safe product. Until Unilever decides to remove the dangerous chemicals, I will be looking elsewhere for a safe cleanser/makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This cream cleanser is effective in removing the eye makeup. For me who applies eyeliners and sometimes mascara the cleanser makes me look like a panda with two black circles around the eyes as the makeup gets resolved but it means it&#x27;s effective. However I find it hard to wash the cleanser off the face with just water, and after it&#x27;s washed off it leaves a somewhat greasy feel on my face (I have dry skin).</li>
    <li> Gentle, does not tear at eyelashes, takes off makeup so easily!&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave my skin dry and not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> I will readily admit that the ingredients are not great. That&#x27;s why I gave 4 out 5 stars. But... It works. I&#x27;ve got dry skin specially because I live in a dry climate. After washing my face, it would be greasy looking in less than an hour. I realized my skin was too dry and it was overcompensating. The area around my eyes has drastically improved and my skin isn&#x27;t as greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product for a few months, it does clog my skin. I now only use it around my eyes, cleaning gently with a washcloth.  I have seen a big difference in keeping the area around my eyes moisterized.</li>
    <li> When I was beginning to look into cold creams a while back, I came across this because of all of the raving reviews about how excellent this product was. Upon looking closer at the ingredients though, I changed my mind. There are formaldehyde agents in the formula--which is something that anyone should avoid (unless you are a specimen about to be preserved in a jar).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I found that using harsh chemicals only made it worse. My mom introduced me to ponds about a year ago and my skin has been so great ever since. It takes off all of my makeup and actually cleans my skin at the same time. I always found that products that were makeup removers + facial cleansers always left my skin feeling greasy and gross. Ponds is the total opposite, it leaves my skin feeling so airy and clean. Nothing beats that.</li>
    <li> I went to school for theatre and my professor of theatre makeup always told use to use Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream to take off the makeup and as a cleanser. I didn&#x27;t really listen. I have always had a love hate relationship with my skin. It has changed from combination to dry. I would break out a lot. I have been using Pond&#x27;s for 2-3 months now and I love it. It has given my skin a more healthy look and it has helped my skin tremendously in the winter. I don&#x27;t think I could ever use anything else. Some reviewers have commented on it being greasy but it isn&#x27;t greasy as much as it is moisturizing. I love the feel of it and so does my skin.</li>
    <li> I used to use this as a teenager but for some reason stopped. I&#x27;ve been using covergirl foundation over olay face cream for years but for some reason my face started breaking out recently. So I bought a bottle of this and my face cleared right up and I don&#x27;t even need the olay cream because this cold cream moisturizes my face plenty</li>
    <li> I wanted a travel size bottle for on vacation, perfect size. It fits in my small makeup bag along with all of my other stuff</li>
    <li> People have been praising this product for awhile now so had to try it.  I have dry acne prone skin (guy-21).  I have done it all, cetaphil worked the best so far but I was still having breakouts.  I tried ponds and it felt greasy  at first, but once you get used to it, you love it.  Use it just at night (wipe off with cotton pad).  Most of my acne was gone after a couple weeks of use.  Skin feels surprisingly clean even though I don&#x27;t use water and you wouldn&#x27;t think it is much of a cleanser.  Couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.  The grandmas know exactly what they&#x27;ve been doing all this time.  Recommend to  any one with dry-sensitive-acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser and am quite pleased with the results. The item is now one of my regular purchases. Thick cream and if you put it in the fridge it is great to put on cold and then wash off or wipe off after it warms to regular temperature. This little trick also keeps the product shelf life longer and is so soothing after a hard day.</li>
    <li> My original bottle, with no bar code on it, finally got used up. This seems to be identical. I&#x27;ve had problems with dry ears ever since I began wearing earplugs daily for up to eight hours a day. It keeps them clean and moisturizes too. The list of ingredients is almost the same as my original bottle.</li>
    <li> Well, this product works, but the ingredients are questionable. If anyone else is looking for another product, Jergens makes a face cream with the same basic ingredients without some of the chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have used this product consistently for about 4 months. My acne is much better (this was the only change to my lifestyle) with only hormonal breakouts once a month. Even those are better. My skin is also much more supple and softer.</li>
    <li> I tried using this 3 times and shortly after my 3rd time, my face turned red like a sun burn!!  It stayed red for about 2 hours after and I was worried I did damage to my face!!  Thank the Lord I did not!!  At least, I can&#x27;t see any damage.  My face went back to normal after a couple of hours and I quit using it.  This was the first time I ever tried a facial cleanser.  I have very dry skin and I usually use dove soap to wash my face and body in the shower.  I was told to use a moisturizing facial cleanser like ponds cold cream because soap strips the oils from the face.  Well, I don&#x27;t know what it is in ponds cold cream to have caused that reaction, but I will not be using it ever again :(  Back to dove soap for me!!!</li>
    <li> My family has been using Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser to remove makeup for generations!  It is especially great for waterproof mascara which can be sometimes difficult to remove safely.  I have never had a problem removing any type of waterproof mascara with Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser.  I have even removed stubborn makeup from Halloween with no problems.  The great thing is that is it gentle and this is especially important around the eye area where skin is more fragile.  I just take a little and gently massage it over my eyes to remove the makeup, tissue it off, and wash my face.  It does not burn your eyes or sting.  I have tried other products that don&#x27;t completely remove stubborn waterproof mascara and/or sting my eyes in the process.  As always, Amazon offers a great price and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> oo heavy - not nearly as light as &#x27;original&#x27; Pond&#x27;s which I have been unable to find anywhere. 2 more words</li>
    <li> This is not the original formula ponds has used for years!!! but they still advertise as the \\&quot;CLASSIC\\&quot; they changed the ingredients!!! Original had only 7 and worked great never made my skin burn. The other&#x27;s on here who have reported it making there skin burn probally got a batch of there new 12+ ingredient formula that also broke my skin out, burned, and doesn&#x27;t have the same smell or consistancy as the original. They no longer make the original but I am not the only one who wants them to bring it back!! Listen to your customer&#x27;s UNILEVER!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser and am quite pleased with the results.  The item is now one of my regular purchases.  Thick cream and if you put it in the fridge it is great to put on cold and then wash off or wipe off after it warms to regular temperature.  This little trick also keeps the product shelf life longer and is so soothing after a hard day.</li>
    <li> So straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: removes makeup completely&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I am very gentle and patient with removing my makeup, so I make sure to rub my eyes gently for 1-2 minutes to remove eyeliner. However, no matter how gentle I try - my precious eyelashes fall like crazy! Each time i&#x27;d lose 1-2 eyelashes, and there&#x27;s nothing more precious to me than that.&lt;br /&gt;2. Too greasy to use all over the face. I only use it for eye makeup mostly, or days when i have heavy face makeup on (I normally just use tinted moisturizer so my regular cleanser is enough. For those interested, I use the Clinique face soap - very gentle but still cleanse everything very well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it works well as a makeup remover, but IF YOU HAVE \\&quot;WEAK\\&quot; and FEW EYELASHES - DO NOT USE THIS! By weak, i mean like my eyelashes would fall off if i wear mascara every day without a primer. I limit using mascara to only special occasions for that reason. I really wanted to like this, for the idea of removing all eye and face makeup is so convenient, but it just destroyed my lashes. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I clean my face EVERY night and have done so for over 30 years.  I feel it is important to take makeup off before I go to bed.  I usually use a name brand cleaner to put in and then a wet washcloth to take off.  At 11:00 at night the wet cloth is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a good review in a magazine and decided to try Pond&#x27;s.  Its perfect.  It cleans my face and I just wipe off with a tissue.</li>
    <li> This has certainly changed over the years.  With the addition of different ingredients, and an abrasive scent, this hasn&#x27;t held up well.  That said, I found at my local Shaws Market (Boston), their house brand under the &amp;#34;Equaline&amp;#34; name.&lt;br /&gt;There are only 7 ingredients here, and the scent is pleasant and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I was happy with its mild smell and texture while making my skin feel really relaxed and clean before bed. Definitely two thumbs up from me :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just love that you don&#x27;t have to remember to get this kind of stuff on your next grocery store jaunt?  I put the empty jar next to the computer to remind me, and it&#x27;s just a click away.  Been a Pond&#x27;s girl as long as I&#x27;ve worn make-up.  Still the best make-up remover out there.  I transfer a small amount to quarter-size containers and I&#x27;m good for travel.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Best product to remove eye make up</li>
    <li> This is a product that has been around what seems FOREVER. My mom used to use this cold and it has that distinctive clean, fresh, but mellow scent. Now I use it and have been having really good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not only a cleanser for your face, but a good makeup remover and a moisturizer. I have heard people have sworn its usage with no wrinkles, try for your self and you will get great results.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give this product four stars but I just couldn&#x27;t. I like how it removes my makeup pretty much completely. It removes my mascara but not some of my eyeliner but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t want to rub soap that close to my eye. It is very moisturizing! We have oil on our skin naturally and some of the cleansers just removes it all and dries out our skin. I have normal/dry skin so a lot of cleansers dry me out like crazy. This product leaves oily residue so it doesn&#x27;t dries my skin like many other products. But the oily residue is also why I don&#x27;t like it because apparently cuz of the oily feeling I can&#x27;t tell if my skin is actually clean and Idk if I have rinsed the soap off. Also this has a very strong chemically floral smell (yeah, in a bad way). So if you don&#x27;t like strong scent in your skincare products,avoid this. However, I doubt anyone would like the scent in this product. I think this cleanser meets my need which is to keep my skin moisturized but I will definitely not repurchase it.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream!! I have very sensitive skin and often have an issue with dryness when using makeup removers. I have been using this cold cream as a makeup remover and it is very effective (i.e. I rub it all on my face and neck and then take a warm washcloth and wipe it off). It does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling very soft and moisturized. It is pretty effective at getting all my face makeup off, although I do have to use a separate makeup remover for my heavier eye makeup. I like it a lot! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different make up remover and nothing works like Ponds.  My friends all make fun of me for using Grandma&#x27;s cold cream, but hey...it works the best!</li>
    <li> Irritate my eyes a lot1!!!!!1</li>
    <li> I am a certified makeup artist and my instructor recommended it at the time...figured I would try it, especially considering I have super dry skin. I liked it at first since it didnt leave my skin feeling stretched tight after a shower. After about 2 months of use, I started breaking out considerably (small zits all over face), and when I went for a facial, I told my facialist that I was using ponds. She told me it is definitely the wrong product for me - it was very much clogging my pores and not doing any good for my face. I now use a mild bar soap (avocado oil) to wash my face twice a day and I love it.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, great smell, and very moisturizing. Great product that I will continue using and make a part of everyday cleansing.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m glad to know I&#x27;m NOT the only one who has found the latest formula change completely UNACCEPTABLE!!!  I couldn&#x27;t understand why my eyes burned and my eye-lid skin has gotten all puffy and irritated.  I used this for literally 30 years to remove my eye makeup.  Never had a problem until the new tub I just bought.  I am disgusted.  Do not purchase this product unless the company goes back to the original formula.  Now WHAT am I going to find to replace it?  YIKES!!!!!  It&#x27;d be nice to hear a response to this outrage from the company!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reading some of the review on here from women who have used this product for years and are disappointed with the change composition of the product.  We used Noxema growing up; I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever used Ponds.  I have mild adult acne (chin area), and the skin care routine I was using wasn&#x27;t working at all!  Constant breakouts.  I used Proactive for years and although it worked very well I quit and quit using it because it just got too expensive.  I have never had good luck with any moisturizer; it seemed whatever I used caused me to break out.  I switched to the Equate brand of Proactive, and it worked well.  When I had difficulty finding it in the store, I started using a Neutregena acne wash.  After a time, I realized that all I did was struggle with constant breakouts.  I decided to go back to the Equate equivalent of Proactive and, based on a review I read, I starting using Ponds to remove the makeup before I cleansed my face withe Equate acne system.  What a difference in my skin!  I had never used Ponds before, and it appears to counteract the slight dryness that acne cleansing may cause.  Using the combination of Ponds to take off my make up and moisturize and then following with the Equate acne treatmet has made a HUGE difference in my skin. Less breakouts, reduction in pores and smoother looking skin.  I&#x27;m 56 years old, and I realize there are no miracles, but there&#x27;s a definite improvement!  I&#x27;m surprised at the negative comments I&#x27;m seeing.  I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and what works for one person doesn&#x27;t work for another.</li>
    <li> love the product....been using it for years</li>
    <li> My favorite cold cream</li>
    <li> Unless you buy this by the caseload, I THINK you will get a better price at your local drugstore.  The jar I received was tiny (my abd for not checking the size more closely).  The product itself is great for my very sensitive skin.  It takes off makeup and eyemakeup like nothing else can.</li>
    <li> is a very good cream used to wipe his face and moisturize at the same time, like all products recommend them POND&#x27;S</li>
    <li> I had always heard such great things about this product so I decided to give it a try. It was so incredibly greasy. I had to wash and wash my face to get it off. Even after that I still felt that it was on my face. I have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t want to use anything that would clog my pores. I feel this product would indeed do that.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream Cleanser may very well be used for makeup removal, but I use it solely as a facial moisturizer that eliminates facial blemishes, makes the face radiant, and does not produce acne. This is especially useful in the winter months, where cold dry air can destroy your facial appearance by dehydrating it, showing additional blemishes, and aggravating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just smearing this cream on your face after you shower, before bed, every night, is enough. Don&#x27;t remove it like the package says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m aware that additional chemicals have been added, I don&#x27;t feel any sting like other reviewers mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly all-in-one skincare miracle that treats acne, moisturizes skin, and enlivens your face!</li>
    <li> This is a basic make-up remover.  I forgot how thick it is.  It does a good job at removing my make-up.  You need to wipe it off with a face cloth or wet wipe to remove.  It will not come off with just a water splash.  It leaves my skin soft and dewey.  I would recommend to you if you like the extra removal step.  You wil need to follow with a toner to completely remove the residue from your skin.  Nice scent.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, it makes me feel refreshed every time I use it I have sensitive skin so finding something that works for me is often hard I honestly stand by this hands down overall great stuff will definitely order more</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get eye makeup off as well as I&#x27;d hoped, but does keep skin nice and moisturized in the horrible IL cold.</li>
