### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great concept.  </li>
      <li>The product seems to be of good quality</li>
      <li>we baught this for a friend and she is Very Pleased it was recived in about a week</li>
      <li>Very smooth</li>
      <li>Then stick the wad of wet-paper to the wall of your shower - TA DA - you already have something that sticks to the wall better than this plastic number.  </li>
      <li>You have to go out and purchase 2 more suction cups for the product</li>
      <li>no matter how creative you get.</li>
      <li>I know the surface is OK for suction cups because I have a couple of shelfs that are held in place that way</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for a night light!!</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to start shaving my legs with my foot on this foot rest, but my joy was short lived.  </li>
      <li>then it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>However the LED lights which shine just as advertised light up fine but won&#x27;t turn off, ever.</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;ve been secure for years.</li>
      <li>I can not find any suction cups to actually fit the slots it has for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried and tried to get the Luma Step n&#x27; Shave to attach to the shower wall and was only successful one time.  </li>
      <li>I have large ceramic smooth glazed tiles and it would not stick to the shower wall.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want the light portion to really work after a while</li>
      <li>After about 30 seconds of use, the step started slipping - more - and more.  </li>
      <li>(and I use that word lightly) still slid down, at one point all on its own with no weight put on it.  </li>
      <li>This sticks just fine to tile walls if installed properly.</li>
      <li>Great idea but poor workmansip</li>
      <li>but it would not suction to the shower wall very well.</li>
      <li>but maybe it would do better on tile which is less porous.</li>
      <li>We have clean, non-porous walls (single sheets of acrylic) and this \\&quot;step\\&quot;</li>
      <li>If you are willing to glue this to a wall, you may actually have a chance at using it - otherwise: save your money.</li>
      <li>Was so excited to get this, but that didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>Can not use it, it is a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your time and money.</li>
      <li>This is the first item that I have purchased that I actually had to send back.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd one now after returning the first one and after a week it did the same thing.  </li>
      <li>or you constantly put a new battery in...</li>

<li> What a total waste of money.</li>
<li> Instead of purchasing this, wet down 20 $1 bills and mold them into the rough shape of this footrest.  </li>
<li> The quickest waste of money I have ever spent on just about anything.  </li>
<li> Like this but the cover underneath to the batteries always comes off once you press down on the step.</li>

    <li> I was not able to get the large suction cup to screw tight against the tub surround . . . it will be in the trash soon!</li>
    <li> The quickest waste of money I have ever spent on just about anything.  Instead of purchasing this, wet down 20 $1 bills and mold them into the rough shape of this footrest.  Then stick the wad of wet-paper to the wall of your shower - TA DA - you already have something that sticks to the wall better than this plastic number.  We have clean, non-porous walls (single sheets of acrylic) and this \\&quot;step\\&quot; (and I use that word lightly) still slid down, at one point all on its own with no weight put on it.  If you are willing to glue this to a wall, you may actually have a chance at using it - otherwise: save your money.</li>
    <li> Simply horrible item. Would not attach to the wall with suction cup, and when it did, it did not last.  As I started to use it, it slipped down, fell, and broke.  What a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This thing uses a hand screw to create the suction. It kept slipping while I screwed and eventually the screw assembly fell apart.  I know the surface is OK for suction cups because I have a couple of shelfs that are held in place that way and they&#x27;ve been secure for years.</li>
    <li> Total crap! Do not waste your time and money. The thing will no stay on the wall no matter how creative you get.</li>
    <li> I am very pregnant and bathe in a stand up shower and it has been become very hard to shave my legs and this has helped a lot!</li>
    <li> Like this but the cover underneath to the batteries always comes off once you press down on the step. I just pick it up and replace after I&#x27;m done shaving</li>
    <li> It will not stick to the wall, the lights stay on all the time.  Can not use it, it is a huge waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> After a week, the LED Lights stay on all the time.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd one now after returning the first one and after a week it did the same thing.  If you don&#x27;t want the light portion to really work after a while or you constantly put a new battery in...then it works just fine.  However, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for a night light!!</li>
    <li> we baught this for a friend and she is Very Pleased it was recived in about a week</li>
    <li> The product seems to be of good quality but it would not suction to the shower wall very well. Tried several times following the instructions but it just would not hold up to any weight being placed on it. Our shower is not tile, it is fiberglass. Very smooth but maybe it would do better on tile which is less porous.</li>
    <li> Works as designed, a little big, but holds up to pressure of the weight of leg well in shaving process</li>
    <li> I tried and tried to get the Luma Step n&#x27; Shave to attach to the shower wall and was only successful one time.  I was so pleased to start shaving my legs with my foot on this foot rest, but my joy was short lived.  After about 30 seconds of use, the step started slipping - more - and more.  This product is of no use to me and the manufacturer says my purchase does not qualify for a refund because I didn&#x27;t use 1-click or the shopping cart offered by Amazon????  I can&#x27;t return a bad product because I used my credit card to buy it?  What is this world coming to.</li>
    <li> This wouldn&#x27;t stay stuck to the wall at all.  Any pressure from putting your foot up on it would cause it to slide.  Great concept.  Wish it worked...</li>
    <li> I received the product and it wouldn&#x27;t stick to my shower tile and just fell off.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to get this, but that didn&#x27;t last long.  I have large ceramic smooth glazed tiles and it would not stick to the shower wall. After several tries it fell into the shower floor and the cover fell off getting water into the battery area. After that the lights stayed on until it dried out/batteries went dead.  Tried again several days later with no luck and couldn&#x27;t find my shipping label so I threw it in the trash...piece of JUNK!</li>
    <li> This looks like an &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; item. Mickey mouse construction which won&#x27;t even attach to the wall. Don&#x27;t waste your return postage money by buying this piece of *^#@,</li>
    <li> It does not hold on stone finishes.</li>
    <li> It DOES NOT stay attached to ANY surface what so ever. You have to go out and purchase 2 more suction cups for the product (IT DOES NOT COME WITH IT) and I can not find any suction cups to actually fit the slots it has for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first item that I have purchased that I actually had to send back.  The item does not stick to anything in my shower.  Very disappointed with this product</li>
    <li> This sticks just fine to tile walls if installed properly. I put a lot of weight on it and couldn&#x27;t get it to budge. However the LED lights which shine just as advertised light up fine but won&#x27;t turn off, ever. I returned it and got a second one, same thing. When your foot comes off the pad, the lights dim to half power and then stay on until the battery dies. Tried a third one and doggone it, after 3 days the same thing again.  No more! Great idea but poor workmansip</li>
    <li> This did not work at all.  I could not get it to stay up on the tile or the glass in my shower.  Completely useless!</li>
