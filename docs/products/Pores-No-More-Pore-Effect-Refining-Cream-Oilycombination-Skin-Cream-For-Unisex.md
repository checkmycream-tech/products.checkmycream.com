      <li>Love this !!!!</li>
      <li>The cleanswer was great too.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The cream is housed in an attractive container.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant eucalyptus scent.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with another dr. brandt product -</li>
      <li>It does contain salicylic acid, which is good for preventing blackheads.  </li>
      <li>Cream works fairly well.  </li>
      <li>loved the refining cream.  </li>
      <li>if anything, as my skin is naturally fairly oily in the T zone.</li>
      <li>Brandt has an excellent reputation so it is probably worth a try.</li>
      <li>I am SO getting more of this!  </li>
      <li>But then I saw the kit that included this, and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I found the product a nice creamy consistency.  </li>
      <li>Kind of exacerbates the oily skin though.  </li>
      <li>The pore refiner is awesome in its own right (glides on magically), but this Refining Cream is the winner!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For the money I think I should notice something more happening to my pores after two weeks.!&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure that helped too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Although it say&#x27;s to use more of there</li>
      <li>At $45 a jar, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase more, but that may change when I look for an alternative when it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
      <li>As someone with acne, I&#x27;ve used many products with salicylic acid over the years.</li>
      <li>and this product seems to be able to control outbreak as well - it gives me smoother complexion</li>
      <li>I lOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have never heard of, but I&#x27;m sure there</li>

      <li>I have also been exfoliating more faithfully this month</li>
      <li>Although not touted as an &#x27;acne cream,&#x27; my daughter hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts from her acne since using the cream and is incredibly satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>At first it was kind of nice.  </li>
      <li>- I just don&#x27;t necessarily think that it requires a dr. brandt ($$$) exfoliant, but any good exfoliant along with this cream would probably do just as good of a job.</li>
      <li>Most are fine.</li>
      <li>There is a rather strong odor of tea tree oil which doesn&#x27;t bother me bit</li>
      <li>The non-greasy cream is easy to apply and feels smooth and soothing on my face.</li>
      <li>I dpn&#x27;t have huge pores to begin with, but the area on my nose and chin is sometimes a problem.</li>
      <li>It irritated my skin and caused huge flare ups.</li>
      <li>and I like knowing that I am getting the benefits of it on my skin; if you are unfamiliar with this odor and want something light and perfume-y this odor might be off-putting.  </li>
      <li>As to a product endorsement, once we are done with the sample my daughter wants me to buy her more.  </li>
      <li>finally found the ingredients on the bottom of the box!&lt;br /&gt;The good ingred.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, it made it more oily, much to my surprise, although I like that</li>
      <li>I liked this cream as a general moisturizing product, and I could also see that it has some impact on my pores.  </li>
      <li>Good for oily skin, does help with pore size in the long run.  </li>
      <li>I have really huge pores on my nose and the results were very visible.</li>
      <li>Overall I am glad I have invested in a good pore refining cream that actually does work.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say my pores seem any different since adding in this cream 3 weeks ago, but it has a nice finish and seems to keep my skin moisturized without causing acne, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me too much at first, but when I got pregnant, I had to stop using it.  </li>
      <li>Luckily the odor dissipates quickly but because of this, there is no way I can stick with this product for much longer.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve seen some positive effect in cleaning up some of my pores, but the jury is still out on whether it&#x27;ll work on the more stubborn ones</li>
      <li>but  if you are consistent, you will like what you see.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>It seems rather heavy at first but goes on smoothly and absorbed very quickly into my skin.  </li>
      <li>This really is worth it, and is probably the single most important part of my daily routine.</li>
      <li>The acne is large and has not reduced since the wedding over a week ago.  </li>
      <li>As to making pores disappear, neither my daughter or I noticed any decrease in pore size (but certainly our pores didn&#x27;t get</li>
      <li>my face broke out with large cystic acne.  </li>
      <li>the whole</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this cream.</li>
      <li>I was amazed that it came to the surface and is now gone!&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to make an appointment with my Dermatologist, now I do not have too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I see Dr. Brandt has a whole Pores</li>
      <li>You do not have to use much..</li>
      <li>in others he was really irritated.  </li>
      <li>I will have to use it longer to really see.</li>
      <li>This is a decent product to help improve cell turnover and prevent breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I have particularly focused on my nose which gets blackheads.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had large pores on my cheeks near the sides of my nose.</li>
      <li>No More Pore Effect Refining Cream comes in a gorgeous blue container with a screw on lid.</li>
      <li>All other reviews are mostly fantastic</li>
      <li>and I am very sensitive about what I have on my face.</li>
      <li>I have been using the product for the past 2-3 weeks nightly and within the first week of using, I can already see the results - smaller and more refined pores.</li>
      <li>-- I&#x27;ve never found a product that works consistently in the long run.  </li>
      <li>It smells like something that shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near a persons face.</li>
      <li>both used the cream for almost two weeks and while I couldn&#x27;t really see a big difference on my face my son&#x27;s</li>
      <li>On the whole it actually works rather well in this regard.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have even slightly sensitive skin (my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive)</li>
      <li>Every time I am nearly running out, I think, I don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this cream.</li>
      <li>I have found that with the colder weather setting in that there are some dry spots on my face that need a second application of this moisturizer but at the end of the day I am pleased with my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and don&#x27;t find it to be extra oily or super dry, which means this moisturizer seems to be doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
      <li>However, I have big pores, this did not reduce their size, and unfortunately shortly before my wedding (I know, don&#x27;t try something new before you get married)</li>
      <li>and I used this together on a daily basis and the container is still mostly full and will likely last 3 to 4 months.  </li>
      <li>its present price it does seem costly, but it really goes a long way--if it lasts four or five months when used by one person it is probably inexpensive compared to lesser creams that have to be used in larger quantities for adequate coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I should bed done with major blemish acne.</li>
      <li>No More Pore Effect Refining cream is designed to reduce oily skin and clean pores.  </li>
      <li>The cream feels light and airy and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I simply starting using my old moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>skin use to be oily, but now I noticed it was getting dry as I&#x27;m getting older, which this should have made my face dryer with Salicylic acid in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clear out all the pores but definitely gives my T-zone a smaller and cleaner pore look.  </li>

<li> The other night I looked into a magnified lighted mirror and was very pleasantly surprised by the difference.</li>
<li> The cream is white and has a pudding-like texture that quickly thins when it hits the heat of your skin and spreads thinly.</li>
<li> He has extremely oily skin with white heads and black heads and my skin is very oily in the T-zone area, so I was looking forward to trying it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really help, just use it...</li>
<li> Overall, this is a thick cream that smells strongy of tea tree oil, has a non-greasy finish, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my pore size.  </li>
<li> THe only other option was CLinique and quite frankly, I&#x27;d rather use something from my local pharmacy than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Thick, creamy cream and very luxurious container.  </li>
<li> I personally think it is fainter than other tea tree oil products I have used, and I do not mind it.</li>
<li> and I would be wary to try any other products by them because of the strong chemical smell of their products.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if continuous use of this No More Pore cream eliminated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However, I am not sure if it is just my sensitive skin</li>
<li> The bottle is really big and a little each application goes a long way.  </li>
<li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores seem to be opening up, definitely not a good thing.  </li>
<li> The major difference between this and less expensive products is probably the base, which is extremely smooth and easy</li>
<li> A few months after getting back from vacation, I ran out of my \\&quot;cruise\\&quot; supply.</li>
<li> I hope to report back after another few weeks -- and I need to decide whether to buy one of these or not once I run out of the sample sent to me by Amazon Vine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using the product for the past 2-3 weeks nightly and within the first week of using, I can already see the results - smaller and more refined pores. I have really huge pores on my nose and the results were very visible. The bottle is really big and a little each application goes a long way.  The smell is not strong as what some people had mention - at least it doesnt bother me at all. I have acne skin  and this product seems to be able to control outbreak as well - it gives me smoother complexion and I have zero breakout. Overall I am glad I have invested in a good pore refining cream that actually does work.</li>
    <li> dr. brandt&#x27;s Pores No More Pore Effect Refining cream is designed to reduce oily skin and clean pores.  On the whole it actually works rather well in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is housed in an attractive container.  The cream is white and has a pudding-like texture that quickly thins when it hits the heat of your skin and spreads thinly. Very little cream goes a long way--my 14-year-old daughter and I used this together on a daily basis and the container is still mostly full and will likely last 3 to 4 months.  The cream does have an astringent smell to it--most likely because of the tea tree oil--but it&#x27;s not too bad once it is spread over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients are likely the salicylic acid and tea tree oil, ingredients that you can certainly find in other products.  The major difference between this and less expensive products is probably the base, which is extremely smooth and easy to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream definitely reduced the oiliness of my skin and did so without causing excessive dryness or any irritation.  Although not touted as an &#x27;acne cream,&#x27; my daughter hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts from her acne since using the cream and is incredibly satisfied with it.  As to making pores disappear, neither my daughter or I noticed any decrease in pore size (but certainly our pores didn&#x27;t get bigger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its present price it does seem costly, but it really goes a long way--if it lasts four or five months when used by one person it is probably inexpensive compared to lesser creams that have to be used in larger quantities for adequate coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this is a product that delivers on its promises. As to a product endorsement, once we are done with the sample my daughter wants me to buy her more.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 3 weeks. The non-greasy cream is easy to apply and feels smooth and soothing on my face. I&#x27;ve already had problems with pores, and my skin is on the oily side. So far I&#x27;ve seen some positive effect in cleaning up some of my pores, but the jury is still out on whether it&#x27;ll work on the more stubborn ones -- I&#x27;ve never found a product that works consistently in the long run.  I hope to report back after another few weeks -- and I need to decide whether to buy one of these or not once I run out of the sample sent to me by Amazon Vine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sick of companies charging an arm and leg for products that irritate your face and put several crap ingredients in them.</li>
    <li> I was in the store saying to my friend \\&quot;I need makeup that will control my shine\\&quot; and just so happened to wander into the skincare section while saying that... when an esthetician overheard me and recommended Pores No More&#x27;s Pore Refiner. But then I saw the kit that included this, and boy am I glad I did!  The pore refiner is awesome in its own right (glides on magically), but this Refining Cream is the winner!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a Biore strip posterchild, but now you can run your fingers across my T-zone/nose/chin and feel nothing but smoothness &#x3D;) A whitehead DARED to form on my chin one day, but the Refining Cream resisted it, and caused the whitehead to harden and be pushed out before it could even attach to a pore! ;) Sorry if this is TMI, haha</li>
    <li> Me and my son both used this cream. He has extremely oily skin with white heads and black heads and my skin is very oily in the T-zone area, so I was looking forward to trying it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both used the cream for almost two weeks and while I couldn&#x27;t really see a big difference on my face my son&#x27;s cleared up in some area&#x27;s but in others he was really irritated.  He was not using anything else on his face, but this cream, so it had to be the cause.  Since the irritation we have stopped using.  All other reviews are mostly fantastic so I think if you don&#x27;t have acne just oiliness it should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Brandt has an excellent reputation so it is probably worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for almost a month now and I have noticed a difference in pore size. I dpn&#x27;t have huge pores to begin with, but the area on my nose and chin is sometimes a problem. The other night I looked into a magnified lighted mirror and was very pleasantly surprised by the difference. The skin was tighter and the pores much smaller and not clogged at all. I have also been exfoliating more faithfully this month so I&#x27;m sure that helped too.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint i have about this product and its a big one, is the smell. It is awful... Really awful, almost indescribable. It smells like something that shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near a persons face. I have to hold my breath when i put it on. Luckily the odor dissipates quickly but because of this, there is no way I can stick with this product for much longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had large pores on my cheeks near the sides of my nose. I&#x27;ve used cosmetics that go under foundation to fill in the pores, but when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup they&#x27;re noticable. I&#x27;ve been using the Pore Effect cream for 3 weeks, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a size decrease. My skin is softer too. I see Dr. Brandt has a whole Pores No More line that I plan on researching and trying in conjunction with this cream. This stuff didn&#x27;t make me break out like 1 or 2 creams in the past have and it works, so I couldn&#x27;t not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Every time I am nearly running out, I think, I don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this cream. And once or twice I&#x27;ve tried something else. This really is worth it, and is probably the single most important part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence if this does anything !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin use to be oily, but now I noticed it was getting dry as I&#x27;m getting older, which this should have made my face dryer with Salicylic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it made it more oily, much to my surprise, although I like that it did..I have used it for about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information that came with this does not say if you should use moisturizer over it, and there is not much info at all to speak of !&lt;br /&gt;Although it say&#x27;s to use more of there product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few times, I started using my moisturizing cream, over pores no more. I just notice&lt;br /&gt;my face feels smoother.&lt;br /&gt; I did have a white head under my skin by my nose. I was amazed that it came to the surface and is now gone!&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to make an appointment with my Dermatologist, now I do not have too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still cannot say if this is helping my pores! For the money I think I should notice something more happening to my pores after two weeks.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This jar should last quite awhile. You do not have to use much..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found the ingredients on the bottom of the box!&lt;br /&gt;The good ingred. that are mentioned, are at the end..There are Ingred. I have never heard of, but I&#x27;m sure there all chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid is the second to last ingred, although it is mentioned on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I notice my pores are getting smaller, I will update this review.</li>
    <li> I discover Dr. Brandt&#x27;s line of skin care while on a cruise this past summer. I forgot my moisturizer at home and needed a night cream and a cleanser so I got the Dr. Brandt line.  THe only other option was CLinique and quite frankly, I&#x27;d rather use something from my local pharmacy than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the refining cream.  The cleanswer was great too.  A few months after getting back from vacation, I ran out of my \\&quot;cruise\\&quot; supply. I simply starting using my old moisturizer.  Within a week or so, my skin looked AWFUL.  I can&#x27;t explain it - just not \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. Was it stress?  the food? What?  I realized I had ran out of DR.B. Product.  I just ordered another supply of this and can&#x27;t wait to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I also use the Dr. B. TIme Arrest Laser Tight.  I lOVE this stuff. You won&#x27;t see results overnight but  if you are consistent, you will like what you see.</li>
    <li> It irritated my skin and caused huge flare ups. If you have even slightly sensitive skin (my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive) don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Cream works fairly well.  Doesn&#x27;t clear out all the pores but definitely gives my T-zone a smaller and cleaner pore look.  Kind of exacerbates the oily skin though.  I have to blot the areas with cream during the day.  Pleasant eucalyptus scent.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a thick cream that smells strongy of tea tree oil, has a non-greasy finish, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my pore size.  I use it nightly, and every other day I use a salicylic acid scrub.  I can&#x27;t say my pores seem any different since adding in this cream 3 weeks ago, but it has a nice finish and seems to keep my skin moisturized without causing acne, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone  At $45 a jar, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase more, but that may change when I look for an alternative when it&#x27;s gone.  In the past, I used whatever I came across, if anything, as my skin is naturally fairly oily in the T zone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and while I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference in my pores I do like the cream.  It seems rather heavy at first but goes on smoothly and absorbed very quickly into my skin.  There is a rather strong odor of tea tree oil which doesn&#x27;t bother me bit and I like knowing that I am getting the benefits of it on my skin; if you are unfamiliar with this odor and want something light and perfume-y this odor might be off-putting.  I have found that with the colder weather setting in that there are some dry spots on my face that need a second application of this moisturizer but at the end of the day I am pleased with my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and don&#x27;t find it to be extra oily or super dry, which means this moisturizer seems to be doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> This dr. brandt Pores No More Pore Effect Refining Cream comes in a gorgeous blue container with a screw on lid. The cream is white, thick and has a tea tree scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is unfortunately a problem in my household. I personally think it is fainter than other tea tree oil products I have used, and I do not mind it. However, my Husband and my dog do. When I wear it my dog goes crazy and tries to sniff (and possibly lick...) my face. I have to fight him off. At the same time my Husband has a hard time kissing me because he says the smell is strong and awful. I have made them deal with it for the last 2-3 weeks in order to do this review, but I do not think I will be buying this product again because of the scent. If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said; it does work! I have definitely noticed a difference in my pores. I have particularly focused on my nose which gets blackheads. They are so much smaller now. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if continuous use of this No More Pore cream eliminated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have oily skin and I am very sensitive about what I have on my face. This cream did not make my skin oily or gross feeling. It actually seemed to have helped with my oil control some. The cream feels light and airy and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this cream. I will not continue to use it because of the scent. If you like the tea tree scent, then I would recommend this pore refining cream.</li>
    <li> Good for oily skin, does help with pore size in the long run.  Thick, creamy cream and very luxurious container.  The only thing is that the smell is a bit annoying.  At first it was kind of nice.  It has a citrus tinge to the smell, but there is that chemical odor too in there.  It didn&#x27;t bother me too much at first, but when I got pregnant, I had to stop using it.  It helps if I just don&#x27;t apply it around my nose, but I worry about what my nose is telling me.  I had issues with the smell of other products by this company and I would be wary to try any other products by them because of the strong chemical smell of their products.</li>
    <li> I liked this cream as a general moisturizing product, and I could also see that it has some impact on my pores.  However, I am not sure if it is just my sensitive skin or if it is a side effect of the pore reducing, but I had some problems with breakouts when I used it.  I will have to use it longer to really see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really help, just use it...</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer it made my face dewy.  However, I have big pores, this did not reduce their size, and unfortunately shortly before my wedding (I know, don&#x27;t try something new before you get married) my face broke out with large cystic acne.  It was not stress related, my wedding was a second wedding and destination wedding were everything was paid for and in place.  The acne is large and has not reduced since the wedding over a week ago.  I&#x27;m not terribly pleased, since at 34 I should bed done with major blemish acne.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product to help improve cell turnover and prevent breakouts.  It does contain salicylic acid, which is good for preventing blackheads.  I found the product a nice creamy consistency.  My only complaint is that I found it a bit drying on my combination skin.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores seem to be opening up, definitely not a good thing.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about two months and about a month into using it I noticed that the pores on my nose and cheeks had actually begun to look smaller.  I am SO getting more of this!  To be fair, I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with another dr. brandt product - [[ASIN:B008B0S8L4 Blemishes No More Daily Exfoliating Cleanser]], so I think the one-two punch of this cream along with an exfoliant is the ticket - I just don&#x27;t necessarily think that it requires a dr. brandt ($$$) exfoliant, but any good exfoliant along with this cream would probably do just as good of a job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item. it been almost decade. Quality is the same and nothing change. Love this !!!!</li>
    <li> As someone with acne, I&#x27;ve used many products with salicylic acid over the years. Most are fine. This, however, is a thick paste that emits noxious fumes. I would not recommend putting this on your face, except perhaps in tiny quantities as a spot treatment.</li>
