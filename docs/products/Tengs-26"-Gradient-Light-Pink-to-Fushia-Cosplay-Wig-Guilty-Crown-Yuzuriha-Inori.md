      <li>If that doesn&#x27;t work I guess I&#x27;ll get my own wig cap to sew the wefts too</li>
      <li>, when I was brushing the wig with my nice wig brush</li>
      <li>This wig isn&#x27;t the best (if you&#x27;re looking for high quality).</li>
      <li>The hair also falls out very easily.</li>
      <li>Though some edits are needed, it&#x60;s a fantastic wig that fits perfectly and feels like real hair!</li>
      <li>First of all , it came two day b4 the estimate delivery time,its very nice quality and about the colors, instead of fushia</li>
      <li>This wig is sooo cute.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll be cute if i wear a hat on top</li>
      <li>I was pleased.</li>
      <li>Stunning</li>
      <li>This is way better than hacking/</li>
      <li>Besides that I love the wig</li>
      <li>But for the price I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a wig that sheds more than the one I got when I ordered this.</li>
      <li>and I am sure I could construct a better wig myself.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Such a perfect wig and length!</li>
      <li>The bottom of the wig is actually bright red which I didn&#x27;t expect, but its such amazing quality at a great price!</li>
      <li>and it does not get tangled easy</li>
      <li>and so so so so easy to brush it is the easyest i have found yet</li>
      <li>It falls apart easily</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much nicer and very cute when on.</li>
      <li>First off its a nice length</li>
      <li>I will enjoy wearing this to the con in June.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for it to look real and be amazing then you need to examine your head.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping from China was a bonus!!!</li>
      <li>I gave 4 stars because I voiced my unhappiness with the product and they were willing and able to rectify the situation.</li>
      <li>However It is very soft though and feels really nice.</li>
      <li>It is so soft and I got so many compliments!  </li>
      <li>for a bright color cheap wig its surprisingly thick and great texture, i had to trim the bangs but people always think its my real hair when i wear it.</li>
      <li>SELLER please post pictures that a true to your product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wig that came was not ugly...</li>
      <li>I tried on the wig, I noticed there wasn&#x27;t much of a &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; its more like it was placed by layers and not even a fade.</li>
      <li>its gorgeous, i hope for next time i get the product i see in the pic though!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS, FIND A WIG THAT IS TRUELY REPRESENTED IN THE PICTURES.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad wig just...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and easy to maintain and you are able to style to your liking</li>
      <li>, the hair itself is very pretty</li>
      <li>It is just white with a very bright red underneath.</li>
      <li>If you plan to cosplay as Inori this wig if perfect, but you need to dye the white part pink...</li>
      <li>( I own multiple wigs I can understand).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>I received the wig quickly, and the quality is very nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x60;s my first cosplay, so I was conflicted about wig choices.</li>
      <li>I have lots of wigs and this is the first time that I have been this dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>okay so the wig is a bit different than the pic .. but</li>
      <li>it was white on the top really shiny layers everywhere</li>
      <li>highly recommend for a fun party or burner party.</li>
      <li>The style wasn&#x60;t entirely like the photo, either, but it&#x60;s an easy fix~</li>
      <li>its similar and is perfectly fine if your doing the cosplay.</li>
      <li>light pink mixed into the top layer.</li>
      <li>i really really like it</li>
      <li>the color is very pretty, and the hair is soft, but its extremely shiny and you can see the cap on top.</li>
      <li>coloring your real hair ladies</li>
      <li>the top is a very pastel pink it gets darker at the tips..</li>
      <li>I was so excited for this wig to arrive and when I initially took it out</li>
      <li>The quality of the hair fiber is super soft, I&#x27;ve never had a wig feel so soft before it literally feels like doves feature</li>
      <li>The top of the wig was white and the bottom of the wig was red.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s super different from the stock photo.</li>
      <li>It looks decent with a hat on.</li>
      <li>it is more like a red wine, it doesnt have that much light pink in it, and white only at the top , but overall i luv it !</li>
      <li>I expected some cheap Halloween wig you get at walmart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all light pink with a purplish layer underneath.</li>
      <li>So even though the quality kind of sucks</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really bother with it its long and pretty in the picture and the wig they sent me was nothing like it</li>
      <li>Just know that when you buy this, you won&#x27;t get the exact wig pictured, you may get something in the same color family but it won&#x27;t look like this.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit right on my head no matter how long I fuss with it.</li>
      <li>the colors are a littttle off the top is very very bright, like seriously its so light pink its like white.....and kinda thin,,, so i wear  the wig with some extensions and leave my bangs down</li>
      <li>, besides all the negative factors of this wig it is still very stunning and it will definitely turn heads.</li>
      <li>As people have said, the colors are not exactly as they appear in the photo - but they are not ugly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not going to look natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the coloring isn&#x27;t a gradient, it&#x27;s white top layers and dark red bottom layers, and is the curly wig type you see all over amazon.</li>
      <li>The top layer of the wig is white, and the under layer is a dark burnt red color.</li>
      <li>The image is very misleading and does not have a pink ombre as seen in the image.</li>
      <li>but there is no pink in it at all.</li>
      <li>I then had them check my other wig and got the exact same story.</li>
      <li>The color I love but the layering is HORRIBLE, especially at the top it&#x27;s not blended at all, and it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just white with a hot pink ish red...</li>

    <li> This wig has alot of bad things as well as good things.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the good. First off its a nice length and the hair is great quality. ( I own multiple wigs I can understand).&lt;br /&gt;Then the estimated rate for when it was sopose to be delivered was June 6th but yet I got it on May 21st. This can be either good or bad I guess because if it would of came later then it would be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flaws&lt;br /&gt;When I tried on the wig, I noticed there wasn&#x27;t much of a &amp;#34;fade&amp;#34; its more like it was placed by layers and not even a fade. its &amp;#34;blocky&amp;#34; with the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Then, when I was brushing the wig with my nice wig brush I have (its only used for wigs). A chunk of the hair came out! I was shocked. This has never ever happened to me in ordering a wig. This is why I have gave it 3 stars. I still like it, but if it sheds again, I might just contact the company.</li>
    <li> It is so soft and I got so many compliments!  The colors are lighter than what appear on the picture but it is a great wig!</li>
    <li> The colors for this wig are bright and wonderful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig in the beginning on July two weeks later i got it ofcourse bc it came all the way from Hong Kong. Im totally happy with my purchase it&#x27;s so long the colors are beautiful the top is a very pastel pink it gets darker at the tips.. it gives it that ombre feel.. Its very thick not thin. It doesn&#x27;t look nor feel fake. Only thing the cap is so small. Other than that im very satisfied..</li>
    <li> I loved it! Such a perfect wig and length! I will enjoy wearing this to the con in June. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Used this at an arts festival, got many compliments, mostly people telling me what a great hair colorist I had. It&#x27;s not a big fluffy fake looking wig, it lies close to your head and looks amazing, and real. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> First of all , it came two day b4 the estimate delivery time,its very nice quality and about the colors, instead of fushia it is more like a red wine, it doesnt have that much light pink in it, and white only at the top , but overall i luv it ! its gorgeous, i hope for next time i get the product i see in the pic though!!!!</li>
    <li> The bottom of the wig is actually bright red which I didn&#x27;t expect, but its such amazing quality at a great price!</li>
    <li> Great wig but was NOT at ALL the colors presented in the picture. It came out red and white</li>
    <li> This wig is so thin, but its mainly thin on the top wear its important for it to be thick. the color is very pretty, and the hair is soft, but its extremely shiny and you can see the cap on top. it&#x27;ll be cute if i wear a hat on top i suppose, but i could wear it by itself.</li>
    <li> Well, I expected a darker color at the tips just a hot pink. That is a bit disappointing besides that cute wig!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for it to look real and be amazing then you need to examine your head. It&#x27;s $13 it&#x27;s not going to look natural. But for the price I LOVE it. I expected some cheap Halloween wig you get at walmart. It&#x27;s much nicer and very cute when on. I&#x27;m defiantly purchasing another.</li>
    <li> we didnt recieve the wig we ordered.  we got the wrong color. the quality of the wig seems good. but very disappointed at receivong wrong item.</li>
    <li> The wig comes a bit different than in the picture and the cap was too small for my head. I gave 4 stars because I voiced my unhappiness with the product and they were willing and able to rectify the situation. 4 stars for awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> the one that I received the crown was very thin other than that it is way nice i had to trim the bangs cause they were way long... i also bought a brown wig so i put it on top of this one and it looks great with them together.... if i want to wear this by itself then I have to wear a hat cause it is sooo thin.</li>
    <li> This wig isn&#x27;t the best (if you&#x27;re looking for high quality). The quality and the coloring is all wrong. It&#x27;s suppose to fade from white to dark pink like in the picture but it&#x27;s not even close. The pink is a dark raspberry wine red and it doesn&#x27;t fade at all, the white in it is just on the top and streaking down over the wine colored part. the quality is bad, the hair falls out real easily and the scalp of the wig is visible because it is very thin so I have to wear a hat over it to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;But, besides all the negative factors of this wig it is still very stunning and it will definitely turn heads. The quality of the hair fiber is super soft, I&#x27;ve never had a wig feel so soft before it literally feels like doves feature if you know what that feels like. So even though the quality kind of sucks I still love the wig and the way it looks even if it is wrong.</li>
    <li> fits well, looks good, and my daughter has received lots of compliments from her friends.  This is way better than hacking/coloring your real hair ladies/girls.  Fast shipping from China was a bonus!!!</li>
    <li> The colors were nothing like the picture, it was basically a white bob with orangy pinky long ends beneath it, not impressed</li>
    <li> The wig will come completely different from the photo. Don&#x27;t order. There is no pink or fuchsia just white and red and it looks horrible.</li>
    <li> I just finished watching guilty crown a while ago so I wanted to cosplay as inori I bought the dress and wig but the wig came in a really different color it was a waste of money so I recommend not to buy it.</li>
    <li> Ok so it arrived wayyy sooner than it said, which was awesome! the colors are a littttle off the top is very very bright, like seriously its so light pink its like white.....and kinda thin,,, so i wear  the wig with some extensions and leave my bangs down and then it just looks like i have some bangin hair, i wore a beanie with it and a few people thought it was my actual hair! so as love as you cover the top your good!</li>
    <li> okay so the wig is a bit different than the pic .. but its similar and is perfectly fine if your doing the cosplay. i really really like it</li>
    <li> I read the reviews knowing it&#x27;s not like the picture at all but I was at least hoping the top would be pink but it&#x27;s just white with a hot pink ish red... If you plan to cosplay as Inori this wig if perfect, but you need to dye the white part pink... Besides that I love the wig</li>
    <li> As people have said, the colors are not exactly as they appear in the photo - but they are not ugly. However, the wig did not fit my head (maybe I have a big head?) and stuck out unless I wore a hat with it. With a hat on, the wig looks great and fits nicely. You just have to play around with it a bit.</li>
    <li> for a bright color cheap wig its surprisingly thick and great texture, i had to trim the bangs but people always think its my real hair when i wear it. highly recommend for a fun party or burner party. or just because.</li>
    <li> It was not the samr colot as the picture&lt;br /&gt;I tired to contact the dellrts got nothing back&lt;br /&gt;Im not happy</li>
    <li> The wig I received was red rather than fushia, and shorter.</li>
    <li> The one I got looks nothing like the picture. Instead of a gradient, I got a dark pink wig with white bangs and some streaks of light pink mixed into the top layer. It wasn&#x27;t bad or ugly, it just isn&#x27;t what I was expecting when I purchased this. Just know that when you buy this, you won&#x27;t get the exact wig pictured, you may get something in the same color family but it won&#x27;t look like this.</li>
    <li> The wig I received not only has a different hair cut than in the image but there is no pink in it at all. It is just white with a very bright red underneath. The image is very misleading and does not have a pink ombre as seen in the image.</li>
    <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t look like the pic, it doesn&#x27;t have the same colors. It falls apart easily and I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. It&#x27;s thin and you can see the wig cap in the front. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Wig colors did not match the photo. The top of the wig was white and the bottom of the wig was red. There was no gradient at all. It is also quite thin and you can see the mesh cap underneath the hair when you wear it. The hair also falls out very easily. However It is very soft though and feels really nice. It also did not come with the pouch, but came with a wig cap and temporary tattoo instead.</li>
    <li> Albit the coloring was a bit off, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from the beauty of the wig itself. It&#x27;s perfect for my cosplay and i get many wonderful comments about it. Well put together and the hair strands don&#x27;t fall out. Stunning</li>
    <li> Great wig, was way better than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I love this wig will deff be buying more!!! It&#x27;s soft and easy to maintain and you are able to style to your liking</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this wig to arrive and when I initially took it out I was pleased. Then I tried to put it on... the wig cap itself is very small. My hair isn&#x27;t even shoulder length and I had a problem getting it on (my head isn&#x27;t that big either) It doesn&#x27;t sit right on my head no matter how long I fuss with it. The bangs are horrible and hard to work with. The color I love but the layering is HORRIBLE, especially at the top it&#x27;s not blended at all, and it&#x27;s very noticeable. I have lots of wigs and this is the first time that I have been this dissatisfied. I am hoping that I can fix the layering and the bangs and if all else fails I&#x27;ll try it with a hat. If that doesn&#x27;t work I guess I&#x27;ll get my own wig cap to sew the wefts too, the hair itself is very pretty and I am sure I could construct a better wig myself. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with my purchase. I ordered a wig with a light pink to fuchsia gradient, but the wig I received was white with a dark red under layer. Do not buy from this seller, you will not get what you order. The wig I received, besides being the wrong colors, is also party store quality; you could buy it at your local Party City. I&#x27;ve never had a wig that sheds more than the one I got when I ordered this.</li>
    <li> very nice color degradation is minutes to the character</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for an anime convention. It&#x60;s my first cosplay, so I was conflicted about wig choices. Once I got it, I was a little displeased with the color, because it had two very sudden changes from white to pink, then pink to red. The style wasn&#x60;t entirely like the photo, either, but it&#x60;s an easy fix~ Though some edits are needed, it&#x60;s a fantastic wig that fits perfectly and feels like real hair!</li>
    <li> Ordered this wig at the same time as other woman in my office...for a party. They all received theirs 2-3 weeks later. After not receiving mine, along with the other I ordered for my sister, I get an email stating they lost my wig and it was now out of stock. I then had them check my other wig and got the exact same story. I will never order from them again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wig thinking it would look like the picture. It was not. The top layer of the wig is white, and the under layer is a dark burnt red color. Sent the wig back, was not happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> The picture does not match the colors at all. The cap shows through at the top, very thin hair up there. It looks decent with a hat on.</li>
    <li> I received the wig quickly, and the quality is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;However, the coloring isn&#x27;t a gradient, it&#x27;s white top layers and dark red bottom layers, and is the curly wig type you see all over amazon.</li>
    <li> The wig that came was not ugly... but it does not have the gradient look... It&#x27;s all light pink with a purplish layer underneath. Not unsatisfied in general but the picture is not true to the actual product. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So I came back to add to my review because I am seriously unhappy with the amount of money I spent for a wig that is just light pink all around.... SELLER please post pictures that a true to your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS, FIND A WIG THAT IS TRUELY REPRESENTED IN THE PICTURES. Wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> The wig itself is very nice but it&#x27;s super different from the stock photo. First of all, it&#x27;s much longer (which I guess is good for styling), instead of 33% pale pink 33% pink and 33% magenta, the colors are: 70% pale pink, 10% pink, &amp; 20% magenta. It&#x27;s not a bad wig just...not what I was expecting...</li>
    <li> This wig is sooo cute. And it looks sooo realy an i like how it is heat resistant and so so so so easy to brush it is the easyest i have found yet and it does not get tangled easy</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really bother with it its long and pretty in the picture and the wig they sent me was nothing like it it was white on the top really shiny layers everywhere which i dont it in a wig so i was really disappointed</li>
    <li> The color looks nothing like the picture. The bottom layer is red rather than magenta/dark pink.</li>
