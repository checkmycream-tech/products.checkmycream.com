      <li>You want to make a product like this nice to use</li>
      <li>I really liked it, and it kept my teeth from staining.</li>
      <li>It was nice to think that I was adding another dose of flouride into my mouth, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better yet, it is alcohol free, tastes great and has fluoride to build up teeth and prevent them from getting plaque.  </li>
      <li>It seems very strong too.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
      <li>but i love it! :)</li>
      <li>I read a review of whiting products on the internet and this was one of them that offered the best choice for me, since I have sensitive teeth already.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
      <li>Not my favorite stuff</li>
      <li>Best mouthwash you can buy, my teeth have become much more white after using this product, now when I buy I buy 3 at a time</li>
      <li>the mouth wash most of the time.  </li>
      <li>That gives the whiteners a bit more time to work on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>and I have a winning combo.</li>
      <li>I drink alot of tea and it helps whiten my teeth and is refreshing after meals when I can&#x27;t brush</li>
      <li>And even thought the Crest bottle matches my décor better</li>
      <li>, I love the funky look of this bottle.  </li>
      <li>I dilute it with a bit of water to make it more palatable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I read an article listing this as the top tooth whitener out there.</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars, thinking that it may work better for others.</li>
      <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t have the mouth of a chain-smoker I was still expecting more of an improvement.</li>
      <li>love it&lt;br /&gt;fast</li>
      <li>So glad I gave it a shot.</li>
      <li>but this is definitely the most impressive of all the products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I love this mouthwash, and use it every day.  </li>
      <li>I think this may help with brightening the teeth even more that peroxide alone, so I may get some more soon.</li>
      <li>I will finish using the bottle, but unless I see better results, I won&#x27;t be using this mouthwash again.</li>
      <li>I was offered to try a bottle of this the timing could not be better.</li>
      <li>Be sure to swish it around for the time noted.</li>
      <li>love the look of the bottle and the simplicity of the packaging.</li>
      <li>I am really glad i purchased this product</li>
      <li>I mostly use it once a day when time permits.</li>
      <li>The aftertaste is undeniably minty with a back note of, uh, saltiness, is the best way to describe it i guess.</li>
      <li>Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash is easy to use, cost effective at the current price and it tastes good and leaves a pleasant aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>Rembrandt mouthwash is flat out the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I refuse to give up my beloved vices, so I decided to try Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash daily after reading good reviews.</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t that when mouthwash is most important?</li>
      <li>Gotta willing to take the pain in order to achieve something better!</li>
      <li>Use crest 3D toothpaste for true results!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.  </li>
      <li>Regarding taste - not too strong and not objectionable.  </li>
      <li>and it is not too strong, but there is no doubt it has some power when you use it.  </li>
      <li>Having worked with peroxide at my job for wildlife rehabilitation, I can testify firsthand at the AMAZING whitening affects of peroxide (granted, all my experience has been with preparing animal skulls and bones for educational presentation, but as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware, teeth are bones :)</li>
      <li>So, this mouth wash is fine to use, has flouride, and</li>
      <li>and i love that i&#x27;m getting results so quickly.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my teeth were whiter after the very first use!</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t testify to the whitening ability of this stuff; my teeth are in great shape already, and I only used this for a week.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a whitening alcohal free mouth wash</li>
      <li>Adding fluoride is important to my family as we have well water</li>
      <li>This mouthwash has hydrogen peroxide although label does not tell you the precise amount; and it is alcohol free.    </li>
      <li>This whitening mouthwash works great for getting teeth white.  </li>
      <li>Various iterations of Listerine, Scope and Biotene were ok, but not as good as this stuff.  </li>
      <li>With some studies reporting higher incidence of oral cancer with alcohol containing mouth washes, we are seeing a lot more alcohol free mouthwashes on the market.</li>
      <li>and i have seen a significant change in the color of my teeth.</li>
      <li>the flavor is a bit overwhelming at first, and the packaging needs to incorporate a measuring cup, otherwise it&#x27;s a convenient way to get fluoride and peroxide in one mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I love this mouthwash always see results in the first week of using it.</li>
      <li>I miss the original mouthwash, that stuff was awesome at making my teeth white, it even got tar and coffee stains completely off.</li>
      <li>Since I brush my teeth more than 2 times, the times I do not use the Rembrandt I use a regular mouthwash that leaves my mouth feeling nice and minty.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s good to have it available through Amazon for people without a convenient local source.</li>
      <li>I can smile proudly now showing off white teeth.  </li>
      <li>I know whitening rinses aren&#x27;t the most effective method, but I figured with Rembrandt&#x27;s reputation theirs might be different.</li>
      <li>B001M0NFEK Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse, Clean Mint, 32 fl oz (1 quart)</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>This is getting harder to find and am happy</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mint was intense but refreshing in its taste.</li>
      <li>However, it leaves a cool taste in your mouth that lasts a couple of hours.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used the amount directed, 2x daily, and usually only for 20-30 seconds, as opposed to the minute recommended. After using this stuff for only 1 week, I started developing all kinds of problems in my mouth. I had 3 canker sores, 1 little clear bubble thing that filled with water, surrounded by red specks, and 1 place on the inside of each cheek that I thought was a sore, but was actually where the skin had loosened/swollen so much, it was drooping. All these things hurt, and I also had a metallic taste in my mouth that lasted for a couple days after I stopped using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like the perfect storm in my mouth. Aside from the less than occasional canker sore, I have never seen any of these problems before. I have excellent oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t testify to the whitening ability of this stuff; my teeth are in great shape already, and I only used this for a week. But obviously, any whitening potential this has, isn&#x27;t worth the havoc it wreaked in my mouth. I see a lot of 5 star reviews, so I am probably a rare case. But if you choose to use this stuff, keep a close eye on your mouth. If you start noticing irritation, it&#x27;s not a coincidence.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for about a month now, at least twice a day. While I do like it as a general mouthwash, I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any whitening in my teeth. I use it before and after flossing ( I am just weird like that lol) and then at random times during the day when I feel like I need to freshen up some. I think this product would be best marketed as just Mouthwash instead of a Whitening Mouthwash. That is my opinion based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this mouthwash has a sweet mint taste. It makes my mouth feel fresh and and clean without the super harsh \\&quot;burn\\&quot; of Listerine. Rembrandt Whitening does not taste overly medicinal or like alchohol either. I am not sure how to describe the taste other than to say a sweet mint.. there is a certain sweetness to it, but not like a candy type sweetness.</li>
    <li> After using many different teeth whitening products and comparing them to the whitening gel from my dentist, I was somewhat skeptical of trying another tooth whitening product.  This one however was different from the start. I took a picture of my mouth prior to using and after using just two days, morning and evening, I could tell a noticeable difference in how my teeth looked...much less yellow.  Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash is easy to use, cost effective at the current price and it tastes good and leaves a pleasant aftertaste.  I will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> The Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash is a little different than normal mouthwash in that it contains fluoride (to help rebuild your teeth&#x27;s enamel) and hydrogen peroxide (which I imagine kills germs and whitens your teeth a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the Rembrandt you don&#x27;t just swish, spit, and rinse.  In order for the fluoride to bond with your teeth and help restore your enamel you have to swish it around your mouth for a full minute and you can&#x27;t rinse out your mouth with water afterwards.  Indeed, you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything for a half hour after using the Rembrandt.  I was already using ACT fluoride rinse so I was used to that procedure.  The thing about the Rembrandt that took some getting used to was its taste.  It says it&#x27;s \\&quot;Fresh Mint\\&quot; flavored, but it tastes more like straight hydrogen peroxide with a slight after taste of mint.  If you&#x27;re expecting a fresh minty taste you will be disappointed.  Still, the hydrogen peroxide causes a little bit of foaming action, which I actually came to enjoy.  Two more things about the Rembrandt that I found off putting were the fact that it said it was to be used twice daily and that there was no measuring device on the bottle or the cap.  ACT fluoride rinse only has to be used once daily (and it comes in an 18 oz bottle as opposed to 16 oz) and has a convenient measuring device built into the bottle.  The only advantage the Rembrandt has is the fact that it contains hydrogen peroxide, and I know that some dentists recommend their patients&#x27; to rinse with hydrogen peroxide for dental health.  Lastly, the Rembrandt claims to be a whitening mouthwash, but after using it for a month I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... the flavor is a bit overwhelming at first, and the packaging needs to incorporate a measuring cup, otherwise it&#x27;s a convenient way to get fluoride and peroxide in one mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I have used this product to whiten my teeth and after several weeks of consistent use notice a significant whitening of my teeth.  The taste is fresh and minty.  Unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried, it is extremely easy to use - just use like regular mouthwash - but also does not have any after taste.      The product is also very useful for maintaining that freshly polished look that you get after going to the dentist.  I used it immediately after my cleaning and noticed that my fresh polish last much longer than usual.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash mint intensity when compare to Listerine is a lot less intense! You can literally feel the foam reaction (like Soda when poured into an ice cup) inside your mouth when swishing. I am almost done with my 1st bottle and the result is starting to be noticeable!    One bad thing though (not very serious). This stuff, when used twice a day, makes the tip of my tongue turns numb throughout the day. Everything I eat or drink tastes different! Even Aquafina water tastes a little weird. But hey! NO SACRIFICE NO VICTORY! Gotta willing to take the pain in order to achieve something better!</li>
    <li> I started using the Rembrandt mouthwash about a week and a half ago and I have noticed a visible difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Because I smoke and drink coffee, I use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash at least 2 or 3 times a day and I thought I had a decent smile.  Since I&#x27;ve substituted Rembrandt&#x27;s Whitening mouthwash from my regular mouthwash, my teeth really sparkle.  Also, I my breath is fresher without having the mouthwash burning my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have never used Rembrandt before but knew they made toothpaste to make your teeth whiter. I never bought it, but had heard good things about it. That was about some 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was offered to try a bottle of this the timing could not be better. I had already bought another tooth whitening kit but it was one you place in your mouth and a one size fits all. I never used it. I also was at the end of my pregnancy and after looking at pictures throughout the months; my main complaint was my yellow/stained teeth. I have been using this for several weeks now and am actually surprised, it works. I was always told by my Dentist that my stains on the front of my teeth were beyond fixing completely but that I could make them a few shades lighter. This &#x60;mouthwash&#x27; has made them the whitest yet! I am very pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to note that even though it is a mouthwash I do not use it for that purpose. I use it strictly for whitening my teeth. You are supposed to use it twice a day after you brush your teeth, with toothpaste, yes; it reads that on the bottle. I will admit the aftertaste is not pleasant to me; it took some time to get used to. You are not supposed to rinse your mouth after and are not supposed to drink anything for 30 minutes. I like to use it before bedtime. Again the taste to me is nasty. Since I brush my teeth more than 2 times, the times I do not use the Rembrandt I use a regular mouthwash that leaves my mouth feeling nice and minty. Rembrandt does not make my mouth feel minty but again had an aftertaste you have to get used to but is worth it for the white teeth you will have.</li>
    <li> I alternate between this product and a Crest product.  I can&#x27;t tell you that I notice a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth (coffee drinker here ) and I can only hope it prevents cavities. (-: I like the taste. I like the foaminess.  And even thought the Crest bottle matches my décor better, I love the funky look of this bottle.  I will buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor of this mouthwash, and it does not make my mouth dry like alcohol based mouthwashes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mouthwash along with the Rembrandt toothpaste for a month and I do not notice any change in the whiteness of my teeth.  My teeth were not yellow to begin with, but I have never whitened them, so I expected a better effect from Rembrandt.  Also, one of my teeth became sensitive along the gum and this mouthwash causes strong pain, so I stopped using it.  Scope mouthwash does not cause pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> Nothing whitens like Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash w/Fluoride.  My dental hygienist recommended this after my expensive custom made trays didn&#x27;t do a good job and hurt my teeth.  This doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, has a pleasant taste and according to my hygienist, strengthens my teeth as well.  Hard to find.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It not only helps to whiten teeth, it helps freshen breath and kills bacteria.  I gargled with it when I had a sore throat and that did the trick to kill the bacteria.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really foams a lot, which some people might not like.   It doesn&#x27;t taste sweet or heavily flavored, but it leaves your mouth feeling incredibly clean.   The extra whitening is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I received this on 4/25/11 and have been using it twice a day since, it is now 5/6/11 and i have seen a significant change in the color of my teeth. i was a smoker for 20 odd years and recentley quit (10/31/2010) and was looking for a way to whiten my teeth without having to shell out between $500 and $900. This product is amazing and my teeth are whiter and brighter. Just brush your teeth regularly like you always do and then swish about 2 tspns of the Rembrandt in your mouth for about a minute and spit out......do not rinse out with water, i usually spit out about 2 or 3 times since the taste is not that great but its not that bad. I wont drink or eat anything for about 30 minutes like the instructions state and thats it. I am really glad i purchased this product and i wish it works well on everyone as it has for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the taste of this mouth wash no matter if it whitens teeth or not.&lt;br /&gt;It tastes like Listerine &amp; Cepacol in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It has a heavy medicinal flavor&lt;br /&gt;I really dislike the taste so much that I will not use it. It seems very strong too.&lt;br /&gt;Since I stopped using it, I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s whitening properties.</li>
    <li> I have used one bottle rigorously, as directed for a little over a month and have noticed very little if any improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Granted, I don&#x27;t have the mouth of a chain-smoker I was still expecting more of an improvement. I know whitening rinses aren&#x27;t the most effective method, but I figured with Rembrandt&#x27;s reputation theirs might be different. The rinse itself is obviously peroxide-based so it may cause gum and tooth sensitivity for some (didn&#x27;t for me, but I have had peroxide products in the past that did). However, despite it being a peroxide rinse, it does not foam too much nor does it leave an unpleasant taste. The aftertaste is undeniably minty with a back note of, uh, saltiness, is the best way to describe it i guess. For it&#x27;s decent taste and lack of irritation I gave it 3 stars, thinking that it may work better for others.</li>
    <li> I got this mouthwash a month ago. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, following the instructions written in the bottle.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth getting whiter. However, it leaves a cool taste in your mouth that lasts a couple of hours.  I&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t buy it again.. I think that if I use peroxide mixed with water will have the same effect without the aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I started to use this like 6mos. ago,and have found it so wonderful. it does whiten your teeth,and freshen your breath,,I&#x27;d recommend it highly,,    Thank Much,,  Tina</li>
    <li> Check the ingredients in this with the ingredients in Listerine Whitening plus Fluoride Rinse. I was about to purchase this product at my local target due to the excellent reviews here. I was disturbed by the $6.50 cost for only 16oz. I also saw the Listerine which was 32oz for $6.50. I compared the ingredients of the two and realized that they were nearly the same. The same amount of Sodium Fluoride as a teeth strengthening agent and the same hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent. Don&#x27;t overpay simply for the brand and a cleverly marketed bottle. This stuff is simply too expensive.</li>
    <li> I read a review of whiting products on the internet and this was one of them that offered the best choice for me, since I have sensitive teeth already. I bought it as a gift for my mom and tried it. I liked the minty flavor and opted to use it as a mouthwash. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 month and I couldnt really see a difference in my teeth, but my Aunt came in town and out of the blue complimented me on how white my teeth were. I am a tea and cola drinker, so it was nice to know that even though I did not originally purchase this product for myself or as a whitening product, that it is doing what it says it will.  My teeth are not overly sensitive (they remain the same as before my use) and it has brightened my smile.  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a easy way to give your teeth an extra boost towards whitening, without the hassle of strips and other intrusive gimmicks.</li>
    <li> I am not a normal mouthwash user. I am a brush and go kind of person. So when I was offered the chance to try this I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the look of the bottle and the simplicity of the packaging. It is quite a bit larger than I expected. I was disappointed that there was no doser since the instructions suggested a specific amount to use. So I just guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint was intense but refreshing in its taste. I am not a believer of whitening anything and this didn&#x27;t do anything to help the cause. While I appreciate what they say, I have never seen results worthy of repeating. It was nice to think that I was adding another dose of flouride into my mouth, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the instructions, it says to not eat or drink for 30 minutes after, which doesn&#x27;t make this ideal for mornings. Isn&#x27;t that when mouthwash is most important?</li>
    <li> This is a reasonable mouth wash. The hydrogen peroxide white foam leaves a really odd taste in my mouth, and was a bit of an over kill as a mouth cleanser. I didn&#x27;t find the whitening or the fluoride to do too much and I used two bottles religiously as recommended on the bottle.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m generally skeptical when it comes to products that promise teeth whitening.   i downloaded the $5 coupon from the rembrandt website and [well] spent $20 on the 2 hour whitening kit. i think it worked, well.  i have a tooth mask thing that my dentist made specifically for my teeth, and paste i bought from my dentist, and this kit is just the same. as opposed to any other tooth whitening paste or such i have tried, the rembrandt actually tasted like my dentist&#x27;s stuff, for me a clear sign that there must be the same stuff in it.  the mouthwash tastes the same, too, and works. i use it before going to bed. since you&#x27;re not supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after rinsing, that&#x27;s the best time. used it for a few days in a row, at night, and already my teeth look whiter to me.     :-D</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I read the reviews and decided to try it.  I noticed a difference after about a week or two.  It&#x27;s a bit strong, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.  I had a dentist appointment last Friday and even the hygienist noticed a difference in my teeth and she&#x27;s the same one who works on my teeth every time.  I told her about it and she&#x27;s going to mention it to other patients.  If you don&#x27;t want to pay the money for costly whitening, then try this.</li>
    <li> It really is a shame this was reformulated. I miss the original mouthwash, that stuff was awesome at making my teeth white, it even got tar and coffee stains completely off. Once Rembrandt stopped making it I have had a terrible time trying to get my teeth like they once were. This new version is nowhere near as effective. I wont buy it again once it is gone, it just doesnt do much of anything.</li>
    <li> Purportedly, the mouthwash prevents plaque &amp; gingivitis, improves breath, may strengthen teeth if it has floride and may whiten the teeth if it has hydrogen peroxide like this one. With some studies reporting higher incidence of oral cancer with alcohol containing mouth washes, we are seeing a lot more alcohol free mouthwashes on the market. They can also affect the breath analyzer.    Hydrogen peroxide whitens the teeth by bleaching enamel, and with continued use, underlying dentin. This mouthwash has hydrogen peroxide although label does not tell you the precise amount; and it is alcohol free.    If you are looking for a whitening alcohal free mouth wash then this a good choice, albeit expensive than [[ASIN:B00336EUTA Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Fresh Mint, 8-Fluid Ounce( 237-mL) Bottles (Pack of 6)]] or [[ASIN:B001F51QG6 Crest 3D White Whitening Rinse, Fresh Mint, 32 fluid ounces Bottle (Pack of 3) Packaging may Vary]] or the pre brush rinse [[ASIN:B001M0NFEK Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse, Clean Mint, 32 fl oz (1 quart) (Pack of 2)]].    So this mouth wash does it all: prevents gingivitis, fluoride strengthens the teeth and hydrogen peroxide whitens the teeth. And the taste is reasonably good but it is lot more expensive than the competitors, almost double if you calculate per oz.</li>
    <li> Do you have a teaspoon in your bathroom?  I don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s what the instruction asks for. Why not just make a lid with a marker?  This make me feel insecure about the whole product.</li>
    <li> Rembrandt mouthwash is flat out the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.  Various iterations of Listerine, Scope and Biotene were ok, but not as good as this stuff.  After using it for a week, I can tell the difference in both whiteness and enamel strength (well, my Dentist confirmed the latter).  This mouthwash does not burn as bad as Listerine, but works as well at keeping your breath fresh.  Just don&#x27;t eat or drink anything before and after for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> maybe i&#x27;m being over zealous but i have only used it a few times and swear i can already see a difference. it doesn&#x27;t burn or taste bad...it&#x27;s so easy! and i love that i&#x27;m getting results so quickly. i didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon, i got it at wal mart for 6 bucks...but i love it! :)</li>
    <li> I used to use another Rembrandt rinse when I brushed my teeth. I really liked it, and it kept my teeth from staining. When it disappeared from store shelves I was forced to use a different brand. I noticed, and my hygienist noticed, that my teeth weren&#x27;t staying as white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the new Rembrandt rinse came along. It has definitely made a difference. Not only have I noticed the difference, so has my hygienist. So I&#x27;m hooked. (Or re-hooked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula has a sharper taste than the old, and I don&#x27;t like it as well. I dilute it with a bit of water to make it more palatable. When I can I prefer to buy this kind of item locally to save packaging waste. But it&#x27;s good to have it available through Amazon for people without a convenient local source.</li>
    <li> First of all, this stuff has fluoride.  That&#x27;s important to me because the flouride is filtered out of my regular tap water.  I run all my water through a reverse osmosis system having charcoal filters.  So, I&#x27;m safer from pollutants but I don&#x27;t get that flouride benefit anymore.  This mouth wash addresses that shortcoming.    Regarding taste - not too strong and not objectionable.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it tastes good but there&#x27;s no huge need to spit the stuff out.  That gives the whiteners a bit more time to work on my teeth.  At first I found the flavor a bit bothersome.  Not bad, just a certain blandness that had me rinsing out the mouth wash most of the time.  It was never a real problem and I guess I&#x27;m used to the taste now.    As for whitening, hard to tell.  I&#x27;ve been drinking a lot of tea and coffee for decades.  I think it&#x27;s doing something but didn&#x27;t take a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture or anything.  Hence an \\&quot;after\\&quot; comparison doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Oh well.    So, this mouth wash is fine to use, has flouride, and I -think- it&#x27;s doing some whitening.</li>
    <li> The taste was acceptable. You want to make a product like this nice to use but you don&#x27;t want it to taste so good that someone is going to swallow it. If there is added fluoride, sometimes it can be very bitter. Adding fluoride is important to my family as we have well water and I believe that adding fluoride decreases tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products to whiten my teeth (coffee drinker) and they have helped, but it is something you have to keep doing pretty often. I think it foams properly and helps my mouth to be clean and my teeth to be smooth and shiny and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it - get yourself a medicine cup so you can measure it out - if you don&#x27;t use enough it won&#x27;t be effective and if you use too much, it is wasteful. Be sure to swish it around for the time noted. I don&#x27;t understand why they do not include a measuring cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it does not have alcohol in it, it does not have that &#x60;burning&#x27; feel to it. I think this may help with brightening the teeth even more that peroxide alone, so I may get some more soon.</li>
    <li> My teeth were already pretty nice and white, but I&#x27;ve been drinking more coffee since it&#x27;s gotten colder and was paranoid about coffee stains. I bought this after reading about it online someplace. I noticed that my teeth were whiter after the very first use! That&#x27;s impressive. I have used those Crest strips, listerine whitening mouthwash, and various others but this is definitely the most impressive of all the products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> After 2 years of adult braces, my dentist gave me a bleaching gel that I put in a invisilign type mold of my new smile. It really wasn&#x27;t too bad a process, but I would love to never have to do it again! Rembrandt mouthwash feels very similar to the sensation given by the gel that I got from the dentist. The peroxide bubbles near the root of the tooth where I have the most problem with discoloration. I have used it for maintenance for over a month now and have found it to be very gentle and easy to use. Its well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am heavy tea drinker and I do not have $500 for teeth whitening treatment. Whitening strips  etc made my gums sore.    This moulthwash is great.  At first I did not notice much but on a third week I looked in the mirror and I was \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;. Those stubborn yellos stains on the boarder of my teeth and gum line were gone. Nnothing could get rid of those before. My teeth are much whiter. I also feel that it improved my breath and gums seem healthies too.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened a few years ago and I can see that my daily coffee and iced tea habits are affecting my lovely results. I refuse to give up my beloved vices, so I decided to try Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash daily after reading good reviews. I could see some brightening after 3-4 days of daily use, so this is now part of my oral hygiene routine. I&#x27;m getting a little worried about this product being possibly discontinued. My local Walgreens and Target have stopped stocking Rembrandt mouthwash, but at least I&#x27;ll be able to get it here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT REALLY WORKS AND IS NOT AS HARSH AS SOME WHITENERS.  I USE IT ONLY A FEW TIMES A WEEK WHICH DOES THE TRICK.</li>
    <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Nothing special. However, watch out if you buy the three pack. When I received it, I only had three months to finish all of them. Unless you&#x27;re buying it for a whole household, just get one. It&#x27;ll expire before you finish them.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash because it freshens my breath, whitens my teeth and it tastes great! Combined with Rembrandt whitening toothpaste and I have a winning combo.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash you can buy, my teeth have become much more white after using this product, now when I buy I buy 3 at a time and I have invested in their toothpaste which also works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash for about two weeks - twice a day.  Instructions are to brush teeth before using and don&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes afterwards.  Honestly, I see very little difference in my teeth whiteness so far.  Maybe, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough or, maybe I&#x27;m expecting more. It does contain Flouride, so it is good for the teeth.  I don&#x27;t like the taste of this mouthwash.  The peroxide lingers in my mouth along with the foam. I will finish using the bottle, but unless I see better results, I won&#x27;t be using this mouthwash again.</li>
    <li> On my first use of this mouthwash, my teeth felt fresh and clean, but when I ate a hot piece of pizza four hours later, my teeth hurt!  I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, either.  My teeth never hurt.  The whiteness seemed to be the same as whitening toothpaste.  I used it a few more times with the same result.  Thus, I don&#x27;t want to use this because of how my teeth feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have used [[ASIN:B001M0NFEU Listerine]] for as long as I can remember. I have never been happy about the color of my teeth. I may have the occasional latte, but I&#x27;m not a constant coffee drinker, I don&#x27;t drink tea and I have never smoked. My teeth shouldn&#x27;t be the color that they are. But, that&#x27;s how life goes sometimes. I figured why not give Rembrandt a try. It worked fine as a mouthwash, even though I have to admit I found it a little disconcerting that I could not eat for 30 minutes after using the product. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but I didn&#x27;t find much to the whitening aspect of the mouthwash. (See picture)</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has been really helpful in keeping my teeth white.  I am an avid tea drinker, so I have been trying lots of teeth whitening mouth washes throughout the years.  Overall I think this seals the deal, it leaves a great minty flavor after the rinse and the taste is not as bad as some may think.  I have been using this product for 2 months now and I notice a healthier appearance in my teeth.  This will not do miracles for a person with really yellow teeth but it will help out those who are coffee or tea drinkers.  I knocked a star off on my review because of the price and there isn&#x27;t a extra cap included which measures out how much of the mouthwash we need to swish around.  For those who like to be precise, just use the green cap on the bottle and swish around 2 capfuls of mouthwash around for one minute.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like most mouthwashes, but this one is perfect. I&#x27;ve been monitoring the price, hoping that it will go down.</li>
    <li> This is tasty, tho I really wish the old Stain Therapy were readily available, as that stuff was terrific!</li>
    <li> If you use as directed it works like it says!  I found that the stinging when used is temporary and was not irritating enough to prevent me from using twice a day.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really does whiten teeth. My wife has tried toothpaste, other mouth washes, strips, bleaches, etc., but this mouthwash seems to do as good or even better than other options.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and makes a noticeable difference.  I was out of the product for a while and as a coffee drinker I noticed the difference.  Keep up a regime and your teeth will sparkle!!</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash because it is clear AND has fluoride in it AND whitens.  I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why the teeth-whitening products are so heavily promoted and yet they make purple, blue and green mouthwash! My teeth are white but porous and actually have a blue cast if I use blue mouthwash. I can&#x27;t help but think that this dye is staining my teeth and any white fillings that I have. I know I pay a little more for this but, hey, I&#x27;m worth it. I figure I save money by NOT having to buy the teeth-whitening products! Maybe that&#x27;s their intent!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to whiten your teeth, that doesn&#x27;t involve a visit to the dentist, or messy trays or strips, it&#x27;s right here in this 16 ounce bottle of Rembrandt Whitening Mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here&#x27;s how easy it is:  Brush your teeth, then rinse with (approximately) 2 teaspoons of the rinse. (I say approximately, because I don&#x27;t use a teaspoon to measure, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m using a little more than the recommended amount.) Then, wait 30 minutes without eating or drinking. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within several uses, I noticed visible brightening of my teeth.  I expect that continued use will enhance the subtle whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is foamy, and has a SLIGHT hint of peroxide taste, but there is NO burn or sting, and the full minty flavor almost cancels that slight medicinal peroxide flavor. It also contains fluoride to help fight cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible downside to the product that I can see: it&#x27;s pricey for a mouthwash.  Then again, it does a lot more than a plain old mouthwash, so I think it&#x27;s worth the money, and the minimal effort required to brighten your smile.</li>
    <li> Used it every day for a month and nothing noticeable.  I guess if you use it twice a day and NEVER skip a day there&#x27;d be a chance of some difference but not worth it and wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use a non-alcoholic mouthwash, preferably one with hydrogen peroxide.  I experimented with several and ended up with Rembrandt.  I ordered the three bottle pack from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it at the local drug and variety stores.  The taste is absolutely great and it whitens your teeth, too.  The taste is the best I have ever used and it is not too strong, but there is no doubt it has some power when you use it.  I highly recommend it and will have to order another 3 pack soon because my wife and granddaughter have already taken 2 of the bottles.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I struggle to use this, it leaves an awful taste in your mouth and I find I spit it out, then wipe my mouth dry with a towel. Not worth it, cut down on your coffee consumption</li>
    <li> Well I was hesitant to buy this when I was reading reviews of people saying that the other formula was better and then this 0.2% fluoride doesn&#x27;t get the job done.    I used it for less than a week and saw noticable results.    I will continue using this and most likely will order this product again once i&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mouthwash a week ago and already see results. I read about it in an article comparing whiteners. It is hard to find the only stores that I&#x27;ve seen it at is Walgreens and Target which is where I purchased it. I used it twice the first day. I mostly use it once a day when time permits. If I see a difference without using it the twice a day you know it&#x27;s good. The key is to use it the full 60 seconds and not to eat or drink for 30 min. after. It does not burn like I&#x27;ve read in some reviews, I normally use Listerine so compared to that its a breeze. It does leave a nice minty taste in my mouth. My teeth have always been on the white side but over the past couple of years have begun to yellow. Not anymore thanks to Rembrandt. Just on a side note I used their tray whiteners over 5 yrs ago and those also worked wonders. I guess Rembrandt has it down with whitening.</li>
    <li> I read an article listing this as the top tooth whitener out there. I thought I would give it a shot since mouth wash is much easier then those trays. I can say it definitely works and is nice and easy to use - the draw back is that it is very strong. It burns my tongue to the point that I have to spit it out and it makes my mouth water. You are suppose to swish it around for a minute but sometimes it is hard to last the minute. It does cause some sensitivity but that is standard.   I like it, 4 stars just because of the harshness of it but it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> I like the foam and taste of the mouthwash.  It definitely helps with the whitening, as long as you have good teeth you should have no problems.  I have a couple teeth that have worn thinner than my other teeth (not from this), so I have to stop using this mouthwash because it does make those 2 teeth numb.  Otherwise during the times I have used it, it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Unlike a lot of other mouthwashes, your mouth actually feels clean after using this, even if used without brushing for that in a hurry cleaning.</li>
    <li> After using the entire 16 oz. bottle, it is very difficult to say it \\&quot;visibly\\&quot; whitened my teeth.  It may have made my teeth a bit whiter, but it is hard to say for sure.  I have no way to know if it restored any enamel.  When I first started to use it, I did not think it had that \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; taste.  After about the 5th time I used it, the taste did become somewhat pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to get another bottle and give it a second chance.</li>
    <li> Some people really expect too much from this, and when it doesn&#x27;t turn yellow teeth white in a few days they are disappointed.    It does what it says. It has whitening agents and I could tell a noticeable different from first use. Better yet, it is alcohol free, tastes great and has fluoride to build up teeth and prevent them from getting plaque.  Really has everything I would want in a mouthwash all right there.    A product that does what it says it&#x27;ll do and does it well.  No miracles here though, if you want heavy whitening you should buy products solely for teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I got this for a great deal at Target, where they already had the price marked down to $5.74. I had a Manufacterer&#x27;s coupon for $3.00 off, so came away paying only $2.74!     So glad I gave it a shot. I was turned off by how small the bottle is compared to other mouthwashes, but I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Rembrandt, and I needed a whiter smile, so gave it a shot. This stuff tastes great and does what it claims. I love that it&#x27;s cavity-protecting as well as whitening! No, flouride is not good for you, but I&#x27;d rather have it in my mouthwash because the benefits (less or no cavities) surely far outweigh the small dangers. Having worked with peroxide at my job for wildlife rehabilitation, I can testify firsthand at the AMAZING whitening affects of peroxide (granted, all my experience has been with preparing animal skulls and bones for educational presentation, but as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware, teeth are bones :) Anyway, I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase again, and I will probably give other Rembrandt products a shot, as well.</li>
    <li> Works great for me, really gets my teeth white. I use this with the toothpaste and is the ONLY thing that works for me, and I&#x27;ve tried everything,</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I use all Rembrandt products and they have yet to disappoint. I drink a lot of coffee and smoke cigars, and yet my teeth are pearly white. I thank Rembrandt products for that.</li>
    <li> works great, a bit expensive</li>
    <li> Not my favorite stuff</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;would recommend</li>

    <li> I love this mouthwash always see results in the first week of using it. People always ask my secret. I drink coffee (4 cups) a day pretty much and still have very bright, white, smile! Use crest 3D toothpaste for true results!</li>
    <li> This whitening mouthwash works great for getting teeth white.  I have used it for a few weeks and noticed a drastic change in the color of my teeth.  I don&#x27;t smoke but do drink a lot of coffee and this seems to work on those coffee stains.  I can smile proudly now showing off white teeth.  This is getting harder to find and am happy I found it here at Amazon and the price was the cheapest.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash, and use it every day.  It must have some peroxide in it because it does foam a bit when you use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find at my pharmacy, but if you want a product that doesn&#x27;t burn, leave a terrible after taste or change the taste of your food or drink afterwards, this is it!  I drink alot of tea and it helps whiten my teeth and is refreshing after meals when I can&#x27;t brush</li>
