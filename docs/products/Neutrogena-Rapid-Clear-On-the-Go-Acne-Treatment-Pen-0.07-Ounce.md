### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Product best use at night and wash off in morning.  </li>
      <li>and it is the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
      <li>really great invention..</li>
      <li>and it works great...</li>
      <li>This is amazing!</li>
      <li>and a lot of good review for this, i thought maybe it can work, but</li>
      <li>Its best to use right before you go to bed, otherwise it will roll up and you will look like your skin is peeling</li>
      <li>i love this!</li>
      <li>Amazing.    </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve never had to use a lot, since the formula is concentrated and effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work any miracles all on its own, but it seems to be a valuable asset to any good skincare program.    </li>
      <li>Of course the best thing I could do for my skin would be to stop picking, but even if I did that, this product also helps with any zits that naturally crop up.    </li>
      <li>It also leaves a very light film over the skin so people might notice,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;am not gonna to buy it any more.</li>
      <li>I do think that the proactive mask over the pimple at night works better though.</li>
      <li>WANT TO SEND ME ONE MORE TIME WITH NEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
      <li>This product is ok it works sometimes.</li>
      <li>So application-wise, you don&#x27;t have to use your hands to rub the medication on, so it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;sanitary&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Make sure to use it twice a day for better results.</li>
      <li>Better than having nothing at all.</li>
      <li>WOW, I am super impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have found, it works well isn&#x27;t messy and very easy to use and travel</li>
      <li>other wise, my acne stays for weeks!!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and easy to use.</li>
      <li>On a whim, I bought some of this since I saw it was a gel formulation of  2% Salicylic Acid which is rather strong medicine.  </li>
      <li>It works good but not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>this &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; was perfect for use right when you notice a breakout starting.</li>
      <li>I think it works fine</li>
      <li>a good, soothing No-Oil light moisturizer for men&#x27;s skin when he is completely heeled.  </li>
      <li>Overall, a great product to add to your routine for any spot-treatments you may require.</li>
      <li>hopefully this remains available.  </li>
      <li>I love this product; I haven&#x27;t tried other products for comparison, but I am super happy with this one.</li>
      <li>A good design deserves an extra star.</li>
      <li>I find it to be very effective for once-a-day use, but my skin is not very oily, either.</li>
      <li>but I found treating them with the hot water first worked better than piercing the skin which you should NEVER do since that can cause scar.  </li>
      <li>It can sting a bit on freshly-popped pores, but that subsides quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;first used i feel very cool and fast care but secound</li>
      <li>Neutrogena has a CLEAR winner in this product and we&#x27;re off to get some more.  </li>
      <li>Normally those \\&quot;mosquito bites\\&quot; would be full-fledged volcanic zits by next morning, but with the combination of products I&#x27;ve been using, I&#x27;ve woken up with a smooth face.</li>
      <li>it seems to be affective when used at the right time....</li>
      <li>(the first of which contains the 4 hour claim on the front of the box.</li>
      <li>but mine went away after a few which is good cause</li>
      <li>The smell is not strong, which is good, and it&#x27;s a convenient size and design.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought and use this item for a long time and it works like magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone~</li>
      <li>never nt to be without this product again!a regular schedule and make sure we hit any new break outs with the hot water application to kill any bacteria in the hair follicle or skin pore.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, however, I wiped the area clean with alcohol and then I plunged a Q tip in water that measured 150 Degrees F which is just hot enough to kill bacteria lurking inside surface acne.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced as well.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try as it said results in 4 hours, and I was looking for fast results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We will apply the Rapid Clear Gel from the On-The-Go Pen to the areas he tends to break out in on a regular schedule and make sure we hit any new break outs with the hot water application to kill any bacteria in the hair follicle or skin</li>
      <li>much longer USE RESET APPLY DUE WITH MORE TIME</li>
      <li>His scabs did simply dry up and fall off on their on but underneath, they revealed new, healthy skin.  </li>

      <li>have to say that for what most people pay for Anti-Acne emergency treatments, this little Pen is a BARGAIN.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that for what most people pay for Anti-Acne emergency treatments, this little Pen is a BARGAIN.  </li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t get ache pimples, but 2-4 times a year</li>
      <li>Most times if I used it the same day I noticed a breakout, the swelling and redness was very minor and the issue resolved within a day or two.</li>
      <li>I think they market this as being something you can use all day, but I think it would be pretty noticeable in public.</li>
      <li>In fact it&#x27;s larger now, more red, same amount of pain/</li>
      <li>After letting his skin cool back down to normal and having him cleanse his face &amp; neck with an Anti-Acne soothing botanical toner, I made ready with this  </li>
      <li>so I dab a little more on and it definitely helps!</li>
      <li>Neutrogena has a CLEAR winner in this product and we&#x27;re off to get some more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>so catch them early and use it often.  </li>
      <li>(If you&#x27;re at all curious about what other products I use along with this one and the Mia, check my Mia review for more details.)</li>
      <li>Granted, I only get a few pimples now and then, so this is more for spot treatment (not overall acne).</li>
      <li>I pressed the hot Q-tip against the angry red welt about a dozen times, making sure I kept the water up to temperature.  </li>
      <li>And once I find it, oh buddy, you better believe I&#x27;m doing my darndest to clean that bad boy out.     </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hot, but not hot enough to scald and about the same temp as those Zit-Zapper electric pens.  </li>
      <li>If I wake up in the morning with a zit, I spot treat with this pen, and by early evening the zit is almost completely gone, and a lot of the redness has gone down.</li>
      <li>It did dry out the area with repeated use, but that was worth it to me - just add a little extra moisturizer the next day.</li>

<li> after almost 2month, now my acne little bit smaller.</li>

<li> I stand with my nose to the mirror and obsessively look for any pore that appears to be remotely clogged.</li>
<li> i think this rapid clear is not good and not bed.&lt;br</li>
<li> I used this product but there is no results, i just can say that it does not work for me, maybe it works for other.</li>

<li> Generally they then go on to become big angry white-headed zits.</li>
<li> It was a little pricier than other products I have tried, so that is why I deducted one star.</li>
<li> but it does have a slight sting to it when I put it on.</li>
<li> My husband sometimes gets some very angry red welts of adult acne that will not come to a head under the arms of his eye-glasses that trap sweat and can clog pores or lower on his neck from ingrown hair on his beard since his hair is curly.  </li>
<li> USUALLY THESE PRODUCTS DUE AFTER ONE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I get a few pimples now and then.</li>
<li> I put this on and it works after a few hours.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll develop a painful red bump on my face.  </li>
<li> From the pus-showing ones to the painful red bump ones.</li>
<li> Now, with my face, at the very least those spots turn into something resembling a mosquito bite.</li>
<li> Its too bad it is not readily available anymore.</li>
<li> This was what I was looking for and the price wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> I figured if I could just get him not to pick at the painful areas, the acid would help and boy</li>
<li> it was painful and swollen...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> WOW, I am super impressed with this product. Granted, I only get a few pimples now and then, so this is more for spot treatment (not overall acne). If I wake up in the morning with a zit, I spot treat with this pen, and by early evening the zit is almost completely gone, and a lot of the redness has gone down. I love this product; I haven&#x27;t tried other products for comparison, but I am super happy with this one. You don&#x27;t get a lot of product, considering what you pay for it. But I&#x27;ve never had to use a lot, since the formula is concentrated and effective.</li>
    <li> I am a face-picker. There, I said it. I stand with my nose to the mirror and obsessively look for any pore that appears to be remotely clogged. And once I find it, oh buddy, you better believe I&#x27;m doing my darndest to clean that bad boy out.     I know I&#x27;m not alone in this.    Now, with my face, at the very least those spots turn into something resembling a mosquito bite. Generally they then go on to become big angry white-headed zits. I don&#x27;t even have bad skin, it&#x27;s just a terrible habit.    All that being said, this product is one of the things that is helping me with the after-effects my picking routine has. Of course the best thing I could do for my skin would be to stop picking, but even if I did that, this product also helps with any zits that naturally crop up.    After picking at my face and using my [[ASIN:B004BL95HI Clarisonic Mia]], I dab some of this stuff on. It can sting a bit on freshly-popped pores, but that subsides quickly. Normally those \\&quot;mosquito bites\\&quot; would be full-fledged volcanic zits by next morning, but with the combination of products I&#x27;ve been using, I&#x27;ve woken up with a smooth face. Amazing.    My recommendation is to use this before bed. It creates a glossy sheen where you put it, which eventually will flake at the edges and peel off (like when you were a kid and would put Elmer&#x27;s Glue on your hands so you could pick it off). I think they market this as being something you can use all day, but I think it would be pretty noticeable in public. I find it to be very effective for once-a-day use, but my skin is not very oily, either. It&#x27;s oily in some patches and a little bit dry in others, and this product dries out anything it touches, so please be aware of that when you apply it.    ----    Overall, a great product to add to your routine for any spot-treatments you may require. I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work any miracles all on its own, but it seems to be a valuable asset to any good skincare program.

    <li> I have always struggled with Acne (29) and yesterday I started to feel this pimple coming through...it was painful and swollen...I remembered seeing something like this in the store so I stopped in and bought this with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. This works so well and it is the best I have ever used. I put it on at 1:30pm and by 5:30pm you couldn&#x27;t even see where the spot was and today it&#x27;s not even there. I am a big fan!!</li>
    <li> I have occasional breakouts and this product dries up a blemish quickly..in fact, I&#x27;ve had a breakout disappear overnight by using this topical product.  It&#x27;s the best! Reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> My husband sometimes gets some very angry red welts of adult acne that will not come to a head under the arms of his eye-glasses that trap sweat and can clog pores or lower on his neck from ingrown hair on his beard since his hair is curly.  On a whim, I bought some of this since I saw it was a gel formulation of  2% Salicylic Acid which is rather strong medicine.  I figured if I could just get him not to pick at the painful areas, the acid would help and boy did it EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, however, I wiped the area clean with alcohol and then I plunged a Q tip in water that measured 150 Degrees F which is just hot enough to kill bacteria lurking inside surface acne.  I pressed the hot Q-tip against the angry red welt about a dozen times, making sure I kept the water up to temperature.  it&#x27;s hot, but not hot enough to scald and about the same temp as those Zit-Zapper electric pens.  After letting his skin cool back down to normal and having him cleanse his face &amp; neck with an Anti-Acne soothing botanical toner, I made ready with this  On-The-Go pen.  To prevent cross-contamination, I applied the gel to a clean Q-tip swab and then swabbed it over his worst welt that had yet to come to a head and then proceeded to use clean Q-tips for every other minor outbreak.  Some had come to a head but I found treating them with the hot water first worked better than piercing the skin which you should NEVER do since that can cause scar.  Once the bacteria are killed by the heat, the body takes care of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of the heat treatments at night and 3 times a day duabs of the Rapid Clear gel, his face looks almost as if he never had a breakout!  He has NO scarring since he didn&#x27;t pop the acne spots or try do dig at the ones that had yet to come to a head.  The only thing I will need to do is use a good, soothing No-Oil light moisturizer for men&#x27;s skin when he is completely heeled.  We will apply the Rapid Clear Gel from the On-The-Go Pen to the areas he tends to break out in on a regular schedule and make sure we hit any new break outs with the hot water application to kill any bacteria in the hair follicle or skin pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that for what most people pay for Anti-Acne emergency treatments, this little Pen is a BARGAIN.  My husband looked like he had several Honret stings on his face and in less than 24 hours they were hardly noticeable and 2 days afterwards, they are virtually healed completely.  Salicylic Acid is an old, old treatment for Acne but this gel formulation with added botanicals is not at all harsh on the skin.  His scabs did simply dry up and fall off on their on but underneath, they revealed new, healthy skin.  Neutrogena has a CLEAR winner in this product and we&#x27;re off to get some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We never nt to be without this product again!a regular schedule and make sure we hit any new break outs with the hot water application to kill any bacteria in the hair follicle or skin pore.

    <li> I use this at night because it leaves a shiny sticky residue on the areas where you spot it on the acne. It also tends to flake off if you wear it during the day. The applicator is a rubbery slanted pen-tip with a hole where the acne medication comes out. So application-wise, you don&#x27;t have to use your hands to rub the medication on, so it&#x27;s more &amp;#34;sanitary&amp;#34; I guess you could say. A good design deserves an extra star. Also, it takes 2 to 3+ nights on stubborn or deep acne. The smell is not strong, which is good, and it&#x27;s a convenient size and design.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IN THE MONTH ENDING MARCH 03, 2013 AND THOUGHT much longer USE RESET APPLY DUE WITH MORE TIME USUALLY THESE PRODUCTS DUE AFTER ONE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WANT TO SEND ME ONE MORE TIME WITH NEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>

    <li> I used this product when on the go and it is life save. It does make pimple disappear faster. Easy to apply and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on acne that comes up (or when I feel it at work)  I use the heat one - Zeno at home but I don&#x27;t use it at work due to the beeps it makes. Anyways, I bought this when I&#x27;m at work, and I start feeling an acne coming up.  I think it works fine but it does have a slight sting to it when I put it on. It also leaves a very light film over the skin so people might notice,  But it does seem to help as the acne does go away after a few days, rather than the next day as it stated. Maybe for others it does but mine went away after a few which is good cause other wise, my acne stays for weeks!!</li>
    <li> it seems to be affective when used at the right time....so catch them early and use it often.  it does leave a film that tends to peel, so be mindful of that.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t get ache pimples, but 2-4 times a year I&#x27;ll develop a painful red bump on my face.  I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try as it said results in 4 hours, and I was looking for fast results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the box for 3 applications (the first of which contains the 4 hour claim on the front of the box. I had no results, thought the pimple was being stubborn and continued treatment) Still a bump, still red, still pain after 3 treatments. I saw no results. In fact it&#x27;s larger now, more red, same amount of pain/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the concentrated 2% Salicylic Acid might work for some, not for me.  Looks like it&#x27;s back to the store because I&#x27;m going back to sulfur based spot cream.</li>
    <li> I basically look for prevention of acne, rather than going with the big guns. Although every now and then I need something stronger on an embedded skin issue. I Trust Neutrogena&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought and use this item for a long time and it works like magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone~</li>
    <li> I know this products form website. and a lot of good review for this, i thought maybe it can work, but no!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;no any change on my face.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I started using and 2 days later my pimples started drying up. Make sure to use it twice a day for better results. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> i think this rapid clear is not good and not bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first used i feel very cool and fast care but secound used anything change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so after almost 2month, now my acne little bit smaller. not care but not glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think soso</li>
    <li> i love this! expensive for the amount on the pen,but works really good! id wake up the next morning and my acne are all tamed! really great invention.. hope this production dont end.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores, maybe they have discontinued product? This was what I was looking for and the price wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found, it works well isn&#x27;t messy and very easy to use and travel</li>
    <li> This product is ok it works sometimes. Its best to use right before you go to bed, otherwise it will roll up and you will look like your skin is peeling</li>
    <li> hard to find and it works great...hopefully this remains available.  Product best use at night and wash off in morning.  It will cause flaking on area.</li>
