      <li>Use a lot to give your hair that classic wet look.</li>
      <li>Wet hair, apply a little and thoroughly work in...style till you smile!</li>

    <li> Good. It was a gift and was a success. Thank you. Take care. Sincerely and with warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;R. E. K.</li>
    <li> Great product some lettering on container appears to be in German has a slightly different scent than the one I ordered direct from England. The England product has a slight lemon scent while this one has a more neutral scent,&lt;br /&gt;Both are great products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Brylcreem ffor over 15 years now. I like the way it adds bit of luster and adds styling to my hairs at the same time. In colder areas, especially in winter months, its important to use some sort of oily substance to your hairs as it protects your hairs from dry air and stops your hairs and skull to become dry. Brylcreem adds that needed light oiliness to my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over two years now. It helps to strengthen and bring all &#x27;thin hairs&#x27; together to look good.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh material. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 packs of which one is completely broken and gel is spilled all over the package. I had the touch time in cleaning up and everything. worst packing..!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good for the hair.  Only problem is the oil that drips down the forehead after 20 mins of application. LOL&lt;br /&gt;I wish Brylcreem would make it  less oily yet  have that same wet greasy feel.</li>
    <li> A great product! Not as greasy/oily as the American version in the tube, but very pleasant and easy to work with. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll order again due to the long shipping times, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it OR the seller either.</li>
    <li> dry look sucks! I have been using brylcream  for the last 6 decades, real good stuff, not greasy at all, I got my order on time promised and packing in good condition, I would recommend it to everyone.  Nice Guy</li>
    <li> Just how I remember it when I was a kid</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my Father in law, I used to use this one when I was a kid back in the 80&#x27;s and I always like the sleek look!</li>
    <li> Just as I rememembered it. nothing was changed the smell was still there and it does what it say it would do to your hair.</li>
    <li> According to my daughter this is the best cream she had in a while. Just make sure you either get the british or italian version.</li>
    <li> Smells good...a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff. I like it! Wet hair, apply a little and thoroughly work in...style till you smile!</li>

    <li> Perfect.......Thanks!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a man&#x27;s product. Excellent hold and excellent fragrance. Use a lot to give your hair that classic wet look. Use a small amount to make your hair softer and more manageable. I wish I could go back in time and use Brylcreem over some of the crappy hair products I wasted my money on over the years. If you are tired of gels, I&#x27;d say give this product a try.</li>
    <li> It is very pricey for this product including the shipping. However, I have used this all my life and I recommend it.</li>

    <li> the is an excellent product.  it smells great and not greasy.  we love it and will order more.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products. The order took time, but for something like this, I don&#x27;t mind waiting at all. This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering this product, and will be in the future too.</li>
    <li> Super, my dad loved it.</li>
    <li> Brylcreem has been my favorite hair dressing for more years than I care to recall. I have always been very pleased with the results when i use it. I will continue to do so indefinitely!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brand.</li>
    <li> Great brilliantine, my husband really loves it for his long and curly hair to tame them a little bit.</li>
    <li> I believe this is THE best hair Product ever made.  It looks good when properly used.  And it does good for bothe the scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> My dad love it. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found another product I like better than Bylcreem.  Not sticky or greasy.  But in the future I will probably buy Brylcreem in the tubes.  Smaller.  Easier to travel with than in this container.</li>
