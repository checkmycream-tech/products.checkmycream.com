<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband and I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for about eight years.  My hygenist is bored with me now since there&#x27;s not much for her to do when i arrive for my twice-a-year cleaning.  The days of her chipping and scraping around on my teeth are history.  Anyway, after all those years the toothbrush handles finally began to wear...weren&#x27;t holding a charge well anymore.  So, we upgraded to one of the newer models, which ARE even better than the originals.  Then, about three months in, my husbands&#x27; began to sound really loud, and the vibration of the brush wasn&#x27;t right either.  So he called Sonicare customer service, explained what was going on.  They apologized for the problem and said they&#x27;d send a new brush handle right away.  Sure enough, one week later the UPS guy delivered it to our door.  Simple as that.    Wonderful product from a great company.</li>
    <li> As a constant user of the older model, purchased before Sonicare was acquired by Phillips, I was interested to see how different the re-engineered model would seem.  My old one was giving up the ghost:  it was very susceptible to cracking; it cracked from simply falling on its side on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;The 7500 seems improved:  lighter weight, cushioned sides (now I know why), and brush mounting that allows more vigorous, yet gentle seeming movement of the brush.  Worth spending the money.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was pretty happy with my other (less expensive) power toothbrush so when Philips said that the Sonicare moves \\&quot;3 times faster\\&quot; I was skeptical. But a guarantee is a guarantee, plus the angled brush is a smart improvement from older models and the timer is helpful. &lt;br /&gt;To put it simply: you WILL notice a difference the very first time you use a Sonicare. It is amazing how clean truly clean feels. And believe me, healthy teeth and gums are not something you want to take for granted.  Who wants to tempt fate in the dentist&#x27;s chair? Steve&#x27;s advice: if you get what you pay for then the 7500 is worth every single penny. &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and that older (less expensive) power toothbrush? I use it on my dog&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally buy anything marketed with \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; in the name, but I had some extra cash when I saw the top of the line on sale. It seemed too cool to pass up on impulse.  Famous last words. My teeth did feel clean and smooth the week I used it, but they were not any whiter. The sensation seemed brought on by the noisy whir, numbing vibrations, and relatively long 2 minute brushing time. I wasn&#x27;t happy with being locked into buying replacement heads for something that didn&#x27;t really work, so I did some research. Unfortunately, my instincts were dead on. Notwithstanding the pretty lights, beeping noises, luxurious case, and grandiose claims, the simple fact is that conscientious manual brushing is clinically proven to be just as effective. In fact, the only type of powered brush that offers any statistically significant benefit whatsoever over manual is \\&quot;rotational oscillation,\\&quot; NOT so-called \\&quot;sonic.\\&quot; All in all, I&#x27;d say Braun has somewhat less brazen snake-oil salesmen than Philips.</li>
    <li> Wherever you&#x27;ve looked, you&#x27;ve most likely seen very positive reviews on the Sonicare line of products. Well there is a reason. This kind of money for a toothbrush may seem fairly expensive, but trust me, its worth it. After all, your teeth are priceless. The toothbrush itself is very easy to use, but comes with some very useful features. It may take some getting used to for some, but for most, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. It feels like you&#x27;re actually at the dentist everytime you use it (without the pain). You may wonder how just a toothbrush could make your teeth whiter, but it does. To prove it, I started brushing my teeth with Sonicare and within a week I noticed whiter teeth. To be sure, I went back using a regular toothbrush and my teeth weren&#x27;t as white anymore. Now I started using Sonicare again and they keep getting whiter and shinnier all the time. I also tried brushing with a normal toothbrush, then flossing, and food particles would come out all the time. I tried flossing after brushing my teeth with the Sonicare and no matter where I floss nothing would come out, meaning the toothbrush also works very well in removing food from in between the teeth, which is a very good source for bad breath and cavities (I do not recommend that you stop flossing, however). The Sonicare also reaches the very hard to reach areas, such as the very back of the mouth, areas which I couldn&#x27;t reach with other toothbrushes, so you are guaranteed a complete clean. The product feels very good and is very strong as I have dropped it more than once with no damage. EVERYONE should own one of these, so trust me, and everyone else who owns one, BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Wow. After just one use my teeth felt great. Much cleaner than a conventional. Easy to use. Long battery life! Excellent little item. A little heavy on the $$ but well worth it. Also, the heads are a little expensive as well if you want to share it with your partner/spouse or children. A great design. Very, very big difference at the dentist!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Sonicare brush.  After each use, I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist (minus the numbing and drilling, etc.)  I started using it the day I came back from a routine cleaning at the dentist, and two months later, I still don&#x27;t see any plaque.  I have sensitive teeth, but I&#x27;m starting to notice that they&#x27;re not as sensitive as they were before I began using the Sonicare.  It&#x27;s a must-have.  Well worth the seemingly high price tag!</li>
    <li> Before I bought this sonicare, my girlfriend told me it was not a good  idea to buy a 100 dollar toothbrush. However, I bought one toothbrush with two brushheads. Now, both of us enjoy heathy teeth. We use Sonicare with Sensodyne. Moreover, we plan to buy another one for my girlfriend&#x27;s mom as a gift for her birthday.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is FAR inferior to INTERPLAK brand electric toothbrushes with rotating bristles. Get the Interplak toothbrush with the rotating bristles, not the round \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; style head.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My family has used Interplak brand since the 1980&#x27;s and we have had fantastic success - imagine cancelling your curettage appointment and reducing the number of cleaning visits you need...etc. (Don&#x27;t tell my dentist that I don&#x27;t floss - I just use my Interplak!) We tried a Sonicare &amp; were horrified.  These are overpriced and they don&#x27;t leave your teeth with the same clean feeling you get with an Interplak.</li>
    <li> UPDATED on 4/27/05:  My comments about concerns over battery / charging circuit design remain as noted below.  However, in fairness to Sonicare, they have just confirmed that they are replacing my unit without charge (it is roughly 2 years old but they did not require a receipt or clear proof of purchase).  Also important, the new unit will start with a new two year warranty in place.  Based on this, their customer service and responsiveness deserve an extra &#x27;virtual star&#x27; since I cannot revise my initial rating to four stars!    ORIGINAL COMMENTS: If I could break down my &#x27;stars&#x27; into two groups, it would be a 5 Star for brushing effectiveness and a 1 Star for battery / charging circuit design.  Given that most reviews have already sung the praises of the brushing effectiveness to which I generally agree, I will limit my comments to the battery / charging circuit issue.    One reviewer wrote about the excellent customer service they found when their battery died after a short period of time.  That is great news for them.  However, over the past four years we have owned 4 Sonicare units (2 Advanced followed by 2 Elites) and as of yesterday we are up to 3 dead units due to battery failure.  A 75% failure rate STRICTLY DUE TO BATTERIES / CHARGING CIRCUT DESIGN which results in the rest of the unit needing to be replaced or trashed is simply a poor design.      If customer service replaces the unit within the 2 years, that is great customer service which compensates somewhat for poor design, but our first 2 units failed shortly after 2 years and within about a month apart and Sonicare did not offer any assistance.  Just throw it away and buy another!  Which we did!  And now we are faced with the same problem (I am communicating with Sonicare on this and will update things if they decide to replace the unit out of fairness to them).     But no matter what, if you are a propsective purchaser of a Sonicare Elite you should at least be aware that there does appear to be aflaw in their battery technology and circuit design which allows the battery to fail long before it ever should. (As an aside, the first Sonicare units replaced a Braun Oral-B unit.  We liked the Sonicare better than the old Oral-B, but the Oral-B still holds a charge perfectly, as does my Braun shaver, both of which are over 5 years in use!  Three Sonicare battery failures out of four, so far, cannot be a coincidence.)    For the technical among you, Sonicare uses an older NiCad battery technology but recommends keeping the unit in the charging base when not in use.  NiCads have a history of &#x27;memory effect&#x27; which begins to reduce the cycle times if it is continuously kept charging.  That is why most everything has switched to NiMH or L-Ion batteries.  But not Sonicare.  I tried not following their instructions (i.e. keeping the unit outside the charging base until the battery was almost drained which is how most companies advise NiCad batteries to be treated) and the one &#x27;Advance&#x27;d model that I did this with failed.  But so did the other one that was in the charger all the time, so ????  As for the new Elites, they were kept in the charger as recommended by Philips / Sonicare but once again a unit has failed.  Can the final unit be far behind?      So, 5 stars for the brushing effectiveness  - 1 star for battery / circuit design.  Know this when you buy one.  Even with this, it may be worth your $125 every 2 years for the great brushing results.  As for me, I may relook at the newer Oral-B designs.</li>
    <li> WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just picked one of these up the other day at Costco. I have been using a Crest Spinbrush for the last two years or so. Recently, Crest stopped shipping replacement heads for their Spinbrush series due to quality concerns. I went looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say about the Sonicare is that if you haven&#x27;t tried one, you have no idea how awesome this thing is. It is completeley different than any kind of brushing you have ever done before. I was surprised at first that the instructions say not to scrub or push down any harder than a fingertip grip when brushing....but that&#x27;s all it takes! Just place it on each tooth 1-2 seconds and you&#x27;ll feel like you just had your teeth professionaly cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can buy a $1 toothbrush and have clean teeth. But for those that care just a little more about their oral health (and admittedly are blessed to be able to afford something like this) it is well worth EVERY penny. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you like 7500, then you may want to try 7750. It is nothing but a package of two 7500 in one box that cost me only $114 (ie $57/each). I got it at casco</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare Elite 7500 Power Toothbrush.  I have tried 2 other brands but was very unhappy with both.  The brush head make brushing the back teeth  very easy due to the shape of brushhead being narrow at the back and front of the brushhead.  Thank you for a bushhead that fits in tight places.</li>
    <li> wow!! i bought one of the 7500 elite series for my wife and after hearing her talk about how good it was, i decided to buy an extra twin pack of brush heads so i could see what the big deal was. if you have noticed in several of the other reviews, it states how you get that just left the dentists office feel. thats an understatement!! your teeth feel so amazingly clean, its kind of scary how good it works. a few people whine about the price but dont let that scare you away. i will have one for the rest of my life. its simple to use and the battery life off of one recharge lasts a good week or so. worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommanded I buy this tooth brush. He said I was gonna be pricey but well worth it which I come to find out to be true! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel so much cleaner than brushing with a regular toothbrush. The 2 min. auto timer is just such a good feature, every 30 seconds it pauses to indicate for you to move on to the next sections of your mouth. And the battery life last so long! Fully charge it over night.. and don&#x27;t have to chargeit again for 2 weeks! With it&#x27;s traveling case, you can take it with you on vacations and not have to bring the charger! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a bit price... the next time you want to buy that pair of shoes, or that new gadget... don&#x27;t. Instead, buy this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a must have.  The first time I tried it I knew I could never go back to my old manual toothbrush.  The Sonicare leaves your entire mouth feeling like you just left the dentist.  Lately I&#x27;ve been using Listerine whitening mouthwash first then I brush.  Seems like a great system for clean white teeth.  I also read through other reviews on here and was intrigued by the \\&quot;drilling\\&quot; one.  It&#x27;s true the Sonicare is a little forceful upon first use, but I wouldn&#x27;t want it any softer.  I think that&#x27;s the problem with some of the other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.  They didn&#x27;t really feel like they were doing anything so I ultimately reverted to the manual.  Now I think I&#x27;ve made the switch for good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the patient type, but I did wait til the battery had fully charged before using the Sonicare toothbrush for the first time.  I already brushed my teeth this morning, but when the light indicated it was \\&quot;charged\\&quot;, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on it and check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression:  It tickles! I didn&#x27;t find it to be an overzealous toothbrush, as some of the reviewers indicate here.  Although, it was only my first use, and I read the manual which does say it will increase in its exuberance with ea. brushing,  I&#x27;m actually looking forward to it!  I am 49 yrs. old and not much impresses me anymore.  The Sonicare toothbrush is the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have excellent teeth, and because my dentist says that I have the teeth of a 20 yr. old - I asked if I could lie thru my teeth about my age. I have only three baby cavitities that I&#x27;ve had since about the ages of 10-14 yrs. old.  Perfect teeth ever since.  For all the great hygiene I have with my teeth - this toothbrush made me feel like I haven&#x27;t been brushing my teeth correctly all these years!  I actually feel like I just left the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I will recommend this product to everyone I know - I am *that* impressed!  BTW, I have never owned an electric toothbrush in my life til now.  I guess the right product had to come along.................</li>
    <li> I have had a couple el cheapo battery powered toothbrushes over the years and never thought much about it till I had the oppertunity to pick up a 7500 pretty cheap.  I was absolutely blown away by how clean my teeth felt after just the first use.  They were smooth and slick just like after a trip to the dentist.  It makes brushing so easy that it should not even be called brushing, all you do is stand there for 2.5 minutes and the job is done.  I was so excited to go to the dentist and open up for inspection.  I used to get the \\&quot;not bad\\&quot; followed by 30 minutes of the hygenists scraping.  This time it was just a quick cursory inspection preceded by \\&quot;wow, you have been doing a great job brushing\\&quot;.  A 36 year old should not be proud of how well he brushed hit teeth but I must say it was kinda neat.   &lt;br /&gt;Just go get one, I am positive you will love it and sure I guess you could get the same results from a manual tooth brush if you were careful and did it exactly the right way but I know for a fact I will NEVER, NEVER want to go back to the \\&quot;Dark Ages\\&quot; again.</li>
    <li> As a General Dentist, I have used the Sonicare line for years.  This particular model is better than its predecessor, the Advantage.  The handle is smaller, as is the brush head.  It provides superior cleaning in smaller places.  I like this model because a variety of patients can benefit from it.  If you have never used one, take advantage of the feature that allows you to \\&quot;get used to it\\&quot;.  To be fair, I also really like the Braun Oral B excel, and the Triumph, but these are NOT sonic.</li>
    <li> I had used a Sonicare for several years. When the time came to buy a new one, I wasn&#x27;t sure if there was enough advantage to buy the &#x27;elite&#x27; one. I did, and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush, but I find it absurd that the battery life is 3-5 years (2 1/2 in our case), and the batteries are non-replaceable.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is an outstanding product. I&#x27;ve had my Elite 7500 for about 2 years and have had virtually no problems with it. The quadpacer works perfectly, I&#x27;ve become so used to the 30 second timer, I know exactly when it is about to beep. The whole unit is totally waterproof, no electrical contacts to become corroded. This product is first class and worth every penny. Make sure you buy the kit with the travel case, as I&#x27;ve seen dentists sell them without the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop around for the best price for replacement brushes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads last maybe 2 months max, based on twice a day usage so costs of brushes would be about $75.00 a year - that really adds up. I do wish the brush heads had different stiffness though as I prefer a stiffer bristle. When I switched from manual to Sonicare brushing I was disappointed that the brushes were a bit softer than the manual brushes.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 Toothbrush has so many helpful features.  The 30 second pause and two minute shut off take the guess work out of amount of time to brush. The size and shape of the brushes and the ability to keep the toothbrush charged at all times are wonderful features.</li>
    <li> an excellent value, this is my second purchase in 5 years.  easy to clean,and it works very well.  it is also highly rated, which is why i  &lt;br /&gt;purchased it in the first place.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The best feature about this toothbrush in my opinion is the two-minute timer with 30-second intervals. I don&#x27;t notice much difference in the speeds and I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth more money than the 5000 series. I feel like it cleans behind the teeth pretty well. Overall, I am pleased with the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s husband who will be going overseas for one year.   She could not give up the one Sonicare that I gave them last year, and requested I buy one for him to take with him.  They love it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Cleans your teeth. Check. Now that that&#x27;s settled. Let&#x27;s look at the downside.  It&#x27;s expensive. Replacement heads are expensive. Ours died after a year and luckily was replaced d/t warranty. Then, after a year, the replacement died. Users of the Sonicare know what I&#x27;m talking about. We recently switched to Oral B. Hubby thinks the Oral B cleans better. I think they&#x27;re about the same. However, the Oral B is cheaper and the heads are cheaper. Also, the Sonicare design creates a gunk environment where the head has to be taken apart to clean. So if you don&#x27;t mind the expensive heads and you don&#x27;t mind cleaning them once in a while and you like a quiet toothbrush, Sonicare is your toothbrush. Otherwise, my choice is the Oral B.</li>
    <li> I used my Philips Sonicare the first time yesterday and when i was done it just felt like i came out of the dentist. My mouth feels so clean and fresh. I love this product, Cost $$$$ but is worth it all the way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to replace a brush because there&#x27;s always a newer model which uses a slightly different brush, and the old brushes aren&#x27;t available.  It&#x27;s actually a rip-off.  It&#x27;s too bad because otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.  The same problem exists for all the parts.  I&#x27;ve had to buy a whole new appliance (charger, handle, and brushes) twice because I lost the handle,twice because I needed a charger, and several times because the brushes wore out. I did it because there wasn&#x27;t any real competition.  But now I&#x27;m going to switch to a less expensive brand and stop paying $100 everytime I need to replace a part.</li>
    <li> I am using this toothbrush for the last 5 months. I used to smoke and there were tar stains on my teeth even after I stoped. But this tooth brush removed all of them. Its  angle helps in reaching all the places. Its a bit expensive, but worth the price. The LED indicator is also helpfull for knowing the battery charged and making the life of the battery longer. The first time you brush with it you will feel a bit tickling in your teeth, but after that its just like a regular toothbrush. You can feel the difference the first time you brush your teeth using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As the other reviews accurately state: this toothbrush works VERY well but...this toothbrush is not for everyone.  I have one part of my gum that is a bit sensitive and sometimes the vibrations hit a spot that really tingles in a painful sort of way.  Also, one of it&#x27;s main strengths is a potential &#x27;pain&#x27; point -- the vibrating.  The toothbrush is on a hard plastic armature (as expected).  When this rapidly vibrating hard plastic inadvertently makes contact with my teeth, it reminds me of scratching the chalk board -- it does not hurt but is very &#x27;painful&#x27; to experience.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this toothbrush strongly enough.  It is by far the best electric toothbrush i have ever used.  The money that you spend is very easily saved on the scrape and scale you pay your dentist to do and it doesn&#x27;t feel as harsh as other toothbrushes.  I actually find myself disappointed when it turns itself off after two minutes, which in any other circumstance is just odd!!</li>
    <li> I got the Philips Sonic care toothbrush for Christmas and was shocked at how good of a product it was.  Now about a month and a half later my teeth are gleaming and alot whiter.  Not to mention my girlfriend lives with me and I bought and extra toothbrush head and now we can both share the elite model.  The head easily screws off and the head easily screws on.  So it serves dual purposes and makes me and my girlfriend happy!  We have the cleanest teeth in Manhattan!</li>
    <li> I just got this toothbrush today from drugstore.com for about the same price. I had been waiting for this model to get a little cheaper, but I ended up saying, \\&quot;Oh screw it! I&#x27;m getting it now!\\&quot; - I did. And I love it. It&#x27;s worth the price. It&#x27;s going to be even more worth it six months from now when I go in to get my teeth cleaned and the dentist will actually be able to see that I&#x27;ve been brushing at least twice daily and flossing every night! My mother has one of the Advance models, and she loves hers as well. She told me how great it was and I decided to ask my dentist about it before forking out 100 bucks for my first electric toothbrush and my dentist agreed that it was great! I just used this toothbrush about 5 minutes ago and my teeth and mouth altogether feel VERY CLEAN! I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t wait any longer to get this thing. I must admit that while reading the instructions before using it- I said to myself, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too wise to have a toothbrush that&#x27;s smarter than you are.\\&quot; Or is it wise? Hmmmm?.... Anyway, it&#x27;s a lot less intimidating once you just go ahead and use it (after reading the instructions, of course) and you&#x27;ll see how fresh your mouth feels. I highly recommend this toothbrush!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strange but I&#x27;m 25 and I&#x27;ve never been so excited about brushing my teeth before...</li>
    <li> I have read many contradictory reviews, opinions and studies about the relative benefits of brushing with Sonicare, Braun/Oral B and manual brushes. Some people, including dentists, believe the Sonicare is no more, no less efficient than good old manual brushing; some others claim the Oral B does a better job than the Sonicare.  From what I&#x27;ve put together with all this information, the bottom line is that a Sonicare is not significantly better for people under 30 with good oral hygiene and no periodontal problems.    However, if you are over 30 and/or if you have periodontal pockets or your gums bleed when you brush, a properly used Sonicare is an invaluable tool, the only one that can actually reverse periodontal pockets (my 4s and 5s have become 2s and 3s in a little over a year of twice-daily use) and restore healthy, non-bleeding gums.    Key to this is proper use. If you use it like a regular brush it will not help you anymore than a regular brush, and you will have wasted your money. Unlike regular brushes, you need to keep the brush motionless at a 45 degree angle at the base of each tooth for about 10 seconds. The QuadPacer feature is very useful to monitor this. It will take 2 cycles of two minutes each to treat your entire mouth. One cycle for the top, one for the bottom.    Complement this with daily flossing (Reach Access is great if you hate dealing with those pesky strings) and rince for 30 seconds with Listerine after brushing, and I guarantee your dentist will be amazed at your next visit.    The 7500 package comes with a convenient travel case, but only one brush head. The pompously named \\&quot;deluxe wall mount\\&quot; is a stupid piece of plastic that will hold the brush and one extra head, but does not charge the brush so it&#x27;s pretty much useless: if you don&#x27;t want to keep the brush in its charging cradle between brushings for lack of countertop space, you would probably want to cover the bristles with the supplied transparent  cap and put the brush away ina drawer, instead of sticking this ugly thing on the wall. I wonder what they were thinking when they designed this one!    The bundled travel case, however, is very convenient and stays shut unlike earlier versions which shipped with the Advance model. Unfortunately the charger has to be packaged separately. It would be nice if Philips/Sonicare would offer a travel charger; the battery will only last a few days of regular use, so you need to pack the charger if you go on a week-long trip, and that&#x27;s yet another piece to get lost in the luggage.    The handle features a two-level power setting (normal and \\&quot;training\\&quot;), and an illuminated LED battery charge indicator.    The brush handle is sealed, however the attachment of the brush to the handle is not; it&#x27;s a good idea to remove the brush from the handle every few days to clean and air dry the inside of the brush attachment area, a very minor issue.    I love my Sonicare; it has completely reversed my gum disease, and that is something that no other brush could have done. It may be overkill for younger people, but if you have gum disease, you could not do yourself a better favor than to buy a Sonicare and learn to use it properly.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite is the better electric toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare Advanced for years and felt it was time to upgrade. However, instead of just upgrading to another Sonicare, I decided to take a look at Oral-B 7000 series(after \\&quot;hearing\\&quot; of the Cochrane report) and the Sonicare Elite(I passed on the Intelliclean because I didn&#x27;t want to be locked into using Crest. I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine for years, with great results and don&#x27;t want to switch). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, After using both, for a couple weeks, I can tell you that I definitely prefer the Sonicare Elite. The Oral-B was good, but it just didn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as clean as the Sonicare. The new Elite version is so much better than the older Advanced model, in that it has a smaller head(and no splash screen to get in the way, on the back of the brushhead) and an angled stem. The angle makes it&#x27;s MUCH easier to reach those back teeth. About the only thing I did like about the Oral-B, over the Sonicare, were the different brushheads that were available, for the Oral-B(although some were a bit awkward to use and it will add expense, as they need to be replaced, every so often). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BTW, some food for thought, if the side to side oscillating motion is supposedly better, as the Cochrane report leads us to believe and which Oral-B uses, then why is it that Oral-B, somewhat recently introduced their own SONIC toothbrush? Hmm... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the brushheads being expensive, compared to Oral-B, I disagree. The Sonicare Elite heads are actually CHEAPER, because you must take into account the longevity. The Sonicare&#x27;s last 6 months and the Oral-B only 3 months. Using the prices on Amazon.com, 3 round Oral-B brushheads go for ~$16, while 2 Sonicare Elite brushes, go for ~$20. So in 6 months, I&#x27;ll use 1 Sonicare brushhead &#x3D; $10 every 6 months, but I&#x27;ll use 2 Oral-B brushheads @ $6 each &#x3D; $12 every 6 mo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, all in all, I LOVE the Sonicare Elite. Get it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite is a phenomenal product and should be in every home in America.  Don&#x27;t let the price tag scare you away, it will save you a fortune as well as save your oral health.  Why wouldn&#x27;t everyone dedicate two short minutes a day to have cleaner teeth and healthier gums?  The Sonicare does take some getting used to but within a few days, you won&#x27;t notice the vibration which may bother some in the beginning.  My professional cleanings have changed since I started using the Sonicare regularly, no more scraping and no more pain.  Getting through the visit is a breeze, it makes that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head on the Elite is small and easily reaches to the back of your mouth, the hardest place for me.  I can feel the water swish between my teeth and it feels great to know how thoroughly they are being cleaned.  This unit charges quickly and it holds the charge for days.  You can take it with you for the weekend or even longer without worrying about bringing the charger along.  If you start using the Sonicare right after a professional cleaning, you will achieve the greatest results and your teeth will begin to get whiter faster.  There will be a noticeable difference in 28 days, just like the product information claims, you just have to use it.</li>
    <li> Hello.  Is the whole kit dual-voltage?  If I take it to Europe where the voltage is 220, would it still charge? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than the bulkier models.  Excellent performance.  Brushes are smaller than other models and fit well for optimal performance.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 does what it says it will, my teeth have never felt this clean without visiting the dentist!  But I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price increase over the previous model.  I don&#x27;t have the previous model to make an informed comparison, but it seems that buying the cheaper Sonicare would have sufficed.  This model does however come with a nifty travel case.  The only real problem I am having is the water that accumulates in between the head and the base; it needs to be kept dry in order to keep clean.  Overall, it is a good item.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush takes all the work out of brushing.  I find myself brushing more frequently, and my teeth feel so much healthier.  It truly makes your mouth feel completely refreshed.  I would definitely recommend this Sonicare toothbursh to anyone.  It promotes great dental health!</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare for 5 years.  My old unit finally got to the point where it would not hold a charge for more than a day, so I ordered a 7500 model a few weeks ago.  I just saw my dentist and he said I had very minimal plaque and the cleanest teeth he had seen in a long time.  Also, my gum recession has not worsened in the 5 years that I have used Sonicare.</li>
    <li> When I upgraded from my Sonicare from the Advanced series to the Elite 7000 series, I expected a quality electric toothbrush that would last years. I was, however, also happy with some of the design improvements. The handle slimmed down a little, and feels very easy to grip in my hand. The brush head is smaller than before and is attached to an angular shaft; both are intended to reach all the areas of your mouth better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare claims that their brushing technology cleans better than other electric toothbrushes that have rotating or oscillating heads. I think I&#x27;ve read that they even say that their toothbrushes aid in stain removal on your teeth. I don&#x27;t know if the incremental cleaning power of Sonicares has been proven, but I do know that my teeth and gums have been in excellent shape as long as I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I once read that the two most important factors in brushing your teeth are technique and how long you brush. If that&#x27;s the case, almost *any* electric toothbrush will be an improvement over a regular toothbrush. That being said, Sonicare electric toothbrushes are among the most expensive on the market. They do seem to have more bells and whistles over other brands, which may or may not be important to you. One feature I like that I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere is their Quadpacer. Other electric toothbrushes have timers built in so you know you&#x27;ve been brushing a certain length of time -- say 2 minutes for example. The Quadpacer is different in that it also beeps at 30 second intervals so you know you move to another quadrant of your mouth, which prevents the tendency of brushing certain areas of your mouth more than others. Very handy. Not all Sonicare models have the Quadpacer, so check the model details if that&#x27;s a feature you want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I am happy with my purchase I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m totally convinced that you couldn&#x27;t get somewhat similar care with an electric toothbrush that costs half as much. Still, if you can afford the price I think you can feel confident that your teeth and gums will be well taken care of using a Sonicare, with very little effort.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and it is great for my teeth and gums.  I have had it for almost two months and I love it.</li>
    <li> I recently  replaced my Braun Electric Toothbrush with Sonicare.  The new tooothbrush is a tremendous improvement.  My teeth seem plaque-free for the first time in my life.  They look and feel much cleaner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, it might seem anomolous, but toothpaste is filthy.  The Braun accumulated crud and was difficult to clean.  The Sonicare has been carefully engineered with smooth parts which are relatively easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist and hygienist are both incredibly nice people but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to spend hours with their hands stuck in my mouth as they try to clean up my messy teeth! Lucky for me I use a Sonicare toothbrush (lucky for them, too, because it makes their job so much easier). I just looked and I bought my brush in April 2006, it&#x27;s now November 2010, and this will probably jinx it but my brush is still going strong.  Do I cringe over price when I need new brushheads? Absolutely! But then I get a clean bill of dental health and limited scraping at my 6 month check up and it&#x27;s all worthwhile (I&#x27;m a bit of a dental wimp afterall).  I would absolutely recommend the Philips Sonicare toothbrush - it kinda rocks!</li>
    <li> After 11 years use, both my wife and I have our own, both are losing recharge ability now. They only last 2-3 days now. Both are Elite and expensive but, for 11 years it was cheap and excellent cleaning. Yes the charge lasted at least 10 days for the first 8 years.</li>
    <li> Great little product. Have had it for over 2 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. Came highly recommended by my dentist and afterwards I noticed several family members and friends have them.</li>
    <li> To the extent that I can determine, the brush does a fine job. I find it bothersome in one respect, though. It has a timer that turns the device off after 2 minutes, whether or not the job is done. More often than not I have to turn it back on. It would make better sense for the timer to be optional, and to allow the user to set the number of minutes he wants the brush to run.</li>
    <li> I bought the sonicare elite last year just to see if it was worth all of the &amp;quot;hype.&amp;quot; Well let me tell you, it is one of the greatest things I&#x27;ve ever done for myself. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my teeth but still dreaded the twice yearly trips to the dentist. Now that I use the sonicare, my dentist cleanings only take 15 minutes and I have received compliments from the dentist as well as the hygenists about how clean my teeth are. This product may seem expensive, but belive me it is WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!! Your teeth will look and feel so much better and your trips to the dentist will be a piece of cake. Wouldn&#x27;t you rather buy a slightly expensive brush and save on future dental expenses? I sure would!</li>
    <li> Sonicare is absolutely, utterly brilliant. I&amp;#146;ve been using the Advance model for almost three years, and even though it&#x27;s still working very well I&#x27;m seriously tempted to buy the Elite. It almost seems like it can&#x27;t get any better, but if it does - I want it!      Yes, it does cost a lot, but there is absolutely nothing that takes care of your teeth and gums like this thing does. As far as I&amp;#146;m concerned, that&amp;#146;s &amp;#145;priceless&amp;#146;. I used to have bad gum pocket problems, and now they are almost normal in depth. And every time you brush your teeth they get so squeaky clean it&amp;#146;s like you&amp;#146;ve just had a professional cleaning at the dentists. It takes some getting used to at first, but once you have you&amp;#146;ll probably never be satisfied with another toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> I received the Sonicare Elite 7500 as a gift for Christmas 2003.  Last month (March 2005) the battery on the handle died on me.  I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t replace it because I didn&#x27;t fill out a warranty card or anything when I bought it.  And I didn&#x27;t have a receipt to prove that I had purchased it since it was a gift.    I was kinda bummed, but after brushing with the Sonicare for so long, I never wanted to go back to the old way of brushing.  I didn&#x27;t even want to settle for the other brands (oral-b, etc).  I was ready to shell out the $150 or whatever it was at Costco.  But first I decided to give it a shot and call customer service to see if they could do anything.  The girl at Sonicare was so friendly and helpful.  All I had to do was read the serial number on the bottom of my handle.  She looked it up, and told me that it was still within the 2-year warranty.  SO after a few diagnostics tests over the phone (to make sure it was dead), she told me a new handle was on it&#x27;s way.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy that was!    The box came in a few days later, and it was the next model up.. the 7800 (although I can&#x27;t tell any difference).  Not only that, it also came with a new head and base charger!  I was waay satisfied.  A few days later, I got an envelope with a UPS sticker in it.  I followed instructions and put the old handle in the box the new one came in, and stuck the UPS sticker on it and dropped it of the next day at the nearest Mailboxes Etc.    Anyways, I was really happy with the whole experience, and I couldnt be happier with my new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Take cae of your teeth and gums with this elecronic toothbrush.  The new design with the angled head makes brushing your teeth easier.  Also, the new smaller brush design is better.  After using this for a few months, your dentist and/or periodontist will be able to tell the difference.  When the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; in your gums around the teeth are measured, you will be amazed at the improvement.  Highly recommended, and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Sonicare PS for many years and it finally died - but didn&#x27;t owe me anything. I find that using the Sonicare keeps my gums in much better condition between dental checkups. I got the 7500 because of the ability to program the quadpacer for additional time, and because of the battery meter. I haven&#x27;t used the programming yet, but the feel and reach of the new model is an improvement over the old one. I like the &#x27;feel&#x27; of the bristles on the older model better, though. There is a $30-40 range in cost between the 7100 and the 7800, and all the models in between - not sure if the step up is worth it, but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> works very well, but its a freakin toothbrush, unless you have teeth problems dont spend$100+ dollars (or ur rich) i mean its really not that great or worth it, just get a $20 one instead if you want to blow your money...</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite is excellent. I owned an older model Sonicare toothbrush which was fine.  The Elite is a new model which makes your gums and teeth feel even cleaner and healthier.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and found a great price through Amazon.  I purchased it cheaper than I paid for my first Sonicare toothbrush 5 years ago.</li>
    <li> This product has done more to whiten my teeth than all the whitening toothpastes in the world.  I only wonder why I didn&#x27;t think to buy one years ago!  I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker, so this is just what I need.  Also, your entire mouth feels fresher after brushing with it than with a regular toothbrush.  I give it two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare Toothbrush the first one lasted for five years of daily use.  The new 7500 is much lighter and smaller which makes it easier to use and more effective in reaching all the surfaces of your teeth.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and how well it removes plaque and food bits from between the teeth.  My dentist always remarks about how little tarter I have during semiannual check ups and cleaning.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works as advertised...has two brush ends (with holders for both) that can be switched in a few seconds. Think this has one speed..I think some other models have two speeds and/or area to put toothpaste into...Don&#x27;t think this is necessary...and a little too much work..just put a little toothpaste on the brush/put it in your mouth and turn on...when done..rince with some listerine and you should be in good shape...</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT THE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH FOR CHRISTMAS TODAY I REGISTERED IT AND I AM GETTING $24.95 IN COUPONS. I JUST USED IT AND I THINK THAT THE BRUSH ITSELF IS UNIQUE AND AWESOME.</li>
    <li> I started using a Sonicare several years ago on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, when I was having a lot of trouble with gingivitis and the resultant loosening of some of my teeth.  This problem cleared up totally with the Sonicare.  A year ago I began using the Sonicare Elite, and I like it even better than my old Sonicare.  The Elite is lighter in weight and angled in a way that makes it easier to reach every part of my mouth.  I also appreciate the extra 30 seconds I can select for working on areas that need more attention.  My dental health is now excellent, and I get high commendations from my dental hygienist at each of my semi-annual checkups.</li>
    <li> I had heard about the SONICARE toothbrush for years before I finally made the decision to try it. WOW...WOW...WOW is all that I can say.I was watching OPRAH in 1998 and she was giving all of her audience a sonicare toothbrush. So from her endorsment I thought I would try it. I had been using a manual toothbrush before I started to use SONICARE and the harder the brush the  better cleaning I thought. I totally damaged my teeth and gave myself Receeding Gingiva(gums). So NOW the dentist was recommending I find a better way of cleaning my teeth or I could have some serious problems.(LOSE THEM)I decided to give it a try since they had the 30 day money back guarantee.( What did I have to Lose)YES it is very different than using a manual toothbrush or a spin brush. I gave my husband one of the brushes since it came with 2 brushes in the package. My husband also complained that it tickled when he began using it But still urging him to continue he finally is using it regularly and loves HIS SONICARE. Next... I gave SONICARE to my coastguard son in law as a birthday present. His wife (My daughter) tried to use it and complained it tickled too much, she is still trying to get use to using it.I guess she is the next one to get her own..HeeHee (He just fell in love with it) and takes it on his missions when he goes out to sea. Next.... this year for Christmas I gave my 11 year grandson a SONICARE (His mom was fit to be tied he was not brushing his teeth...Yuck) We had tried everything (BUT you know boys...Whew) anyway I took the time to explain the use of the product and how it functioned (the Do&#x27;s &amp; Don&#x27;ts) and his mother informed me from that night on he has not stopped brushing his teeth.HOORAY!! My idea is to purchase a SONICARE for everyone in our family that is how much I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.I have not had any problems with mine at all but like someone else has said on here that there are a few lemons in everything .But the SONICARE people stand behind their product with GREAT customer service.I am sold for life on SONICARE.I have now upgraded to this 7500 and it has an even better feel than the advance I was using. Smaller head and an angled neck and lighter in weight. As for my teeth they are whiter than ever and the gums have quit receeding the hygenist says whatever you are doing keep it up. It is all about proper technique and getting that brush in your mouth for the proper amount of time. All the features on this toothbrush keep you where you need to be. Yes...the SONICARE is a bit on the pricey side But in comparison to what it will cost for dental repair it is PAY ME NOW OR PAY ME LATER ...YOUR CHOICE. My advice is to BUY &amp; TRY.GREAT customer service.I am sold for life on SONICARE.I have now upgraded to this 7500 and it has an even better feel than the advance I was using.

    <li> My, 6+ year old Sonicare Electric Toothbrush, \\&quot;got tired&#x27;, there are two us us, my wife and I, using it. I replaced it, from Amazon.com, with the same, but newer model. I am glad the old one \\&quot;gave up the ghost\\&quot;, this new Toothbrush is fabulous, so much better then the previous model. Some times bad things, turn into good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to several dentists for a semi annual cleaning but I&#x27;m surprised nobody suggested the product. Now I know why--they&#x27;re probably lose you business because it feels like you just had a thorough dental cleaning after each use. You could realy feel the difference</li>
    <li> This toothbrush and its cleaning abiltiy is 5 STAR! But the battery life needs inprovement.  I had my first Sonicare Elite for exactly 2 years when the battery no longer charged.  I called the consumer hotline and they do not sell replacement batteries, but they will sell you another Sonicare Elite at what they call a \\&quot;discount\\&quot; (which is more than Amazon sells it for). So when your battery dies, your Sonicare is garbage.  I am very dissapointed that my $140 toothbrush only lasted 2 years, but after a year of trying different, cheaper brands, I&#x27;m breaking down today and buying another as the health of my teeth is worth paying for.</li>
    <li> The 7500 model is lighter and more comfortable in the mouth than the Advance model. It is also easier to clean and doesn&#x27;t collect gunk in the brush head and shaft like the Advance did, a huge and necessary improvement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare added a power meter so that you always know how much charge remains, a great upgrade for the frequent traveler. I get a longer period between charges with this model. The new charger design looks good and works well; it hasn&#x27;t developed hairline cracks like the old model did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Quadpacer timer is very helpful in making sure you balance the two minute brushing period across all areas of mouth. I&#x27;ve never used the other programming features. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I feel certain I get a better result brushing with Sonicare than with manual brush or other electronic models (Braun or SpinBrush). My mouth feels cleaner and my dental hygienist is very pleased with my improved results since switching from manual brushing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The big negatives regarding Sonicare brushes are the high cost to purchase and the relatively short battery life. I&#x27;ve gone through two Advanced handles in under four years. Sonicare offers a two year warranty, which I believe covers the battery, but I&#x27;ve never pursued warranty replacement as I&#x27;d prefer not to miss a day using Sonicare. I wish they offered a replacement battery pack. These points prevent me from giving a five-star rating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for those who are able to invest +/-$100 in a good tooth brush for preventative dental care. Look for special packages with two handles (e.g. Costco) if you share brushing time with a partner. It&#x27;s more convenient than waiting for your partner to finish and prevents the two of you from having to switch brush heads 4x daily.</li>
    <li> While the brush does brush exceedingly well, the battery in the brush holder cannot be replaced.  According to Sonicare the battery will last 3 to 5 years. Ours lasted only 3 years despite using non-peroxide toothpaste and only cleaning it with water and a towel.  So be warned, when you invest $100 into a two-headed toothbrush set and another $20 every six months in new heads, this gimmick may last you only three years.  You will be left with two perfectly good toothbrush heads, a well-functioning base, and a dead battery.  According to Sonicare at this point all you can do is throw it all away (who cares about our growing mountains of garbage and future generations?) and buy - a new Sonicare!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sonicare toothbrush on our dentist&#x27;s recommendation, and we are very pleased with it.  My teeth feel cleaner after using it than with any other electric or battery-operated toothbrush I have ever tried.  We are so pleased with the results we get from this one, that we also purchased one for our daughter and her family.  This is their first electric toothbrush, and they use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I waited about a month before writing this review to make sure I really liked it. That being said, I love this toothbrush! I was very nervous to buy this because when I go to the dentist, I dread the electric tools because they make my mouth feel funny when they vibrate. Nevertheless, I bought this toothbrush because I didn&#x27;t feel like my manual brush (Oral B Crossaction Vitalizer) was doing the job, and I wanted something that would force me to brush for exactly two minutes, no more, no less. I got way more than I bargained for with this: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(1) This is great for people with sensitive mouths because it has a built-in mechanism that slowly increases the brush speed/vigor over the course of the first 14 uses, which I really appreciated because I have a VERY sensitive mouth.  &lt;br /&gt;(2) Love the Quadpacer. It helps me not to overbrush or underbrush and evenly space out brushing time for the different regions of my mouth. And, if 2 minutes is too short for you, you can change it so it brushes for 2.5 minutes &lt;br /&gt;(3) Love the fact that I can easily adjust brush speed while brushing. I always turn mine down a notch (with just a single push of a button) when brushing the back of my top teeth, since that&#x27;s the most sensitive area of my mouth &lt;br /&gt;(4) This toothbrush whitened my teeth!! I did not expect that at all, but my friends have actually asked me what I used to whiten my teeth. &lt;br /&gt;(5)My teeth FEEL clean. When I rub my tongue across my top teeth, it feels smooth. Plus, I feel like I just left the dentist every time I finish brushing. I actually look forward to brushing now. &lt;br /&gt;(6) I went home for 5 days, and the travel kit was super handy. Plus, the toothbrush didn&#x27;t run out of battery. &lt;br /&gt;(7) My gums are healthier!! &lt;br /&gt;(8) It&#x27;s really easy to clean this brush. I just wipe it down with a tissue after using and disconnect the brush head and wipe it down to get rid of any excess water. It takes about 20 seconds.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So all in all, yes,its $120, but I honestly feel like it was worth every last cent. I&#x27;m so happy with this brush, I don&#x27;t want to try anything else.</li>
    <li> It works well for gum massage and teeth cleaning and holds a charge fairly well for travelling.</li>
    <li> I gave my first Sonicare to my husband.  His head has the shield behind the bristles and it was difficult to clean that small space between the shield and the bristles.  But it works fine and he likes it much better than his Braun.  I got myself an Elite model through my dentist.  It has a small head and no extra space to clean.  However, it is about a year old and it only holds a battery charge of about 3 days.  I am on a trip and used it from Wednesday through this morning (Saturday) and it died this morning.  Same on the last trip.  Luckily, my daughter has the same charger. The Sonicare that my husband now has could hold its charge for almost 2 weeks.  Other than that irritant, I love the way it performs and would buy another.</li>
    <li> Capitalism at its finest moment:  Battery dies after the two year warranty, can&#x27;t replace it, carefully dispose of it.  Spend another 120 for a new one.    Yeesh.  At least sell replacement, proprietary batteries for the consumer to fix it!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the BEST without a doubt.  It cleans beyond belief, it literally is like a buffer machine.  Unbelievable is one of the many other words that come to mind.  This was a good investment.  I have noticed a whiter smile.  I bought it the day it came out.  The battery life lasts up to two weeks.  I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicaire products for about 8 years and will use nothing else.  I recently retired my old Advance model and replaced it with the Elite 7500.  I know it&#x27;s only a toothbrush but it&#x27;s such a pleasant experience, that I really look forward to my twice a day brushings.  After some extensive dental reconstruction, I learned to take care of my teeth and  Sonicare makes it happen.  It may seem expensive, but the benefits and ease of use make it a bargain at twice the price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  My teeth are prone to cavities so proper dental care is very important to me.  I first noticed this brush for sale at my denstist&#x27;s office but figured it cost too much money.  But soon after that Amazon had a great deal so I gave it a try.  After the first use I couldn&#x27;t beleive the differnce how my teeth felt versus manual brushing.  My teeth had a nice slick feeling, the same feeling that I get after a hygenist buzzes away for 20min.  I gave it 4 stars because the fibrating part does take some getting used to.  I can&#x27;t say how many times that I missed the bristles and had the plastic buzz against my teeth.  Not a good feeling.  However, that&#x27;s probably due to inexperience since everyday that happens less.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally worth the investment</li>
    <li> I already owned the previous version. Then I bought this one. It&#x27;s great great. The system makes thounsands of passes without any force of your part. You just TOUCH your teeth with the brush and the velocity makes the rest. It&#x27;s thinner than the previous versions, much better to hold. if someone knows a better toothbrush, please tell me so. &lt;br /&gt;By the way, since it makes the toothpaste go \\&quot;micro\\&quot;, it fights tartar inside gengive like nothing before...  My dentist was surprised how it worked with me! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Once you start using this product, you can&#x27;t go back to regular brushing.  Only flaw this product has is the necessity of frequent removal of the toothbrush head from the main unit to enable the water that collect inside to drain out.  If you forget to do this, the toothbrush starts to smell foul.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonic Care for 2 or 3 years now.  I will attest that my teeth and gums are in much better shape then they were 3 years ago.  Plus the Phrophy is a much easier process!  I still have coffee stains, which can be reduced using the sonic care. However the elimnation of coffee stains are only accomplished using industrial strength equipment in the hands of a persistent hygienist. But hey, I&#x27;m really pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting with the sonic care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists and Hygienists endorse it (that&#x27;s where I first heard about it), and IT WORKS.  Let the brush do the work and the user just guide it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has built in features for quadrant timing, which are really nice.  A 3-minute cycle is used, whereas the average person may only hand brush up to 30 seconds total! That was a revelation to me, and was confirmed by actually timing the two methods and verifying the result.  Very beneficial personal care tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2007:  I&#x27;ve had this same one for 7 years now.  No problems.  Bullet proof!</li>
    <li> I had the best Oral B and now this toothbrush recommended by my dentist. WOW! This toothbrush really is the best. My roommate AND girlfriend bought one after seeing mine and my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the timer with the little 30 second quadrants thing. That helps me out so much. Make sure to get the one with the timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just never could get the timing to change to 2.5 instead of 2. Never worked. I put it on the charger and held the button forever and nothing happened. Still... this is a small issue.</li>
    <li> Who needs Crest White Strips when you have a Sonicare toothbrush! I drink tea all the time, and this brush keeps my teeth just as white as my friends who use a standard brush AND white strips. I brush twice or three times a day and it keeps my teeth post-dental office clean. I also enjoy the fact that the sonic waves get above the gum line, while with regular brushes you have to scrub your way up. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the quad timer on it, too. Nice little thought from someone at Sonicare. 30 seconds....BEEP! Switch to the other side of your mouth. 30 more seconds....BEEP! Switch to the bottoms. This goes on for 2 minutes (4 beeps) until before you&#x27;re done and it shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a twitchy battery, however. But if you leave it in its charging unit (like you will most days while you&#x27;re at work or away), it works just fine. But take it on vacation for a day or two and you might run into some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, though, this is an amazing little piece of dental technology.</li>
    <li> This is the first toothbrush that really gets between my teeth.  Though nothing is as good as flossing, this is as close as you can get with a toothbrush.  When I first used it, I felt like I had just been to the dentist.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I admit I was a skeptic of these types of toothbrushes.  But after rave reviews from my sister and a strong recommendation from our dentist, I decided to give it a try.  It is truly amazing how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt this good between dentist visits.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying Sonicare Elite, and decided to do so based on the fact that if Sonicare prevents a single cavity, it has basically paid for itself.  So I splurged, and the results were great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time I used Sonicare Elite for 2 minutes, I felt like I had just had a dentist clean my teeth for an hour.  After a week of using it, I knew I could never go back to a normal brush.  My teeth and mouth felt amazingly clean all day long based on brushing just twice a day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then recently I broke the charger by plugging it in in Europe without a transformer, and have been forced to go back to a regular toothbrush.  After a few months of using Sonicare Elite, this is possibly one of the worst things that could have happened to me.  You can brush all you want with a manual brush, but it&#x27;s just not the same.  You can&#x27;t really move plaque with a standard brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, of course, I called Philips imediately to order a replacement.  I was shocked when they said they would send me a new charger free as a courtesy.  I was totally amazed!  This is a great toothbrush, and a great company standing behind their product.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that I bought due to word of mouth. A few years ago, everybody that I knew seemed to be buying this product, and when my dentist recommended that my husband try it, we got one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The downside is that I got the smaller toothbrush and sometimes feel that I need a bigger toothbrush. The upside is that you are in an auto-pilot mode and the brush does all the work, and the result is not too bad.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you regularly flossed your teeth and used a good toothbrush I am sure you will get the same results as using this brush. But, in this hectic world who has the time to floss and brush. Something has to give, and usually it is the flossing. If you belong to this school then you might want to try this product which is a little on the expensive side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now use a regular brush, and need to find time to buy the replacement for the brush. You see it can&#x27;t last forever and needs to be replaced every now and then. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush on the recommendation of my periodontist.  It seems to be doing a very good job of cleaning (according to my dental hygienist), and my gums feel great.  The battery charger appears to be intelligent, which should make for good battery life, but I can&#x27;t be sure with only a couple of months of experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three small drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The toothbrush has a timer that is supposed to be programmable, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to change it.  It shuts off before I&#x27;m done, so I have to start it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The top of the unit accumulates moisture and toothpaste that need to be cleaned out every 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The buzzing action numbs my lips, especially when I&#x27;m searching for the switch to turn it off.  The sensation is not entirely unpleasant, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t consider any of these drawbacks serious enough to dampen my rating of 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Es un articulo muy bueno para la higiene dental. En Navidad nuestros suegros nos regalaron un par de cepillos Sonicare, 30 dias despues fui al dentista y me dijo que mis dientes estaban muy limpios, es por lo bien que actuan sobre los dientes, los deja sin sarro. Lo recomiendo ampliamente, Sonicare + hilo dental, es justo lo que se necesita para una buena limpieza dental.</li>
    <li> Follow instructions and this product will leave your teeth and gums feeling and looking much cleaner.  This is my second Sonicare product purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband was the one initially insisted on buying this product while I was very skeptical considering the price.  But after the first use... I was shockingly amazed by how well it performed.  I have used other types of electronic toothbrush but had never had one that come close to this.  It gaves me a sensation of just having my teeth cleaned... Yes, It was that good.  It is powerful and the design of the head made it very easy to reach the back molars.  The broad of Dentistry had suggest to brush 2-3 minutes for best cleaning while the rest of the world shown in research are brushing just about 30 seconds.  Knowing that, here&#x27;s where the best feature comes in, Once you turn on this toothbrush it will beep 4 times in a 30seconds increment to remind you to move on to the next section.  It helped my son so much on knowing when he should be done brushing rather than just do a quick run though and call it done. &lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricy but worth every pennies. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Yeah, it works great until . . . the on/off button cover needs to be replaced. Sonicare says they cannot repair it. Also, from what I&#x27;ve been reading, you&#x27;ll need to throw it out when the battery will not take a charge. Greed engineering!</li>
    <li> Owned an Oral-B for 10+ happy years.  Attractive pricing on Sonicare caused me to defect.  Totally regretful.  It thoroughly puzzles me that a design of a medical appliance causes a colossal harbor for bacteria/mold. Consumer needs to take the thing apart each week and resort to Q-tips etc. to at least ensure visual cleanliness.  Fact is, growth of the nasties commences immediately whether it&#x27;s visible or not and compounds with the number of uses in a given period. This same weird design accomplishes an ongoing revenue stream for the manufacturer because the screw-on brush head unique to this product is very expensive to replace comparatively...especially on the recommended schedule of every three months. That said, the cleaning action is quite good.  But then, so was Oral-B&#x27;s.  And the closed design and cheap brush heads far exceeded their Sonicare counterparts.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my original Sonicare died after about 7 years of use.  This one is much better.  The head is angled so it is easier to reach back teeth.  And the toothbrush seems more powerful.  The power indicator is nice when traveling because I don&#x27;t take the charger except for long trips.  The Sonicare also comes with a carrying case which I just used for the first time.  It is very compact and nicely designed.</li>
    <li> It seemed like a little too much money to be paying for a toothbrush, but after using it only once, I knew it was worth it. My teeth and gums immediately felt cleaner, more smooth, and after a couple of weeks, I noticed a definate change in the color of my teeth. It sure wasn&#x27;t a hardcore dental bleaching white, but it was noticeable enough to impress me. This product is very recommended, and Phillips provides a great warranty in the case of an accident.</li>
    <li> For those who grew up using the regular hand held brush, the only experience that most of us had with a rotating brush could be had only by going to the dentist. There was something minty clean that one felt after such a cleaning. The ORAL B stepped into the breach a few years ago with middling success. There was not much competition until the Sonicare was made available for general release. This unit worked much better than the ORAL B and its clones. Now you can get the SONICARE ELITE, which represents the next generation of tooth cleaning. The price is daunting. Yet, as with one&#x27;s other health concerns, how can you put a price on that? The SONICARE ELITE is truly worth the high price tag,if for no other reason than to reduce future dental bills. This unit has an angled head that allows you to clean thoroughly those hard to reach areas. There is even a twin speed: a fast one to grind away the plaque on the enamel and a slower one for those sensitive spots on the gum line. The unit has a recharging kit and is portable. In essence what you spend your money on is the newest cutting edge technology that makes tooth care less of an onerous chore and more of an aesthetic experience.</li>
    <li> Now I know why my dentist has been recommending I begin using this toothbrush for over a year now.  I wasn&#x27;t about to spend over $100 on a toothbrush when the dentist gives me a new one every six months for free.  After alot of harrassing by my dentist, I purchased the Sonicare Elite 7500. &lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night before bed.  I&#x27;m AMAZED!  My teeth felt like they do when I leave the dentist office.  I followed up with my regular toothbrush. (only until I get a rythem down to cover all my teeth in the two minutes the timer gives you)  The narrowed neck and smaller brushing head makes getting the very back of your mouth and teeth a snap.  &lt;br /&gt;Spend the money.  You and your dentist will be thankful.</li>
    <li> For my fortieth Birthday my Husband had a surprise party for me- (It helped me forget the 40th party).  Any way, I got tons of gifts.  This toothbrush is definitely one of the top 5.  There is something fun about the buzzing sensation on your gums.  Also in the top five gift list, (if I may share), are my singing lesson CDs- yey, I&#x27;ve always wanted to learn- \\&quot;Voice Lessons To Go\\&quot; by Vaccarino.  And then of course since I am anonymous I must mention the \\&quot;New Sex Now\\&quot; DVD my husband gave me later after the party.  Can we say enlightening.  Well, I am singing and doing some wild other things now with the cleanest of teeth!</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 does it&#x27;s job very well.  After using it one time, I could tell a difference.  My teeth felt like they had just been polished at the dentist office.  After using it for ~ 1 month, my teeth are consistently cleaner.  The sensation of brushing with the Sonicare system is odd, seeming as a combination of vibration and pulsations at your teeth and gums.  And brushing the teeth in the front of your mouth may result in splattering of toothpaste around the room if you don&#x27;t keep your mouth closed!  Only time will tell if it results in better gum health, as purported in some of their ads.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush, everytime I use it I feel like I just got a cleaning from my dentist. Your whole mouth feels tingly, fresh and super clean. It feels so good that sometimes I go into, what I can only describe as a mini trance during the 2 minute cycle. I know that sounds weird, but you just have to try it. Not only that but my teeth are whiter and healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been, and without all the crazy whitening products. This was some of best money I ever spent.</li>
    <li> I was a Braun electric brush user for about five years when I tried the Sonicare. It was a gift, and I was skeptical. In fact, I had tried a friend&#x27;s non-Elite Sonicare in the past and did not like it. But this brush is far superior than anything I have ever used before. Even after two brushings, my teeth felt as good as after a professional cleaning. Now, after using this brush for six months, my hygienist tells me my gum measurements are down from 4.5mm to 3mm -- a big improvement! This brush is expensive, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quad timer is a great feature and keeps you brushing for the full two minutes. The one problem with this brush is that it tickles your gums like crazy when you first start using it. It comes with a starter mode to ramp up the brush speed over the first 15 brushings. I still had a slightly hard time starting up with it, though.</li>
    <li> This power toothbrush is the greatest.  My teeth never feel this clean except right after my dental visit twice a year.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We purchased this electric tooth brush at the recommendation and insistence of our dentist. It takes a bit of time to become accustomed to and hopefully will reduce visits to our dentist!</li>
    <li> I purchased a new 7500 Elite on amazon.com in August 2004 after our old trusty original Sonicare gave out (it was 4 years old and the batteries would not hold charge anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one year the battery in this new 7500 Elite would not hold charge for more than a day and now in November 2005 would not even complete a full 2 min. brush cycle anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Phillips SOnicare Customer Support. They are quickly to get on the phone, you have to have the brush and charger at hand because they run you through a few tests. After the test they determined that the handle battery was defective and sent a brand new one without any questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAKE SURE TO SEND IN YOUR WARRANTY REGISTRATION WHEN YOU BUY ONE OF THESE !! The customer service rep immediately found my registration and purchase data and the warranty replacement was not problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: Brush is only a 3 because it is the best brush out there, but has a short battery life. Customer Service is a 5+ because you get a very helpful person very quickly on the phone and warranty is no problem if you registered your product at purchase. Thank you Phillips!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement handle also comes with a renewed full warranty!</li>
    <li> I have purchased my Sonicare over the holidays and me and my spouse have used it for couple of weeks. I found it to be very unpleasant - way too much vibration for my liking. It seems that electromagnetic field in the toothbrush is quite strong as well - after regular for couple of weeks, we have found that it could cause you to become more easily irritated. This might not be true for everyone but was true for us. We have returned our Sonicare toothbrush, and did switch to manual for now - but likelly switch back to Oral-B - we used to have one in the past.</li>
    <li> This is an upgrade from my Sonicare Optiva. We gave my inlaws an Elite for Christmas and I was impressed with the head design so I decided to try one for myself. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did. The new head is a lot less \\&quot;messy\\&quot; than my Optiva.</li>
    <li> I balked at the idea of spending $100 on a toothbrush, but it was probably some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent.  Yeah, OK, I admit, I&#x27;m not the most religious flosser, so I knew I needed to step up my dental care.  Of course this isn&#x27;t a substitute for flossing, but it is sure better than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feels so clean and my teeth look better.  I went to the dentist after two months of use and got a clean bill of health.  That&#x27;s worth the price right there.</li>
    <li> I bought this for more than $150 at my dentist. It worked well for about a year, though it does get pretty disgusting beneath the top half without fairly intensive cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a year of use, however, the switch broke. It wouldn&#x27;t turn off or on reliably. Now I&#x27;m SURE Philips would have happily replaced it under warranty. The problem is, I can&#x27;t be bothered with a toothbrush that adds that much complexity to my life. An iPod breaking is bad enough, a $100 plus toootbrush breaking is the proverbial straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t magically prevent the age related recession of my gums -- if it had I&#x27;d suffer the time drain. As it is, it&#x27;s back to the old toothbrush. I&#x27;ll spend the time I save dealing with the warranty on better gum care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets two stars because it does have a warranty, I just can&#x27;t stand to deal with it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a dentist and luckily we only stock oral-B in our office. why? many people i&#x27;ve talked to have had the same problem i had with the sonicare elite and that was the battery running out. i received mine free as a promotion anyhow, but i&#x27;m glad that i don&#x27;t have to repeatedly answer &#x27;why did you sell me an expensive piece of junk?&#x27; great toothbrush otherwise, i think that it cleans better than anything else out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I travel, and it holds it charge all week when I am on the road without having to recharge. My Dentist visits are much easier to take now that I use this toothbrush since I have so few problems with my gums and teeth. My gums are actually much better than they were before I bought this product.  &lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my Mom who has arthritis in her hands and has a hard time holding on to a smaller toothbrush. Now she can brush her teeth without any pain and her dentist tells her he can really tell the differnce.  &lt;br /&gt;We both love this product and highly recommend it!   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush. My dentist recommended it because I had problems with the skin around a couple of crowns always looking red and bleeding. No more! At first it felt very weird, but no longer. I would recommend it, and have, to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare brush is better than a regular brush. I am pleased with the product. One note, it claims to eliminate gum disease. I use it faithfully twice a day and floss, and I still have gum disease.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this model.  It&#x27;s my first time using one of these powered toothbrushes, and it simply doesn&#x27;t compare to manual brushing.  Sure, it&#x27;s rather expensive considering you can buy an Oral-B for [less], but you won&#x27;t regret it and your mouth will feel the difference.  In fact, I purchased two for relatives who also raved about it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toothbush is so much better than the old model. It fits in the mouth so much better and gets to places easily that would of been difficult to get to with the older model.  Great toothbrush I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Three years ago, I threw away my Oral B for a Sonicare, and I thought the Sonicare was far and away better than my Oral B.  The one dislike, however, was the relatively large head design, which made it a little difficult to reach the rear teeth.  About two weeks ago, I got a mailer from the people at Sonicare, announcing their &amp;quot;new and improved&amp;quot; Sonicare Elite model.  The ad said the new head design was angled, and featured a new design that clinical tests showed improved cleaning by about 20 percent over the older model.  So, I bought it; literally.  And after the first use, there is little doubt that the new Sonicare Elite is everything it&#x27;s said to be.  The new angled head and brush design make reaching every tooth easy.  And the powerful sonic brush strokes leave your teeth feeling like you&#x27;ve just had a cleaning at the dentists office.  This is one amazing toothbrush!  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why my dentist recommends Sonicare so highly, because the better oral health it provides obviously is cutting into his business. The price is a little high for the 7500 model.  The lower model is really a better value, since it includes all the functional features of the 7500.  This is just a truly amazing power toothbrush!</li>
    <li> The shape of brush is very ideal for our teeth. The bristles are softer than other brands. I love the brushing effect. Besides, the handle is also good for me.</li>
    <li> I received fast and correct service. Following an inquiry for related information, I received prompt and excellent email communications. Great job Trading Crew!</li>
    <li> Yes, this thing works as advertised and as well as the people who rave about it say. You should be warned the power put out by the motor in this thing has you feeling like you&#x27;re brushing your teeth with a chain saw at first. Not to worry, you&#x27;ll get used to it.       Here&#x27;s the &#x27;But&#x27;: When the rechargeable battery dies (in my case, after about two years of use), YOU CAN&#x27;T REPLACE IT -- you&#x27;re stuck having to buy a whole new unit.       Not wanting to believe this, I went to the Sonicare Website, and found precious little information and no apologies. All I found was an admonition to not attempt replacing the battery.       Call me a tight wad, but I think having to replace a $100+ toothbrush every couple of years is a tad bogus.       Philips/Sonicare, you need to correct this issue.</li>
    <li> Buy this toothbrush! My teeth are whiter, gums healthier and breath fresher. You will notice the difference between this and other products and/or models immediately. Try it once and you will be hooked, I guarantee it. So what are you waiting for silly DONT BE A YUCK MOUTH buy one today.</li>
    <li> All Sonicare toothbrushes have the same fundamental flaws. The design of the brush head allows water and toothpaste get inside the handle which must be cleaned out frequently or it will develop a foul odor. Brush heads are only changed every six months which is not very hygienic. There are two small magnets on the bottom of the brush head that easily come off. Sonicare continues to use NI-Cad batteries in every model. These same flaws are even present in the new Sonicare Intelliclean 8000 series which can only be bought at the dentist or directly from Sonicare. It is just like the Elite 7500 but you must buy these Crest toothpaste cartridges since the toothbrush despenses the toothpaste. So not only will you have to buy those poorly designed brush heads but you will have to buy those Crest cartridges too. The new Sonicare 8000 series will be in stores Spring 2005. Go to Sonicare.com for more info. Unless Sonicare fixes these flaws I would not recommend any Sonicare model period!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I have a tendancy to brush too hard and hoped it would help stop that. It did. It also made my teeth noticably whiter and made brushing fun. Everytime I brush I feel like I have just left the dentists office.</li>
    <li> Once acclimated to this product, brushing becomes an adventure. Small children have an initial fear of this product so that takes some coaxing. I believe the benefits received are worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite is the best way to dental health available today. It seems expensive at first but does a wonderful job in just two minutes a day. You will have cleaner teeth and healthier gums if you use this product TOGETHER with flossing! No, you do not get to go away from flossing nor do any of the electric flossers such as the Oral-B Hummingbird work in place of good old floss. I was unable to get in for my regular cleaning for over a year. No problems with the Sonicare. I don&#x27;t recommend this as a practice, but it is good to know that the Sonicare Elite is that good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare Elite comes essentially in half when you separate the base from the brush. This allows for easy and compact packing in the rigid plastic case provided. Since the unit runs for well over two weeks on a charge, you can charge it and go on vacation without having to worry about taking your charger or voltage converters for overseas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Use this for 30 days and you will never go back to another way of brushing again!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Sonic Elite 7500 after my old (10 years) Sonicare finally passed away. My dentist recommended the sonicare system.  I like the smaller brush and the timing device, which allows for 30 seconds of brushing on each quantrant.  The Sonic Elite also comes with a travel case which makes it easy to pack without damage.</li>
    <li> I bought my Sonicare about a year ago, and only used it maybe 6 months of that year.  Batteries are dead, and completely non-replacable, toxic, and a pain in the ass to get to a recycling plant.  I&#x27;ll never buy another Sonicare product.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush you will ever need. It is one of those things that feels like you are taking TOO good care of yourself after you brush with the sonicare elite. It makes you want to go back in time and start flossing every day instead of once in a while.</li>
    <li> This product is a big improvement on my original sonicare toothbrush with features that measure the amount of charge left; a two minute program for ensuring you brush well enough with 30 second beeps in between. I originally bought a lesser model for about $30.00 more at Walgreens but returned it after reviewing Sonicares website and then finding this model on Amazon. Great purchase</li>
    <li> Well, I just went on a vacation to Asia and I took my Sonicare WITHOUT the charger. I figured it would probably last two weeks with no problem. Silly me, it died after a week! Actually, I was just curious to see how long it could go, but it was no fun going back to my backup toothbrush. Life can be so hard. ;-) Seriously, I really do love this product and I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer. About a year after I started using it, a dental technician commented that my teeth seemed to be getting whiter, something I attribute to my Sonicare. Now I&#x27;ll just have to remember to bring the charger on those long trips...</li>
    <li> I used to brush my teeth with an old manual toothbrush and then my brother told me to get a Crest spinbrush because they worked so well. Using the spare brush head I tried his spinbrush and was convinced that it did a great job. So I got one of my own. Then about 2 years later my girlfriend told me that I should try the sonicare and I replied that I already had the best toothbrush on the market but she insisted that I try the sonicare. I figured what have I got to lose so using the spare head that comes with the toothbrush I tried her sonicare 7300. I was very surprised to find that it did an even better job than my Crest spinbrush. I immediately purchased my own because I can&#x27;t spend every night at my girlfriends house and therefore I cannot use her toothbrush every day and night. You would be hard pressed to convince me that there is a better toothbrush available on the market. I have read complaints about the batteries in these reviews but I have not had any problems with mine. I can only attribute that to a few lemons in the lot. My girlfriend has had hers for over two years and it still works just fine. Yes it is pricey but well worth the money afterall what is more important your money or your teeth? Remember you can always earn more money but you can never get more teeth. JUST BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I just got the Elite 7500 and it sure does seem to do a nice job of brushing my teeth. It feels kind of funny when it is brushing, but the manual says you ge tused to that. The manual also says that it beeps when you turn it on, and after every 30 seconds of use. It *does not* beep at all. I called Phillips and they told me the manual is wrong and there is no beeper built into it. The Quadrapacer feature just makes the toothbrush stop for a second or two - it does not beep as the manual says. It is not a  big deal, but the first time I used it, I kept it in one part of my mouth waiting for the beep, which never came. Just something to be aware of.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush.  I like the way it makes my mouth feel after brushing, but I would like to address this question to the Phillips folks:  Other than simple greed, is there any other reason why you would design, market and sell a $100.00 toothbrush that must be thrown away when its rechargeable batteries lose their ability to hold a charge?  Is there some reason that you don&#x27;t include this information in your advertising of the product? And as far as a single charge lasting up to two weeks of \\&quot;normal\\&quot; brushing, this is a bit of advertising hyperbole at best.  While carefully following the initial charging instructions with my two toothbrushes, I have rarely gotten more than a weeks use (brushing twice a day for 2 minutes each session) from either battery.  It is a nice product, but it would be better if you could slap a couple of rechargeable nicads in the handle when the old batteries no longer hold a charge rather than throwing the whole thing away.  I stumbled across this review googling another matter.  Guess I should be fair to the Phillips folks and revise my initial assessment.  The original review was written in 2006, and as of February 6, 2012, I am still using both toothbrushes, although I alternate use and charge cycles. A five year life on the units makes the initial cost much more reasonable, and I believe that the cost for new a new unit has come down a few bucks in the intervening years.  Now about the issue of those replacement brushes........</li>
    <li> I go to the dentist regularly, but as I get older (I&#x27;m 55) I obviously have more dental problems. On my last trip to the dentist the dental assistant noted that I was starting to get gum disease. When she cleaned my teeth, my gums bled like crazy. The dental assistant suggested that I go to a gum specialist.    Instead of doing that I bought this toothbrush. The promo for it said that it could wipe away plaque (and thus protect the gums) and it could also help to rejuvenate the gums.     That was a few months ago.    Well, I went to the dentist today for a regular cleaning and check up and apparently the toothbrush worked. The dental assistant said that difference was obvious. The cleaning (which usually is a long and tedious affair) was over relatively quickly since there was much less plaque build up. My gums barely bled at all. The dentist didn&#x27;t even bother to measure the gum line since apparently the gum disease was reversing.     You can&#x27;t argue with success.    Another reviewer wrote about gunk build up in the handle. That is true but cleaning the toothbrush is not difficult and I don&#x27;t find that to be much of a bother.     A couple of reviewers note the short battery life of the rechargeable battery. I haven&#x27;t had the toothbrush long enough to find that out but I&#x27;ll assume that it is true. It&#x27;s a legitimate gripe and I agree that it would be better for Sonicare to sell new rechargeable batteries, rather than make you buy a completely new unit. However, I&#x27;ll pay the extra money to be able to stay away from gum disease.</li>
    <li> After seeing some relatives spend well over $10,000 each having their neglected teeth and gums repaired, I decided that I have better uses for my money, and resolved never to skimp on preventive dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why this Sonicare is the most frugal product I&#x27;ve bought. This toothbrush is plain amazing. Of course it cleans your teeth fabulously and leaves your mouth with that just-got-my-annual-cleaning feeling. You&#x27;d expect that. But one thing very few people note about the Sonicare is how well it cleans your *gums*, and that may be even more valuable. It&#x27;s designed to get under your gums (be sure to read the instructions, as you don&#x27;t use the Sonicare like an ordinary toothbrush), and it&#x27;s amazing at preventing plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I switched to the Elite several years ago, I used the Sonicare Advance for about 5 years. This brush is so superior in every way. It doesn&#x27;t get gunk caked in the handle, the base doesn&#x27;t get uncleanable crud in it, the motor is smoother and has a setting for Sonicare beginners that allows you to get used to the system slowly... and the battery is in another league. I had to replace my Advance after a couple years because of battery issues; this one is still going strong years after I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use for this Sonicare is cleaning orthodonture. You can&#x27;t brush under braces with a spinning head like the Oral-B&#x27;s. This head vibrates, so you can push it down into your morass of oral wires and it miraculously dislodges all the hidden food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want proof that this brush rocks? I recently mentioned to my orthodontist that I&#x27;d graduated from high school in 1983, and she said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re not that old.\\&quot; \\&quot;Yes, I&#x27;m 40,\\&quot; I said. She actually checked my chart! \\&quot;Well, your teeth and gums look like they belong to someone in their 20s!\\&quot; she concluded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few bucks now, and use your retirement money on vacations instead of putting your dentist&#x27;s kids through grad school. Spring for a quality toothbrush. It&#x27;s really, really worth it.r a quality toothbrush. It&#x27;s really, really worth it.</li>
    <li> On a recent visit, my sister told me about her SoniCare Toothbrush and how great it was.  On her recommendation, I ordered one. I am pleased beyond all expectation!  The automatic beep every 30 seconds help you evenly divide your brushing time between quadrants of your mouth.  Also, the results are just great.  You may not be my sister, but let me recommend it to you, too.</li>
    <li> This brush is worth every penny. At first, I was skeptical about spending so much on a toothbrush. Then, I had a little tooth problem that cost me three grand at the dentist&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for what it can save you from! The quadpacer is an excellent feature. If you&#x27;ve tried other [$$$] brushes that you find in department stores, it is difficult to appreciate how much better this unit is...without trying it. The unit came with 2 brush heads, a really short manual, and a blue carrying case. Using it each day gives you that clean feeling that you normally get when you return from your dentist...after a pricy cleaning. You won&#x27;t regret the investment. Highly highly highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit to replace an old Advance series that finally died.  I thought I&#x27;d be getting a better unit with more features and to a large extent, this is true.  However, the brush head is quite large and is too big for my mouth.  The old Advance unit had a compact brush head available and it was wonderful.  I contacted Sonicare and they have no plans to make a smaller brush for the Elite.  That&#x27;s too bad.  It makes  what could be a great product into a mediocre one.  It&#x27;s hard to get your teeth clean if the brush doesn&#x27;t touch them.  The brush head is so large, I can&#x27;t get the inside surface of my teeth as clean as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  - Major reason to buy Elite rather than (Sonicare) Advance:  brush head on Elite has many fewer nooks and crannies that can foster bacteria.  After I switched to Elite, I noticed how many hard to clean areas there were on the Advance brush head -- yuck. &lt;br /&gt;- Teeth feel very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; after use.  More so than with a disposable. &lt;br /&gt;- Charge lasts an extremely long time.  I&#x27;ve taken it on 8 day vacations without the base. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  This might be largely due to how I use (abuse) the product, but I find the brush heads only last me a maximum of 3 months, instead of the suggested 6 months.  Spoke to a Philips rep and they indicated I am applying way too much pressure.  Makes sense, I&#x27;ll be more gentle, but still not sure I&#x27;ll make 6 months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Advisory note:  If you use a peroxide/baking soda toothpaste, make extra sure to keep the handle clean.  The chemical composition of the toothpaste can actually cause the plastic handle to crack over time!  Philips is aware of this and has adjusted the makeup of the plastic.  Nevertheless, I did experience this on the Elite (issue resolved satisfactorily).</li>
    <li> WOW! The second I pushed the start button on my new Sonicare my eyes opened way, way up. I couldn&#x27;t believe the feeling. I just guided the brush and let it do it&#x27;s thing. The timer is great too. Afterwards, my mouth just tingled. Before I bought the Sonicare, I read many reviews and went through the consumer reports. My dentist highly recommended this product as well. It did not disappoint. I don&#x27;t know why some consumers had problems with this product as far as keeping things clean. It&#x27;s a snap. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!  It makes my mouth feel like a mid-winter nor easter ripped thru it...   In a good way! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;People are noticing my whiter teeth and I didn&#x27;t even tell them I had the Sonicare.  I spoke to a few dentists and orthodontists in the last month and all of them have this same product and they love it.  If it works for them it must be good. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item. Its battery cannot be replace what so ever. Like any other electronic products, its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program. Mine lasted about 6 months, at this rate...we&#x27;re going to end up tones of these in our landfill. It is irresponsible to produce products like this. If I had known about this I would never have bought it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff. Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare cleans better than any brush I&#x27;ve had, including Oral-B, by far. Your teeth feel great and your gums too. Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rota-dent and I love this electric toothbrush but it only lasted 1.5 yr because of corrosion (lifetime warranty does not cover corrosion), so I got Sonciare Elite 7500. Big change!! With Sonicare, I can feel the high speed vibrations throughout the whole unit, my hand and my mouth. I don&#x27;t know if this sonic vibration is good for your bones. The vibration is minimal but it&#x27;s there. The good thing about Sonicare is that I can&#x27;t see any exposed metal on the unit, it uses magnetism to create the vibrations and to recharge the unit, so I supposed it&#x27;ll last longer than the corrosion-prone Rota-dent. I prefer the Rota-dent(lower speed rotating head) because it&#x27;s gentler on my teeth, Sonicare feels like a drilling experience at the dentist office. I estimate I&#x27;ll be with this unit for 2 years before I try the Oral-B. If you do research on the internet, many people praise Sonicare but I was disappointed, I really didn&#x27;t expect a  drill in my mouth. As for which brand is most effective, I&#x27;m not sure but many people praise Sonicare so i&#x27;ll stick with it. Rota-dent is only available through the dental office, expect to pay $80 every 1-2 yr for a replacement due to corrosion.</li>
    <li> This thing works like a charm. My teeth feel clean and delicious.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used it twice so far since yesterday and i noticed a huge difference already. it massages your gums which makes your whole mouth feel really good and i notice my teeth whiter already. definitely worth the $.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had all kinds of electric toothbrushes ... going all the way back to the first Water-Pik which gave a shower more than a teeth cleaning. I have never had a better brush, and because it feels good, one doesn&#x27;t skip brushing. And because I haven&#x27;t skipped brushing, my last checkup almost (underline \\&quot;almost\\&quot;) didn&#x27;t call for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one person uses it, the battery will last 5 days, maybe 6. Although the brushes are easily changed, we decided to buy two of these and just leave our individual brushes attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recommendation to Sonicare: use brighter colors on the replacement brushes. It&#x27;s difficult to determine the difference between any two bush heads. Another reason to get two. I can never go back to a regular brush ... or even my old Braun.</li>
    <li> A dental hygientist recommended this power toothbrush too me.  I purchased it and found it to be an outstanding piece of equipment.  After every use you feel like your teeth are as clean as when you walk out of the dentist&#x27;s office.  I was so pleased with the performance of the Sonicare Elite 7500 that I purchased one for my wife.  It is expensive but the value you get is worth the cost.  This review is based on two months of use, so I can not comment on how well this power toothbrush will hold up over several years, but it does look sturdy despite its small size.</li>
    <li> This model of the sonicare does everything it claims to do, and it does it well.  It seems to have the lasting power and all of the \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; features which allow for accurate timing and duration of tooth brushing.  Additionally, the \\&quot;ramp up\\&quot; feature for new users is a nice touch to get people comfortable with the vibrations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned, the first one lasted seven years and the battery finally stopped holding much of a charge.  I would definitely buy additional toothbrushes of this type.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, but water can collect under the brush head and ugly stuff will grow if you don&#x27;t regularly take off the brush head to air it out.  A bit of a hassle.  I&#x27;ve had the brush over a year and my wife has an Oral-B.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting an Oral-B for myself when it&#x27;s time to get new brush heads (yes I&#x27;ve changed them over the time I&#x27;ve had the brush).</li>
    <li> I bought the 7500 to replace an older Sonicare that would not hold a charge long enough to brush my teeth. I remember how happy I was with my original Sonicare when I first got it. I didn&#x27;t think I would have that feeling again, since I was an experienced user. It does seem like a lot of money for \\&quot;a toothbrush\\&quot;, but this newer model is lighter and easier to move around, and it does feel stimulating again. It was a great buy. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had such a nice experience with Sonicare that I felt compelled to write my 1st ever review on Amazon.      They have great customer support- they sent me a new brush after my 1st one failed within the warranty time period.  No runaround at all either.    Also this brush cleans better than my other electric toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t recommend this brush enough.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for about six years and I loved it.  I can even do without floshing with the Sonicare.  But I was using the old one, i.e. the 4100.  Recently my beloved 4100 is breaking down.  I can switch it on, sometimes pressing several times to do so; but I can&#x27;t switch it off. I have to wait until the two minutes is up. So I bought a new one.  First the battery operated one, then the new 7100.  I found them both unbearable. They are very noisy and very rough.  I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s just me or what.  It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.  The old one is so gentle and quiet, but the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; new one is so rough.  Am I missing something?  I would like to have the company to explain why they \\&quot;improve\\&quot; a good product in such a way.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothbrush.  My teeth never felt cleaner and I was happy knowing that I was brushing my teeth for an appropriate amount of time.  However, after treating my beloved toothbrush with kid gloves for about two years, it up and died on me!     My dentist told me that I was brushing too hard and my gums were receding at an alarming rate.  He told me to begin using a special soft-bristled brush that he gave me.  It was a regular manual brush.  So, my Sonicare sat on the bathroom shelf on its little charger for about 3 months.  When I tried to use it after a 3-month break, it worked for about two seconds, and then gave a long \\&quot;beeeeep!\\&quot;  I thought that maybe I had overcharged it, so I let it sit off the charger for a day.  No change.  Three weeks of trying everything I could think of (replacing the head, cleaning it, various charger/non-charger positions) it still doesn&#x27;t work.    I got two great years out of this toothbrush.  However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right match for me because my gums have begun receding so badly (my roots are exposed in all 4 quadrants and I am experiencing severe sensitivity to cold and sweets).  Besides, who wants to spend over $100 on brushes, special paste, and heads if it only lasts 2 years? No, thanks!</li>
    <li> The sonicare toothbrush is great for getting your teeth really clean and preventing plaque build-up without the worry of gum erosion you have with normal toothbrushes. You just need to be diligent in changing out the brush portion of the toothbrush, since you won&#x27;t see or feel the deterioration of the brush over time since you are not putting pressure on your teeth when you use the toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had my sonicare system for almost three years and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great for cleaning.  My teeth feel so much cleaner than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it, and I said, &amp;quot;a 100 toothbrush? Are you crazy?&amp;quot; Turns out it was well worth it! I never realized what a chore it is to brush your teeth, but not with this one! It does all the work for you. It feels like you just had a cleaning everyday! Been using it for 6 months and back to dentist who said I had hardly any plaque at all. I sent one to my Dad for his birthday and he LOVES it. Now I am sending one to Mom for her birthday.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Advance (which I loved and have used for a couple of years) still works great but the Elite model is much better (for me). The narrower and angled design of the brush shaft on the Elite makes it much easier to reach the molars than the earlier design.&lt;br /&gt;It seems pretty clear that they could have simply designed an new type of brush head to fit the old body (they are almost identical) but of course they want us all to buy new ones... Bottom line: I&#x27;m glad I did. If you&#x27;ve never bought an &amp;quot;electric toothbrush&amp;quot; before, this is the one to get. It&#x27;s the best by far of any I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews and talking to a user I know, I bought a Sonicare for myself and one for my mother. After using mine for 3 weeks I realize I made a big mistake. I was given to believe that this &amp;quot;ultrasonic&amp;quot; technology would not only replace flossing but be better than flossing since, supposedly, the brush can remove plaque 5mm beyond the reach of the brush, besides removing 98% of all plaque. Frankly, I don&#x27;t believe those claims anymore.&lt;br /&gt;After using 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve found that the brush didn&#x27;t clean any better than an ordinary half-as-expensive electric toothbrush. Actually, my teeth feel distinctly cleaner after using the much cheaper brush for 2 minutes. Also, much more important, the Sonicare left plaque that irritated my gums and could only be removed by flossing. When I finally did floss just now, my gums bled quite a bit (as much as they ever have after not flossing for more than a few weeks), indicating that the Sonicare was doing nothing for my gums. Only flossing, it seems, can do what flossing can do.&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare is over-hyped, it seems. If it is the last word in &amp;quot;untrasonic&amp;quot; toothbrushing, then that&#x27;s the last I&#x27;ll use an untrasonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;Back to flossing. And, with flossing, one can use any old toothbrush to do the full job, though I do like my old, tired Oral-B electric &amp;quot;sub&amp;quot;-sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;I like the timing feature and will still use the brush. It does a decent job, just not nearly what is advertised!&lt;br /&gt;I would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> ...&lt;br /&gt;Oh my GOD!  This thing is FANTASTIC!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This was like getting a whole head full of NEW TEETH!&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the most incredible products I have ever used or discovered!&lt;br /&gt;This experience is so entirely revolutionary, you can hardly say that it&#x27;s like brushing your teeth at all -- it&#x27;s a NEW tooth-brushing experience.  &lt;br /&gt;If you want to try out a new set of teeth for yourself, try this baby out.  And if you want to experience that same level of intense NEW-NESS with something you consider to be old hat or mundane on a more \\&quot;personal\\&quot; level, check out the \\&quot;New Sex Now\\&quot; dvd -- this simple system for easy sexual power and mastery will blow your mind when it revolutionizes your sexlife just as much as this TOOTHBRUSH!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush takes some getting used to.  I have used the Oral B electric toothbrush for years before I tried the Sonicare so it was a big difference.  The Sonicare seems louder and you have to be careful when brushing because the vibration of the toothbrush is pretty powerful.  Overall, I am pleased with it, but it takes some time to get used to.  I think I do prefer Oral B&#x27;s smaller head to the Sonicare head though.</li>
    <li> If you are thinking about getting a power toothbrush, please do not put it off, this is an awesome product.  My gums and teeth feel so much better.  Also, it times how long you must brush your teeth so no more guessing.</li>
    <li> I love my new Sonicare.  My teeth and gums have never been cleaner.  My husband and I have noticed a big difference in the condition of our teeth since we purchased it. &lt;br /&gt;My problem is with cleaning it after use.  I&#x27;ve tried using q tips, cotton, etc. because it says that you shouldn&#x27;t run it under water.  If you don&#x27;t clean it out it gets quite fowl.  I wish there was an easier way to keep it clean.  It takes too much time in the morning to try to get into the crevises of the brush to clean it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this because it has really helped to improve the condition of my teeth and gums.  But maintainence and battery charging problems (I&#x27;ve read this from other reviewers) may make me look for another brand once the battery is dead. For the money I spent, I shouldn&#x27;t have any worries.</li>
    <li> I have owned the previous model of Sonicare before this one and it was prett good.  However, it was hard to reach all of the areas of my mouth with the big head on it.  For some reason it also died out on me after a little over a year.  It would turn on and then just immediately shut off? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This got me to switch to Oral B&#x27;s electric spin brush.  This thing totally sucked.  It did a whole lot of spinning and vibration but didn&#x27;t really do much in affect except make my gums bleed often. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just threw it out after a month and bought the new Sonicare figuring it was pretty good before.  I have got to tell you - it was like going from a pick up truck to a Porsche.  This new toothbrush head was amazing and so much smaller.  I could now reach every part of my mouth with ease.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and then only thing I would ask to be improved is creating some way of letting you know when the brush head is ready to be replaced.  That would help a lot.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! the angle and small brush lets me get behind my front teeth for that squeeky clean feeling! Much better then the ole sonicare i had!</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews that claimed this toothbrush made you feel like you just came from the dentist&#x27;s office, and I thought they were exaggerating.  The claims were true.  I have been using my elite 7500 for the last 3 months and I love it.  Occasionally I have to resort to a manual toothbrush when I am at work and boy can I tell the difference.  I would definitely purchase the same toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> My dentist tells me that my teeth are much cleaner than most patients.  I think its because of the toothbrush.  Its a great brush.  Long battery life.  The only that I dont like about it is that I wish they made a head that was slightly larger, but you get used to the smaller one in a little while.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush after my dentist specifically recommended I get a Sonicare Elite model.  I like the design and it seems to be very well constructed.  Particularly impressive is the recharging portion of the toothbrush; it does not have any metal contacts that might rust with water exposure.  Instead, it recharges through an electric field that is trasmitted by the base to the toothbrush.  This allows everything to be completely water-sealed.  It is comfortable to hold in the hand and is easy to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as performance goes, it certainly seems to do a very good job cleaning my teeth though I&#x27;ll have to wait for final confirmation of that when I next visit my dentist.  At the very least, it forces you to brush for two minutes from the built-in timer which was something that I never did prior to getting the Sonicare.  My teeth feel very clean at the end almost as if I&#x27;ve just had a hygiene cleaning.  During the first week, it takes a few days to get completely used to the sonic waves which can tickle and cause tingling with your gums.  You get used to it quickly however. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this model; it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> All the positive reviews here are true, it feels like I&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning after I brush with it.  I can think of nothing negative about it.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore my Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  I can get up in the morning and brush my teeth without thinking about it.  The 30 second quadrant reminder helps me remember to brush each quadrant front and back.  Sometimes, if I am reading or not paying close enough attention, I will have to push the one button three or four times, hence my teeth and gums are in the best shape of my life.  Keep your own teeth for life with a Sonicare Toothbrush.  I swear by mine. You will too.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  I have had it for 3 years now and would buy another.  Cleans my teeth much better than the manual toothbrush.  Also, the other electronic toothbrushes are not as efficent.</li>
    <li> I must echo other reviewers who have criticized the terrible performance of the \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; batteries in this device. I loved the results of the cleaning but can&#x27;t abide the fact that the batteries died (i.e., simply could not hold any amount of charge) right around the 2-year mark (coincidentally when warranties expire!).  The fact that the batteries cannot be swapped out is truly appalling and can&#x27;t be viewed as anything but a major rip-off of customers by a greedy corporation.  Despite really enjoying the cleaning functions, I can&#x27;t support buying a replacement brush knowing that the dead-battery problem will recur. It&#x27;s simply a bad investment. Sorry, but this is one brand that will not enjoy my consumer loyalty. I&#x27;m truly disappointed to have to write this.    Important note to other toothbrush owners: please don&#x27;t throw an expended toothbrush in the trash where the toxic battery compounds will leach out - there are official means of recycling the batteries so their contents don&#x27;t pollute our groundwater and environment. See [...] (link provided on the Sonicare website). Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for keeping gum disease in check.</li>
    <li> Great product! Arrived sooner than expected.. I had one before this one so I knew what I was getting. This seller is great! Product as described. Packaging was good. I am very pleased! Thank you.</li>
    <li> As a dentist, I have tried this toothbrush as well as other electric toothbrush, such as Oral-B.  Unlike other rotary toothbrush, this one is unique because of its high frequency of brushing strokes(31,000/min).  It is more efficient than other similiar products.&lt;br /&gt;However, I believe that a regular toothbrush can clean as well as any electric toothbrush.  It&#x27;s like driving a car with automative transmission vs manual.  Both can take you to the same destination.  Electric toothbrush does make one&#x27;s life easier if one spends the time to use it correctly.  And an electric toothbrush&#x27;s coolness provides some motivation.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is a fine product, but it does come with a high price tag.  If you are willing to spend the money, this is probably the best electric toothbrush out there.  Take the time to brush your teeth, even if you are using a electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble with deep gum pockets that have increased dangerously to an 8 depth.  The dentist had put me on a 4 month schedule to make sure he kept a good eye on it.  I got the Elite about month ago and went in for my appointment yesterday.  My 8 pockets had decreased to 5, 5 to 3 etc.  This was the first time in the last 5 years they have decreased.  The Elite seems to have cleared up my problem and only after a month.  I never used the old Sonciare but I have been using a cheaper competitive model so I have to say this is far superior based on the results.  My teeth also feel much cleaner and the smaller angled brushhead make it easy to get the backs of my teeth.  Sonicare took a long time to update their model but they obviously weren&#x27;t just sitting around.</li>
    <li> I have what I call PTDSD (Post Traumatic Dental Stress Disorder). I have horrible teeth that require lots of fillings and root canals. The dental work with novacaine can be bad enough and the cleanings themselves can be such an event! (and I have one of the best dentists around) Since Sonicare offers a 28 day, money-back guarantee, I bought this toothbrush four weeks before my teeth cleaning appointment. &lt;br /&gt;The features of the toothbrush are great! After just the first use, my teeth felt awesome! I was worried the constant vibration in my mouth would be annoying or painful but it wasn&#x27;t. It is preprogrammed to gradually increase to full speed during the first week you use it. It also has a button so you can keep in on the lower speed setting if that&#x27;s your preference. You get used to the movement but it can take a few times to remember to keep the toothbrush in your mouth when it&#x27;s on - or you constantly clean the mirror of splattered toothpaste.  The size and design are comfortable and effective. The charge indicator and plastic travel box make it a breeze to take with you on trips. It has a built in timer that keeps track of the dentist-recommended 2 minutes you are supposed to spend brushing your teeth. It breaks the two minutes into 30 second intervals so you spend an equal amount of time on each section of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;So how did the cleaning go??? The hygenist said I was almost completely plaque and tartar free (honestly, I need to floss more). The toothbrush proved itself worth the investment. It would be an even greater investment for a couple or family because you can buy one Sonicare and then as many brush heads as needed. &lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: the cost of the toothbrush pays for itself in the money (and stress) you&#x27;ll save from dental appointments.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my dentist a few months ago and it works great.  My teeth are whiter and feel cleaner... can definately notice a difference after one month of daily use.  I havent tried the other models, but would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Sonicare Elite to anyone who enjoys thoroughly clean teeth. The hygienist noticed the difference in my teeth since my last cleaning. It is far superior to anthing else on the market that I have tried.  The built-in timer is a great incentive to brush for the full 2 minutes recommended by dentists.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 is truly a good product. My dentist recommended it and I don&#x27;t have any regrets paying so much for this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used another brand of electric toothbrush for several years and I can tell the difference now that I&#x27;m using the Sonicare. My teeth feels and looks cleaner and my gums are healthier. I especially like the &amp;quot;2-minute&amp;quot; feature.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal user for years of the original Sonicare before it was sold to Phillips who designed this model. It worked wonders as I had no cavities for 5 years and no gum problem. Since \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; to the 7500 I have gotten 1 cavity (on a receding gum area) and a detached gum using the \\&quot;new model 7500. I attribute this to a smaller brush head which is a poor design that \\&quot;overvibrates\\&quot; on a smaller area loosening up the gums causing them to recede. The original Sonlcare cleaned over a wider area with a flat brush to evenly spread out the vibrations. I wonder if the original inventor had a hand in this \\&quot;improved\\&quot; model? If it ain&#x27;t broken don&#x27;t fix it! If you are a dentist or gum specialist,please take notice!!</li>
    <li> Be careful because you will waste time and money ordering replacement heads.  You won&#x27;t be able to tell what kind of toothbrush you have, because Philips doesn&#x27;t indicate it on the toothbrush, so you have to guess when you reorder.  Philips wins on this, but you lose.</li>
    <li> I have owned three different types of electric-powered toothbrushes: 1) The Interplak - original 2) The Dental Revolution - Twin Rotating Cylinders (in parallel) 3) The Sonicare Elite 7500.  1) About six months after the original Interplak was introduced I watched the macro-animation of it&#x27;s working principal on TV and was impressed with the reversing, opposed spin of the individual brush tufts and could see how this action would enable the bristles to do a deep cleaning. Bausch &amp; Lomb manufacturing it was a further inducement and my chronically bleeding gums were the decisive factor in deciding to purchase the revolutionary new brush (more on that later).   Back then, the hundred-buck investment in this exotic new technology was thought by most to be foolhardy or quixotic. Much like the change in thought where organic foods are concerned, today we find most everyone either owning or considering the purchase of an electric toothbrush. Along the same line (as Dick Cabot narrates in \\&quot;Remember When - It&#x27;ll Never Fly\\&quot;) the original efforts at powering riverboats with steam engines were almost universally scoffed at. I imagine our Neolithic forbearers faced the same sort of resistance to the idea of the wheel.  Although my original Interplak did a fantastic job of cleaning my teeth; stemming the chronic blood flow and almost eliminating the need for flossing, it needed lots of charging and failed after half a year. (Truth is I sort of \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; to pay for it when I noticed that all the cashiers at Best Products seemed to be having a conference outside the store about what brand of cigarette it was best not to smoke, so I found it hard to feel very bad about the short life span.) A free replacement was available from a B&amp;L service center in Sacramento, just 40 miles from my home in Placerville, Ca. but the frequent need for charging and short life span, respectively, became an irritating and a recurrent problem .     I reverted to a manual toothbrush for a number of yearsand was pleased to find that they had improved the designs.    2) Still yearning for a reliable power toothbrush, I eventually bid on and won a Dental Revolution power toothbrush for a bit over forty bucks. The principal was said to incorporate dentists&#x27; \\&quot;most recommended &#x27;Bass Method&#x27; \\&quot; and consisted of two cylindrical brushes in the head rotating in opposition to each other on shafts flexible enough to allow them to flex over teeth while exerting adequate pressure for the bristles to get (somewhat) into crevices. The head was of surprising quality and did not wear noticeably over the three and half months I used it. I was impressed with its efficiency, quietness and battery life in the short time I used it and found that replacement heads were available at a reasonable price from a website mentioned in the literature.   3) I \\&quot;graduated\\&quot; to a Sonicare Elite7500 about a half a year ago and found, almost immediately, that it would remove material from between my teeth that the D.R. had left behind. I am basically happy with the Sonicare 7500 and will elucidate below.    This brush will give some dozen or more full power brushings with a single full charge and using it for long periods without recharging promotes deep battery charges. I rarely return it to the charging base for this reason and, when I do, the five LED charging lights are a great feature for getting the charge level at a glance. The heads last over four months for me, using it about once a day for two and a half minutes. The long, thin, angled shaft on the head makes it easy to reach all the way to the rear of the back teeth and holding it in a relaxed, fingers only grip, is comfortable and becomes natural.  On the con side, the unit is expensive at over a hundred bucks. The timer that cuts off the head power after two minutes is a minor nuisance if, like me, you like to decide for yourself when to stop the brushing period but the four timed beeps make up for it and you get to knowing about when it will cut off and can turn it back on quickly.  I particularly dislike the vibration of this brush when you touch any part of the hard plastic shaft to a tooth, which, with adequate pressure on the head, will happen unless you take excruciating care about the head angle at all times. Probably just my quibble though.  Which gets me to what, in my view, is one of the most important topics concerning this brush. The literature tells you to use \\&quot;fingers only pressure\\&quot; and, while accurate as far as it goes, this can be misleading. To clean adequately and thoroughly the pressure should be some five to seven pounds (my approximation based on years of adjusting the trigger pulls on handguns and rifles and using a gage [spring based scale] to test my adjustments). If you are using adequate pressure there will be very little left behind for flossing to remove. On the other hand, neglecting flossing is a practice you will eventually regret. In addition, your teeth should feel very clean if you run your tongue over them; if you can feel spots that are less than \\&quot;slick\\&quot; then the you&#x60;re using inadequate pressure.  On the matter of cost there is the contrast of the cost of having even minor \\&quot;corrective\\&quot; dental work done. How many of us, facing the reality of a damaged mouth and extensive dental work, wouldn&#x27;t opt to go back and use a good tool on an adequate, regular basis if we could? This is not to say that thorough oral hygiene will not be obtained using a good manual toothbrush and brushing technique and flossing adequately afterward. I&#x27;ve recently incorporated a dropper applied \\&quot;enzymatic\\&quot; dentifrice (20 drops), like it, and have detected the whitening claimed for it by the manufacturer in a bit over two weeks.   I rationalize the purchase price and replacement head costs by contrasting the results obtainable in two+ minutes with the 7500 against the effort necessary to obtain the same results using a manual brush. If it takes less motivation for me to clean my teeth thoroughly with the powered brush I am that much more likely to do it on a regular basis; that much less likely to wind up with a compromised set of choppers.  Overall the Sonicare Elite 7500, although not essential to good oral hygiene, is a very good power brush (although I still believe the principal of the Interplak was the best and if they could have corrected the construction problems, would have made the best brush) if you are willing to invest to this level.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing toothbrush I have ever used.  My teeth are perfectly clean and its easy too!</li>
    <li> I recently got braces. I told my dental care professional that I have difficulty flossing and brushing and he recommended the Sonicare product. This is my first time with an electric tooth brush and I must say that I have been missing out. The instructions for the product are clear and it is preset to ramp up the level of the brushing action to help beginners adjust.  It is easy to grip, comfortably reaches all parts of my mouth and the timing mechanism is wonderful. Philips even offers (easy to set up) email remainders to let you known when it is time to change your tooth brush head. They have made this a very well engineered and easy to use product. I really feel like my teeth are cleaner than they every could be with manual brushing.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, which was recommended by my dentist.  Watching my mom struggle with your teeth and starting to get receding gum lines I asked my dentist how I can avoid that in the future.  Being a good brusher I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems but I don&#x27;t want to get any in the future.  While this toothbrush may seem expensive in the long run it will save you money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean with no residue last on the surface of my teeth.  My dental hygienist who is always said I had low plaque count now says I have none.  An excellent buy and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than my original Sonicare...which lasted about 15 &lt;br /&gt;years before it pooped out!</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested Sonicaire, but I thought, \\&quot;Yea, sure, this pricey toothbrush is going to make a difference?\\&quot; But, after using the Sonicaire for two months, the gum pain and sensitivity I&#x27;ve lived with for years has decreased to almost nil. I&#x27;m delighted! Now I have to eat humble pie during my next visit to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Again, I have to complain about the shipping.  I found a product that I love, but find it a pain to have it shipped to an APO address.  Basically, I pay for shipping twice...once to a friend in the US and again when they ship it to my APO address.  Please, please let this merchant know how user unfriendly they are toward folks with APO addresses.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  This is an excellent product, well worth the money.  It even makes brushing your teeth fun.  The only minor issue is has to do with a somewhat inconsistent battery life between recharges.  Sometime you can get a day or two more of use, sometimes a few days less; all that with identical use pattern.  There seems to be no particular reason behind it.  But, it is a very minor issue.</li>
    <li> The product, when it works, seems like a miracle, as at those times, it is doing a very good job and that&#x27;s why many dentists do recommend it.  However, please read through many reviews and you will read about the same experience that I have had, namely, that they wear out (specifically, the battery won&#x27;t hold its charge) so you have to buy a whole new unit after the very limited-time warranty expires.  It would be so very easy to manufacture these units in a battery-replaceable fashion.  Readers should also pay VERY close attention to the date of the review.  If the review is a rave review and is within the last few weeks or months, just wait .... till the battery fails.  Readers should also pay close attention to the very large number of \\&quot;new models\\&quot; that keep coming out.  I would feel better if they made ONE model that consistently performed well, rather than adding this or that needless bell or whistle.  Also when the new model comes out, all of the reviews from the previous almost-identical product become unsearchable and the whole cycle starts from scratch again. Someone buys one and two weeks later they put up a five star review.  Then more people buy them.  Then, a few months later, people start having a different experience.  Time to introduce yet another new model!  Thus cleaning the slate with all the bad reviews missing.</li>
    <li> BELOW IS MY EXCHANGE WITH SONICARE CUSTOMER SERVICE. YOU DECIDE.    Victor: Hello Ken    Victor: How may I assist you?    Ken: hello. how are you?    Victor: I am fine Ken    Victor: how are you?    Ken: i am well. thanks for askng. I was given a Sonicare HX9500 as a gift just over 1 year ago. The person who gave it to me does not have the receipt. The main handle with the buttons on it has a problem. the main green button has ripped.    Victor: I apologize you are having this experience and will be happy to help you.    Victor: What is the model number (HX number), serial number and the date of purchase of your unit? The HX model and serial numbers are located on the bottom or inside the well of the toothbrush handle.    [...]    Victor: Please ignore the link    Victor: What is the model number (HX number), serial number and the date of purchase of your unit? The HX model and serial numbers are located on the bottom or inside the well of the toothbrush handle.    Ken: I will give you all the info that is on the handle and charging base of the unit. the handle info says 070226 and then below it says HX9500.    Victor: Ken we will need the purchase receipt of this unit to process a replacement of the handle as this unit looks out of two year warranty    Ken: I have checked with my aunt and she does not have the receipt. I got it two Christmases ago, 12/2011, and she bought it from the local drug store in her town in the same month.    Victor: I am sorry Ken without the purchase receipt we will be able to process the repalacment    Ken: i hoped that you would help me. i am surprised that this very expensive unit failed so soon. i guess i will replace it with a better brand. the sonicare does not seem to hold up. i will ask my dentist for a recommendation of a competitive brand.    Ken: i will check for online reviews of the sonicare and maybe tell of my experience with sonicare.    Victor: Is there anything else I may assist you with today?    Ken: so there is no help from sonicare for a unit that was used less than 18 months. i am surprised that you do not make exceptions and do a good will replacement. the bad thing is that i just purchased three new brush heads. very disappointing experience.    Ken: sonicare should be more careful with its inventory in this large chain drug store. it is obvious that this unit was sitting on the shelf for a while.    Ken: well there are good companies and there are bad companies. i will copy and paste this chat for my online review.    Victor: I am sorry Ken but we will not be able to replace this unit without the purchase receipt , if the purchaser can get a copy of purchase receipt from the retailer we can order a replacement    Ken: i just hope that my negative review of sonicare will be a fair warning for anyone that is thinking of purchasing a toothbrush. i will have to warn my dentist of your poor quality product and uncaring attitude in customer care.    Victor: Is there anything else I may assist you with today?</li>
    <li> I have spent thousands of dollars on my teeth, all due to events or conditions I could not help (TMJ, car accident, braces twice, etc.)  While I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I was a pre-teen, it was to my horror that my dentist plus a specialist pronounced me as having fairly severe gum disease. I had 12mm pockets on several teeth, was in danger of having to have them pulled (that would be in addition to the ones which were so damaged in the car accident they had to be pulled)... it looked like I had no future except for a denture which I vehemently refused to wear... the Sonicare Elite products were recommended by people who were using them themselves so I bit the bullet as to the price and bought one. Even though I didn&#x27;t start using it right away, my specialist&#x27;s hygienist saw a difference in the quality of home care within about 3 days of use. And that&#x27;s half the battle won in periodontic disease is your attention to home care! If it improved the look of my home care in just three days, imagine what my teeth and gums would look like in a month or three months!  Delighted!</li>
    <li> I used the original Sonicare for years, and now own this model.  I certainly prefer the new ergonomic design as it does reach the back teeth more effectively.  However I have to give credit to both models for helping to reverse my gingivitis, removing stains, and generally giving me better oral health.  Teeth are so important, it seemed a small price to pay.  Great toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> If it were possible to give this toothbrush a 0, I would.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for a piece of junk that it is.  A toothbrush that is way better is Cybersonic 2.  It costs less than this toothbrush.  It also offers more.  The Sonicare Elite 7500 cleans at 31,000 strokes a minute, but Cybersonic 2 cleans at 41,000.  Cybersonic 2 comes with a 2 tongue cleaner, 2 flosser attachments and 45 pre-strung flossing heads which are disposable, recharging stand, and best of all free replacement brushes every 3 months for free for ever.  The Sonicare brushes cost more than $20.  With the Sonicare brush you have to brush for 2 minutes and with the Cybersonic 2 you only have to brush for 1 minute and the brush pauses for a second to tell you that a minute has passed. Plain and simple, Cybersonic 2 is the best and most powerful toothbrush in the world. So if you want the best toothbrush, do not buy the Sonicare, buy Cybersonic 2.  Check it out for yourself at Cybersonic2.com  peace YO!!!!!</li>
    <li> The use of ultrasound for this application sounds good in theory, but my two-year experience indicated that it did not work in practice. Plaque build-up was, if anything, worse than with manual brushing. It was only when I started to use the Oral-B 3-D Excel that we (my dentist and I) noticed an improvement.</li>
    <li> I am one of those unusual people who have a film that forms over my teeth after only a few hours, the positive part is that the film itself helps reduce the potential for tartar but I hate the way it makes my mouth feel. When I first got this toothbrush it was a bit much for me.  I had not used an electric toothbrush before, but my husband&#x27;s dentist and my dentist both recommended it. The first day using it I noticed that the film that usually formed on my teeth wasn&#x27;t as heavy.  The more I used the toothbrush the less film formed and the longer it took to form.  Also, after using the toothbrush for a couple weeks the sensitivity wore off.  My check-ups were always good, and my cleanings were never difficult, but I never imagined that it could be as easy as it is now!</li>
    <li> always searching for that One Brush that will make my teeth shine&amp;sparkly. this Brush is tight&amp;leaves My Mouth&amp;breath truly Fresh.it truly blows away the other brands. this is some top of the line product big time.you smile wider&amp;feel good after using this Brush.</li>
    <li> I love the way my teeth feel with this product; as smooth as if I just came from a dentist&#x27;s office.  The bristles are soft and comfortable to use.  It does not remove all stains, but it&#x27;s the best home product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It does a great job!! It&#x27;s just a little pricey and noisier than expected.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 electric toothbrush is rated highly in reviews because it&#x27;s comfortable to use, and is effective at removing plaque. Its ultrasonic bristle movement reaches hard-to-clean areas, like along the gum line and between teeth. The Sonicare toothbrush has a non-slip handle, two speeds, and is rechargeable. It beeps every thirty seconds to prompt you to clean a different area, and shuts off automatically after two minutes. Oral-health experts say we should brush twice a day for two minutes, and there&#x27;s evidence that people brush longer with the Sonicare electric toothbrush than with a manual brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday, and I notice a significant lessening of plague buildup around my teeth. Highly recommended for anyone who values oral care.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for 11 years now.  Sonicare once again didn&#x27;t let me down.  I purchased this toothbrush because my old one would no longer hold a charge.  Each toothbrush handle lasts about 3 years before the rechargable battery no longer holds a charge (you can&#x27;t replace the battery - you have to purchase a new handle).  If you have never used a Sonicare toothbrush I HIGHLY recommend you purchase any one of their products.  It is like having your teeth cleaned by your dentist every day.  You will never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrush is a great buy. I was skeptical of its price but it really is worth it. If you use this toothbrush you have less plaque, your teeth stay whiter, and your gums are healthier. I use this with listerine and my teeth and gums are healthier than ever. I am wondering if this thing makes going to the dentist a thing of the past! Seriously, it&#x27;s a great machine with two speeds (in case high makes you ticklish) that helps you spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth to get a complete brushing. Use this everyday and you will have a fresher smile.</li>
    <li> Sonicare Elite 7500 is an excellent tooth brush. the only problem I have is often times it leaks around the brush head, and it is hard to clean when it does that. in terms of brushing it is the best brushing system. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush.  I must say with each generation they get better.    Great cleaning capabilities.  I like the pulse to indicate how long you&#x27;ve gone, this helps make sure I clean my teeth evenly.    I didn&#x27;t give it the final star as I&#x27;m still skeptical of the battery.  I&#x27;ve been told the battery should last 3-5yrs on these.  I&#x27;ve never had one last past 3yrs and I&#x27;m a once a day brusher.  I would hope it would last at least 5yrs.    Still it&#x27;s well worth the money to replace it every 3yrs or so.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist, whom I trust.  Product worked great; I loved the timer feature as I tended, like most people, to brush too quickly.  My check-ups were improved, and my gums healthier as a result of using this product.  However, after 2 years, the battery died.  It is not replaceable and as far as I can tell, the unit must be disposed of--entirely.  What an incredible waste.  5 stars otherwise.  I will not replace it because it looks like the new version has the same 20th century engineering mindset.  I thought Philips was a progressive product designer. Please correct me if I am wrong.</li>
