      <li>The product felt kind of slimy.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>I had read many excellent reviews on this natural product.  </li>
      <li>so I can buy more.</li>
      <li>It is refreshing to spray on your face throughout the day though.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I even tested this to see if I just needed to spray more on throughout the day.</li>
      <li>However I am sure the company has many products that works well on skin.</li>
      <li>and I love this product</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t go to allergist for the many test.</li>
      <li>Its light once it dries!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>It works pretty good.</li>
      <li>but it keeps your face all fresh up!!</li>
      <li>As far as setting my makeup, it did a great job for the 4 hours</li>
      <li>so inside I spray it onto a sponge and dab it to my face which I find is way more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>and I know this isn&#x27;t the right kind of mist.</li>
      <li>It really does help my makeup stay on more, but what I love most about it is that it takes away any access powdery-ness on my face...and gives my skin a healthy dewy</li>
      <li>I was not super impressed for the price I payed plus shipping.  </li>
      <li>Idk if I&#x27;ve noticed a huge diff when I do...</li>
      <li>Instead of spraying as a mist I literally got squirted in the face by huge droplets of this product.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive it.  </li>
      <li>This mist is light and dries quickly, leaving your make up set for hours.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great to use just to want to feel refreshed throughout the day if I&#x27;m feeling kind of icky.</li>
      <li>My skin love it,and I  highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I really like it a lot more than this spray.</li>
      <li>It is true that the nozzle sprays out sporadically</li>
      <li>Im going to buy one more IQ spray, a big one this time :)</li>
      <li>But, To be honest, I don&#x27;t really not quite sure if this is working cause, i keep on re applying my make up..</li>
      <li>Very refreshing, drys quickly after applying, smells fresh, doesn&#x27;t leave face oily, definitely will purchase again...</li>
      <li>But the actual products works pretty good</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t spay in a fine mist, but in rather large droplets.</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than the E.L.F mist &amp; its cheaper!</li>
      <li>A lot in the bottle very nice sprays well and last long for makeup and makes you feel refreshed I love it</li>
      <li>Not necessary, just nice.</li>
      <li>the thing is though that I honestly thought it could have been bigger.</li>
      <li>It is a nice refreshing moisture mist any time of day, but I usually just put it on after makeup application, before blow drying my hair.  </li>
      <li>I think this is amazing however it doesnt make the makeup stay for as long as its advertised</li>
      <li>I received this product very fast.</li>
      <li>The reason for only four stars is because the spray is more of a squirt than a mist.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done with my make-up routine I spray some of this on and it makes it look really neat and pretty and fresh.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>This is my first make-up setting spray</li>
      <li>And my face would feel so cool, moist and soft</li>
      <li>Not pleasant at all lol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice spray that makes evrything powdery look less of that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times on the top of a full face of makeup.</li>
      <li>I have fairly oily skin, and my makeup doesn&#x27;t tend to last on my face for very long.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really set anything...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s available at a local store.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know I have never used a setting spray before, but i really didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a makeup setting spray before, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this too.</li>
      <li>Love this item, came sooner then expected.</li>
      <li>so can&#x27;t really tell how it works .</li>
      <li>The liquid shoots out more like a stream and gets my face way too wet.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really come out as a mist .</li>
      <li>My skin is really oily and I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would hold everything in place all day.</li>
      <li>but, other than that.. I can&#x27;t really make sure if this product works..</li>
      <li>because it was recommended when I purchased the mineral makeup kit with silk primer (and I only needed to add a few bucks more to get free</li>
      <li>smells nice not really sure if it works well....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product the only thing is that  it kind of squirts out a little to hard and it ends up leaving patches in your makeup.</li>
      <li>The stage was very hot, and I went through several &amp;#34;crying&amp;#34; scenes.</li>
      <li>That was as far as my experience with this product goes because I switched to NYX Setting Spray... much happier with that product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy like some other mineral based makeups and doesn&#x27;t settle into your fine lines &amp; wrinkles like some</li>
      <li>and I find it to be very refreshing especially in the afternoons when I need a little wake up spritz!</li>
      <li>So little of the product made it to me that I can only say it smells nice and makes the make up like liquid</li>
      <li>It was sealed and brand new.</li>
      <li>I am really surprised my foundation and everything else did not slide off!  </li>
      <li>Works okay, not really what I expected.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything as far as keeping my makeup on.</li>
      <li>and my face does feel soft and moisturized</li>
      <li>I am a busy mom of 5</li>
      <li>but it comes out way too heavy and not that comfortable.</li>
      <li>I purchase this along with the IQ Natural mineral sample kit for my sisters wedding.</li>
      <li>but this spray doesn&#x27;t feel too moisturizing , it has more of opposite effect - it &amp;#34; pulls &amp;#34; skin after a few minutes of application .</li>
      <li>Although, for some odd reason The first time I uses this it gave me some sting sensation where I don&#x27;t really dont know why probably cause the after effect of me doing the microdermabrasion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several all natural mineral based make ups</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff! I wear mineral makeup every day, and this spray keeps it in place! It even keeps my eye shadow from smearing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for stage makeup (mineral wear). I was in an Easter play a few weeks ago, and this product worked wonders! The stage was very hot, and I went through several &amp;#34;crying&amp;#34; scenes. Yet, my eye makeup and blush stayed firmly in place. Seriously, this stuff is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t spay in a fine mist, but in rather large droplets. It&#x27;s a little shocking on the first use, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual E.L.F face setting mist so I ordered this one, it came sooner than expected. I actually like it better than the E.L.F mist &amp; its cheaper!</li>
    <li> I was not super impressed for the price I payed plus shipping.  I think next time I am just going to by MyChelle spray mist, because I have used it in the past and it&#x27;s available at a local store.  I really like it a lot more than this spray.</li>
    <li> Gave this product 1 star only because the product cause a pimple on my forehead after use. However I am sure the company has many products that works well on skin. This product just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed with the spritzer. The liquid shoots out more like a stream and gets my face way too wet. I&#x27;ve used other makeup setting sprays before and I know this isn&#x27;t the right kind of mist. I&#x27;m going to transfer the contents of this bottle to another one so I can actually see if the formula works well.</li>
    <li> I purchase this along with the IQ Natural mineral sample kit for my sisters wedding. This mist is light and dries quickly, leaving your make up set for hours.</li>
    <li> My makeup did stay on even though I don&#x27;t use mineral makeup. I just can&#x27;t use it too close to my face or it will start to sting.</li>
    <li> this product actually works I was suspicious of it but it does work and it makes me feel refreshed threw out the day. and when I purchase again will get this bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this setting mist with the green tea extract in it. I have just recently started using setting mist and I find it to be very refreshing especially in the afternoons when I need a little wake up spritz! It does help to set the makeup as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation so with a good primer &amp; this spray the powder will not wear off! Lasts forever</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it. I can see a difference when her make up is applied, her skin looks smoother and make up looks lovely and keeps make up perfect all night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a makeup setting spray before, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this too. But, I love it! I have fairly oily skin, and my makeup doesn&#x27;t tend to last on my face for very long. I bought this before a friend&#x27;s wedding in hopes of looking made up from ceremony through many hours on the dance floor, and this delivered!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, drys quickly after applying, smells fresh, doesn&#x27;t leave face oily, definitely will purchase again... Only down side is the small size is very little</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product the only thing is that  it kind of squirts out a little to hard and it ends up leaving patches in your makeup. It doesn&#x27;t really come out as a mist . But the actual products works pretty good I would suggest buying s different spray bottle to put the product in and you should be good</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t mist at all. Have to stream in hand and then wipe on face. Didn&#x27;t do anything as far as keeping my makeup on.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my IQ makeup products. I&#x27;ve used several all natural mineral based make ups and I think I&#x27;ll be sticking to IQ for a while . Good prices and good product. Doesn&#x27;t get clumpy like some other mineral based makeups and doesn&#x27;t settle into your fine lines &amp; wrinkles like some can</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no difference. I even tested this to see if I just needed to spray more on throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t hold. It is refreshing to spray on your face throughout the day though. Other than that, IDK why I bought this. I&#x27;ve tried on both liquid and powder foundation; no change.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I use it everytime I put my makeup on and one spray goes a long way. I can&#x27;t wait to run out so I can buy more. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Works okay, not really what I expected. It&#x27;s makes some of my makeup smudge.</li>
    <li> It is true that the nozzle sprays out sporadically and I find it painful to spray it directly at my face so inside I spray it onto a sponge and dab it to my face which I find is way more comfortable.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product once it runs out.  I also would like to try the elf face setting spray to see the difference.</li>
    <li> A lot in the bottle very nice sprays well and last long for makeup and makes you feel refreshed I love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know I have never used a setting spray before, but i really didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything.  It made my face feel cool for a few minutes after just putting it on, but I saw no change in the length of time my makeup would last.</li>
    <li> I received this product very fast. It was sealed and brand new. It works perfect for my face. Not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> The product itself it great! Its light once it dries! The reason for only four stars is because the spray is more of a squirt than a mist. Even holding it out an arms length it sprays a lot at you so I would recommend that they change their bottle.</li>
    <li> I got it on time and I love this product the thing is though that I honestly thought it could have been bigger. It was so tiny. This is the only reason I gave it four stars.</li>
    <li> It was kind of dripping when I got it ._. But it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really does help my makeup stay on more, but what I love most about it is that it takes away any access powdery-ness on my face...and gives my skin a healthy dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s great to use just to want to feel refreshed throughout the day if I&#x27;m feeling kind of icky.</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom of 5 and I&#x27;m with them all day long.  This spray helps to keep my makeup on even though I rub up against little ones frequently.  It is a nice refreshing moisture mist any time of day, but I usually just put it on after makeup application, before blow drying my hair.  It feels nice.  Might buy again, not sure.  Not necessary, just nice.</li>
    <li> My face condition is horribly oily my entire life. Whatever great high-end make up I use usually melt within an hour. And it&#x27;ll be so oily my face would feels so nasty. This is my first make-up setting spray and it&#x27;s amazing! My face would NOT be oily at all after all day! With just one application from the morning; no re-spraying was needed afterward. And my face would feel so cool, moist and soft like I just washed my face or had a facial or sth. I had to buy an Evian spray cuz this little spray I bought was out, and it sucks by the way. My face was oily again without this product. Im going to buy one more IQ spray, a big one this time :)</li>
    <li> My skin love it,and I  highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times on the top of a full face of makeup. Idk if I&#x27;ve noticed a huge diff when I do...</li>
    <li> Instead of spraying as a mist I literally got squirted in the face by huge droplets of this product. Not pleasant at all lol. The product felt kind of slimy. That was as far as my experience with this product goes because I switched to NYX Setting Spray... much happier with that product.</li>
    <li> Use this as my final step to my makeup application.  It seals very well and does keep the shine from my face for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I had read many excellent reviews on this natural product.  I was excited to receive it.  For reasons still unknown, by my dermatologist, I had a allergic reaction.  There must of been a ingredient I reacted to.  I didn&#x27;t go to allergist for the many test. Just plan to not use any item in product!  As far as setting my makeup, it did a great job for the 4 hours I had it on!</li>
    <li> I will be a returning customer for this product. My skin is really oily and I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would hold everything in place all day. When I&#x27;m done with my make-up routine I spray some of this on and it makes it look really neat and pretty and fresh. Since I used this I&#x27;ve recieved a lot more compliments and my make-up lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, great product</li>
    <li> So little of the product made it to me that I can only say it smells nice and makes the make up like liquid but the make up still looks cracked and makes the skin look dry even if put on over lotion I can&#x27;t say if putting it on before the make up would help that or not.</li>
    <li> I think this is amazing however it doesnt make the makeup stay for as long as its advertised but it keeps your face all fresh up!!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve been using mineral powder for a while now and this holds up my makeup longer and makes my face smoother. Love it!</li>
    <li> Keeps makeup in place</li>
    <li> smells nice not really sure if it works well....</li>
    <li> This is NOT a mist. I had to close my eyes and brace for impact. I am really surprised my foundation and everything else did not slide off!  It does not hurt but it is definitely not a mist. It comes out in a literal SPRAY, like a hose. There is nothing clogging the hole, so I do not know why it comes out like that. I will not buy this again unless seller tells me this is defective. I like the ingredients a lot and my face does feel soft and moisturized but it comes out way too heavy and not that comfortable.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really set anything...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice spray that makes evrything powdery look less of that. Sets makeup well and great mist of the bottle. Not sure how well it hold up makeup though.</li>
    <li> I like this product, Although, for some odd reason The first time I uses this it gave me some sting sensation where I don&#x27;t really dont know why probably cause the after effect of me doing the microdermabrasion. But, To be honest, I don&#x27;t really not quite sure if this is working cause, i keep on re applying my make up.. But, whatever.. I just like the green tea on it.. So, I just use it.. but, other than that.. I can&#x27;t really make sure if this product works.. But, Like what I said.. I just like the green tea that sprays on your face.. Green tea technically fights anti aging.. So I guess,.. It gives me supple skin.. I don&#x27;t know.. lol.. But, over all I kinda like it..</li>
    <li> I really like it! I have horribly oily skin and this helps set my powder and i can use it to freshen up after using a blotting sheet! I do have to say that the bottle i got looks nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> Love this item, came sooner then expected.</li>
    <li> Stressful day as a wedding co-ordinator...makeup on at 6:30...it lasted until midnight.  I like this stuff!</li>
    <li> Like the finish but it squirts out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert in the chemicals but this spray doesn&#x27;t feel too moisturizing , it has more of opposite effect - it &amp;#34; pulls &amp;#34; skin after a few minutes of application . From moisturizing point I would give it 0 points . I didn&#x27;t try to spray it over make up so can&#x27;t really tell how it works . The only thing I hope it does it&#x27;s reduces pores and tighten up skin since it has tea extract in it .</li>
    <li> I like the product! And def recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I got this setting/hydrating mist because it was recommended when I purchased the mineral makeup kit with silk primer (and I only needed to add a few bucks more to get free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this half the time after applying my make-up and I still don&#x27;t notice the benefits or the difference of my makeup look.</li>
