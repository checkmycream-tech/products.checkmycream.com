<li> - that is really wild and these make my curls stay in shape.</li>
<li> Soft and durable</li>
<li> Various sizes, may need multiple packs due to limited number of each size.</li>
<li> They are not as long as the Annie brand</li>
<li> Performed as expected.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay for, but ended up purchasing anyway due to length.  </li>
<li> These are stiff, my hair was getting snagged on the plastic ends, and they were impossible to sleep in!</li>
<li> My hair must be too thick as it didn&#x27;t hold, rather disappointed.</li>

    <li> The package came very fast and looks exactly like the picture but the material of the rods is weaker than I expected</li>

    <li> I LOVE them ,bendable, size variety is good i even used them on my 6 yr olds her hair looks so cute....</li>
    <li> My hair must be too thick as it didn&#x27;t hold, rather disappointed.</li>
    <li> this purchase was done on a whim to see if they would work, and they do.  I have very curly hair - that is really wild and these make my curls stay in shape. Easy to use on my elderly mother and soft enough to put on her as she is currently bedridden but still wanted to make the effort to be pretty.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, I bought these for future use.  They are not as long as the Annie brand I didn&#x27;t want to pay for, but ended up purchasing anyway due to length.  However, this will work great for shorter length hair.</li>

    <li> They arrived just as described. I love these flexi rods!</li>
    <li> These rods are exactly what I was looking for.  Lasting curls. I wish some of them could be an in inch shorter. Great Value.</li>
    <li> Performed as expected.  Great body wave curls without the need of excess products on the hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM SO MANY SIZES TO GO WITH MY LAYERS... super deal!!!!</li>
