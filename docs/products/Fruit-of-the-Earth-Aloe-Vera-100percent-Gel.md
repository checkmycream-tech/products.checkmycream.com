      <li>Exactly the kind of company you don&#x27;t want to support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would&#x27;ve been okay if they said 99% aloe vera, but practically lying...not cool.</li>
      <li>My skin has showed huge changes doing this.  </li>
      <li>Blot with towel lightly.  </li>
      <li>Aloe-This is not the most economical size</li>

      <li>I tried to use this once, but it just didn&#x27;t even feel right.</li>
      <li>all right --</li>
      <li>It is 100% natural and heals the minor wounds and rashes greatly.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any scent and also good as hair gel (I don&#x27;t use hair styling products but wanted to tame a few fly aways) without stickiness.</li>
      <li>It will soothe your skin but not going to solve the skin problem you have... just consider this as a supporting one of your skin product routine.</li>
      <li>I have used different aloe products over the years and I have found that Fruit of the Earth is one of the better products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find plain aloe vera jell in the store, so I was happy to find this online and I thought it was a good deal. Always good to have this around for sun burns, etc.</li>
    <li> This product is so good for sun burn. If you want better relief put it in the fridge and it will feel so much better against your sun burn.</li>
    <li> I used this in my homemade lotion!  I like that it is pure &amp; has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;Will probably order again when I run out!</li>
    <li> This bottle tries to trick us by claiming \\&quot;100% Gel\\&quot;: it is definitely not 100% aloe vera (it has a bunch of other chemicals in it, some of which you may not want to put on your skin or in your body). That&#x27;s like saying a beverage is \\&quot;100% liquid\\&quot;: it&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s not nearly as important as the ingredients, and it appears to be an intentionally misleading label. It is also not \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; because it has \\&quot;no color added\\&quot;. Sorry, Fruit of the Earth, I refuse to do business with a company that does this with their packaging.</li>
    <li> It soothed my itchy dry skin and helped deminish some scarring from constant scratching. I love it! Will Buy Again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review about a gel. I hope it does what for... recipe for wood ticks and a recipe for mosquitoes (sprays). Seems like it was a good brand.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected. Good product.</li>
    <li> It seems to be very pure, is thick and not runny, and there is no odor.  It is easy to dispense from the tube.</li>
    <li> I use this at night before bed--I like to put this on my eyelids because it is so mild and it helps the dryness--but you have to use a very small amount as to not get in the eye....also this can be used for any dry areas on the body because it absorbs so quickly--does not have any additives.just wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool and sooth the skin after sun. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent and also good as hair gel (I don&#x27;t use hair styling products but wanted to tame a few fly aways) without stickiness. Also good for healing skin such as after epilating legs and burned in the kitchen, even heal my face after using prescription strength Retinol. Great for the price and handy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used different aloe products over the years and I have found that Fruit of the Earth is one of the better products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that i use a bit of during the winter, due to dry skin. There is no burning and it absorbs quickly, with no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great size for a backpack or large handbag.</li>
    <li> This does what it is supposed to do.  If you have a sunburn or some other mild burn, this will soothe it.  If you are a company that sells aloe and sells a bad product, you are doing something really wrong.  This is aloe just like it says it is and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually 99% Aloe Vera.. they put &amp;#34;100% gel&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;PURE&amp;#34; because they knew people would think it meant 100% aloe vera ingredients-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it&#x27;s doing wonders for my psoriasis... but I won&#x27;t be buying this again. This company totally exploits the natural market like it&#x27;s some fad. Exactly the kind of company you don&#x27;t want to support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully you&#x27;ll see this and buy some real &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; aloe vera. It would&#x27;ve been okay if they said 99% aloe vera, but practically lying...not cool.</li>
    <li> Mild and hypoallergenic - but not much good as a moisturizer</li>
    <li> No dyes, artificial ingredients, no added fragrance. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought two kinds of the Aloe Vera - one in a pump bottle and the other in a tube.  I like them both - I use them to soothe itchy skin on my lower legs caused by diabetic neuropathy.  I couldn&#x27;t find pure aloe gel anywhere here where I live (admittedly, it&#x27;s a rural area), but even the drugstores and pharmacies didn&#x27;t have it.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> So far, this Aloe Vera Gel is working great to help clear up areas on my skin that are red, dry and itchy.  I live in a very dry climate out West and skin care is so important.  I love that it&#x27;s 100% and therefore a more natural way to care for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing in the world for burns, so recommend keeping some near the stove. Also best for sunburn, the quicker you apply it, the better. If you search for the uses for this product you will be amazed.  Never run out.</li>
    <li> It is a very soothing gel. Arrived quickly and is a very good product.</li>
    <li> This product label is very deceiving and attempts to scam people into thinking it&#x27;s 100% aloe Vera gel. It&#x27;s in fact 100% Gel but not aloe Vera. And they do note that on the label but right below the big &amp;#34;aloe Vera&amp;#34; to deceive people</li>
    <li> great for my mild sunburn</li>
    <li> Love Aloe Vera and wanted one in a tube. This was it! I received it quickly and packed well. Great for sunburns.</li>
    <li> I love Aloe for pretty much everything.&lt;br /&gt;I specificaly bought this for post wax treatment for my clients and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like others.  Very moist and begins healing immediately.  Will definitely buy this again and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this as an aftershave. It cools the face and eliminates razor burn instantly. When used in this manor over time, I think it actually improves skin tone.  I&#x27;ll be buying this regularly.</li>
    <li> As a purist and user of organic products, I do NOT like this one.  When I saw what was in it, I trashed it!  It contains triethanolamine, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM hydantoin, and diazolidinyl urea.  A better option would be Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe Vera Gel for Skin and Hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best aloe gels around! Does not get sticky as it dries, nor does it turn a weird white color and flake off like some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I sunburn easily and rely on this stuff. Also great for a simple clean pure moisturizer for everyday.</li>
    <li> I got it a day earlier and it is exactly what it says it is. Thank God because I was a little iffy about it because it&#x27;s so cheap and free shipping.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say except excellent.  I use this daily.  I can find lots of ways to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product.  I have this little bottle and the giant one and I won&#x27;t be without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the aloe in the shower actually.&lt;br /&gt;I mix some in my conditioner for extra hydration  I apply to face after shower while pores are still open.  Mix with oil and apply to body.&lt;br /&gt;I also mix one tbsp of this with 4oz water and a tsp of jojoba oil (or argan ) in a mister bottle for a frizz fighting spray.  It works well.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong with aloe in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe also makes a great styling aid. My bf uses this in place of gel now and he loves how his hair holds without looking hard and &amp;#34;wet.&amp;#34;  It is also great for frizz free curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have troubled skin and I have really noticed that by adding aloe to my routine my face has calmed down a lot.  It seems to give my skin a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I do a raw honey/citric acid mask in shower.  Rinse.  Blot with towel lightly.  Apply some BP, spitz glycerin/ water, then apply a little aloe to lock it all in.  My skin has showed huge changes doing this.  My skin will never be perfect but this sure helped get it the best it can be.</li>
    <li> Very soothing.  It is all natural, no alcohol, fragrance-free!</li>
    <li> Love this aloe gel. No smells, dries quickly.</li>
    <li> LOOOOVVVEEE THIS STUFF!  I bought this as a moisturizer for my natural hair and my scalp loves it!</li>
    <li> A great all-purpose, non-greasy moisturizer. The clear version is increasingly difficult to find and the only one worth buying.</li>
    <li> not 100% natural. has lots of other weird chemicals in the ingredients not listed here which make your skin worse.</li>
    <li> I use this with my NuFace and it works perfectly.  Not at all irritating or drying, I like it better than the gel that came with the NuFace.</li>
    <li> I love the Fruit of the Earth Aloe-This is not the most economical size but it fits in a small backpack.&lt;br /&gt;100% Aloe is the best for sunburn for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> I am so unhappy with this item, I oredered it because It said 100% aloe, I fell for the&lt;br /&gt;package info, this isn&#x27;t 100% aloe, and when I put it on my face after a derma roll, oh my god, it burned, real aloe doesn&#x27;t burn, because I have used other brands and real aloe. I am returning this, I&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe the waste of money and time getting it through the mail. consumers need to&lt;br /&gt;stop deceiving to sell. :(</li>
    <li> Product is cool, not greasy. It does the job on my 4C hair...no white buildup when mixed with coconut oil. However, a white film developed when mixed separately with trader joe&#x27;s conditioner &amp; Eco styler gel.</li>
    <li> This gel works great on my hair. It holds, theres no flaking and it moisturizers. I won&#x27;t use any other gel now that I found this one.</li>
    <li> After using it, my skin becomes soft and moist. What&#x27;s the most important, I feel comfortable. It&#x27;s mild and the smell is fine to me. And it isn&#x27;t pungent to my eyes. So, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has about a million different uses and this bottle probably lasts about that long. A huge plus for me is that it is made in the U.S. which makes me feel a little safer using it. I mainly use this on my face as a gentle moisturizer because of my acne. It&#x27;s obviously great for sun burns too.</li>
    <li> Like others, I fell for the label and description thinking that it was 100 percent Aloe Vera.  Well it&#x27;s not.  (it is 100 percent GEL, but so is axle grease)  It also contains Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer 940, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea.  I don&#x27;t know what any of this stuff is, but if I had known that it was in there, I would NOT have purchased.  I was looking for a product to heal, not one with ingredients whose purpose is questionable and safety is (to me) uncertain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says on the label \\&quot;No Animal Testing\\&quot; which makes me feel good, but that part of the label was covered up by a sticker, so... go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does seem to have most of the same properties as Aloe Vera, and the price was okay, so I won&#x27;t throw it out, but next time, I&#x27;ll be looking for one of the organic versions also sold by Amazon.  Like other reviewers have said, the label is somewhat deceptive.</li>
    <li> After I read some positive comments about this product I hoped that this aloe vera gel was going to help my Acne problem...&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is... this gel dry toooo fast... but it definitely gives you moisture! It will soothe your skin but not going to solve the skin problem you have... just consider this as a supporting one of your skin product routine.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use for facial mask!</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this product about two years ago and it is the one topical that consistently soothes the pain of burns from cooking accidents. A little seems to go a long way, as I still had 1/3rd of the tube left when catastrophe struck. What follows is a true story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I cooked a large quantity of chili in a crock pot at someone else&#x27;s home. The \\&quot;friend\\&quot; (at best, an idiot) for whom I&#x27;d prepared the chili created chaos and distraction as I attempted to pour the chili into a paper bowl. First, he gave me a ladle that was HUGE. Secondly, he made the paper bowl into a moving target, holding on to it rather than sitting it on a counter top and totally got in my way. There was no talking sense to this person, who kept insisting \\&quot;he was just trying to help.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result? I ended up with a pretty serious set of second-degree burns from the very hot chili, some of which spilled over both sides of my left hand. This clown blocked my access to the kitchen sink, so I spent one full minute in agony as the thick and spicy chili, behaving like some form of napalm, continued to burn my skin. Same \\&quot;helpful person\\&quot; (either a sadist or totally oblivious) notices and asks \\&quot;Are you Okay?\\&quot; Through clenched teeth, wanting to scream, I manage to say: \\&quot;Take your chili and let me get to the sink, NOW.\\&quot; I ran cool and cold water over my hand to wash the chili off and the pain was only slightly less than murderous. Then I made a desperate grab for one of the bottles of water the guy kept in his freezer, which does a lot to ease the pain. Despite the ice, the burn is bad. Both sides of my left hand are bright red welts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in no mood to eat the chili and desperate to escape the company of this \\&quot;friend\\&quot;, who continues to ask stupid questions, like: \\&quot;Does it hurt?\\&quot; \\&quot;Do you want to go to an Emergency Room?\\&quot; Despite the popular expression and assertion, there ARE stupid questions. I tell him I need to go home, where I have some of this Aloe Vera gel. He offers me some totally useless ointment, in hopes I&#x27;ll stick around and keep him company. If both hands were functional, I&#x27;d likely have given in to my desire to strangle the guy. The burns were beginning to blister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally make my exit, run home and grab the Aloe Vera, applying a thick layer. This soothes the pain considerably, but both sides of my hand are blistering badly. I cover the gelled area with gauze, periodically reapply the Aloe Vera gel, replace gauze. I take a mild painkiller so I can sleep that night. I continue the gel and gauze exercise for the next four to five days, then continue to use the Aloe Vera gel as an emollient. When I see the \\&quot;friend\\&quot; again, he advises me to \\&quot;stick a pin in the blisters\\&quot;. I tell him this is in fact a bad idea, as the fluids will be reabsorbed into my body. He asserts that \\&quot;they&#x27;ll break open, anyway\\&quot;. I ignore his advice, stopping myself from telling him to \\&quot;stick a pin where the sun don&#x27;t shine\\&quot;. I wear a lightweight protective \\&quot;finger-less\\&quot; cotton glove on the left hand while I&#x27;m working. The blisters do not break open, a fact that I attribute to this gel keeping the burned skin supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting to the chase: my hand has healed completely. None of the blisters broke open; all were reabsorbed, as predicted. There is no evidence left of this incident except for very faint white lines where the burns were most intense. These faint scars are noticeable only to me, when I look closely. Anyone who saw the condition my hand was in the first few days after it had been burned assumed I&#x27;d have a lot of scarring with risk of infection and were amazed to see it a few weeks later. The hand healed quickly and with very minimal scarring. At no time was there any indication of infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I will add my own expression and assertion: there ARE stupid people who give really lousy advice, so be careful in choosing who your \\&quot;friends\\&quot; are. Any adult of average intelligence who interferes while you&#x27;re cooking food as a favor to them and refuses to listen when you ask them to use common sense, causing you to get hurt as a consequence is probably not one of the better candidates. Meanwhile, in my experience, this is a very good product at a very reasonable price. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> great for work and easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pondered this product after having used it for a month to help sooth/heal skin redness. I came back here to read reviews and discovered that this is a deceptively marketed product! It IS NOT 100% Aloe Vera. Oh yeah, it&#x27;s 100% gel, all right -- I am irked -- taken by Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s deceptiveness. NO MORE of this company&#x27;s products will embarrass my medicine chest! Consumers, be very careful in your reading about any product and its manufacturer&#x27;s hype -- deception.</li>
    <li> Works soo well in my diy shampoo/body wash and it really helps with blemishes! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The amount and quality of my Earth Aloe Vera 100% Gel for the price cannot be matched or surpassed anywhere.  At least that is my humble opinion.  No matter what the blemish or abrasion is  on my body, I can use the gel for a couple of days and it is like magic...the healing not only begins, it is often completed.  I will never go without this gel in my home.  The purchase from Amazon made it simple and quick!</li>
    <li> This aloe is wonderful, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&lt;br /&gt;is so soothing and makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and getting some breakouts and peeling skin.  I&#x27;ve used this gel for years now instead of a night cream. It keeps my face really smooth and actually helps with minor scrapes (yes I&#x27;m one of those women who picks at her face all the time). This eliminates all the redness and actually smooths the little wrinkles I have around my eyes and forehead. I absolutely love it,</li>
    <li> Using it for 6 months already, will keep using it on skin.</li>
    <li> Item was just as described. I used this to add to my own okra hair gel that I make. It really help soften and repair the hair!</li>
    <li> Due to an undiagnosed dermatitis, I have extremely dry and overly sensitive fingertips. Simple household tasks such as folding the laundry have become overly irritating. Doing anything outside requires I wear gloves. The doctors have not provided any solutions. Of course, I have tried every lotion/creme/potion under the sun. This aloe, in combination with plain-old petroleum jelly go a long way in keeping the problem manageable. The gel provides an instant soothing effect and a continuing level of moisture to my fingers. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave the oily feel that many lotions do. I am happy with this purchase and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I never used Aloe Vera Gel before untill I was looking for something more natural then a lotion for my skin. I use it for my face, elbows and knees. When you apply it, it feels kind of like there&#x27;s something sticky on your skin but it goes away in a few seconds. Some people say that the ingredients contain a lot of chemicals. First Tocopheryl Acetate is actually Vitamin E so it&#x27;s not bad for your skin it&#x27;s going to help repair it and fight aging. Triethanolamine is good PH balancer, Carbomer is a thickening agent that makes it a gel and won&#x27;t hurt your skin. But Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin and Diazolidinyl Urea in small amounts are ok. But if you look at the \\&quot;100% GEL\\&quot; on the front you will see a \\&quot; * \\&quot; beside it and on the back bottom in tiny writing it says \\&quot;Plus stabilizers and preservatives to insure potency and efficacy\\&quot;. They don&#x27;t say 100% Aloe Vera Gel but that is what people would think when they see it.</li>
    <li> I actually use for my hair :) Its alcohol free and aloe so what else would i want to use! I use it to slick my hair and it works very well. No smell, color &amp; is quite thick.</li>
    <li> UHG. How did I fall for &amp;#34;100% Gel.&amp;#34; Yuck. As another reviewer pointed out, that does not mean 100% Aloe... I tried to use this once, but it just didn&#x27;t even feel right. Waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> it is a very better product, i love it too much. it help my family member and me. it protect my face.</li>
    <li> I like to use this as a daily face moisturizer, on days when my skin isn&#x27;t super dry. (on those days I use organic coconut oil) I used to use another brand which would burn my eyes terribly. This stuff is perfect. I initially bought it to make mascara, this product did not work, as it would not completely melt. But in the companies defense the recipe called for completely pure aloe vera, like fresh off the leaf pure. This stuff has a preservative in it too make it last. I wanted to save money as 2oz of completely pure is very expensive and only has a 2 week shelf life, as it contains no preservatives. Still super happy with it and worth the small price.</li>
    <li> This is a stand-by for me. Good for burns, skin irritation, insect bites--so much more</li>
    <li> I like this gel; it&#x27;s closest to the plant.  I use it if I have a pimple or whatever; it seems to be helpful.  Good price, as well.</li>
    <li> This the best face moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I started putting it on after showering, and after just a couple of weeks started noticing healthier looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different types of face moisturizers, and the only other two that match the effectiveness are hemp-seed oil, and coconut oil, but they both have downsides that the aloe doesn&#x27;t. The hemp seed oil looks oily on your skin, and my wife hates the taste of the coconut oil :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product a lot. It is 100% natural and heals the minor wounds and rashes greatly. Great alternative to lotions.</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  I use if after every bath on my arms and legs.  It goes on wet, but dries in minutes and makes my skin feel nice and smooth.  I really can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I initially brought this for my natural hair because it was alcohol free but my hair doesn&#x27;t care for it. Now I&#x27;m using it for my sunburn &amp; as a shaving gel. Good thing it has multiple uses...</li>
    <li> Super convenient to order it and have it arrive in two days. I also really like that is clear and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of extras added to it</li>
    <li> Its aloe vera gel. Its pure and clean.Duh! What more can any one say? I would buy it again any time.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this item through Amazon.  But I am reviewing because of the negative effect this had on my skin.  I was using as lubricant for a Microcurrent machine, and actually had swollen red eyes the next morning.  This doesn&#x27;t happen when I use other lubricants.  Skin also is itching terribly.</li>
    <li> To begin with when I opened the Gel I was surprised it had no scent. However, it made up for that with the amount of hold it had for taming unruly curls and my edges. Also, the gel does not leave any residue or buildup and can be used quite often. It doesnt have any unhealthy ingredients such as alcohol which can make the hair have a crunchy feel instead of a soft supple feel. I would probably suggest this for people who have a unruly curls or edges. Just dab a tiny bit between your hands rub where is needed and voila your hair will come out great. An added bonus is Aloe vera has healing properties for the scalp and is extremely healthy. Lastly if doing a twistout or bantu knots I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other aloe vera &#x27;gel&#x27;, solution, juice, etc. but decided to come back to this. It works well for me. I mix this + jojoba oil + Vaseline to use as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
    <li> Always a great product</li>
    <li> I say this with much consideration... Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera is the best Aloe Vera on the market. It is surprisingly hard to find a clear aloe for some reason. You&#x27;d think that would be a given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 100% Aloe Vera gel stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t crumple off like that green stuff, and is just straight up amazing. I have been honestly using it for years. The 6oz tube is good for traveling around. It seems to last forever too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. I live for aloe, and I only use Fruit of the Earth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s aloe vera gel. I mean, it&#x27;s not bad - seems to do what one would expect. What else could a person say?</li>
    <li> And she loves it. I also use 100% aloe to seal the cuticles of the hair after shampooing as well.</li>
    <li> This has provided the relief to my irritated skin and did not stain or create a smell that had to be eliminated by adding other body scents.</li>
