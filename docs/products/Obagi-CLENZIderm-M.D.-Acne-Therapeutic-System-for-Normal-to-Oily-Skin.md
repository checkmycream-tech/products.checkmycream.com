<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am over 40 and have had acne problems my entire life.  I get the large type of blemishes that stay around for weeks at a time.  This product works better than anything I have ever tried.  I have been using it for 2 years.  Since using this product, I have even went without makeup which I would have never done in the past!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clenziderm system for a little over two weeks.  I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon, but I wish I had since I paid ALOT more for it at the spa.  I&#x27;ve been using it at night and using Cetaphil in the mornings.  The first few days my skin was very itchy and chapped, then it became flaky.  It wasn&#x27;t anything unreasonable or embarrassing, just inconvenient.  Now, my skin has adjusted to the product and there&#x27;s minimal flaking.  I had adult acne on my cheeks, with my left cheek having significantly more breakouts.  My right cheek&#x27;s acne has cleared up and all that&#x27;s left are old scars that I need to address.  My left cheek still has some firm cysts but they&#x27;re significantly smaller and are on their way to being gone.  Another benefit is that all my blackheads are gone and my pores looks much smaller than before!!  The only thing that would make this product PERFECT would be if it also addressed the red marks left behind from previous breakouts.  This one&#x27;s a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  So almost 2 years since I started using this product and I am still acne free.  My breakouts completely cleared up after about a month of using the product continuously.  Once my face was clear, I slowly started cutting back on the product since it&#x27;s so strong.  I went from using the entire system daily down to only using it when I feel a breakout coming on or in the summer when my skin tends to get a bit too oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from my son&#x27;s dermatologist.  It is a FANTASTIC product!  He started seeing results within the first two weeks.  Continued use has provided even better results.  Step 3 can cause dryness and mild irritation.  He went down to only using Step 3 every other night and it was perfect!  Highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with acne.  The price through Amazon is much cheaper than in the dermatologists office!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;t\\&quot;, because the aesthetician told me that how it works is dependent on the delivery of it.      Anyway, my very bad (not cystic, but bad) breakouts cleared up within 2 days!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other stuff (OTC &amp; Rx) and even diets.  Nothing else has been this effective this quickly!!!  Yes, the amoxicillin worked eventually, but not after only 2 days.  And who wants to be on those forever?</li>
    <li> I just started using this so I can&#x27;t comment much on the effectiveness. But my local medispa sells the kit for $180 so to get the same thing for $60 through Amazon is a great deal! Delivery took between 5-6 days.</li>
    <li> The first two weeks, I loved using this product. The smell is good, the color is pretty (purple), and it really gives that burning/tingly feel that makes it feel like it&#x27;s working. I really liked the methol in the face wash too. Just noticed that after two weeks, wasn&#x27;t really seeing any improvement. It didn&#x27;t make my acne worse, but it didn&#x27;t really clear it up either. I had tried Clinique&#x27;s Acne Solution line a couple of months ago, it cleared me up pretty good, not 100% but pretty darn good. That&#x27;s why I tried this, the Clenziderm...from the reviews, I thought it would completely clear me up. It didn&#x27;t. Was about 80% cleared up with it. With the clinique I&#x27;m about 90%, plus it&#x27;s cheaper so I went back to it. When I have trouble with aging later on, (I&#x27;m 25 yrs) I will definetly give their other line a try though! It was worth a try at least.</li>
    <li> Obagi is great! This is the only product that did work for me. It&#x27;s very strong , so I switch between Clenzidern Normal to Oily and Normal to Dry.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE ths product. I went to go buy another box of this product and there was a note on the side of the website saying: That STEP 3 the serum, has been recalled and is being replaced by a lotion. I know for a fact that the power behind this product is the serum so we r they replacing it with lotion. Im a little worried hope this products stays top notch. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHY STEP THREE IN NORMAL TO OILY SET HAS BEEN RECALLED AND REPLACED WITH LOTION PLEASE DO TELL.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 5 months ago and now it&#x27;s almost gone. Please restock this soon because I can&#x27;t live without it. This makes your skin a little bit dryer than normal, but it&#x27;s okay rather than having acnes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent rate from seller!  Thank You  First couple days after I used clenziderm.....WOW!  Seen that it was working, and I can feel it working also, My face has never felt cleaner.  If you have acne issues, dont wait.....I wish I would of found this sooner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m like everyone else who writes a review - I&#x27;ve tried it all. This combined with my clarisonic mia have been a life saver. I&#x27;ve dealt with hormonal chin/low cheek acne since I started college about 10 years ago. I can&#x27;t stop touching my face sometimes because I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin is. I&#x27;ve also started adding obagi blue radiance peels - the acne is pretty much gone now but hoping to smooth tone and texture from 10 years of damage. I wish I had known about this product sooner. I bought my kit on \\&quot;sale\\&quot; from a dr&#x27;s office for $110 so if this is for real for $65 it&#x27;s quite a deal!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate with this one! I make sure I always have enough and when I get half way through the kit, I am on Amazon ordering more. I travel for a living and I would love to see a travel kit from them also. Seriously the best product I have ever used, it does what it is intended to do and then some. All I need now is shine control and I am ready to go. Only one draw back is the serum, pump dispenser sticks. This product has helped me control my acne at a 5 out of 5 stars...don&#x27;t let the price detour you, its worth it.</li>
    <li> Ladies and gentlemen, this stuff works.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve battled with acne off and on, but it&#x27;s gotten increasingly worse after the birth of my son (God, love him) 7 years ago.  I have very, very oily skin...so bad some people ask me if I&#x27;m sweating, LOL.  Since then, I&#x27;ve tried everything: Glytone, Proactive, Neutrogena, Panoxyl, ...strong stuff with 10% percent benzoyl peroxide, even a sonic cleasing brush (which I do love and still use), scrubs, peels, in home microdermabrasions and nothing ever gave me the clear skin I craved.      My dermatologist even put me on antibiotic on a daily basis, combined with the Glytone products and I still had milia (tiny bumps) around my chin and congested pores, especially around my cheek and nose area where my pores are the largest.  It wasn&#x27;t until I went to another doctor&#x27;s office for something completely unrelated that they suggested this product to me.  Of course they were selling it for $130.00, but being the Amazon shopper I am, I scored here for half the price. I just got the product on Saturday (3 days ago) and my face is already cleared up for the most part. I absolutely love the tingling sensation of the cleanser and the toner...it&#x27;s like you can feel it penetrating deep into your pores.  So I wake up this morning, and my pores are no longer congested, and the milia I had around my chin is gone! My skin is a tad bit dry, but according to other reviews, its normal and will go away.  I can reduce the application of the gel to once a day.    I may be premature in saying this after a few days, but I am sure that will never go back to another skin care product again.  If you&#x27;ve spent a small fortune trying to clear up your acne like I have, please give this a try.  It may take some time for your skin to adjust since everyone is different, but Clenziderm rocks!</li>
    <li> The order arrived faster than I expected!  Very quick!!  I used the product for the first week and I loved it, my pores seemed to get smaller.  I did start breaking out somewhat, but I gave it a chance.  I started breaking out even more and the acne seemed to be getting much bigger.  I stopped using it all together.  I was off it for about 1 1/2 weeks or so and I am giving it another chance.  I used it twice a day, once in the morning and once before bedtime.  I am now just using the product at bed time.  I will post an update if any changes occur.  Thanks to Amazon for their spectacular pricing.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase it at the salon because I would have spent twice as much.</li>
    <li> Great products.  I knew I needed a 1-2-3 set and what I was using prescribed by my dermatologist was not working (Differin).  The clenser does a great job. The second step product makes your face feel great and your face so clean.  The third step product dries and heals and my face does not become flaky.     The texture of my skin is so smoothe.  I went to another doctor for facial resurfacing and Obagi is the product they promote.      I was looking for something for my acne and found this product line.  The price was over $100.  Then I went to Amazon.com and found this set for $56.    Well worth your money. I needed a moisturizer and looked on line again.  I purchased Obagi Clenziderm M.D. Therapeutic Moisturizer from Amazon.com.  This product makes my face feel like silk.  I love the results.</li>
    <li> I am 36 and I have tried everything, antibiotics, prescription retinol and many other products.  I went and had photo facials and the esthetician gave me this product to try.  She said use it for at least 1 month to see results and reduce use to every other day if you get dryness. I did get a little dry at first. But she also gave me the clenziderm normal/dry theraputic lotion and that helped alot.  Its soothing.  After 1 month my skin was clearer than it has been in a loooong time.   I dont get cystic acne. just blocked pores and bumps on the sides of my nose and chin.  This stuff does work. My daughter is using the cleanser and toner in addition to her atralin and she finds it makes her skin even clearer than with just plain atralin.  The BPO will discolor clothes, sheets and towels and that is the one thing i hate.  But for clear skin, its worth it.  I buy my Obagi on ebay for cheaper. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW. I have for a long time suffered from acne. I have tried differin, retin-a, Benzaclin, and array of antibiotics, finacea, proactiv, max clear, cetaphil... and the list goes on. Seriously, my entire life I have struggled with acne. I have had chemical peels, laser treatments and microderm abrasions repeatedly and spent thousands of dollars.And with my ance I am not talking about a bump here and there, i&#x27;m talking deep cysts filled with fluid that made my face THROB! Finally I got put on accutane and it cleared my skin completely. 2 years later my acne is coming back big time, so I tried clenziderm. This product is a MIRACLE! I never review products but I really felt like I had to review this. Today is day 2 of using clenziderm and my acne is already going away. I am literally amazed. This product is so wonderful... the money is more than worth it. Please, if you suffer from acne try this product!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am 49 and had severe acne with knots and big red bumps (face, back and chest) since I was 15. My acne problem has made me very insecure. I have gone through many treatments; acid peels, blue peels, laser, 3 accutane treatments, and changed my diet and could not find anything that worked. A friend of mine recommended the Obagi Acne treatment. I started using it and after a month I noticed a difference in my skin texture. I used the products on my back and chest as well. The products were actually working. My skin was improving. I could feel the medicine working on the stubborn areas. The ingredients go deep in my skin to clear the bacteria. It also lightened the dark patches on my face. My skin is brighter, smoother and it looks healthier overall including my back and chest. I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 months now and keep seeing improvements every week. Ance is stubborn. I don&#x27;t know why some treatments work for some and not others. I found Obagi and it works for me where other more expensive treatments have failed. I am glad I found it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been seeing a dermatologist for about 12 years and have tried so many prescriptions for my acne that I can&#x27;t even count. Recently my MD asked if I would like to participate in a clinical study for this product and I gave it a shot. At first my skin got very chapped, but that went away. Honestly it took 10-12 weeks for my skin to get really clear, but I was getting the product for free, so I stuck with it. Now, my skin is smoother and clearer than it has been in years. The only other treatment that has ever been this effective for me is Accutane which has many more risks and side effects. I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on skin care, but once it started working, I stopped caring about the cost. I will continue to use it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 3 piece sets have lasted 2.5-3 months for me.</li>
    <li> Not many things are more frustrating than to suffer your whole adult life from acne, read rave reviews about a product, only to discover that it doesn&#x27;t work for you. I tried this kit only because I have an almost religious attachment to Obagi&#x27;s elastiderm eye cream. I assumed Obagi would clear my acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this kit is probably not a  good choice for inflammatory acne. The BP serum is extremely strong. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but the BP serum made my skin so scaly and irritated, I was embarrassed to leave the house until it healed up--and it aggravated my acne. Obagi encourages people to stick it out--that it gets better over time and that&#x27;s what I did for several weeks. It never got better. I also tried using less, but it still irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to discourage anyone from using something that has benefited so many people, but I feel the need to tell people to proceed with caution with these products. Since the kit is so expensive, try to get samples from your doctor or spa before shelling out the money. Then be careful with the BP serum by trying it on only a small area first and then gradually expand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this kit doesn&#x27;t work, go in the other direction and start using products to calm your skin down, such as gentle cleansers, natural remedies, and clay masks bought from health food stores. This is what finally worked for me. Good luck.</li>
    <li> REALLY FAST SHIPPING, EXACTLY AS STATED, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. SMOOTH TRANSACTION, HAPPY CUSTOMER. BRAND NEW AS DESCRIBED. THE BEST !!! TOO BAD THEY DISCONTINUED IT. WORKS !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I was ten I have struggled with acne. I&#x27;m 24 now and had tried Proactive, Maxclarity, Clean and Clear, Este Lauder, you name it, i wasted money on it.....Well, one of my co-workers recommended this product to me (that she pays $140.00 at a Doctors office for) and I decided to use my all time fave Amazon.com to try and find it. It only took one week for all the acne to clear up, sure I can see where some one would dry up and peel because it is pretty intense at first, but you&#x27;re not supposed to do the three step system EVERY time you wash(and I&#x27;m REALLY oily)!!!! You only do the three at night and then just wash or wash/astringent in the morning. I tell you, this is the best thing I could have done for myself...I&#x27;m so happy.    And a note on the shippers behalf,  The shipment got to my house in 5 days and that was with the free shipping. Very Impressive service and timing. Thank you, I&#x27;ll be ordering from you quite frequently!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product on Amazon because I purchased it for the first time at a spa and I paid 3x&#x27;s the money.  When I ran out I waited for a long time to purchase because of not wanting to spend that kind of money.  My face quickly began to go back to the horrible break out and I got desperate.  I found the Obagi Clenziderm and ordered it through Amazon by a vendor:  101 Medical Spa.  For a great price and got it quickly in the mail.  Thank you, my face is looking great and I will never allow myself to run out of my Clenziderm ever again.   This is a Top Notch product, worth the money.  You will love it.  I am wanting to purchase the Obagi Nuderm next for fading brown spots and for acne as well.  That kit is even more expensive.  Waiting to see if Amazon will carry the kit for a decent price.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing !! !use it only at night and in the morning i just wash my face with water and use a regular moisturizer. I have no more pimples ! and you can see the results within 2 weeks of using. i will be using this product for a while. it smells nice too and you can feel that the your skin is really clean after using the face wash. you should give it a try !!</li>
    <li> As all of these reviews start, I have had acne forever. I have been to countless dermatologists and tried literally everything (antibiotics, creams, Spiro, Proactiv, dry ice, etc, etc). I ordered Clenziderm with some aprehension because it is so exxpensive (best to order from Amazon, though). For the first week my faced burned. (I cannot stress how badly it burned). After it burned it became a red and scaly and a few parts literally peeled off (turns out the benzoyl treatment is super strong so you need to use only a small amount). I kept with the routine (and took it easy on the benzoyl) and my skin did a complete transformation. No more cysts, almost completely free of blackheads. I can literally just use a little concealer now (instead of a full foundation forcefield). I never write reviews, but I HAD to write this because this has been an amazing product. Just be patient and you will see results!! :)</li>
    <li> After reading all the wonderful reviews about this product I thought I came across a miracle worker. Wrong. I was so excited to start using this product I used it as directed and I had some of the worst acne of my life. I have acne prone skin thats a normal/dry combo. After the first day of using this I started getting whiteheads, EVERYWHERE. I figured it was just a phase and it would stop, no. Then I got one of those cyst acne right on my cheekbone and now I have scarring from it. I only used this for 2 weeks before I gave up. I&#x27;m not sure what would&#x27;ve happened if I went for the long haul but I couldn&#x27;t handle it. All skin types are different so hopefully this will work for you.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Honestly, I have tried everything there is out there. Proactive, AcneFree, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clean, Neutrogena, EVERYTHING. Nothing has ever worked this well or this fast!  When I started using it, my face kind of got flaky, but it soon went away and now I have clear skin! I have suffered from acne for a long time. I am almost 20 now, and finally have the clear skin I deserve.    The seller also got the item to me pretty fast! Only a couple of days if I recall correctly. The price is the best I have found for such service. I used to get it from my dermatologist and it cost me a good chunk of money!    I recommend this product and vendor to anyone. In fact, I am about to order more right now!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. My face used to be COVERED in acne, like every pore, had a little somthing somthing of it&#x27;s own, and if it didn&#x27;t the pore was HUGE, and I felt disgusting! I got the 1 (orange, 2 (Green), and 3(light blue) and two months later, my pores are no longer visible and i have but a few bits of acne in my hair line. I LOVE it, it&#x27;s amazing and i finally feel normal!</li>
    <li> I find product reviews very helpful when deciding whether or not to make a purchase. I hope this review is helpful to someone who feels that nothing is helping with their acne problem. As a teen I never suffered form acne but after having my children, I began breaking out. It got increasingly worse over the years. Now in my mid thirties I felt hopeless... At my age I should be worrying about wrinkles not acne! I began using this product after a friend recommended Obagi Nuderm products to me. Upon researching Obagi I found reference to this product which fit my needs better. Sounded wonderful and was exactly what I needed. Although skeptical (nothing else has worked: Proactive, Dermologica, Murad...), I decided to spend the hundred + dollars and give it a shot. I am so glad I did! I began using this in August and went from constant breakouts to an ocassional zit within weeks. I can now go weeks without a zit! And if I do get a zit it goes away quickly. Four months later, it is still working, and honestly my skin looks 100% better. I use all three products at night and just the cleanser in the morning. At first my skin was a little dry, but a few flakes were well worth the end result! The dryness does go away after about a month. Give it a try, I hope you see the same great results as I did. BTW, my husband cringes when I spend money on products that don&#x27;t work; Even he says that this is one product that is worth the money!</li>
    <li> i have tried everything for my skin. proactiv, murad, pills, scrubs, everything from the drug store, all the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cures, if its out there ive tried it and absolutely nothing worked for me.   i still got acne. my skin  dried out. i peeled. i broke out even more. i was worse off then i was to begin with.   then i tried obagi&#x27;s clenziderm kit. let me tell you, i have never ever in my life gotten so many compliments on my skin. within a week i already noticed a huge difference. my skin tone evenedout, no redness whatsoever. my skin didnt dry out or peel. my blackheads were disappearing. pimples and acne? goodbye. this product truly is a miracle.   even when i did break out in the beginning the thrid step:serum gel would get rid of them in a matter of hours, yes hours, and the break outs are incredibly small and dont turn red. you couldnt even see them. i have now been using this products for 5 months now and cant imagine my life without it. no acne. no pimples. no blackheads. no congested skin. no redness. no splotchy areas. i have absolutely radiant skin and for once in my life i am actually getting compliments on how great my skin looks!  instead of hiding my face and covering my skin in foundations and concealors, i now dont even need make up. i can show off my skin and be proud of the face i present to the world. i love this product so much and all of obagi&#x27;s products that i could scream it from the roof tops. hell, id even work for them. i want the world to say goodbye to their skin problems and hello to obagi and the beautiful skin that awaits them. i only wish that i didnt have to suffer for so long and found this product sooner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you enough how great this system is. I have been fighting acne since I was in middle school and I am 32 now. During the past 15+ years, I would do just about anything for clearer skin. I have found my answer. It took about 1-2 weeks before I noticed a big difference, but now my skin is 98% clear, 4-5 weeks after starting. It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other products. I use the cleanser (Step 1) and sometimes the toner (Step 2) in the AM and PM. I also use the lotion (Step 3) in the PM every other night. I also use a light moisturizer in the AM &amp; PM. My skin has not been dry or flaky at all like it was with other acne products. I highly recommend that you give this skin care system a try if you have acne. It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne for pretty much all of my life.  I tried everything from proactiv to cleansing and nothing helped.  I have been using the obagi product for about 2 weeks now and notice that my skin is very smooth, clearing up and no breakouts lately.  I will buy this product for the rest of my life if I have to</li>
    <li> As I am sure is the case with most acne sufferers if there is an acne medication on the market I have tried it. A dermatologist recommended that I try Clenziderm before I considered going taking Roaccutane and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. It is the only &#x27;over-the-counter&#x27; product I have used where I have been able to see a real and visible difference in my skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with acne prone skin. It is an easy to use 3-step system with a facial wash, a cleanser and a topical gel. I have found that if you stick to the recommended amounts that it is also quite a long lasting product, the only issues I have ever experienced was when I started using it twice a day I found that it could leave my skin quite red and flaky, this was resolved easily by going back to using it only once a day.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin break out uncontrollably for over a month, I stopped using it, and started using apple cider vinegar and my skin cleared right up, sounds weird, but IT WORKS! ObAGI IS WAY TOO DRYING, even for my very oily skin, The oil under my dry skin had no where to escape and caused huge breakouts, save your money and buy a $3 bottle of ASV</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, especially with my skin type. Which is oily and prone to breakouts. Blahhh!!!! But let me tell ya, my skin look way better!!! It has tightened and smoothed out my face!!! I recommend to anyone who has struggled with their skin and finding the right product!!! It&#x27;s also way cheaper online than at a doctors office.</li>
    <li> I used a lot  of acne product ..this one work very good..  I love obagi they worth for the money:)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. After years of searching, this cleaning system has truly cleared up my acne.</li>
    <li> This line of products is one of the few medicines I have found to work on adult acne.  It only takes a few minutes to use each of the three products, but provides amazing results.</li>
    <li> I had super high hopes for this given the other reviews that I read. Did not work for me at all. No mater how often I use this (once a day, twice a day, every other day) it was WAY too drying for my skin. The wash and the toner cause me to breakout within 2 days of using them (both contain menthol). The only item I can use is the BP lotion. It&#x27;s also very drying and I don&#x27;t think it works any better than a lower percentage lotion. This goes into the giant pile of acne stuff that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried it all, but everything I&#x27;ve tried for my adult acne stops working, so I have to find something else.  I have been pleased with this system so far:  I still get a few pimples, but when I diligently use this on them twice a day, the pimples never fully develop &amp; go away sooner.  My face feels cleaner &amp; healthier &amp; looks clearer.  I just hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> I have literally used every possible anti-acne system out there, and this is the only one that made my acne infested face clear. I cant believe it myself. Its a miracle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s and started to get adult acne in my late 30&#x27;s. It got progressively worse and on occasion, I would even have cystic acne, and those would last 2 weeks or more! The only medicine that halfway worked was Persa Gel (Benzyl Peroxide 10%). Retin-A and Vit C products made me break out worse and salicylic acid didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days of starting this regimen, my skin began to clear up. Please note for some people (per other reviews), it takes several weeks. I was lucky. My skin isn&#x27;t 100% clear, though. I still have huge pores and a lot of blackheads, but rarely do I have breakouts now and when I do, it&#x27;s only one or two blemishes and they only last a couple of days, not weeks. So I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have noted the smell of the BP lotion. It does smell weird, but you get used to it. My skin is so excessively oily, that my skin didn&#x27;t dry out at all, but I know some in the reviews have reported dry, flaky skin. It will bleach your clothes, pillow cases, and towels, so be careful to wash your hands after using and use white pillow cases if you don&#x27;t want bleach spots on them. I only use the BP lotion at night as to not bleach my clothes and it&#x27;s sufficient. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use it in the morning as a spot remedy if I&#x27;m starting to break out and it usually nips it in the bud or again, the break out only lasts a couple of days and is significantly milder. I also only use the pore refiner at night and I can see how it might be drying if it&#x27;s used a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, the product pricing has increase drastically since I bought mine in early July...I hope it goes down again as I&#x27;m almost out of product. :-( So it&#x27;s lasted 3 months for me. If anything changes, I&#x27;ll add to this review.</li>
    <li> For the price I expected alot more from this set. It did clear my skin up somewhat but it dried it out terribly. I am at a stage where I am noticing fine lines and wrinkles. Products that are overly drying don&#x27;t help the aging situation. I am generally normal to combination skin but this dried me out and left me flaky. My skin was so dry it then tried to produce more sebum. Which if you know anything about excess sebum.....isn&#x27;t great for the acne prone. If you are tough skinned this may work great for you though.</li>
    <li> I used the Obagi C system for over a year and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;However, there were diminishing returns and it didn&#x27;t address the break outs I started getting due to stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this system and my acne began to immediately clear up.&lt;br /&gt;It always consisted of mild whiteheads mostly on my jawline and chin but because of recent events, it started to get more serious so I looked for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally ordered the For Normal to Oily Skin set.&lt;br /&gt;I had worried it would be too drying, per some of the reviews--so I HAD wanted the Normal to Dry.&lt;br /&gt;My worries were unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced dryness but it&#x27;s important to note I use the CLENZ Therapeutic Moisturizer too.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate it with the moisturizer from the set, which contains a solution of Benzoyal Peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to order this again once I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Sadly this system was much to strong for me. I have sperratic breakouts and very oily skin all the time, so I thought I would try this product. It cleared my acne but left me with a horrible peeling face which didn&#x27;t get better untill I quit using the product. If you have severe acne I definitely think this product will help, but if you just have mild to moderate acne I would try something a bit more gentle. And the first time you use this product be ready for it burn! It really tingles but the more you use the less it hurts. I gave it four stars because I think it does what it is suppose to do but just wasn&#x27;t a good match for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best acne medication  on the market hands down, I&#x27;ve struggle with acne all my life seens I was 12 years old,I&#x27;m 30 now  I&#x27;ve tried it all laser, acutane, birth control, antibiotics oral inject, facial cream you name it I&#x27;ve tried it, if you this this product is expensive think twice, just before i found this I&#x27;ve just spent over $ 4 thousand  at the dermatologist an my acne came back....this products actually retails for around $120, obagi sales it to the retailers for around $55 thats why u can find good deals on i know because i sold it...this product cure my acne for real...even if i had to pay full price i willl... If you have acne try this is a gods send it was for me</li>
    <li> Its always a great product and my face is nice and clear! I will continue to purchase this item for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I have adult acne and this helps it better than anything I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am 32 and have dealt with acne since high school.  Once I hit 30 my acne seemed to kick into overdrive and became out of control.  I have tried/been on everything from Accutane, Proactive, Murad, Cetaphil, Differin, La Roche Posay, tea tree oil, and countless antibiotics, with no luck. Right before purchasing this product, my doctor agreed to put me back on Accutane. My acne was that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I went to a med spa to get a microdermabrasion treatment and the esthetician suggested Obgai Clenziderm.  Being a skeptic, I decided to not purchase the product in the salon and waited to search the product reviews before making the purchase. I absolutely LOVE this product!  I use the three step process in the morning and at night I use the cleanser, the Obgai Retin-A .1%, and then follow with the moisturizer.  It took about 6 weeks for me to see a complete turnaround in my skin, but it was definitely worth the wait!  I receive compliments about how great my skin looks and I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re talking about my skin!  This product has been a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> This product was very strong.  I do not recommend it for anyone with even semi senstive skin.  It did not smell nice either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne ever since grade school. In high school I had cystic acne and was on accutane, TWICE! I&#x27;m 24 and over the past few years my acne has finally started to subside, but I always get a terrible little breakouts around the time of my cycle. I used to use Obagi Nu Derm but honestly couldn&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds of dollars on a skin care line and eventually switched to something more affordable. A few months ago my sister gave Obagi CLENZIderm a whirl, and OH MY!! What a difference. Her skin cleared up and she no longer had hyper-pigmentation. We both have very fair, sensitive skin. I finally bought some and it is phenomenal!! Absolutely fabulous!! I had the same results; no more breakouts, no more hyper-pigmentation!! I used my clarisonic with it and the combo is amazing! My skin feels incredible, too. It&#x27;s smooth and soft. Oh, and another plus; it has greatly reduced the ugly black heads on my nose and I&#x27;ve been using this regimen for about a month!! JUST BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing trio it really is. It&#x27;s the best treatment out there for people like myself who has breakouts probably due to diet, hormones etc etc. I&#x27;m certainly not a teenager so that over the counter stuff doesn&#x27;t work. This is very effective and an investment I should&#x27;ve made a long time ago!!! Buy it buy it buy it!</li>
    <li> It takes longer than expected to see the improvement, but it is actually starting to diminish the blemishes.  Allow at least 3 weeks before you begin to see any results!</li>
    <li> great! love this product by obagi it is absolutely wonderful i am so sure you will love it just as much as i do!</li>
    <li> And I tried many prodocts. However this&lt;br /&gt;Is the best so far. The only thing I would recommend use sunscreen.</li>
