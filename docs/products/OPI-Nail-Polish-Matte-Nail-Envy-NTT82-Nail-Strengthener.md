      <li>I decided to try this product after reading about how awesome it was.</li>
      <li>This Nail Polish is Amazing!!</li>
      <li>But dealing w/ BP Nails was great.</li>
      <li>great and does not chip.&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a nail strenghthener it would probably be great</li>
      <li>Works great and at a reduced price.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite happy with his product.</li>
      <li>The best part is that there is no nasty smell from this product either.</li>
      <li>No one else has mentioned whether the finish is fairly matte or not.</li>
      <li>Still looking for good matte finish.</li>
      <li>I love OPI products!</li>
      <li>Giving three stars as it applies very smoothly and does a good job protecting my nails.</li>
      <li>great way to give your nails a clean look</li>
      <li>It looks very nice and works just as well as Original Nail Envy.</li>
      <li>hope OPI never discontinues this item like they did with my favorite summer color, Smok&#x27;n in Havana.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and got much better results than I hoped for.</li>
      <li>During those periods, I&#x27;ve test many \\&quot;nail strengtheners\\&quot; with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Per OPI&#x27;s instructions, the more coats I applied the shiner the finish got.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, what matters is that it worked fantastically well for me and did much more than just strengthen the nail.</li>
      <li>Received from seller very quickly.</li>
      <li>Fairly easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Fine for me</li>
      <li>Within a month, the nail was growing almost normally and now, four months later, is almost perfect.</li>
      <li>I am reviewing this in comparison to Original Formula Nail Envy.</li>
      <li>I suggest using this product if you are trying to strengthen your nails this product works wonders on nails that need special attention.</li>
      <li>Saved me lots of money, quick shipment and took care of everything quickly</li>
      <li>The answer is: At first, yes!</li>
      <li>Usually I love OPI, so when the Matte trend came in naturally I got the OPI matter cover.</li>
      <li>If I want to go colorless I just wear OPI glossy and give a fresh coat every couple of days.</li>
      <li>My nails used to be very strong, then suddenly they quit growing.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it states it will.</li>
      <li>This is the first product in over a year that has helped my nails grow.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all!</li>
      <li>Well......the first coat was matte as they claimed</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it was the just the coating that strengthened my nails.</li>
      <li>As far as it&#x27;s effectiveness vs. the original, no difference.</li>
      <li>I have always had problems with the top layer of my nails peeling and this, in addition to clipping very evenly and only filing in one direction</li>
      <li>Wife says it is a good nail strengthener, but the matte part is not very good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say that my nails are back to their old selves!</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>This product really isnt matte as they claim.  </li>
      <li>I really like the polish.  </li>
      <li>So, same wonderful Nail Envy, different finish for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looked really unsightly.</li>
      <li>I used original for a while a couple years ago and saw similar results.</li>
      <li>I love the wide brush, and it is a great base coat to follow with some color and a top coat.  </li>
      <li>but now is almost perfectly shaped and only slightly longer than my other</li>
      <li>It looks pretty natural</li>
      <li>True, my nails still break occasionally</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know whether it works as a strengthener, but  the gentle sheen it gives my nails is fabulous.</li>
      <li>At 1/4 of an inch past my fingertips, this is the longest I have been able to sustain my natural nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So far it seems to be helping a lot.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t rate the actual product since I haven&#x27;t used it, because the product contains Formaldehyde, which is very harmful to nails.</li>
      <li>This works as an impressive base coat for a manicure or pedicure.</li>
      <li>Every now and then, I kept tearing nails down to the quick</li>
      <li>I love this product, it is strengthening and subtle.</li>
      <li>I just have one nail that continually splits right down the middle, has done so for years ever since I slammed it in a door</li>

    <li> This nail strengthener is wonderful.  I love the wide brush, and it is a great base coat to follow with some color and a top coat.  I love OPI products!</li>
    <li> The product is one I&#x27;ve used before, so I know its quality. But dealing w/ BP Nails was great. Saved me lots of money, quick shipment and took care of everything quickly</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is strengthening and subtle. Working in  nursing I need to protect as I wash my hands constantly!</li>
    <li> I have (or had) thin fiinger nails, that will break or tear if I allowed them to grow even just a bit. I am a male, so it&#x27;s inconvenient, because I like using my hands to do odd things around the house.  So I used to have them trimmed all the way, so that the white line didn&#x27;t show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing strengthens your nails.  Seriously.  At first, I thought it was the just the coating that strengthened my nails. In the past half a year, I was too lazy to go through the ritual of applying it every other day and removing it on weekends. I believe that should have been sufficient time for my &amp;#34;strengthened&amp;#34; nail to have all grown out. I can definitely notice that my nails have strengthened.</li>
    <li> This Nail Polish is Amazing!! i usually have cracked nails and most of the time my nails are weak, as soon as i used this nail polish, my nails got stronger immeadiatly and i can actually grow them all( instaed of having one nail shorter than the other)</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it states it will. True, my nails still break occasionally but my attitude is \\&quot;they are nails\\&quot;! They will grow back</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with nail tearing and splitting for many years but has been worse the last year. I have tried a few other remedies including applying clear iodine. I tried other hardeners that didn&#x27;t work as well. After about a month of applying this product, I have just about eliminated the problem. I hope it continues to work. Fairly easy to apply. They recommend 2-3 coats and then 1 every other day. After about 3 weeks, I had to remove and start over which is a bit of a pain. I think I will probably try to apply only 2 or 3 times per week so it doesn&#x27;t get too thick. Received from seller very quickly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate the actual product since I haven&#x27;t used it, because the product contains Formaldehyde, which is very harmful to nails. The ingredients was not listed under \\&quot;product information\\&quot;, so it wasn&#x27;t until I received it that I saw the ingredients.  The seller did email me back after I contacted them about my concerns with the ingredients, saying that I can return for a refund, less the shipping, even though it said \\&quot;this item is non-refundable\\&quot;. So I will give them credit for doing that. I recommended that they include the ingredients to prevent this from happening again. I gave them a 4 star rating for them offering to refund, even though it said it was \\&quot;non-refundable\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynn</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this in comparison to Original Formula Nail Envy. No one else has mentioned whether the finish is fairly matte or not. The answer is: At first, yes! It looks very nice and works just as well as Original Nail Envy. However withing 6-12 hours it becomes glossy again. Not sure if the mattifying agent gets buffed off throughout normal wear or what? As far as it&#x27;s effectiveness vs. the original, no difference. I have been using two coats of this as my base coat for about a month now and I notice my nails tear less, and the whites look whiter. I have always had problems with the top layer of my nails peeling and this, in addition to clipping very evenly and only filing in one direction (kid stuff I know, but that was a hard habit to break!) has done wonders. I just have one nail that continually splits right down the middle, has done so for years ever since I slammed it in a door and that has not changed with the use of Nail Envy yet. I used original for a while a couple years ago and saw similar results. So, same wonderful Nail Envy, different finish for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I got mine at Ulta and it was TRIPLE the price! Someone come over here and slap my wrist!</li>
    <li> My husbands nails are peeling.  He can use this product, and it helps helps strengthen his nails.</li>
    <li> Works great and at a reduced price.  thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. My usually strong nails had become thin and brittle due to over use of gel manicures and some mistreatment while moving recently. I decided to try this product after reading about how awesome it was. I&#x27;m pleased to say that my nails are back to their old selves! Nail Envy has made it into my daily beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> I had a thumb nail damaged in an accident 8 years ago. It grew back knarled, flakey and ugly and stayed that way. It looked really unsightly. My doctor said just to hope it would eventually grow back properly and that there was no treatment. I used a variety of products to create a surface over it, all of which were quite tedious to use, tended to separate back off and none of which caused any improvement in the nail. Finally I came across Nail Envy and took a chance, in spite of the uninspiring name. I have used it now for 4 months. As noted in other reviews, it is not as matt as natural nail and so it can be obvious to anyone who sees your hand close up that you have nail polish on one nail. One solution would be to put it on all your nails, as it is matt enough that you wouldn&#x27;t know there was anything on the nail without a side by side comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what matters is that it worked fantastically well for me and did much more than just strengthen the nail. Within a month, the nail was growing almost normally and now, four months later, is almost perfect. The lunula (the white half moon under the nail) was completely distorted and extended but now is almost perfectly shaped and only slightly longer than my other thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and got much better results than I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go over black OPI nail polish I bought. It doesn&#x27;t make the polish as matte-like as I wanted, but it works well with strengthening.</li>
    <li> This works as an impressive base coat for a manicure or pedicure. I have found that it has allowed my nails to grow stronger and healthier. I bought it due to my big toe always chipping (I&#x27;m a runner &amp; dancer) and this has allowed my pedicures to actually last longer, probably even twice the length of duration for my pedicures.</li>
    <li> It took quite a few coats to almost get the matte effect. As a nail strenghthener it would probably be great but that didnt help me at all.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this product actually does work. I had trouble with my nails splitting and this product helps this and I don&#x27;t even use it every 2 days like it suggests. I put it under my nail polish and I only paint my nails once a week.</li>
    <li> I plan to buy another when this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;works great and does not chip.&lt;br /&gt;A great way to give your nails a clean look&lt;br /&gt;without the shine.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used by itself or as a base with a polish on top&lt;br /&gt;of it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is not as advertised. It is NOT matte. It is simply a glossy nail strengthener. Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I had gel on my nails for the past few years and took it off used this for a month and you would think I have gel on again. Awesome ..</li>
    <li> I purchased the OPI matte finish hardener based their claim that is was truly a \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; and as such, men could use it. Well......the first coat was matte as they claimed but that&#x27;s where it ended. Per OPI&#x27;s instructions, the more coats I applied the shiner the finish got. It actually got to the point at the end of a week&#x27;s trial, that it looked like I had applied a layer of glossy lacquer to my nails. I hated the end result at the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be truly a matte finish, you need to only apply one layer of hardener which goes against the manufacturer&#x27;s directions and possible benefits. Obviously this product was meant for women and to be applied as a base coat under colored lacquer. If you are a man, save your money!!  This product really isnt matte as they claim.  I give it a 1-star rating at best and will continue to search for a truly matte finish product that men can use.</li>
    <li> My natural nails are paper thin and without fake nails on I find it hard to do the simplest things. I&#x27;m not a prissy girl; I&#x27;m active, carefree, and rough with my hands. For the past 15 years or so, I&#x27;ve worn solar nails just to function. Once a year I take the fakes off to let my nails breathe. During those periods, I&#x27;ve test many \\&quot;nail strengtheners\\&quot; with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I was amazed!! I applied two coats of OPI Nail Envy Strengthener topped with two coats of OPI Smok&#x27;n in Havana color. I expected my nails to be flimsy and bendable but no ... they were actually STIFF!! At 1/4 of an inch past my fingertips, this is the longest I have been able to sustain my natural nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope OPI never discontinues this item like they did with my favorite summer color, Smok&#x27;n in Havana.</li>
    <li> This was just a waste of my money! Seriously!!! It didn&#x27;t turn my nail color to matte. I was very upset because its opi and it usually works. :( not this time. :(</li>
    <li> Usually I love OPI, so when the Matte trend came in naturally I got the OPI matter cover. It doesn&#x27;t work very well at all! Try using the Orly brand which made my nails look perfectly matter. I used this OPI topcoat on different shades including black and it just didn&#x27;t turn out as it was suppose to. Pretty unhappy about it.</li>
    <li> My nails are getting stronger everytime I use this product. The best part is that there is no nasty smell from this product either.</li>
    <li> I suggest using this product if you are trying to strengthen your nails this product works wonders on nails that need special attention.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI Matte Finish as a base coast for a colored polish. If I want to go colorless I just wear OPI glossy and give a fresh coat every couple of days.</li>
    <li> I really like the polish.  However, the bottle is awful.  Every time I screw the brush back in little pieces of black peel off and get in the polish.  Really frustrating to have flakes of black in your clear polish.</li>
    <li> This is the first product in over a year that has helped my nails grow.  My nails used to be very strong, then suddenly they quit growing. I know different products work for different people, and I&#x27;ve tried several products, but this is the only one that helped me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know whether it works as a strengthener, but  the gentle sheen it gives my nails is fabulous.</li>
    <li> This product is not at all matte - it&#x27;s a little less shiny than ordinary clear polish but that&#x27;s it.  Giving three stars as it applies very smoothly and does a good job protecting my nails. Fine for me but if you don&#x27;t want shine, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am a man who likes to work with tools. Every now and then, I kept tearing nails down to the quick and then you can&#x27;t seem to cut it short enough to keep from snagging it on something - yeow that hurts! I have started putting a couple of coats of this on every weekend. So far it seems to be helping a lot. It looks pretty natural and I&#x27;m quite happy with his product.</li>
    <li> Wife says it is a good nail strengthener, but the matte part is not very good.  Still looking for good matte finish.</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly as expected!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
