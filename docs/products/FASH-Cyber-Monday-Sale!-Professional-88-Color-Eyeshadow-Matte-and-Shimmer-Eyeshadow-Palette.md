      <li>Great price and great product.</li>
      <li>Very nice eye shadows</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found the best, most effective way to use these shadows by either dampening the brush I apply with, wetting the darker ones to use as liners, or applying using my fingers (works well for highlighter shades).</li>
      <li>I saw all the good reviews on this product and decided to order it and try it out.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a good condition.</li>
      <li>I loved this eye shadow palette.</li>

      <li>I was very pleased the quality of the eyeshadow pallette i received.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>I love this palette!</li>
      <li>That was the first word that came out of my mouth after inspecting this wonderful palette.</li>
      <li>but the colors are just amazing.</li>
      <li>This palette is amazing.</li>
      <li>Regardless of how I saw fit for packaging the kit was in great condition.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I had been looking for a nice selection of both matte and shimmer colors.</li>
      <li>and the colors are very pigmented and gorgeous!!!</li>
      <li>The colours feel smooth and creamy and apply flawlessly with the most easy blending.</li>
      <li>I whole heartedly believe I got what I paid for and more just because of the great colors and the fact that it ultamatly arrived undamaged!</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time this morning, and it looks beautiful.</li>
      <li>It is by far the best palette I&#x27;ve ever purchased for a price like this!!</li>
      <li>The choice of colors is great, I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet, but they all look pretty.</li>
      <li>cause I have so many to choose from.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need primer or worry about touching up.</li>
      <li>I love the intensity of the colors and the variety.</li>
      <li>I love the variety of colors and finishes provided.</li>
      <li>I just wished it had a more creative set up since it was puchased to give as a gift.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this eyeshadow...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible product at all, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it&#x27;s the best eye shadow either.</li>
      <li>love the mixture of Matte and Shimmer colors...</li>
      <li>I love this palette, I have three daughters ranging from 17 to 20, so</li>
      <li>and I would have to say the color of the shadows are top quality and the price was outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I am glad my friend Karin mentioned to me about this lovely shimmer palette, which I instantly gifted to my girl friend.</li>
      <li>The colors are all very very nice not to bright like greens and pink or purple.</li>
      <li>And though the shadow doesn&#x27;t cling well to your eyelids, it sure as hell likes to stay put where you DON&#x27;T want it - like under your eyes where, if your in your 40s, you don&#x27;t want it because if you try to brush it away or use a q-tip to get rid of it, it digs it into any fine lines you may have.</li>
      <li>The colors are amazing, and the palette is just the right size.</li>
      <li>Easy fix</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful lots of glitter &amp; shine or just regular ones to choose from and combined.</li>
      <li>But for the money it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>First off, I was pleased to see that this company was able to deliver to Hawaii</li>
      <li>if eighty eight is HUGE.</li>
      <li>love the warm colors, some days I just want to be natural...</li>
      <li>but some colors are two light.</li>
      <li>Second, I always shop amazon for deals and I was not too happy to find so many nice make-up kits for the same price.   </li>
      <li>First, I must say that I don&#x27;t believe that it was packaged appropriately.</li>
      <li>So excited when I received this jewel in the mail.  </li>
      <li>I am excited each time</li>
      <li>For the price, this palette is worth it!</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>Received item quickly.</li>
      <li>(did not have to pay for shipping because the super saver).</li>
      <li>The price is absolutely amazing for the quality of the product, I definitely recommend it and encourage people to buy it, you will not regret it!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s well worth the money you pay</li>
      <li>The colors look really nice on the actual palette</li>
      <li>and it came a day early, which always puts people in a better mood.</li>
      <li>but when you try to put them on you really have to spend a lot of time really layering it on because they are extremely light.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>with this palette and because they have different skin colors I&#x27;m able to use one palette verse&#x27;s buying a variety of palette&#x27;s</li>
      <li>They were superficial, and I was able to press the powder back into their cups with no problem.</li>
      <li>First I would like to begin with the negitives.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I have to complain about is the mirror came unglued to the top of the palette.</li>
      <li>The colors are excellently pigmented, and have no creasing while using an appropriate base.</li>
      <li>When I opened this palette, I thought the colors were gonna look great, however these shadows are very powdery and just get all over your face and not really much pigment when you actually apply them and don&#x27;t stick well.</li>
      <li>Its a more natural set with lots of browns, natural and a little bit more of everything</li>
      <li>They really need to improve their packaging.</li>
      <li>(just wish it didn&#x27;t take so much effort).</li>
      <li>Product is very pigmented.....</li>
      <li>I wished I would have just spent the money on a lot fewer colors but better quality.</li>
      <li>I really like this palette.  </li>
      <li>and it was very affordable</li>
      <li>So many colors to choose from that I don&#x27;t need any of my other separate eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>It would seem that a little more protection for the shipping this item is needed.</li>
      <li>Smaller than I expected from the picture, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I have been using professional eye makeup for a while</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift and so far the receipent seems to like it.</li>
      <li>The colors are true and long lasting.</li>
      <li>They also don&#x27;t start falling down after awhile, they look fresh for hours</li>
      <li>but it takes me a while to get the shade that I want which is why Ive only used it a couple of times when I actually had the time to sit there and really layer the eyeshadow on and keep in mind I am fairly light skinned so usually</li>
      <li>I do makeup professionally, and it works wonderfully--having an assortment of all essential colors that will compliment nearly everyone&#x27;s complexion.</li>
      <li>I have to be careful with how much I eyeshadow</li>
      <li>The actual envelope needs to be marked as fragile, not the package inside because no one can see that unless they open the package.</li>
      <li>Frustrating, too, because the fine powder can blast color all over the place around your eyes, on your cheeks, etc.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome colors for a great price!! This wide selection allows you to mix and match and experiment with different colors to suit your mood.</li>
    <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. I love the intensity of the colors and the variety. The only negative thing I would have to say is that one of the eyeshadows was damaged and it made a little mess. Nothing serious. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s well worth the money you pay and the colors are very pigmented and gorgeous!!! I&#x27;ve reccomended it to all my friends. It is by far the best palette I&#x27;ve ever purchased for a price like this!!</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not high-end makeup.  But for the money it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this a Looks like a great product. I bought this as a gift and so far the receipent seems to like it. She wears it everyday.</li>
    <li> I saw all the good reviews on this product and decided to order it and try it out. I was initially going to buy Coastal Scents eyeshadow, but this was cheaper so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The amount of each shadow you get is a lot less than I thought it was, which I guess is probably why the price was cheaper. The choice of colors is great, I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet, but they all look pretty. I used it for the first time this morning, and it looks beautiful. Some of the browns I had a problem getting to show up on my lid, but I also didn&#x27;t use any eye shadow primer, so that might make a difference. It&#x27;s not a horrible product at all, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say it&#x27;s the best eye shadow either.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! So many colors to choose from that I don&#x27;t need any of my other separate eyeshadows. They also don&#x27;t start falling down after awhile, they look fresh for hours so I don&#x27;t need primer or worry about touching up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! the colors are fantastic,they last all day without creasing and it was packaged and shipped so that it was not damaged in anyway when I received it.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette.  Lots of neutral colors and the shimmer is not overwhelming.  A really good buy!</li>
    <li> Three words - \\&quot;Value for money\\&quot;. I think this is one of those products which you will never knew about unless it&#x27;s word of mouth. I am glad my friend Karin mentioned to me about this lovely shimmer palette, which I instantly gifted to my girl friend. She loved it, and so did I as she was happy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I had been looking for a nice selection of both matte and shimmer colors. This palette is amazing. I do makeup professionally, and it works wonderfully--having an assortment of all essential colors that will compliment nearly everyone&#x27;s complexion. I would definitely buy FASH again. The colors are excellently pigmented, and have no creasing while using an appropriate base. For the price, this palette is worth it!</li>
    <li> Ive used this palette a couple of times since I bought it, like the title says its so so. The colors look really nice on the actual palette but when you try to put them on you really have to spend a lot of time really layering it on because they are extremely light. I like the ending result but it takes me a while to get the shade that I want which is why Ive only used it a couple of times when I actually had the time to sit there and really layer the eyeshadow on and keep in mind I am fairly light skinned so usually I have to be careful with how much I eyeshadow I put on.</li>
    <li> First I would like to begin with the negitives. First, I must say that I don&#x27;t believe that it was packaged appropriately. Second, I always shop amazon for deals and I was not too happy to find so many nice make-up kits for the same price.   Now for the prositives. Regardless of how I saw fit for packaging the kit was in great condition. The product itself has great colors. I just wished it had a more creative set up since it was puchased to give as a gift. I whole heartedly believe I got what I paid for and more just because of the great colors and the fact that it ultamatly arrived undamaged!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time....excellent on packaging....it was all intact.....no mold not crack... LOVE IT!!! Product is very pigmented.....</li>
    <li> I have been using professional eye makeup for a while and I would have to say the color of the shadows are top quality and the price was outstanding.  I used eight colors on my daughters eyes which blended well without creasing. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This palette was absolutely wonderful and the packaging was perfect. I havn&#x27;t used it yet but the colors are just amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this palette, I have three daughters ranging from 17 to 20, so with this palette and because they have different skin colors I&#x27;m able to use one palette verse&#x27;s buying a variety of palette&#x27;s like I use to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the warm colors, some days I just want to be natural...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the mixture of Matte and Shimmer colors...</li>
    <li> Received item quickly. Despite being well packaged for shipping, two colors were chipped. They were superficial, and I was able to press the powder back into their cups with no problem. I love the variety of colors and finishes provided. Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow...It came in 2 days just like it should have. Not a color was broken or the mirror. The colors are beautiful lots of glitter &amp; shine or just regular ones to choose from and combined. I was worried the color wouldnt show as I read in other reviews but I dont seem to have that problem. Id buy again love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It arrived in a good condition. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very nice eye shadows but some colors are two light.</li>
    <li> So excited when I received this jewel in the mail.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the colors to look the way you want them to.  None of the colors were broken when I received the package.  I am excited each time I know I get to use these eyeshadows cause I have so many to choose from.</li>
    <li> The good ... the colors are gorgeous and you can put together just about every look imaginable with them. The bad ... they&#x27;re super powdery and they don&#x27;t cling very well if you apply them dry - even after using an eyeshadow primer/base and using high quality brushes. Frustrating, too, because the fine powder can blast color all over the place around your eyes, on your cheeks, etc. And though the shadow doesn&#x27;t cling well to your eyelids, it sure as hell likes to stay put where you DON&#x27;T want it - like under your eyes where, if your in your 40s, you don&#x27;t want it because if you try to brush it away or use a q-tip to get rid of it, it digs it into any fine lines you may have. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the best, most effective way to use these shadows by either dampening the brush I apply with, wetting the darker ones to use as liners, or applying using my fingers (works well for highlighter shades). Like I said, you get what you pay for. It takes some practice to make these shadows work but I do like the result (just wish it didn&#x27;t take so much effort). One last word of advice - hold a tissue under your eyes when you apply the shadows as it&#x27;ll keep the colors from getting under your eyes &amp; on your cheeks.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was broken. The palette was broken and a few eyeshadows were also broken. Im really disappointed in that. It was pretty frustrating to open this and see eyeshadow dust everywhere. The actual envelope needs to be marked as fragile, not the package inside because no one can see that unless they open the package.</li>
    <li> several of the eye shadows were broken. I actually ordered another Fash pallette and they were even worse.  On this one, only about 4 were broken (which is why I didn&#x27;t return it), but on the other one, a dozen were broken.  They really need to improve their packaging.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It came unharmed, nothing broken. I got two day shipping and it came a day early, which always puts people in a better mood. The colors are amazing, and the palette is just the right size. Smaller than I expected from the picture, but that&#x27;s fine. The only thing that I have to complain about is the mirror came unglued to the top of the palette. Easy fix though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is a 5 star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love it! The different colors make it possible for blending and mixing colors!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased the quality of the eyeshadow pallette i received. The colors are true and long lasting. I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> Wow. That was the first word that came out of my mouth after inspecting this wonderful palette. The colours feel smooth and creamy and apply flawlessly with the most easy blending. Only one colour was terrible (The pink mixture type) . One out if eighty eight is HUGE. Even shipping was beautiful. The palette was packed carefully and not a single shadow broke. I am extremely happy with this purchase. If you are hesitating buying this, don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best palette i own, it comes with just about every color you can think of, it is of great quality, the packaging was amazing; there were NO broken colors, the mirror was intact, everything was in great condition. The price is absolutely amazing for the quality of the product, I definitely recommend it and encourage people to buy it, you will not regret it!!</li>

I wished I would have just spent the money on a lot fewer colors but better quality.</li>
    <li> First off, I was pleased to see that this company was able to deliver to Hawaii and it was very affordable (did not have to pay for shipping because the super saver). The palette matte and shimmer shades looked great and there is a lot of choices to use as a combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have to say about this product is not the product itself, but the packaging of the shipping. When the makeup arrived it looked like one of the eyeshadow was smashed which scattered over the rest of the palette. It would seem that a little more protection for the shipping this item is needed. However, after wiping away the excess remnants, the majority of the makeup palette was unscathed and thus useable.</li>
    <li> I loved this eye shadow palette. The colors are all very very nice not to bright like greens and pink or purple. Its a more natural set with lots of browns, natural and a little bit more of everything</li>
