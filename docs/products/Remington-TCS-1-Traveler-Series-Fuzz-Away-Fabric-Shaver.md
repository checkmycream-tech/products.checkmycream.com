      <li>It works wonderfully on knit products to remove &amp;quot;pilling&amp;quot;, but it has a hard time with large pills from sweaters.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem worth it to spend over an hour removing pills.  </li>
      <li>It worked well right after I bought it, but never like I thought (hoped) it would.</li>

      <li>Follow these tips and you will not be able to complain; assumming you are not predisposed to complain about life in general.</li>
      <li>Rated this 4 stars because it is not the big industrial model that is more powerful.  </li>
      <li>So far it seem to be really good on batteries and is a pretty quiet running gadget.</li>
      <li>With that being said, it is not a bad little gadget to have handy.  </li>
      <li>sweater had a lot of lint ) and you might have to go over the same spot more than once.</li>
      <li>I first purchased a fabric shaver twenty years ago and paid twice the price of this fabric shaver.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not my first purchase of a fabric shaver.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t return it as it was too much effort!  </li>
      <li>now she is back and school and took her shaver with her :)</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see my clothes looking more like they did when they were new.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for large jobs (blankets, etc.).</li>
      <li>This is a handy little gadget for clearing pills and surface lint from sweaters.</li>
      <li>And since the prodcut was really inexpensive, I assumed that it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>The sheets went from feeling like I was sleeping with sand in the bed back to feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have lost all respect for the Remington name and some respect for Amazon for carrying such a piece of cheap trash.</li>
      <li>Thanks Fast Shipment</li>
      <li>Really, what do you expect for 5 bucks?</li>
      <li>This model does very well eliminating pills from your sweaters.</li>
      <li>Great gift for Secret Santa.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable also.</li>
      <li>Really found a lent eater.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I use mainly Ds and AAs, so was very irritated that I had to go out of my way to find Cs.</li>
      <li>I had to go over them a couple times, but the jacket looks brand new again!</li>
      <li>but it does all come off and the chamber is easy to remove to empty.</li>
      <li>The lint container is fairly easy to empty</li>
      <li>Sure they&#x27;re a little wimpy for power, but they do the trick.  </li>
      <li>It would have been worth it in the long run to spend a little more money and get a stronger/better shaver.  </li>
      <li>and they told me that they would send out a new foil, which never came.</li>
      <li>I love this little gadgit!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best if you regularly shave off pills as they develop, not wait until they are thick like a little bubbly lawn on your sweater.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super fast or powerful but it does the job.</li>
      <li>They are so cheap that the one at home broke the same day and the second one at work is on its last leg.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how efficiently and \\&quot;clean\\</li>
      <li>The old one just keeps on running.  </li>
      <li>Some larger that this one, but this one performs very well for 90% of the items we&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
      <li>have used it 3 times thus far</li>
      <li>use it most on cotton knot pants and tight wave knit sweaters (loose knits may get caught in the mechanism).  </li>
      <li>Did not do well on larger sofa fuzz-nummins, but for normal use, it&#x27;s performed up to expectations.</li>
      <li>We purchased a lint &#x27;stone&#x27; locally from a dry cleaner and it works really well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from the shaver per the other reviews that I had read.</li>
      <li>The reason I only gave it three stars is the fact that it took multiple passes to clear all the pills.</li>
      <li>Even when working, it didn&#x27;t shave much and I had to go over the same area repeatedly with minimal results.  </li>
      <li>My new jacket showed some signs of wear and tear with the loose treads sticking out.</li>
      <li>I bought a new one of these, got it in the mail, put in the battery, and it worked for all of 10 minutes before going dead and refusing to work again, even with new batteries.  </li>
      <li>This is a pill sahve for sweaters, tee shirts, and any other fabrics that may fine or small pills on the fabric.  </li>
      <li>It is not intenended for large pills that may accumulate on lambswool or heavy sweaters.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had several of these shavers. Some larger that this one, but this one performs very well for 90% of the items we&#x27;ve used it for. Did not do well on larger sofa fuzz-nummins, but for normal use, it&#x27;s performed up to expectations.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how efficiently and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; it shaves. Never tried a product of this type before. My new jacket showed some signs of wear and tear with the loose treads sticking out. This little machine made it look like new again. I also successfully used it for the sweater. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am on the road four to seven days a month.  I pack this product for road use just in case that I need it.  This shaver is small enought that you never miss the space that it takes up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I keep my hygiene bag packed 100% of the time.  My fabric shaver is packed right beside all of the items that I utilize in the evenings and mornings during travel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is not my first purchase of a fabric shaver.  I first purchased a fabric shaver twenty years ago and paid twice the price of this fabric shaver.  This item cost less that what I normally leave for a tip.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchase Duracell batteries for this product, just as I purchase for all non-electronic uses.  Move the fabric shaver in slow circular motions.  Follow these tips and you will not be able to complain; assumming you are not predisposed to complain about life in general. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Purchase this product with confidence.  Prices have decreased with time and quality has improved.</li>
    <li> I bough this for my daughter for Christmas. It works so well! I wish I had ordered 2 becuase now she is back and school and took her shaver with her :)</li>
    <li> if you buy this remember to buy the &#x27;C&#x27; battery for it.  also if you use it for too long it tends to smell like something burning , but it goes away if you just ignore it. you also have to claen it regularly(my sweater had a lot of lint ) and you might have to go over the same spot more than once. but other than that it works well. i am very happy with my purchase and have recomended it to others as well. the sweater came out &#x27;like new&#x27; which is better than i could hope for. &lt;br /&gt;i recommend this for a very nice quick fix to lint. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the shaver per the other reviews that I had read. And since the prodcut was really inexpensive, I assumed that it wouldn&#x27;t work. However, I had a jacket with many pills on it. I was able to remove them ALL! It was a little time consuming. I had to go over them a couple times, but the jacket looks brand new again! I am very impressed with this little, inexpensive machine!</li>
    <li> I bought this to handle full-sized sheets that had pilled very badly.  It&#x27;s not the fastest machine going, but it did finally get rid of the pills.  I had to keep going over the areas, but I did get rid of all the pills.  The sheets went from feeling like I was sleeping with sand in the bed back to feeling smooth.  It&#x27;s easy to work and it does a good job of catching the pills in the container.  The reason I only gave it three stars is the fact that it took multiple passes to clear all the pills.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  It broke the same day.  I didn&#x27;t return it as it was too much effort!  Warning...a waste of money!</li>
    <li> My mom had something like this years ago and loved it, so after searching around I purchased this. It worked well right after I bought it, but never like I thought (hoped) it would. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 yrs and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all, even after replacing batteries. At least it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2006 and it still works as well as it did back then.  This is not a heavy duty shaver, but it is very effective at removing piling and fuzz from sweaters and pants.  While I will agree with other reviewers that its not the fastest, it serves its purpose and shaves fabric without damaging it.  And for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining about the speed, or lack thereof.</li>
    <li> I love this little gadgit!  I had one for 10 years that I bought from a local Remington store (now closed), the screen just now has worn out, the motor is still strong.  I was so excited to see it on Amazon.com! It works better than anything I have tried to get fuzzies&#x27; off clothes and its fun to use!</li>
    <li> This device doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected it to. You have to push really hard and it still doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. We purchased a lint &#x27;stone&#x27; locally from a dry cleaner and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Really, what do you expect for 5 bucks? The unit works just fine. It&#x27;s not super fast or powerful but it does the job. Just have a relatively firm surface to place the item to be shaved on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for large jobs (blankets, etc.). I bought it for the wool cuffs and waistband of my leather jacket and for that purpose, it&#x27;s perfect! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a variety of different shirts, sweaters, and pants and it had no effect.  I finally tried it on a shag carpet rug just to see if it did anything other than buzz--it worked on the rug, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.  For just the average fuzz balls that appear on clothing, it was completely useless.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully on knit products to remove &amp;quot;pilling&amp;quot;, but it has a hard time with large pills from sweaters. It serves the purpose I bought it for and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This item did not seem to work on any fabric I tried.  Turns out it&#x27;s crap.  Not one speck of lint in the trap.  What&#x27;s up with that?  I needed something that works for my fuzz ridden garments man.</li>
    <li> This thing works and works great.  I do not know what you are trying to shave, but I have had the same device for at least three years now and it works without a hitch.  This is a pill sahve for sweaters, tee shirts, and any other fabrics that may fine or small pills on the fabric.  It is not intenended for large pills that may accumulate on lambswool or heavy sweaters.  Please disregard the foul reviews and understand this is a great price on a great little machine.</li>
    <li> Great product ..... cuts away fuzz balls on most fabrics ....... &lt;br /&gt;does not damage goods ..... a bit &#x27;under powered&#x27; will purchase a &lt;br /&gt;non battery unit to do heavy duty \\&quot;Fuzz Busting\\&quot; to suppliment this &lt;br /&gt;unit. Takes \\&quot;C\\&quot; batteries ...would prefer that it took \\&quot;AA\\&quot; batteries &lt;br /&gt;so that the unit could be easily recharged ..... Hate to buy disposibles! &lt;br /&gt;My wife has lots of fun with this product!  I think she&#x27;s getting addicted &lt;br /&gt;to \\&quot;Fuzz-Busting\\&quot;  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working pretty much fine for me. And the price is very good. Excelent cost benefit.</li>
    <li> This item is light weight but works good at removing those stubborn fuzz balls from clothing.  Somestimes you have to make several passes but it does all come off and the chamber is easy to remove to empty. So far it seem to be really good on batteries and is a pretty quiet running gadget.</li>
    <li> I had previously used a fabric shaver that sucked all the pills off my sweaters without a problem.  This shaver is more tedious - I have to make multiple passes before I get the pills removed, and on a very-pilly sweater I have, I actually gave up.  It didn&#x27;t seem worth it to spend over an hour removing pills.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver - I think you DO get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is one of those things that I didnt know I needed until I had it.  Basicly, it removes the fuzz and *pilling* from clothing.  I have found it especially helpful on knits, particulary lesser quality knits which seem to pill a lot.&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this  I was surprised to see my clothes looking more like they did when they were new.  A great thing considering the cost of this!&lt;br /&gt;I use it most on cotton knot pants and tight wave knit sweaters (loose knits may get caught in the mechanism).  I have used it on a sofa on areas of wear, a blanket, a towel (bad idea..it sucked in the terry piles), and several clothing items I thought were *gonners* only to find they looked almost good as new.</li>
    <li> For $5, this is the best way to keep your favorite items looking like new.  I have bought several over the years.  Sure they&#x27;re a little wimpy for power, but they do the trick.  It&#x27;s best if you regularly shave off pills as they develop, not wait until they are thick like a little bubbly lawn on your sweater.  That&#x27;s when they jam and don&#x27;t work as well.  I do agree, though, that a \\&quot;C\\&quot; battery was the wrong choice.  I use mainly Ds and AAs, so was very irritated that I had to go out of my way to find Cs.</li>
    <li> It is very economical and does a very good job. Must buy item.</li>
    <li> Considering the cost of this item, I should not have to complain but I will. This product only works if you press on it really hard, and then you still are basically pressing and  pressing with minimum results. Word to the wise, invest in a better product or get a new garment.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, one for work and one for home. They are so cheap that the one at home broke the same day and the second one at work is on its last leg. IT doesn&#x27;t work that well either. Save your money.</li>
    <li> With that being said, it is not a bad little gadget to have handy.  I had a very particular item of clothing in mind when I ordered this from Amazon, and although it took quite some time and needless to say, patience, the little bugger worked \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes it feels cheap, yes it required plenty of \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; as it gets jammed easily and as I mentioned before, you&#x27;ll need your fair share of elbow grease. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used it 3 times thus far and it still works.  I don&#x27;t plan on beating the life out of it, so I think it will have a \\&quot;to be expected\\&quot; life expectancy around my household.</li>
    <li> This item was very low cost, but didn&#x27;t last long for me and didn&#x27;t have the strength I needed for my sweaters.  It would have been worth it in the long run to spend a little more money and get a stronger/better shaver.  Mine didn&#x27;t even last 1 winter season.</li>
    <li> This item worked until the foil started to fall apart. I called customer service from Remington and they told me that they would send out a new foil, which never came. I guess I should have boought a more expensive product.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little gadget for clearing pills and surface lint from sweaters. The battery cover doesn&#x27;t always stay on tight, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to keep me from using it. The lint container is fairly easy to empty and it&#x27;s easy to see when it&#x27;s full. It restored a favorite sweater of mine - so it&#x27;s already worth the small amount of money I spent!</li>
    <li> Shock!  Really found a lent eater.  The only place that still has them. Thanks Fast Shipment</li>
    <li> Product just as I expected.  Rated this 4 stars because it is not the big industrial model that is more powerful.  This model does very well eliminating pills from your sweaters.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this item, I expected the bigger version. the battery does not exactly cradle in the case. It does its job removing lint balls. I don&#x27;t use it that often but it is nice to have. One is enough. Great gift for Secret Santa.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The price was reasonable also. It is great for flannel sheets and socks that come out of the dryer linty.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give this item a single star if I could!  I know that this shaver is inexpensive, but it should at least work for the $8 you have to pay between the shaver and the shipping.  I bought a new one of these, got it in the mail, put in the battery, and it worked for all of 10 minutes before going dead and refusing to work again, even with new batteries.  Even when working, it didn&#x27;t shave much and I had to go over the same area repeatedly with minimal results.  All I can tell you is that you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver!  I have lost all respect for the Remington name and some respect for Amazon for carrying such a piece of cheap trash.</li>
    <li> The shaver I got is a piece of junk. It worked for 2 min before it went dead.</li>
    <li> exact product at an affordable price w a smooth transaction &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought one of these to replace one just like it that I bought in the late 80s or early 90s.  The old one just keeps on running.  The battery life is excellent in this as well.  It does a great job of clearing away fabric pills.</li>
    <li> Great for getting rid if snags on fabrics, this is the second one I own, wish it require 2 AA batteries instead of 1 C battery</li>
