    <li> I like this product it has been in business for a long time. I would recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son who has long hair that is very stiff and coarse. He has always wanted straight hair and his is anything but straight. I had him apply a small amount of this product evenly to his hair from root to tip and then he used his press comb on his hair. It worked wonders. I think if he had gone back over his  hair again with his flat iron straightener his hair would have looked even more straight. This product with the press comb left a nice sheen to his hair without a greasy look.</li>
    <li> This hair dressing is lighter in texture than I expected; pleasantly so.  I use it almost daily and it moisturizers without heaviness or any displeasing odor.</li>
    <li> I remember when I used to go to this beauty shop named Tracy&#x27;s to get my hair done. She always used Dudley&#x27;s products and I couldn&#x27;t find it for the longest. And now I finally found it! This product is great for thick coarse hair. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and not dry. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  This size will last me for a longer amount of time than the regular size.  And most importantly, by ordering online, I saved gas and time that I would have had to use to locate it - and even then, it wouldn&#x27;t have been the same size as this.  This size is larger than most retail locations have available for sale.</li>
    <li> The product is a good item. I have used it for years and this product is no different. Great item.</li>
    <li> Just what we been looking for, love the product. Considering strongly reordering this product so that I may have as needed</li>
    <li> this product keeps my hair from being dry. My hair actually looks healthier and it is not breaking off and the ends are not splitting</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed using this product.  My mother and I found it difficult to find in the local stores and we were pleased to discover that we could purchase it via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. My hair is shoulder length, salt &amp; pepper, rather course, and the weight of ADE is perfect. Hope it&#x27;s never discontinued.</li>
    <li> Great product,  great price , fast shipping,  makes hair really soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my Mother. Her hair &amp; Scalp looks Great!</li>
    <li> Great product as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Really helps with dry scalp!</li>
    <li> Love all dudle&#x27;s products. Have use it for years. Would never change. Leaves my hair very soft and managerable. I&#x27;ve used other products but alway come back to dudley</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> I have natural gray hair (no perm, no color) and Dudley&#x27;s moisturizers hair and scalp without leaving a greasy feel. I do wish that product provided more shine (but of course I don&#x27;t like greasy). There may be a trade-off between greasy and shine. Overall I am happy with product. I also think that the 14 oz. size is good.</li>
    <li> Cooling and soothing. Keeps scalp from itching. Has a nice subtle fragrance, not overpowering. This jar would last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product provides the shine and manageability my hair needs. This amazing product is just what the &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; ordered. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product some people do not think they need essentials oil in their hair but they do and this is the right product to use.  It will soften up your hair and make it manageable and will cause it to grow.  Yes I will recommend this product to those who are serious about their hair care products.  Also I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even need much to moisturize your scalp. I knew it was a great product after the girl who styles my hair uses it! My scalp loves it!</li>
    <li> I have used it before, but was not able to buy it locally.  I was excited to find it on Amazon.  It is great for dry scalp and make the hair shine without being heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightweight scalp conditioner.  Silky feel on hair (a small amount goes a long way).  Thanks Dudley</li>
    <li> This caused my hair to grow so long and my mom&#x27;s hair is down to her past her shoulders now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dudley&#x27;s Hair &amp; Scalp Conditioner for over 5 years.  It is a wonderful product that I&#x27;ve recommended to friends and family.  A little really does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Keeps hair healthy. Gives hair a great light shine without making hair heavy. Love this product.  Please don&#x27;t ever change this product.</li>
    <li> this conditioner is the best product for my hair which is colored, it gives it body and life. love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year without even reading the back of the container.  After recently attempting to start a hair journey, I realized this product has petroleum in it, which blocks your pores.  I have recently stopped using it.  I have a thinking around around my temples that I recently noticed getting thicker.  I have been using a new product that is all natural and smells amazing.  I can get a bit of a dry scalp and have noticed I don&#x27;t have to use the other product as much as the dudley&#x27;s. I still like dudleys but it wasn&#x27;t working to it&#x27;s potential.</li>
    <li> Dudley Hair &amp; Scalp Conditoner great to used.</li>
    <li> great product been using it for a few years now just love it will continue to buy it thank you</li>
    <li> This scalp conditioner is good for the scalp and hair and helps the hair to look great and keeps the hair healthy looking.</li>
