      <li>Can&#x27;t say how much I love this scent!</li>
      <li>I reach for LP Original whenever I don&#x27;t know what I feel like wearing, or what would be appropriate for a given occasion, and it is always perfect.</li>
      <li>There are no pheromones in this at all, but it does seem to have some impressive effects on those who smell it on you and seems to bestow a most welcome \\&quot;lift\\&quot; to the wearer, making you just naturally feel happier and more attractive.</li>
      <li>and yes this is an HONEST review, not a coerced advocate of the fragrance.</li>
      <li>As this scent develops on my skin it becomes so creamy, warm, and inviting.</li>
      <li>I love this LP variant and i have received awesome comments both from complete strangers and people i know.</li>
      <li>I love the vanilla and apricot in this.</li>
      <li>I will also add that the customer service is top notch at LP.</li>
      <li>but they all agree that it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>Most complements from EVERYONE I encounter when wearing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sexy but in a demure way.</li>
      <li>I love them both although i do believe that the spray has a better throw.</li>
      <li>It is a yummy and classically sexy scent.  </li>
      <li>My tastes changed &amp; I realized that I LOVE this perfume.</li>
      <li>Love Potion:</li>
      <li>So those of you who still want more, there is indeed more to be found at their site.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comforting when I&#x27;m moody, sexy when I&#x27;m frisky, ladylike when I&#x27;m in church, classy at meetings and beautiful all the time.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite Love potion scents, of which there are many, it may not be your favorite at first but give this scent time to settle and age and trust me</li>
      <li>It allows the lovely apricot, vanilla, verbena, and other notes to waft beautifully, creating a breathtakingly gorgeous perfume that stands easily on its own as a classic.</li>
      <li>This is the ONE LP I cannot ever be without - it is mysterious, beautiful and sexy - without being overly floral or foody or &#x27;in your face&#x27; strong.  </li>
      <li>LPMP has quite a few signature fragrances and all of them are exquisite in their own unique ways.</li>
      <li>For a while after discovering this companies fragrances, I avoided the original Love Potion because I feared the patchouli.</li>
      <li>Love Potion Original, in my opinion, is a must-have in any perfume lovers collection.</li>
      <li>It is also unlike anything I had ever smelled in a department store (I strongly dislike department store fragrances).</li>
      <li>I first started MY love affair with Love Potion Perfumerie when I purchased LP Red (listed here on Amazon as well) which is also INCREDIBLE.  </li>
      <li>Such a beautiful perfume.</li>
      <li>The vanilla is rich and irresistible, almost custard-y, and the other notes compliment it perfectly.</li>
      <li>so it was much to my surprise that I instantly liked this one.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this through the LP website and I have to say it was such a great surprise.</li>
      <li>LP Original is that one for me.</li>
      <li>Mara Fox, a master perfumed knew exactly what she was doing when she concocted this Original Love Potion.</li>
      <li>It is feminine, soft, and undeniably SEXY!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, sweet and sexy!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very sweet and gentle!</li>
      <li>In the bottle, it is sweet and enticing...</li>
      <li>In one sniff you may pick out a note of vanilla or apricot, in another you may sense the rose/verbena but the blend is really delicate and perfectly balanced.</li>
      <li>The original Love Potion is classic.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a classic, for sure.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much greenery or rose, but the scent as a whole is just intoxicating</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is also a classic love potion scent.</li>
      <li>Many MANY scents later, I finally purchased my first bottle of Love Potion Original and proceeded to fall completely in love with IT</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, if you should find yourself confused while trying to make a choice , their staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable and happy to help you find just what you are looking for.</li>
      <li>If you only try one Love Potion, try this one!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a head turner for sure!</li>
      <li>- I never fail to get compliments when I wear this one!</li>
      <li>but as the evening progressed the smell did not change; however, it made me feel aggressive and aroused and overly confident.  </li>
      <li>I always get compliments when I wear this one - and it never fails to lift me and those around me.</li>
      <li>Its very soft and gently sweet.  </li>
      <li>I applied it to my cleavage and the smell is very soft and sweet and welcoming.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft and sweet vanilla based scent with creamy fruit tones, you will definitely notice what makes Love Potion scents so popular, I&#x27;ll never go back to commercial fragrances now.</li>
      <li>The other ingredients such as the rose, verbena and patchouli each have their own part to play in the overall sophistication of this scent.</li>
      <li>classic I will never be without!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like scent as much to begin with</li>
      <li>On me, the fragrance really blooms -</li>
      <li>Still the smell was very unattractive until I read the instructions and applied it as directed.  </li>
      <li>This is a must have for anyone who wants a scent you can wear anytime.</li>
      <li>Even the notes I would normally consider loud are so well blended that none particularly shout out; instead, they subtly complement each aspect of the fragrances chosen, resulting in a unique and harmonious perfume that will most definitely set your apart in a crowd, in the most positive way possible :)</li>
      <li>I just received this perfume and my first impression after applying it on my wrist was old lady&#x27;s powder smell!  </li>
      <li>, I can say this is the fragrance I most often reach for when I am craving something unusual and uncharacteristic of my typical scent choices.</li>
      <li>Beautiful in its own right, it also forms the base for other the other \\&quot;Love</li>
      <li>It definitely signature scent worthy.</li>
      <li>It is not a matter of whether you will find one that you adore, it is simply a matter of which one will be just the right one for you.</li>
      <li>I was new to artisan scents at the time and had no idea that scents could smell so heavenly.</li>
      <li>This is LPMP&#x27;s flagship scent &amp; definitely the first one I recommend anyone to try.</li>
      <li>and I was surprised by the response I got with this one (wink, wink).</li>
      <li>I also get frequent compliments from both men and women when wearing this</li>
      <li>The scent is unique and isn&#x27;t like any typical commercial perfume.</li>
      <li>After using artisan scents for a while now I will say I won&#x27;t go back to any department store perfume full of odd chemicals that would leave my head aching.</li>
      <li>On me the apricot and vanilla really shine, and as it dries the other notes come out.</li>
      <li>The patchouli in this is not overpowering on me and it really helps the other scents to bloom.</li>
      <li>If that is still not enough for you, LPMP offers numerous unscented pheromone blends to layer with this.</li>
      <li>Potion\\&quot; variants: LP Pink, LP Red, LP Black, as well as special edition seasonal LP variants.</li>

    <li> This is a beautiful scent with prominent notes of vanilla, apricot, amber, and patchouli. Beautiful in its own right, it also forms the base for other the other \\&quot;Love Potion\\&quot; variants: LP Pink, LP Red, LP Black, as well as special edition seasonal LP variants. For a while after discovering this companies fragrances, I avoided the original Love Potion because I feared the patchouli. I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a head shop or a hippie. But this fragrance is neither; it is feminine, complex, and very balanced. It is also unlike anything I had ever smelled in a department store (I strongly dislike department store fragrances).</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous artisan blend.  It is a yummy and classically sexy scent.  I also get frequent compliments from both men and women when wearing this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a classic love potion scent. The components are well grounded in aromatherapy intent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A classic I will never be without!</li>
    <li> If I could only have one scent to wear ever again, this one would be it. I reach for LP Original whenever I don&#x27;t know what I feel like wearing, or what would be appropriate for a given occasion, and it is always perfect. It&#x27;s comforting when I&#x27;m moody, sexy when I&#x27;m frisky, ladylike when I&#x27;m in church, classy at meetings and beautiful all the time. The vanilla is rich and irresistible, almost custard-y, and the other notes compliment it perfectly. Don&#x27;t be frightened off by the patchouli, it is well blended and &amp;#34;clean,&amp;#34; there is no hippie vibe here. If you only try one Love Potion, try this one!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume oil!! Will be back again and again!</li>
    <li> Purchased this through the LP website and I have to say it was such a great surprise. I was new to artisan scents at the time and had no idea that scents could smell so heavenly. Vanilla and Apricot lead and over time meld with the amber and patchouli to round out a scent that I do not want to be without. After using artisan scents for a while now I will say I won&#x27;t go back to any department store perfume full of odd chemicals that would leave my head aching. To anyone who thinks they just can&#x27;t wear perfume for the same reason, give the artisan scents a try. You will not be disappointed. I will also add that the customer service is top notch at LP. Always have had my questions answered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The original Love Potion is classic. I receive compliments from men and women while wearing this. The notes are perfectly blended. The scent is unique and isn&#x27;t like any typical commercial perfume. It definitely signature scent worthy.</li>
    <li> Love Potion Original, in my opinion, is a must-have in any perfume lovers collection. It is perfect for any occasion – very sexy but can be worn any time. On me the apricot and vanilla really shine, and as it dries the other notes come out. Lasts a long time and others around you will NEED to know where you got it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells so great......warm and inviting, and wears well on the skin. It is long-lasting and not over-powering at all.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say how much I love this scent! It is vanilla, apricot, amber goodness. The other ingredients such as the rose, verbena and patchouli each have their own part to play in the overall sophistication of this scent. I&#x27;ll admit I was scared of this at first due to the patchouli, but I think it may have been to smelling other company&#x27;s inferior blends with patchouli in them. The patchouli in this is not overpowering on me and it really helps the other scents to bloom. Love it!</li>
    <li> LPMP has quite a few signature fragrances and all of them are exquisite in their own unique ways. It is not a matter of whether you will find one that you adore, it is simply a matter of which one will be just the right one for you. LP Original is that one for me. I simply adore this one! It is feminine, soft, and undeniably SEXY! Mara Fox, a master perfumed knew exactly what she was doing when she concocted this Original Love Potion. It is expertly blended, incredibly well balanced, and beautiful. I have never experienced a patchouli blend where the patchouli did not overwhelm and overpower the other notes... UNTIL I found THIS one that is. It allows the lovely apricot, vanilla, verbena, and other notes to waft beautifully, creating a breathtakingly gorgeous perfume that stands easily on its own as a classic. There are no pheromones in this at all, but it does seem to have some impressive effects on those who smell it on you and seems to bestow a most welcome \\&quot;lift\\&quot; to the wearer, making you just naturally feel happier and more attractive. If that is still not enough for you, LPMP offers numerous unscented pheromone blends to layer with this. The choices are mind boggling! So those of you who still want more, there is indeed more to be found at their site. What&#x27;s more, if you should find yourself confused while trying to make a choice , their staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable and happy to help you find just what you are looking for. Thank you Mara and LPMP!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite Love potion scents, of which there are many, it may not be your favorite at first but give this scent time to settle and age and trust me it will become a scent you will wear forever! It&#x27;s a soft and sweet vanilla based scent with creamy fruit tones, you will definitely notice what makes Love Potion scents so popular, I&#x27;ll never go back to commercial fragrances now. This is a must have for anyone who wants a scent you can wear anytime.</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t claim this as my signature scent (I am way too fickle for such things!), I can say this is the fragrance I most often reach for when I am craving something unusual and uncharacteristic of my typical scent choices. As this scent develops on my skin it becomes so creamy, warm, and inviting. I am often wary of perfumes containing patchouli, but there is nothing to fear here. Even the notes I would normally consider loud are so well blended that none particularly shout out; instead, they subtly complement each aspect of the fragrances chosen, resulting in a unique and harmonious perfume that will most definitely set your apart in a crowd, in the most positive way possible :)</li>
    <li> I just received this perfume and my first impression after applying it on my wrist was old lady&#x27;s powder smell!  Not appealing at all but as the evening progressed the smell did not change; however, it made me feel aggressive and aroused and overly confident.  Still the smell was very unattractive until I read the instructions and applied it as directed.  I applied it to my cleavage and the smell is very soft and sweet and welcoming.</li>
    <li> This is the one that started it all and it&#x27;s a classic, for sure.  I tend to go for the heady, resinous, \\&quot;in your face\\&quot; dark scents so it was much to my surprise that I instantly liked this one.  Its very soft and gently sweet.  It&#x27;s sexy but in a demure way. In one sniff you may pick out a note of vanilla or apricot, in another you may sense the rose/verbena but the blend is really delicate and perfectly balanced. I found it to be sheer so you won&#x27;t be knocking anyone out with a cloud of perfume but whenever I&#x27;ve worn this, everyone may perceive the fragrance differently but they all agree that it&#x27;s lovely. Definitely date AND work wearable.</li>
    <li> Love Potion: Original is awesome stuff! In the bottle, it is sweet and enticing... On me, the fragrance really blooms - vanilla and amber are in the forefront, with the patchouli and apricot peeking through to round it out. I don&#x27;t get much greenery or rose, but the scent as a whole is just intoxicating - I never fail to get compliments when I wear this one!</li>
    <li> Best perfume you will ever try! Most complements from EVERYONE I encounter when wearing. All the LP scents are Devine. You can choose one of Mara&#x27;s wonderful monthly creations, or consult with her on creating your own!</li>
    <li> This is the one that started it all... I first started MY love affair with Love Potion Perfumerie when I purchased LP Red (listed here on Amazon as well) which is also INCREDIBLE.  Many MANY scents later, I finally purchased my first bottle of Love Potion Original and proceeded to fall completely in love with IT (so in that sense of the word, it DOES do what it says!)  This is the ONE LP I cannot ever be without - it is mysterious, beautiful and sexy - without being overly floral or foody or &#x27;in your face&#x27; strong.  I always get compliments when I wear this one - and it never fails to lift me and those around me.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful perfume. I could wear this everyday, and never get tired of it!! I love the vanilla and apricot in this. It&#x27;s definitely a head turner for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect scent to try if you are new to Love Potion Perfume!!  It&#x27;s soft, sweet and sexy!  Don&#x27;t let the patch scare you, it adds depth and richness to the blend!!  Men will want to get close and find out what smells so good!!</li>
    <li> This is LPMP&#x27;s flagship scent &amp; definitely the first one I recommend anyone to try. I didn&#x27;t like scent as much to begin with &amp; I passed along my sample. My tastes changed &amp; I realized that I LOVE this perfume. It&#x27;s the perfect vanilla perfume. I always get compliments when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I have this in oil and in spray. I love them both although i do believe that the spray has a better throw. I love this LP variant and i have received awesome comments both from complete strangers and people i know. This one is definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scents you will ever try! Perfect for any occasion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my skin it&#x27;s very sweet and gentle!</li>
    <li> great fragrance! simply beautiful and I was surprised by the response I got with this one (wink, wink). Please try it, you will like it and yes this is an HONEST review, not a coerced advocate of the fragrance.</li>
