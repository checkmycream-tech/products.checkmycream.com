      <li>i did like Alterna 10, but i think it was starting to weigh my hair down after so many years of use.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and smelling like roses a bit.</li>
      <li>First off, it arrived damaged due to packaging and/or handling not fault of the vendor--appeared to be an Amazon packaging issue.  </li>
      <li>highly reccomend for male or female.</li>
      <li>It came in three small bottles each which is a little more convenient.</li>

    <li> Amazingly clean refreshing scent with just the right amount of sexy. highly reccomend for male or female. perfect size for traveling too so you can keep that great scent.</li>
    <li> If you like &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; then you will love this. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy at all. Full and fluffy with a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Delivered as stated.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want the white tea, I just wanted au the blanc.not the same conditioner I had. This one is not the right consistency.</li>
    <li> WIFE LOVES THE PRODUCT.THANKS.E.P.</li>
    <li> love it.  just wish the perfume smelled as good.</li>
    <li> This product is a little expensive but I bought anyway due to the way my hair felt. I got a sample at a Country&#x27; Inn somewhere in Alabama going to Montgomery from Key West, Florida. Great advertising tool.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; that she loved this product while we were on a recent vacation; thus, I ordered it on Amazon.  Product is pricier than other shampoos and conditioners, but it makes the wife happy.... Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> Its expensive but worth every penny. I have been happy with the way my hair smells and feels after use.</li>
    <li> Delicious!  Used these on vacation while in Mexico at a resort and came back wanting more.  Very hard to find in normal sized bottles so these seemed to be the closest.  Leaves hair soft and smelling like roses a bit.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. The scent lasts for days when shampooed into hair. It was delivered as described.</li>
    <li> I am suspicious of shampoo and conditioner that are scented, but these smell good and make my hair look good.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  First off, it arrived damaged due to packaging and/or handling not fault of the vendor--appeared to be an Amazon packaging issue.  All 6 bottles (although small) were loose in a zip lock bag inside of a skimpy padded envelope.  One of the shampoo caps had broken off in transit and was all over the place--one big mess in the zip lock bag.  Because it was damaged I tried it to see if I was going to get my order replaced or credit.  I tried the shampoo &amp; conditioner and didn&#x27;t care for it.  Not a product that I would be interesting in re-purchaseing.  Amazon&#x27;s customer service associate apologized for the inconvenience and was very speedy in providing a credit for the item and return shipping expenses.  Won&#x27;t purchase this item in the future.  Just wasn&#x27;t to my liking but that&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t be to yours.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance for your hair.  I love Bulgari perfume and just discovered their hair products. I bought several for gifts.  Perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> I buy this shampoo and conditioner only. I will never use any different!</li>
    <li> My daughter got this product and just loves the fragrance. It came in three small bottles each which is a little more convenient. I just know she really likes it.</li>
    <li> pure luxury for my hair. i have extremily frizzy, flat, dried out hair. before using this, i was using Alterna Science of 10, which is a very high end line of hair products. i had my doubts about Bvlgari&#x27;s shampoo because it was a beauty line didn&#x27;t EXCLUSIVELY do hair products, but decided to try it anyway because of the positive reviews i found online. i did like Alterna 10, but i think it was starting to weigh my hair down after so many years of use. Bvlgari&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner left my hair very silky, shiny, bouncy and frizz free. the fragrance is amazing as well. you really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a treat for me because of the high price. The smell is magnificent and fresh, the best-smelling hair product I&#x27;ve experienced. Because of the price and the fact that I wish they came in a container that dispensed the product better, I took 1 star off. I sometimes am allergic to shampoos/conditioners, getting itchy red bumps, so I&#x27;m picky about what I use. This product doesn&#x27;t give me any trouble.</li>
    <li> What a wonder fresh fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I went on a vacation and stayed at a spa that offer this fragrance in their toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;Simply love it!!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product while staying at the Ritz Carlton in San Juan on vacation.  When I got home, I had to get some of my own.</li>
    <li> love the scent and the way it makes my hair feel.  Great product.  I hope to get the corresponding scent soon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF. Fresh clean scent plus leaves my hair feeling fantastic. The shine is great and for someone my age to have such nice healthy looking hair.....welll it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
