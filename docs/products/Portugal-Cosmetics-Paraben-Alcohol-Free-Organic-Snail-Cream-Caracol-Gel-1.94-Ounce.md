      <li>Appears to work better if you exfoliate and/or cleanse face prior to using</li>
      <li>I used it alone for three days first to gauge my reaction.</li>

      <li>This cream is a real must.</li>
      <li>It feels refreshing, not sticky or greasy like a lot of other products.</li>
      <li>I bought this cream because it claims to have high levels of snail serum&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

      <li>Had strong chemical smell - kind of like lighter fluid - afraid to use it on my face</li>
      <li>I am 39 yo F and have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>By the way, I am 75 years old.</li>
      <li>Since I have naturally oily skin, I must conduct reaction tests always.</li>
      <li>After buying the &#x27;real stuff&#x27; in Peru, and seeing someone else comment how similar it was, I purchased this.  </li>
      <li>And even I have sensitive skin still can use.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 of these and expected to get the third one free, but i only received the two</li>

    <li> I just use this snail gel for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;But the results were immediate.&lt;br /&gt;My face look very fresh ,Feel better.</li>
    <li> Had strong chemical smell - kind of like lighter fluid - afraid to use it on my face</li>
    <li> Being a first-time user of Snail Gel products, I thought I would give the product a try. Many facial creams and skin care items I&#x27;ve used can&#x27;t compare to how wonderful this product feels! It&#x27;s light, smoothe and leaves my skin glowing! No nasty residue or heaviness on the skin. No burning alcohol feeling either, my skin has always been super sensetive but this stuff is great.  Thank you Madrenature!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using snail cream for some time now and love the lightness of it and also the fresh clean scent. Recently a friend of mine whom I hadn&#x27;t seen  for a while  asked me if I had some &amp;#34;face work&amp;#34; done. I laughed with delight and told her no, but thanked her for the compliment. By the way, I am 75 years old.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars vs 5 is because I do not like the smell. The consistency, texture etc., are fine.</li>
    <li> A friend encouraged me to try SNAIL GEL.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product spreads easily &amp; absorbs right away.  It feels refreshing, not sticky or greasy like a lot of other products. An unexpected benefit that I’ve noticed is that my skin is softer and tighter (it has minimized my wrinkles!)  As a woman, I am always concerned about cosmetics which might contain toxic parabens. I’m very pleased this product is paraben-free.</li>
    <li> Excellent natural skin product. I like using it after I apply Hyaluronic Acid serum and allowing both to dry before applying my usual moisturizer. It really locks in moisture for this cold weather we&#x27;re having. Plus it&#x27;s formulation does not cause any breakouts or clogged pores. Since I have naturally oily skin, I must conduct reaction tests always. I used it alone for three days first to gauge my reaction. Luckily, it proved to be non allergenic and caused no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s very smooth going on. The gel absorbs quickly into the skin without any residue, ash, or film on your face. Additionally, it leaves virtually no trace at all. I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup so having flawless skin is vital for me. I&#x27;m always searching for &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; products and I&#x27;m so glad I tried this out. Will repurchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, is perfect for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these and expected to get the third one free, but i only received the two I ordered?&lt;br /&gt;the product seems to be ok, it smells fresh.kinda strong, but it goes away instantly which i am happy about. Hopefully it works, it would have been nice to have gotten what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY WORKS! i was getting really bad acne around my chin and shoulder area and started to use this and it has really helped smooth out my skin! will buy again, love snail gel! its the only topical acne medicine that works for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic! I Love it.. I Love what it does to my skin and I love how it feels on my skin... the BEST snail product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> After buying the &#x27;real stuff&#x27; in Peru, and seeing someone else comment how similar it was, I purchased this.  It&#x27;s nothing like the real stuff from Peru.  It&#x27;s maybe a watered down version.  Doesn&#x27;t give any of that tighning of the skin feel.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my skin look.</li>
    <li> Helps dry spots and acne. I am 39 yo F and have sensitive skin. Very careful of what I use on my skin. Deminish freckles and age spots. My daughter was curious and tried product for 1 mth and not going back to old expensive cream.</li>
    <li> I had heard wonderful things about this product so thought I would try it out. It&#x27;s great and very affordable!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because it claims to have high levels of snail serum&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for a few weeks &amp; don&#x27;t see any dramatic changes yet&lt;br /&gt;It is a good moisturizer ~ nice and light.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this snail gel for very long but the results were immediate. My skin looks and feels lovely and fresh.  It looks more even toned and my blemishes are GONE! .  I’ve used creams before, but this is a gel, so it is more pure and goes on super light. I felt smoother skin instantly!  I love that it is from South America and is paraben free &amp; alcohol free.</li>
    <li> I like this product!  I have used other snail extract products and this is a good one...reasonably priced too! I use it at night on the facial areas more prone to wrinkling, around the eyes and mouth, then moisturizer. Only time will tell how effective it is but I am happy so far!&lt;br /&gt;8/2/17 Update: I continue to purchase and use  Portugal Organic Snail Cream every day in combination with other products and I love it! It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but I feel that used every day it seems to make a difference. I like the way I look after I apply the cream and sometimes I even use it at night!</li>
    <li> This cream is a real must.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the perfume smell</li>
    <li> It is very light gel. And even I have sensitive skin still can use. But not very like the box of the gel, feel very cheap made.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see much difference, smells bad</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It is a gel so it is light and feels great on the skin. The fragrance is light and refreshing. My face feels better already!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s in gel form and you use less as opposed to using the cream. Appears to work better if you exfoliate and/or cleanse face prior to using and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to state actual results yet. Will have to update later.</li>
