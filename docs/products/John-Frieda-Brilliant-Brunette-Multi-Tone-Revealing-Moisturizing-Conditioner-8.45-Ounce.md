      <li>/&gt;She says the shampoo is just ok, but there is no color benefit for brunettes, and she says the conditioner is terrible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Our favorite shampoo/conditioner</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Well it has been more than a month and the frizz is gone.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I had tried numerous products and haven&#x27;t found one that best suits my hair yet.</li>
      <li>I color my hair and using John Frieda&#x27;s conditioner, my hair keeps it color longer and give me more times between trips to the beautician.</li>
      <li>When a friend recommended the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette line I tried it and never turned back.  </li>

      <li>This makes my hair so shiny, easy to manage, and free of split ends.</li>
      <li>Works fine</li>
      <li>the brunette was not any more shiny or bold...</li>
      <li>Easy to use, smooth, clean product.&lt;br /&gt;Ads</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Conditioner which leaves my hair shining, moist and smooth, as well as smelling like shea butter and coconut?  </li>
      <li>item exactly as described exactly smells so good</li>
      <li>Just as good as some kinds I&#x27;ve tried from a salon Leaves my hair super soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have layered, naturally brunette, past-my-shoulder straight hair and it is easily combed, dries quick, smells great, and has fabulous luster.  </li>
      <li>It looks clean and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>Her hair has amazing highlights and is very soft a airy.</li>
      <li>I use this moisturizer after shampooing my hair and it leaves my hair soft and tangle free!!  </li>
      <li>This product is true to its name.</li>
      <li>I have been happy with other John Frieda products that I have used</li>
      <li>She said they keep your hair color from fading as quickly.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it highlights the lighter brown tones in my naturally medium brown hair.</li>
      <li>and I love how soft and moisturized it feels.</li>
      <li>I swore I&#x27;d never color my hair because I love my natural color</li>
      <li>I would still buy it again at the right price.</li>
      <li>but this is the first product that consistently has been delivering.</li>
      <li>I love it and definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>It left my hair silky, shiny and feeling in much better shape even after just one use.</li>
      <li>They are sure to last us for awhile.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my highlights per se, but there is definitely more shine to my hair overall</li>
      <li>My hair looks more voluminous and big..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair color but worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products to bring some luster back to my locks</li>
      <li>If it is under $6.50 it is a good price, especially if it has the extra 30%.</li>
      <li>This is a good conditioner, but I&#x27;m not sure my hair is richer-looking.</li>
      <li>and I see that its making my hair more frizzier and dry.</li>
      <li>As with the shampoo, this product just did not live up to the 5-star reviews I read, although it was ok.</li>
      <li>I usually really like the John Frieda products.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Haha daddy is a butt.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the stores.</li>
      <li>I really believe these products help.</li>
      <li>I only had to use a small amount to achieve beautiful results.</li>
      <li>It can be a bit hard on the hair if you use it daily though, alternate days seem to work best.</li>
      <li>It rinses pretty well and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>Read label and found that main ingredient after water is SODIUM and ALCOHOL...</li>
      <li>The two stylists I have seen consistently in the past (2 because I moved states) always remarked how healthy my hair looked and felt when I used JF and nothing else.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love John Frieda products, I use this to keep my hair even toned between appointments, sometimes I alternate in the summer with the high lightening version, to add extra definition.</li>
      <li>John Frieda always makes high quality products</li>
      <li>I rinse most of the conditioner out but leave a little in to keep my hair moisturized.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo already leaves my hair fairly soft, but I use just a little to help manage it better.  </li>
      <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
      <li>/&gt;About 2 years ago, I found large pump-top bottles at my local bullseye store.  </li>
      <li>It also makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>This worked well as far as conditioners go.</li>
      <li>I am a 60 year old Caucasian woman.</li>
      <li>This product really does work for revealing the different hues of my hair as well as making it look shinier.</li>
      <li>I buy these 2 packs on Amazon as refills, and everyday my hair looks fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on the recommendation of a stylist for my eight year old daughter.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;re a brunette who wants their shine back after too much dye and heat</li>
      <li>I went nearly 48 hours between wash/condition sessions and it was still lustrous!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the smell.</li>
      <li>I have spent decades trying to find the right combo of hair products to get my dry/thin/frizzy hair in line.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It might work for other hair types, but I strongly don&#x27;t recommend it for dry curly hair!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this for my dark brunette daughter. This stuff is amazing... It reveals all the different tones and natural highlights in her hair. It smells really good ( almost a sweet almond smell</li>
    <li> Have used it for a while and really like the little color boost it gives with each use.</li>
    <li> I love John Frieda products, I use this to keep my hair even toned between appointments, sometimes I alternate in the summer with the high lightening version, to add extra definition. Love the auto ship!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for my hair! I have been using this brand for years along with the John Frieda shampoo.</li>
    <li> This always keeps my hair from acting ugly. Love it.</li>
    <li> I color my hair and using John Frieda&#x27;s conditioner, my hair keeps it color longer and give me more times between trips to the beautician.</li>
    <li> I have spent decades trying to find the right combo of hair products to get my dry/thin/frizzy hair in line.  When a friend recommended the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette line I tried it and never turned back.  This conditioner is fantastic, but all the items in the Brilliant Brunette line are great.  They keep my hair as under control as I could possibly hope to get it.</li>
    <li> Works fine but I don&#x27;t like the greasy smell. It works fine in moisturizing the hair and making it easy to comb. In my case it was a little to greasy after dried, and that may be fine with people with drier hair, mine is actually not. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the smell.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo and conditioner for my blonde hair that I dye dark brown, immediately my hair feels like straw with nasty sticky texture. Gave it to my boyfriend after three days. Read label and found that main ingredient after water is SODIUM and ALCOHOL... ew</li>
    <li> John Frieda always makes high quality products so I thought I&#x27;d give this Brilliant Brunette a try.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  It smells great and makes my hair shiny.  I gave up on coloring my hair a year ago and this gives my grey hair a sheen too!  It also makes my hair soft and silky. I would recommend this to my friends and family. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my highlights per se, but there is definitely more shine to my hair overall and I love how soft and moisturized it feels. It is way out performing the Garnier smoothing conditioner I was using.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, smooth, clean product.&lt;br /&gt;Ads hints of brown/tans to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quality, and they send you two bottles.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have used ever. It left my hair silky, shiny and feeling in much better shape even after just one use. It also helped to keep the color in my hair longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my brunette niece. Instead She uses all my shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says the shampoo is just ok, but there is no color benefit for brunettes, and she says the conditioner is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it dries her hair out. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with the John Frieda brilliant brunette product line and use the shampoo, conditioner and the glaze.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner, but I&#x27;m not sure my hair is richer-looking.</li>
    <li> Excellent,high quality conditioner. Just as good as some kinds I&#x27;ve tried from a salon Leaves my hair super soft and smooth. I only had to use a small amount to achieve beautiful results. Smells really nice too. I love it and definitely recommend it. With 3 women in the house, we go through a lot of shampoo and conditioner. This two pack is a nice value. Good size containers. They are sure to last us for awhile. I will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> As with the shampoo, this product just did not live up to the 5-star reviews I read, although it was ok.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so shiny, easy to manage, and free of split ends. I have dirty blonde hair, and this conditioner goes well with the low lights I get every few months.  It extends the color. I&#x27;ll buy this product as long as it is on the market.</li>
    <li> I am a 60 year old Caucasian woman. I use this moisturizer after shampooing my hair and it leaves my hair soft and tangle free!!  It does not fade my colored hair.  Sometimes I use it without using any shampoo... I just wet my hair in the shower and put it on.  I rinse most of the conditioner out but leave a little in to keep my hair moisturized.  I like using this conditioner and always keep some on hand.  I buy it through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
    <li> I have been happy with other John Frieda products that I have used so I decided to give this a try for my dull looking hair. As I got older my hair went from blonde to a very dark brown, and I have been frustrated by my flat colored and dull hair. This product really does work for revealing the different hues of my hair as well as making it look shinier. The conditioner is moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy. I also have a number of white hairs mixed into my dark brown hair, and this helps to make those whites shinier, which I appreciate. I recommend this to all of my friends now!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner and I will keep using for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been using the John Freida Brilliant Brunette products for years - probably close to a decade.  Any time I switched, I was disappointed with my hair&#x27;s shine, manageability, and overall feeling.  The two stylists I have seen consistently in the past (2 because I moved states) always remarked how healthy my hair looked and felt when I used JF and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago, I found large pump-top bottles at my local bullseye store.  I buy these 2 packs on Amazon as refills, and everyday my hair looks fabulous.  I have layered, naturally brunette, past-my-shoulder straight hair and it is easily combed, dries quick, smells great, and has fabulous luster.  Love this line!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this conditioner.  It smells a little bit like coconut.  The shampoo already leaves my hair fairly soft, but I use just a little to help manage it better.  It rinses pretty well and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I tend to have rather oily hair, and this never leaves my hair feeling oily and greasy.  It looks clean and bouncy.  Plus, my hairstylist is saying my hair looks ridiculously healthy (which usually gets her acting like an artist in front a blank canvas, just ready to make a mark).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a fancy midtown Manhattan salon owner think I had a secret trick or was getting my hair done somewhere else because of this shampoo/conditioner combo. It really is a wonderful option, though it does work best in the context of the rest of the system I really do think the conditioner is the key to the magic. It can be a bit hard on the hair if you use it daily though, alternate days seem to work best.</li>
    <li> my wife purchased.  hair was very dry and straw looking.  this along with the shampoo made it softer and shinier after one use.  recommend</li>
    <li> Is one of the best conditioner that I had used before leaves my hair perfect not freeze at all /</li>
    <li> Makes you hair so soft and smells great. I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my hair color but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Brings out the color in my hair, the softness and the shine!  Plus, it makes my hair more manageable!  Always use with the matching shampoo for a cohesive hair solution!</li>
    <li> I usually really like the John Frieda products.  This particular one, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of.  I just didn&#x27;t have the same results as some of the other reviewers.  I felt it was drying, which is odd for a conditioner I think.  It didn&#x27;t add shine or do anything to enhance my brunette hair.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> One of the best brands I have used..and I have worked in a few hair salons. It does give your hair a little natural looking hi lights.</li>
    <li> So awsome great deal 2 for 1 price! item exactly as described exactly smells so good I love it! thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. If it is under $6.50 it is a good price, especially if it has the extra 30%.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a stylist for my eight year old daughter. Her hair was always a fuzzy bush of nonsense. I teased that there may be animals living in it. Haha daddy is a butt. Well it has been more than a month and the frizz is gone. Her hair has amazing highlights and is very soft a airy. I cannot believe all I had to do was switch her shampoo and conditioner. The smell is very nice and she loves to play with her hair now. Got rid of a big frustration on her and my part. If a professional recommends this, (or any other), shampoo/conditioner I suggest you listen. They do know what they are talking about. And they are not always trying to just make a sale. Tell them you are going to get on Amazon. Whenever I say that they usually just chuckle and say they buy all their hair stuff on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> There was no visable difference using any other conditioner - the brunette was not any more shiny or bold... but it works well as a regular conditioner</li>
    <li> Our favorite shampoo/conditioner</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Got it for my birthday, and now order it for myself.  Husband just switched over, too.  Much cheaper than the stores.</li>
    <li> I l I k e t h e w a y m y h a i r f e e l s a f t e r s h a m p o o i n g</li>
    <li> I have been using John Frieda products for quite some time now; over 2 years. I have good, healthy hair and it does shine and shimmer beautifully. I really believe these products help. They make similar products for Blondes and Redheads. I&#x27;ve tried the Redhead (my hair was dyed red at my niece&#x27;s suggestion!), and it too worked, even though Red is not my natural color. Try these products, they work and they make your hair gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Conditioner which leaves my hair shining, moist and smooth, as well as smelling like shea butter and coconut?  Sold!  I love it!  I&#x27;ve tried salon brands and not really had any different results.</li>
    <li> This worked well as far as conditioners go. Softened hair without feeling greasy. However, I didn&#x27;t notice any color improvement. I would still buy it again at the right price.</li>
    <li> This made my normal to oily hair so gross. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week</li>
    <li> Recently I switched to using John Frieda hair coloring products. A friend told me about John Frieda shampoo and conditioner for brunettes. She said they keep your hair color from fading as quickly. She was correct, they do. I have been using these products for several months now. My coloring lasts longer, nor does it get brassy. So far, the best non-sale price I found is on Amazon. The best sale price I found matches Amazon prices, until you factor in the cost of gas, etc. I take the cost of gas, wear on my car, and my time into consideration when I calculate cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Helps color last longer&lt;br /&gt;Brings out the color highlights&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way - I have shoulder length hair - use approximately 50 cent piece size amount&lt;br /&gt;Travels well - I like the tube concept&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of any at this time</li>
    <li> This product is true to its name. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and I love the way it highlights the lighter brown tones in my naturally medium brown hair. I have never dyed my hair and I recommend this to women or girls who are looking for that extra dimension without coloring. My mom, who frequently dyes her hair, uses this too and loves it for the same highlighting effect. I have thick, sometimes frizzy hair, and this helps smooth it out dramatically.</li>
    <li> I have naturally deep brown hair but started getting grays at 23! I swore I&#x27;d never color my hair because I love my natural color but there&#x27;s nothing like being 25 and seeing your temples threaded with silver. But dye always ravages my hair and then doesn&#x27;t like to stick around. I have tried many products to bring some luster back to my locks but this is the first product that consistently has been delivering. It smells nice but doesn&#x27;t leave a strong odor afterward as many conditioners do and the shine lasts. I went nearly 48 hours between wash/condition sessions and it was still lustrous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a drug store brand I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;re a brunette who wants their shine back after too much dye and heat have made it dull.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but felt a review here would help a lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;I have real thick curly hair that would get really frizzy. My hair had lost shine due to color treatment, flat iron etc etc (all the harm I could do to my hair). I had tried numerous products and haven&#x27;t found one that best suits my hair yet. Thus, I tried John Frieda Brilliant Brunette shampoo and conditioner. I have been using it for over a month now and I see that its making my hair more frizzier and dry. My hair looks more voluminous and big.. Its really hard to maintain. I now have to spend almost an hour to blow dry and flat iron my hair, without which it looks like a total mess. My hair was never so bad before.&lt;br /&gt;It might work for other hair types, but I strongly don&#x27;t recommend it for dry curly hair!</li>
    <li> Very good for once or twice weekly uses. Dries my hair out if I use it daily, though. Works well with the rest of the system.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners for my thick frizzy hair, including much more expensive ones. This is the only product that actually smoothness my hair and makes it less frizzy. It&#x27;s a must have in my shower at all times!</li>
