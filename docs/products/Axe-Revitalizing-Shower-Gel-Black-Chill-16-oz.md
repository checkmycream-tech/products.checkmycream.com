      <li>This smells really good!</li>
      <li>Great smell.</li>
      <li>Smells and works great.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t know unless you try what&#x27;s good for me might not be good for you</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great and the ladies love it.</li>
      <li>I took one whiff, tried it out, and love it!  </li>
      <li>Smells nice and cleans well.</li>
      <li>Lathers nice.</li>
      <li>Gave as a gift and was liked by recipient.</li>
      <li>It lathers really nicely and seems to linger on your skin for awhile afterwards.</li>
      <li>leaves a nice after shower aroma which is refreshing.</li>
      <li>I like all axe product in general they are not the best out there</li>
      <li>But they are not in love with this scent.  </li>
      <li>I liked very much, thank you</li>
      <li>I am a woman who uses the AXE shower gel products because they aren&#x27;t floral and sweet like so many women products.  </li>
      <li>I figure if girls can get pretty smelling shower gels and body washes then why can&#x27;t my handsome preteen?</li>
      <li>I thought I was using this it to get her to come near me, not push away :).</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 12 year old at Christmas, because he is at the ripe age to begin caring more about his hygiene.</li>
      <li>My husband and son both like axe shower gels and they&#x27;ve used many different ones with the axe shower tool, aka nylon puff.  </li>
      <li>I am now buying this myself, because I like it that much!</li>
      <li>I have four teenage sons, so I buy most anything that can help with the smell after football and basketball practice.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery and product was exactly as described</li>
      <li>I used to make shower products for a living and if any color runs off too much dye was used.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy this again, especially after having to clean my shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only slight gripe is that I wish it would lather a little better, but it seems to be on par with most other body washes.</li>
      <li>Bubbles should never be anything but clear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear color.</li>
      <li>He loves it, I think it smells like old school bar soap.</li>
      <li>and this was NOT Black Chill.</li>
      <li>It cleans and it&#x27;s got very manly scent -- but you won&#x27;t reek of it like you drowned in cologne</li>
      <li>I bought Axe Black Chill shampoo first from here</li>

<li> but I guess there&#x27;s no real way of relating to matter of taste</li>
<li> I found residue from the puff running down my beige shower wall looking like melted chocolate.</li>
<li> He loves it and now takes a shower everyday!</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old at Christmas, because he is at the ripe age to begin caring more about his hygiene. I figure if girls can get pretty smelling shower gels and body washes then why can&#x27;t my handsome preteen? He loves it and now takes a shower everyday! SCORE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and was liked by recipient. leaves a nice after shower aroma which is refreshing.</li>
    <li> I liked very much, thank you</li>
    <li> Great smell. Lathers nice.</li>
    <li> My step son had this when we went on a trip with my husband.  I took one whiff, tried it out, and love it!  I didn&#x27;t have issues with tasting it, like another viewer. I am a woman who uses the AXE shower gel products because they aren&#x27;t floral and sweet like so many women products.  I am now buying this myself, because I like it that much!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product was exactly as described</li>
    <li> I like all axe product in general they are not the best out there but they are close.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great.</li>
    <li> I bought Axe Black Chill shampoo first from here and this was NOT Black Chill.I don&#x27;t know what happened unless something else got mixed up at the factory.It didn&#x27;t have the same scent the shampoo has OR the same color.It&#x27;s a clear color.I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> good !and good price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nephew. He loves it, I think it smells like old school bar soap.</li>
    <li> My husband and son both like axe shower gels and they&#x27;ve used many different ones with the axe shower tool, aka nylon puff.  I found residue from the puff running down my beige shower wall looking like melted chocolate. It was from this gel!! I used to make shower products for a living and if any color runs off too much dye was used. Bubbles should never be anything but clear. I won&#x27;t buy this again, especially after having to clean my shower.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great and the ladies love it.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks it smells like bleach. I thought I was using this it to get her to come near me, not push away :). We like many of the other Axe scents so I don&#x27;t want to leave the wrong impression.</li>
    <li> I have four teenage sons, so I buy most anything that can help with the smell after football and basketball practice.  But they are not in love with this scent.  Will try another one.</li>
    <li> Have expected a longer effect after shower chill but I am NOT going to throw it out I will use it I like it not the best choice but I guess everybody is different so actually I gave a 5 star for another model but I guess there&#x27;s no real way of relating to matter of taste and you don&#x27;t know unless you try what&#x27;s good for me might not be good for you</li>
    <li> Smells nice and cleans well.</li>
    <li> It cleans and it&#x27;s got very manly scent -- but you won&#x27;t reek of it like you drowned in cologne afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only slight gripe is that I wish it would lather a little better, but it seems to be on par with most other body washes.</li>
