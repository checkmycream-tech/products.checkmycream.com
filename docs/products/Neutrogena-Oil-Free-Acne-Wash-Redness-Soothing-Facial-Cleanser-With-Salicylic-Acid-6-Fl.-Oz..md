      <li>/&gt;It has the active salicylic acid, but is still nice to skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because that means I have less wrinkling, but it&#x27;s a drag to have a shiny face, esp in a warm environment.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying it. I got to use it twice and then all of a sudden I had an allergic reaction. It&#x27;s taken me over 5 days to get my face back on the semi normal side.</li>
    <li> This cleanser tones down the red in my skin and it feels very fresh.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and fair skin, which tends to get red very easily. I decided to buy this product to help with my redness. I used it for 3 days, and it didn&#x27;t help at all. What it did to my face was make it dry, itchy, and more red. After I stopped using the product, my face broke out in hives because it irritated my face badly. I hoped that it would have helped, but it didn&#x27;t and it made my face worse. My advice is for those with sensitive skin to stay away from this product. It smells great, but it was very harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  I still have redness here and there on my face.  It is a nice product in that its not harsh or drying.</li>
    <li> Shipping was not the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent face wash; and it aides in reducing redness. Just another salicylic face wash.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face acne-free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser, my face looks good, and it&#x27;s totally worth for its price, I&#x27;ll get another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> is alright, i bought it for my arms as recommended by my dermatologist. i have Keratosis pilaris and it has created a redness on my arms that the doctor said could be removed with an acne face wash. seems to be working a little.</li>
    <li> This cleaner is okay.  It&#x27;s not harsh (though my skin does feel a little tight after using it).  I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in redness.  I also can&#x27;t tell if it is helping my acne or not.  It is not making it worse.  To be fair, it has only been a week since I have been using it.  I only use it in the morning (because of the tight feeling).  I use Purpose at night.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. It really does reduce redness. I was surprised about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is less dried out since I started using this. I used to use the standard Neutrogena acne wash (the orange colored stuff--it also worked well), I think this green one makes my skin more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its acne-reduction properties are also good--my skin is staying clear.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Oil-Free has salicyilic acid to absorb OIL and aloe and  chamomile to reduce redness. It works Perfectly!!</li>
    <li> So, picked up some of this &amp;#34;Redness Soothing&amp;#34; Acne Neutrogena wash at my local Walgreens a couple weeks back. Have used it 1-2 times daily ever since. I&#x27;ve got slightly more than the mild case of acne, and my face does get oily fast overnight (though nothing too major, I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff somewhat dries out the acne on my forehead, not all of it (nor all of the redness). It also barely clears blackheads as the bottle says otherwise. Maybe it cleared them on the cheeks, but nowhere else. My nose is still covered with pin-needle sized ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it seems like it&#x27;s trying to work, but half of the time is meh. This might work for some folks, not necessarily for me.</li>
    <li> Even in my 50s I have oily skin. It&#x27;s nice because that means I have less wrinkling, but it&#x27;s a drag to have a shiny face, esp in a warm environment. But it only takes a very tiny amount of this product, added to some water to create a full lather to wash my face. Rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a tight feeling. Very light fragrance if any (I can&#x27;t smell anything). Feels very clean afterwards and I use it at least twice per day.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter swears by it! She won&#x27;t let me buy anything else for her skin because this wash has made such a difference. A little goes a long way, too, so it keeps the price at a good place for our family.</li>
    <li> Men - mix this with Jack Black Glycolic Line Smoother and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
    <li> My partner swears by this stuff and it&#x27;s the only thing she will use. It&#x27;s definitely much better than the pink grapefruit variant which is much easier to find in places like Target and Acme. This one, we seem to have to now buy online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however tend to find it makes me skin dry and itchy. Instead, I find the foaming cleanser works much better on my skin: [[ASIN:B00027EG9C Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could also be better because it&#x27;s very hard to close for travel purposes - in fact, we usually put it into a separate container for travel to avoid awkward leaks.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, leaves my skin feeling clean and soft</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell quite as pleasant as the purple stuff, but it works well... as expected of a neutrogena product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, sadly it completely dried out my chin, upper lip, and eye lids.  I use this twice a week now with much better results.  I&#x27;m definitely seeing much less redness in my face.  With the aloe (which you can feel) and chamomile, I had hoped not to experience such dryness.  On the other days I use Deep Clean facial cleanser, and my complexion is improving greatly.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found keeps my acne away.  Highly, HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Smells nice, good foaming action, works just as well as the next SA acne wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: works just as well as the next SA acne wash.</li>
    <li> I had used this product in the cream cleanser and loved it, so I thought I would try this. Bad, bad decision. After several days of using this my face was unbelievably dry. Overnight my face swelled and I developed chemical burns. When I say swollen, I mean I could barely see out of my eyes because they were so swollen and puffy. After a day of the painful burns on my face I developed the small white bumps everyone else is describing. Mine skin looked terrible and it took about a week to return to normal. I had this happen once before with neutrogena grapefruit wash. I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredient making this happen is, but Neutrogena needs to do something about it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have tried all three of the Neutrogena oil-free acne washes and this one is by far my favorite. While they all clean the same I find that this product no only smells the best, but my face isn&#x27;t red or dry after using it. It foams up nicely and removes all of my make up without having to scrub my face. It doesn&#x27;t sting, even on sunburned skin. I use it every night in the shower and then apply my oil free moisturizer like usual. It seems to help with break outs and I noticed since I started using it I will occasionally get a small zit, but nothing huge and crazy like before. I recommended it to my boyfriend, and now he uses it too.</li>
    <li> Like many others I bought this in the hope it might reduce the redness on my cheeks.  Hope in a bottle...  Frankly, there is nothing short of laser treatment that will reduce redness if it is caused by broken capillaries.  Like many others I have tried it all and there isn&#x27;t anything topical, as yet that will reduce redness.  Your best hope is to find a gentle cleanser that does not redden your skin further, protect your skin from the sun and getting heated up.  I just saw a Dr last night for a laser treatment to zap many of the broken blood vessels on my cheeks.  I asked if I just keep growing more as it seemed like I could not get ahead.  I&#x27;ve now had two treatments and the first time it did look better for a couple months.  He attempted to explain how some people have this 19 carbon molecule something or other, that makes the lining of the vessels too elastic and thus they expand resulting in what we see as broken capillaries on the skin.  Nothing to be done about this other than the laser treatments.  And yes, he said those that have it just keep having more broken capillaries.  At least the laser may keep them at a stand still.  Unfortunately, this process is separate from Rosacea so if like me you have this 19 carbon whatever and rosacea you have a double whammy of redness.  When in hot weather my cheeks are so red people think I&#x27;m either ill or a wino.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product:  Although this cleanser did not reduce the redness it did do a nice job of cleaning my face without over stripping or causing further redness. I was surprised since this is an acne product.  It has a nice smell.  I also tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Grapefruit one because I love the smell of grapefruit.  Whoa, did this smell bad.  I thought it smelled like arm pit odor after a work out.  I think I&#x27;ll keep using the Redness soothing one and keep the grapefruit for washing cosmetic brushes.  The other cleanser I have used successfully for years is the Aveno&#x27;s Ultra Calming.  So those you have dry skin I think this is a very good option, especially in the winter.  In the summer I like this product better.dry skin I think this is a very good option, especially in the winter.  In the summer I like this product better.</li>
    <li> NOTE: This product is not a magic pill. If you suffer from severe psoriasis, only a licensed dermatologist can diagnose and treat your specific condition. Don&#x27;t expect one product to cure all your problems! Experiment until you find the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is it. I had been using the original Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, and careful application all but cured my facial acne. However, the original formula left my skin feeling dry and noticeably red and flaky, even after moisturizing. I could feel a mild burning and tingling sensation when applying it and would hurry to rinse it off immediately. With the soothing facial cleanser, all that has gone away - no acne, and without the side effects. My skin looks clear and healthy. Best of both worlds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, take half a pump in your hands while in the shower or at the sink. Get your (CLEAN!) hands wet and lather up until you have a handful of foam, then spread the foamy face wash in the problem area. Immediately rinse off as fast as you put it on. You might need to follow up with a facial moisturizer. No cracking, flaking, or redness, and best of all no acne!</li>
    <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin and this is my favorite face wash. I used to use Aveeno&#x27;s Ultra Calming but I greatly prefer this one!</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best cleanser that you can get if you have oily/dry skin. It smells wonderful and you can just feel it working. I love this stuff and think it needs to get more credit.</li>
    <li> i like so much this facial cleanser because it helps to reduce redness ans smells very well. I recommended it</li>
    <li> This product is okay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; salicylic acid is harsh on skin especially if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena needs to come out with a better product</li>
    <li> It is good for Cleaning makeup brushes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or hand wash..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for face .. too harsh (it has 2% salicylic acid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you use it once a week and moisturize heavly ..</li>
    <li> It really does help reduce redness.</li>
    <li> I am rating this product 4 stars because it does make my skin feel great afterward - cool and very soft - and it does have a great fragrance; however, it hasn&#x27;t impacted my acne zones much in regards to the redness.</li>
    <li> I thought I had bought this before a long time ago for redness as I have rosacea and wanted something to calm the redness (very little bumps). So I used it and a few minutes afterwards, my cheek was MORE red than before and now I&#x27;ve broken out in whiteheads &amp; bumps. This product is the worst and I would not recommend it. Now I know why I never went back to using this product. I will stick with my Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, with my Clarisonic. I LOVE this cleanser, it smells AMAZING! And my face has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Soft cleanser, great for every day but can leave skin dry, make sure you get their oil free lotions too!</li>
    <li> Nice face wash. Smells nice. Soaps up and rinses easily. I always like Neutrogena products however I think I&#x27;ll stick to the creamier face washes.</li>
    <li> I have bad acne and a lot of redness associated with scarring and I have no Idea what. This product really helps to temporarily reduce redness. Plus, there aren&#x27;t many redness reducing products out there to begin with... I also like the eucerin redness reducing sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it to all acne-prone people except the ones with the extremely oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product has JUST RIGHT cleaning power. I have combination skin, many acne wash cleanser just over dry my face, such as the regular neutrogena acne wash. However this one is perfect for me. I think it has enough cleaning power to oily skin, too. For extremely oil skin this cleanser will be too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s formulated in a way to minimize the side effect of salicylic acid. My face, sensitive to most salicylic acid product, do not have any bad response to this product. However my whitehead/blackhead condition is improved after two weeks. The skin dybris was removed by salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the active salicylic acid, but is still nice to skin. What can I ask for more?</li>
    <li> I swear by the Neutrogena Oil Free (salicylic acid) products, including this face wash.  It keeps me from breaking out, without drying my face out too much (but it does dry out a little).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Salicylic acid works wonders for some kinds of oily acne (T-zone).&lt;br /&gt;-More gentle than the pink (grapefruit scent) and orange (original gross scent) Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Although it doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much, but you&#x27;ll still probably need a daily moisturizer when using salicylic acid on your face (I recommend the basic Aveeno)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a staple for my 20 year old son. Some products are to harsh and seem to promote redness. This is a fantastic product. The redness is completly gone. He swears by it. Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Does a great job without drying skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wash my face at work, being an engineer, I always have grease, or dirt on my hands; which naturally, ends up on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I had little red bumps on my forehead just under my hairline, I guess from wiping sweat away with dirty hands. After using this product last night and this morning, the redness, and little bumps are completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but for the Neutrogena name, and the price, it was absolutely worth a shot. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used and I will be purchasing it again.  It lathers perfectly and rinses just as easy.</li>
    <li> I bought the Redness Soothing Neutrogena Acne Wash about 2 weeks ago &amp; I really like it so far. I used to use the regular Neutrogena Acne Wash but I think that it was a bit too drying so I&#x27;d only use it a couple times a week when my skin was giving me problems.&lt;br /&gt; This acne wash is alot better for me, I can use it 2 times a day &amp; it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the other wash (beware its still salicylic acid!) &amp; my skin feels soft &amp; smooth after I use it.&lt;br /&gt; As for the \\&quot;redness soothing\\&quot;  it is helping a bit I think, (mostly where most of the pimples have come &amp; gone, over &amp; over they come in same spots which causes irritation) so the redness isn&#x27;t that noticeable anymore in places.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle wash for redness, maybe it takes time.  Overall I really like it &amp; would definitely buy it over the regular Neutrogena (orange) wash!&lt;br /&gt;  Oh, sometimes you can find generic washes in the stores you are shopping in for alot cheaper, try those &amp; sometimes they can be almost identical. I found the orange regular version of Neutrogena wash as generic in Walgreens but no generic brand of this one, they were either out or don&#x27;t have one made up yet. Hopefully will soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of face washes, from the usual cheap stuff (like this) to high end Men&#x27;s specific products.  This not only lasts longer for a fraction of the price, but works just as well.</li>
    <li> easy on your skin as an acne wash.  I found that it may be a bit too gentle for my face in removing oll.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my new face wash. I have been using it for about a month, twice a day, and my complexion has stayed clear and pure. I was so intrigued by the things it could do. I will continue using this. The smell is great too.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to rinse off in soft water.</li>
</ol>
