      <li>The men&#x27;s one is amazing too.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this, because I work with a man that wears this scent for men all the time and it smells wonderful on him.  </li>
      <li>However, this perfume is so strong that I can&#x27;t wear it!  </li>
      <li>Spicy, warm, exotic and sexy as hell is what Carlos Santana perfume smells like.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started spraying it more liberally because of these two things.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
      <li>I really do love this scent</li>
      <li>I love it when I catch the scent on myself.</li>
      <li>Excellent product at an amazingly low price.</li>
      <li>One of my top 3 perfumes of all time...and got it for such a good price!!  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend says it makes me smell like he thinks Salma Hayek looks, but that I&#x27;m still better looking.  </li>
      <li>At these prices you may want to stock up:)</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It came like leaking and like It has been used already because it was like a quarter of the bottle, But still kept it and enjoying ot because it is my favorite smell</li>
      <li>Shipping for product was outstanding.</li>
      <li>my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great scent!</li>
      <li>but I love</li>
      <li>I love Carlos Santana scents.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural, sexy, and musk like!!  </li>
      <li>But I love the perfume and was so happy to finally receive it.</li>
      <li>The scent of this perfume is light and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>Definitely my new favorite!</li>
      <li>Very sweet, golden &amp; almost beachy scent.</li>
      <li>Product was received before original ETA provided.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com sends the order quickly and the package is wrapped securely.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and it was super fast getting to me.</li>
      <li>I came across it here on the ever awesome Amazon and was excited to see that it was the real deal, I ordered it right away and have worn it everyday since.</li>
      <li>Want use nothing else as Long as this is on the market and at a good price.</li>
      <li>I will be back to purchase more!</li>
      <li>it starts off as a strong floral and then dries down to a nice spicy musk smell.</li>
      <li>I noticed that when I first spray it the scent has a rather masculine quality but this fades within the first 5 minutes and it turns into something really lovely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong enough, almost bold, yet not pungent.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast, too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve adored this scent since I first bought it in the department store years ago.</li>
      <li>For the money there is no longer lasting and better smelling perfume.</li>
      <li>This perfume came exactly when it was supposed to without any shipping damages.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I put it on in several places on my body, and almost immediately, I tried to wash it off with a washcloth because it was so strong.  </li>
      <li>However, I am a huge fan of Carlos Santana&#x27;s pefume because it has a deep warmth and spicy feminine overtones.</li>
      <li>and I really wanted to get again this Christmas.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear fragrance because I have never found one I liked until now.</li>
      <li>Second, it fades rather quickly.</li>
      <li>I think there must not be a high concentration of fragrance oils in this perfume.</li>
      <li>Dry down is nice, not so sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last on my skin.</li>
      <li>I tried spraying a little of it into the room and then walking into the spray, and it is still too strong.  </li>
      <li>This scent has been my favorite for the last few years</li>
      <li>but other people thinking about the purchase should know two things, first of all this is a very soft scent.</li>
      <li>I used to wear this all the time and you could ONLY find it at high end department stores, then it was gone</li>
      <li>Also, the white florals are too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos honors women as givers of life, on stage, in music &amp; spiritually.</li>

<li> I can usually only smell it on myself and other people</li>
<li> I am a fan of few scents because they rarely capture my complex palate.</li>
<li> It has a fresh, subtle fragrance- a slightly tropical feeling.  </li>
<li> Smelled like an old lady to me :/</li>
<li> Then again, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected 4\\&quot; stiletto shoes and frugly pleather handbags either.</li>
<li> I never really understood the notion of having a signature fragrance.  </li>
<li> This fragrance is not what I would have expected given his history.</li>
<li> I am not a flowery woman and had resorted to wearing men&#x27;s cologne due to the flowery stuff ends up smelling like vinegar on me.</li>
<li> I am also a fan of Hugo Boss&#x27; Woman which is lighter but still deep and complex.</li>
<li> Reminds me of JLo Miami Glow and Jovan Black Musk.</li>
<li> I wear everyday.  </li>
<li> This is a hidden gem!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought it for the past 5yrs.</li>
<li> Not sweet or floral!!!  </li>
<li> getting very hard to find it.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed that I am not able to wear it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Santana fans might be disappointed.</li>

    <li> itwas a gift  for my  husband  he loves it alot... he keeps it in his car and away from me</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can find this perfume since they&#x27;ve discontinued selling it at Dept stores.  Always happy with this product. Shipping for product was outstanding. Product was received before original ETA provided.</li>
    <li> This is such a great scent! It&#x27;s not too musky or woodsy but still has sensual undertones. I always get compliments when i wear it. Definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume. getting very hard to find it.</li>
    <li> I never really understood the notion of having a signature fragrance.  Now I get it.  This is perfume  I wear everyday.  Not over powering or cloying.  It has a fresh, subtle fragrance- a slightly tropical feeling.  I love it when I catch the scent on myself.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear fragrance because I have never found one I liked until now. My only problem is that my daughters like it too.</li>
    <li> this is different. it starts off as a strong floral and then dries down to a nice spicy musk smell. i like it. i probably wont wear it all the time but just for different occasions. and you so cant beat the price. Amazon is awesome when it comes to getting your order. i didnt even have to wait a week!</li>
    <li> The scent of this perfume is light and clean smelling.  I receive a lot of compliments when wearing this perfume.  Definitely will purchase again.  Amazon.com sends the order quickly and the package is wrapped securely.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of few scents because they rarely capture my complex palate. However, I am a huge fan of Carlos Santana&#x27;s pefume because it has a deep warmth and spicy feminine overtones. I am also a fan of Hugo Boss&#x27; Woman which is lighter but still deep and complex. Love this scent! Hope you will too!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this on Amazon since I could not find anywhere in the stores. This scent has been my favorite for the last few years and I really wanted to get again this Christmas. The size is awesome, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat Carlos Santana EDT! For the money there is no longer lasting and better smelling perfume. At these prices you may want to stock up:)</li>
    <li> That&lt;br /&gt;I can find it after they stop selling it at Macy&#x27;s and Dillards&lt;br /&gt;It came like leaking and like It has been used already because it was like a quarter of the bottle, But still kept it and enjoying ot because it is my favorite smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve adored this scent since I first bought it in the department store years ago. It&#x27;s strong enough, almost bold, yet not pungent. I use it only in spring and summer-- don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this all the time and you could ONLY find it at high end department stores, then it was gone and I thought it was gone for good. I came across it here on the ever awesome Amazon and was excited to see that it was the real deal, I ordered it right away and have worn it everyday since. I love Carlos Santana scents. The men&#x27;s one is amazing too.</li>
    <li> What can I say spicy just like me and I get a lot of play because of it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!!!  It&#x27;s natural, sexy, and musk like!!  Not sweet or floral!!!  Carlos knew what he was doing when he created this fragrance!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I am not a flowery woman and had resorted to wearing men&#x27;s cologne due to the flowery stuff ends up smelling like vinegar on me. Didn&#x27;t want to smell like a patchouli/sandalwood hippie because that&#x27;s not me either - no offense to all the hippie chicks out there.  Spicy, warm, exotic and sexy as hell is what Carlos Santana perfume smells like.  My boyfriend says it makes me smell like he thinks Salma Hayek looks, but that I&#x27;m still better looking.  Good save on his part.</li>
    <li> One of my top 3 perfumes of all time...and got it for such a good price!!  This is a hidden gem!  Delivery was fast, too!</li>
    <li> Very sweet, golden &amp; almost beachy scent. Reminds me of JLo Miami Glow and Jovan Black Musk. Dry down is nice, not so sweet, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last on my skin. Also, the white florals are too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos honors women as givers of life, on stage, in music &amp; spiritually. This fragrance is not what I would have expected given his history. Then again, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected 4\\&quot; stiletto shoes and frugly pleather handbags either. All of it is inconsistent with his image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Santana fans might be disappointed. I am.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter.  she has difficulty wearing some perfumes, but can wear this one with no problems with this one</li>
    <li> Excellent product at an amazingly low price. I will be back to purchase more! Thank you. This price is lower than the \\&quot;discount perfume sites\\&quot;.  My wife loves the fragrance!</li>
    <li> This perfume came exactly when it was supposed to without any shipping damages.  It is a warm and SPICY scent that is always sumptuous and delicious!  I wear it year-round/day &amp; night, and I always get compliments from both guys and gals!</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance! I was looking for something with amber in it and have had lots of compliments on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Carlos Santana, please start making this fragrance again. This is my favorite and I know it is discontinued but I love it&#x27;s deep scent and have found nothing that compares. My experience with the seller was perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. I love the way it smells and it was super fast getting to me. LOVE IT. Am I ordering it again.....AND again.</li>
    <li> Smelled like an old lady to me :/</li>
    <li> I really do love this scent and I&#x27;m glad I bought it but other people thinking about the purchase should know two things, first of all this is a very soft scent. I can usually only smell it on myself and other people only notice it if I hold my wrist out for them to smell (they like it, they just don&#x27;t notice it). Second, it fades rather quickly. I think there must not be a high concentration of fragrance oils in this perfume. I&#x27;ve started spraying it more liberally because of these two things. I noticed that when I first spray it the scent has a rather masculine quality but this fades within the first 5 minutes and it turns into something really lovely.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, because I work with a man that wears this scent for men all the time and it smells wonderful on him.  However, this perfume is so strong that I can&#x27;t wear it!  I tried spraying a little of it into the room and then walking into the spray, and it is still too strong.  The first time I used it, I put it on in several places on my body, and almost immediately, I tried to wash it off with a washcloth because it was so strong.  But even after washing it with soap and water, I could still smell it on my arms.  I am so disappointed that I am not able to wear it.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever bought. I&#x27;ve bought it for the past 5yrs. Want use nothing else as Long as this is on the market and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Finally received. this was sent through UPS but then sent to USPS, this took an additional over to weeks to get to me. But I love the perfume and was so happy to finally receive it. Thank you.</li>
