      <li>I love a cat eye!</li>
      <li>/&gt;i really love the brush too!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of freaky each time it happens.</li>
      <li>i absolutely LOVE</li>
      <li>spending 30 dollars on a liquid liner not needed :)</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s an okay eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it would work better if I used a primer</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner...</li>
      <li>seems like every time I look for it in the stores it&#x27;s gone! :)</li>
      <li>I loved this so much!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hypoallergenic which is great because I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It applies easily and lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Its easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I am very allergic to other brands,so happy to be able to find at amazon!  </li>
      <li>If you are familiar with applying liquid eyeliner</li>
      <li>I would have liked to see an actual brush instead</li>
      <li>Last long, will not flake, and great smooth line/easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Specially since my eyes are very circular.</li>
      <li>BUT my first couple of applications it DID STING.</li>
      <li>I have tried SOOOO many different types.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to navigate the tiny brush.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always aware of getting my eyeliner getting smudged or looking oily, but this eyeliner holds up really well.</li>
      <li>Constantly have to reapply because it brushes off easily.   </li>
      <li>It makes it much easier to apply than the brushes.</li>
      <li>The felt tip applicator is much easier to maneuver rather than a flimsy brush type.</li>
      <li>it dries really fast and it stays on all day :</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very choosy about eye cream, etc.</li>
      <li>The applicator is gentle on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I would have much preferred their other liquid liner which had a better brush and ingredients but can&#x27;t remember the name since it rubbed off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been well over 13 days since I originally placed the order because I just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, and my current lil jar is on the verge of running out.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to find this one (I was tired of the wet-garbage-bag finish of most liquid</li>
      <li>Otherwise than that, it would create a decent line.   </li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>got exactly what i payed for, which is always a good thing, i would have more words, but only if it&#x27;s a bad review, thanks again Amazon........</li>
      <li>Okay so a few things.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so in love with the felt tip applicator as I find it a bit stiff but it works.</li>
      <li>The great dramatic look it gave!</li>
      <li>Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect my eyeliner to hurt when I applied it!</li>
      <li>but Almay liquid eyeliner is not only cheaper than those other brands but better.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise than that, it is pretty decent as an eyeliner as long as you keep reapplying.  </li>
      <li>The black is rich and it dries with a matte finish.  </li>
      <li>I have unbelievably sensitive eyes to the point where i get frequent styes on the inside of my eyelid</li>
      <li>Never peeled or flaked for me and looks natural rather than shiny and cracked.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Almay liquid eyeliner since I was 14 years old</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve put it on early in the morning &amp; accidentally fallen asleep at night before taken it off</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and that includes my eyelids.</li>
      <li>Just for those who are really sensitive, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.    </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a really bold black which i also lovee.</li>
      <li>Wears all day with normal use (low perspiration and no crying type of day).</li>
      <li>Of course, you would manage to get it on, but after a short bit of time, it would come off into your eyes and make this huge mess swirling strings in your eye.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to occasionally get it to give wings, but It&#x27;s probably just that I&#x27;m not good at it or something.</li>
      <li>it allows me to draw pretty wings with really sharp points!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s dried but you have to kind of scrub at it which, over time, can be damaging to the delicate skin of your eyelid.</li>
      <li>The applicator tip is very defined and accurate and the color is a dark black (not opaque or &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; looking like some other liquid</li>

<li> negative reviews are right, tho -</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a few ladies, including my sisters, switch to this particular eyeliner from others.</li>
<li> I have Asian eyes and need to put on a pretty thick layer for the liner to show.</li>
<li> This eyeliner does not flake or smear and it lasts a very long time.</li>
<li> Sometimes they have dry skin on them.</li>
<li> I love to put eyeliner on my waterline of my eye on the bottom, but with this eyeliner it is impossible.  </li>
<li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner, but it makes my eye lid burn really bad.</li>
<li> I wear eye makeup everyday and one bottle of this liquid eyeliner last me months.  </li>
<li> Aside from that, it created such a dark line that looked harsh and like it was drawn with a crayon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other liquid liners</li>
<li> So other than the burning, and it not staying ALL day as it was said that it would -</li>
<li> Needs to dry a bit or it smears but wait a few seconds</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it does indeed irritate my eyelid where I put it on.</li>
<li> And hands down this is a entertainers choice.</li>
<li> if I mess up I can just wipe it away before it dries.</li>
<li> It was hard to fix when you mess up, too.</li>
<li> If i go out in the evenings, I usually reapply another layer to make up for any liner that may have gotten rubbed off throughout the day.</li>
<li> occasionally i will find weird strings of eyeliner in my eye.</li>
<li> I apply the eyeliner, but if I press the applicator a bit too hard, I tend up erasing what I had just drawn.  </li>
<li> so i&#x27;ve always had a really hard time finding eye makeup that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids.</li>
<li> allllllll day(it&#x27;s quite shocking because my skin is very oily!!).</li>
<li> not good at all for waterline</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with eyeliner irritating my eyes, but this one does indeed.</li>
<li> Sometimes, when I apply, it starts burning my eyes a little, but it isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
<li> including expensive type thats</li>
<li> Very dramatic and all day or night wear.</li>
<li> I used this Almay Liquid Eyeliner and it stung like crazy.</li>
<li> This eyeliner is very difficult to find in stores!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Almay liquid eyeliner since I was 14 years old and I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products such as MAC eyeliner and CLinique etc.... but Almay liquid eyeliner is not only cheaper than those other brands but better.  I wear eye makeup everyday and one bottle of this liquid eyeliner last me months.  Its easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner, but it makes my eye lid burn really bad. This eyeliner does not flake or smear and it lasts a very long time. I&#x27;ve put it on early in the morning &amp; accidentally fallen asleep at night before taken it off &amp; it&#x27;s still on, like I had just applied it, the next morning. My only complaint is that it does indeed irritate my eyelid where I put it on. I&#x27;ve never had problems with eyeliner irritating my eyes, but this one does indeed. But, like they say, \\&quot;beauty is pain,\\&quot; so I suck it up &amp; use it anyways because it&#x27;s the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! :)</li>
    <li> Okay so a few things.    1. I apply the eyeliner, but if I press the applicator a bit too hard, I tend up erasing what I had just drawn.  Otherwise than that, it would create a decent line.   2. I love to put eyeliner on my waterline of my eye on the bottom, but with this eyeliner it is impossible.  Of course, you would manage to get it on, but after a short bit of time, it would come off into your eyes and make this huge mess swirling strings in your eye.  3. Sometimes, when I apply, it starts burning my eyes a little, but it isn&#x27;t too bad.  Just for those who are really sensitive, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.    4. Constantly have to reapply because it brushes off easily.   Otherwise than that, it is pretty decent as an eyeliner as long as you keep reapplying.  The color comes out strong and creates a dramatic effect.  I would have much preferred their other liquid liner which had a better brush and ingredients but can&#x27;t remember the name since it rubbed off.</li>
    <li> If you are familiar with applying liquid eyeliner it&#x27;s pretty easy to navigate the tiny brush. I always have damp q-tips nearby when putting it on so if I mess up I can just wipe it away before it dries. You can still get it off once it&#x27;s dried but you have to kind of scrub at it which, over time, can be damaging to the delicate skin of your eyelid.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is very difficult to find in stores!  I am very allergic to other brands,so happy to be able to find at amazon!  I always keep xtra on hand in fridge!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product from Almay.  The black is rich and it dries with a matte finish.  The applicator is gentle on the eyes.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I ever use. I love a cat eye! The applicator is great. It makes it much easier to apply than the brushes.</li>
    <li> This is the only one I use. The felt tip applicator is much easier to maneuver rather than a flimsy brush type. Specially since my eyes are very circular. The 5 stars is for the product. I would give 3 stars for the seller or whomever it may concern. I&#x27;m still waiting on this product to come in the mail. It&#x27;s been well over 13 days since I originally placed the order because I just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, and my current lil jar is on the verge of running out. Luckily I finally found it in store since I haven&#x27;t gotten my order yet...</li>
    <li> Very dramatic and all day or night wear. Needs to dry a bit or it smears but wait a few seconds and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was reviewed as being a great eyeliner for making wings on eyelids, but I get some burning sensations after I apply it and it&#x27;s kind of freaky each time it happens. I&#x27;ve been able to occasionally get it to give wings, but It&#x27;s probably just that I&#x27;m not good at it or something. So other than the burning, and it not staying ALL day as it was said that it would - and I did read about this product in a magazine which was what made me buy it- which means i still have to occasionally reapply it through out the day, it&#x27;s an okay eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I loved this so much! The great dramatic look it gave! But... There was one problem, it did not stay on. Perhaps it would work better if I used a primer but I don&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t want to add that into my daily routine.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I use. Does not crumble, smear resistant. Wears all day with normal use (low perspiration and no crying type of day).</li>
    <li> I have unbelievably sensitive eyes to the point where i get frequent styes on the inside of my eyelid so i&#x27;ve always had a really hard time finding eye makeup that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids. and this product is absolutely perfect! it dries really fast and it stays on all day :D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviews are right, tho - occasionally i will find weird strings of eyeliner in my eye. not good at all for waterline lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really love the brush too! it allows me to draw pretty wings with really sharp points! and it&#x27;s a really bold black which i also lovee.</li>
    <li> I have been using this almay eyeliner for years! i absolutely LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;works amazing &amp; does the job! I would recommand this to anyone!</li>
    <li> got exactly what i payed for, which is always a good thing, i would have more words, but only if it&#x27;s a bad review, thanks again Amazon........</li>
    <li> I have worked with several entertainers and show girls... And hands down this is a entertainers choice. Also I am a makeup artist in town and do several weddings this wont budge in the heat....I buy several at a time so I don&#x27;t run out...spending 30 dollars on a liquid liner not needed :)</li>
    <li> I wear eyeliner every day and have recommended this eyeliner to a number of friends. I have Asian eyes and need to put on a pretty thick layer for the liner to show. The applicator tip is very defined and accurate and the color is a dark black (not opaque or &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; looking like some other liquid eyeliners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have double eyelids so I&#x27;m always aware of getting my eyeliner getting smudged or looking oily, but this eyeliner holds up really well. If i go out in the evenings, I usually reapply another layer to make up for any liner that may have gotten rubbed off throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The quality of this eyeliner is great for the price. It applies easily and lasts throughout the day. I&#x27;m not so in love with the felt tip applicator as I find it a bit stiff but it works. I would have liked to see an actual brush instead but that&#x27;s just my preference. In my opinion, this is one of the best drugstore brand liquid liners out there.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. I have tried SOOOO many different types. including expensive type thats you can only buy at sephora/Macys. This is by far the best eyeliner I have come by and the best part about it is that its cheap and you can get it just about anywhere (CVS, walmart, ect..) Last long, will not flake, and great smooth line/easy to apply. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner...you can not get a better liquid eyeliner than this one!...the wand is perfectly pointed for easy application...and I do not get any itching or allergic reactions...stays on all day...great price here on amazon for this 2 pack!...will buy here again...seems like every time I look for it in the stores it&#x27;s gone! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried maaaannnyy liquid eyeliners in hopes of looking for a matte drugstore liquid eyeliner! I was fortunate to find this one (I was tired of the wet-garbage-bag finish of most liquid eyeliners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hypoallergenic which is great because I have sensitive skin BUT my first couple of applications it DID STING. After the third application it stopped though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t discontinue using it because it has an amazing matte finish, a great applicator, was inexpensive, and lasts allllllll day(it&#x27;s quite shocking because my skin is very oily!!). I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t discontinue using it because, as I mentioned, the stinging sensation went away and hasn&#x27;t returned for 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves my eyeliner and always ask me what brand it is and I happily tell them it&#x27;s Almay. I&#x27;ve had a few ladies, including my sisters, switch to this particular eyeliner from others. I&#x27;m a fan for the rest of my days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other liquid liners but i always go back to this one. Lasts all day unless you rub of course, but even then it just smudges and you get the smokey effect. Never peeled or flaked for me and looks natural rather than shiny and cracked. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t expect my eyeliner to hurt when I applied it! I have sensitive skin, and that includes my eyelids. Sometimes they have dry skin on them. I&#x27;m very choosy about eye cream, etc. I used this Almay Liquid Eyeliner and it stung like crazy. I read the box and the second/third ingredient is alcohol. No wonder! Aside from that, it created such a dark line that looked harsh and like it was drawn with a crayon. I like a softer look. It was hard to fix when you mess up, too. I&#x27;m hoping the store will take it back.</li>
