      <li>Unlike most durags.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>for some reason I have to write more . . .</li>
      <li>It is a large rag, which I imagine is good for someone with a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>The durag does what its supposed to do, now i got these waves all around my head makes me feel good every time my girlfriend wants to rub them.</li>
      <li>Does the job fine to wear underneath a helmet while riding motorcycles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for building, training and keep those spiraling waves tight over night.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean out.</li>
      <li>Overall this product is good, I recommend it for sure.</li>
      <li>luckily it was so cheap</li>
      <li>It is perfect because of the seamless stitching...that takes the line out of the middle of your head when you wake up.</li>
      <li>RIGHT..</li>
      <li>This Du-Rag is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Occasionally they&#x27;ll slip off but not too often and they&#x27;re easy to wash.</li>
      <li>Fast drying.</li>
      <li>this is really grindin my gears.</li>
      <li>i dont really use it for waves but rather to keep my hair neat when i putting on a jersey &amp; vest...</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because its still a du-rag which I can use &amp; because it was cheap...</li>
      <li>i didnt stress too much.</li>
      <li>It fit well and did what it was made to do and left no line after i took it off...</li>
      <li>If your looking at this product to help in your wave training regimine I will highly recommend this high quality durag.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Wave Builder Seamless Du-Rag Black; instead I received a cheap Du-rag that I could have bought from the store.</li>
      <li>First off let me say that this not a seamless du-rag as described.</li>
      <li>I bought this product in the hopes of me getting a \\&quot;WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag BLACK\\</li>
      <li>I love it, but mine has a tiny hole in it about the size of a small pea....</li>
      <li>Fast response, good customer service, just bad experience.</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t have major bed head in the morning and to prevent breakage.</li>
      <li>Not sure what the deal is with the whole &amp;#34;Wave Builder&amp;#34; label, but this is basically a general purpose Wave Cap.</li>

<li> The Seamless Du-Rag is hard to find, unless you live in the city.</li>
<li> Last a long time!</li>
<li> Anything that can survive young childen has got to be pretty tough!</li>
<li> The only cons about the durag are that the strings are a bit too short for me and there is a little bit of space at the peak of the seam in the durag so the crown of your head may not be completely laid down like you would want it to be.</li>
<li> I do note that the quality of the product is above average.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth it to send it back.</li>
<li> This isnt even sold by wavebuilder, and it began to rip down the middle before i even put it on.</li>
<li> I had this for a month or so before it started splitting down the middle.</li>
<li> tie down cap&#x27; NOT a wavebuilder du-rag, AND I was quite upset because that&#x27;s obviously not what i paid for.</li>
<li> What do they mean &#x27;no seam&#x27;, when there is clearly a seam.</li>
<li> Total waste of my money!</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t like my other rag, which set my waves after taking a morning shower in about 30 minutes.</li>
<li> Starting to get tired of the standard wave cap that leaves a line across your forehead.</li>
<li> I no longer have to worry about a line going down the center of my forehead!</li>
<li> Not worth the time to order it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ok but the material is annoying.</li>
<li> so it won&#x27;t leave an indentation in your hair while your training to lay your hair down.</li>
<li> Slightly ripped after a month of usage though and the stitches at the seams are coming apart.</li>
<li> but I fold it over a little</li>
<li> a du rag is a du rag, i use em for years, gts the job done, i wake up with my hair laid down and a head ful of waves!</li>
<li> ill take my buisness elsewhere, but i would have rather got a WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag.</li>
<li> For small headed people</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is too long and is uncomfortable.</li>
<li> WASTE OF TIME AND WRONG PRODUCT.</li>
<li> I am sick and tired of falling victim of false advertising.</li>
<li> Wrong product.</li>
<li> Completely random du rag and not the du rag I paid for.</li>
<li> Waves make people sea sick from looking at my head.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First off let me say that this not a seamless du-rag as described. It is a regular du-rag with the seam. Secondly it is not made by wave builder. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because its still a du-rag which I can use &amp; because it was cheap... I DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> If your looking at this product to help in your wave training regimine I will highly recommend this high quality durag. Unlike most durags. The wavebuilder durag has no seams in it so it won&#x27;t leave an indentation in your hair while your training to lay your hair down. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am sick and tired of falling victim of false advertising. I ordered the Wave Builder Seamless Du-Rag Black; instead I received a cheap Du-rag that I could have bought from the store. The Seamless Du-Rag is hard to find, unless you live in the city. Therefore I bought it online. It&#x27;s not worth it to send it back. It&#x27;s just going to lay in my draw and eventually end up in the trash. Total waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This durag is the best durag ive had and ive had about three. It is perfect because of the seamless stitching...that takes the line out of the middle of your head when you wake up. The only cons about the durag are that the strings are a bit too short for me and there is a little bit of space at the peak of the seam in the durag so the crown of your head may not be completely laid down like you would want it to be. This can be solved by throwing on a wavecap though so its all good. Overall this product is good, I recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the hopes of me getting a \\&quot;WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag BLACK\\&quot; But i open the package and it&#x27;s from a company called &#x27;ACE tie down cap&#x27; NOT a wavebuilder du-rag, AND I was quite upset because that&#x27;s obviously not what i paid for. I was quite insulted because it seems as though, someone just went to the local store, and bought any du-rag they saw and mailed it to me. After dealing with the seller i got a refund which is alright, ill take my buisness elsewhere, but i would have rather got a WAVE BUILDER Seamless Du-Rag. Fast response, good customer service, just bad experience.</li>
    <li> Take my advice when i say it. This isnt even sold by wavebuilder, and it began to rip down the middle before i even put it on. WASTE OF TIME AND WRONG PRODUCT. luckily it was so cheap i didnt stress too much.</li>
    <li> IT NEVER COMES OFF AT NIGHT, BECAUSE OF THIS CAP MY WAVE STAY LOOK RIGHT.. AND THERE IS NO LINES LEFT IN YOUR WAVE WHAT SO EVER. LOVE IT IM GOING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE SOON THANK A MILLION !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For small headed people</li>
    <li> buy  it and you will look like chris brown. yes its good. yes buy . i like it yes I do</li>
    <li> The durag does what its supposed to do, now i got these waves all around my head makes me feel good every time my girlfriend wants to rub them.</li>
    <li> I no longer have to worry about a line going down the center of my forehead! I can take it off without the crease! Thank you!</li>
    <li> a du rag is a du rag, i use em for years, gts the job done, i wake up with my hair laid down and a head ful of waves!</li>
    <li> I love it, but mine has a tiny hole in it about the size of a small pea.... but I fold it over a little so you can&#x27;t see it.... Love it!</li>
    <li> I had this for a month or so before it started splitting down the middle. Think I&#x27;ll try a different product.</li>
    <li> Does the job fine to wear underneath a helmet while riding motorcycles. Slightly ripped after a month of usage though and the stitches at the seams are coming apart.</li>
    <li> Good product that is at an affordable price and I am very satisfied. for some reason I have to write more . . .</li>
    <li> Not worth the time to order it.</li>
    <li> I use these on my kids (ages 7 and 4) dreads at night so they don&#x27;t have major bed head in the morning and to prevent breakage. We&#x27;ve used them for almost two years and they are great. Occasionally they&#x27;ll slip off but not too often and they&#x27;re easy to wash. Anything that can survive young childen has got to be pretty tough!</li>
    <li> Its a stocking cap!. Its good quality just dont let your dog eat it.&lt;br /&gt;Or let your cat get a hold of it.</li>
    <li> Starting to get tired of the standard wave cap that leaves a line across your forehead. Would recommend a Tsurag before buying this.</li>
    <li> i dont really use it for waves but rather to keep my hair neat when i putting on a jersey &amp; vest...sometimes i sleep with it on, no compliants...</li>
    <li> It fit well and did what it was made to do and left no line after i took it off... I recommend it...</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Last a long time! This was for my son and he still has it! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone! Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> Umm, there&#x27;s a seam. What do they mean &#x27;no seam&#x27;, when there is clearly a seam. I need that explained to me. this is really grindin my gears.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work lol .. Guess just for style or I didn&#x27;t use it corrected but I&#x27;m sure I did so don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> This Du-Rag is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s perfect for building, training and keep those spiraling waves tight over night.</li>
    <li> It is a large rag, which I imagine is good for someone with a lot of hair. For me, the rag works best when wearing overnight. It isn&#x27;t like my other rag, which set my waves after taking a morning shower in about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Waves make people sea sick from looking at my head.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will reorders. Will tell others. Easy to clean out. Fast drying. Please, keep up the good work. Thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but the material is annoying. The &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; is too long and is uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Not spandex material hurts your for head no give in material</li>
    <li> Wrong product. Completely random du rag and not the du rag I paid for. Do not buy from &amp;#34;plug in deals&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Loved it , never comes off at night , great product ,</li>
    <li> Not sure what the deal is with the whole &amp;#34;Wave Builder&amp;#34; label, but this is basically a general purpose Wave Cap. I do note that the quality of the product is above average.</li>
