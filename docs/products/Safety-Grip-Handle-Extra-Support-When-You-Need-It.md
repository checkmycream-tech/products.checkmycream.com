### Positive Reviews

      <li>but it work perfect.</li>
      <li>For three months, it has been working perfectly on fiberglass shower wall.  </li>
      <li>Both products excellent</li>
      <li>Works perfectly.</li>
      <li>This works great!</li>
      <li>this is a very good idea.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Ideal for Temporary Support For Showers, Tubs &amp; More!\\&quot;   </li>
      <li>My husband wanted to try this out before giving it to our friend, and it is a good thing he did!  </li>
      <li>Good Luck!</li>

      <li>This item is very safe sturdy</li>
      <li>I am very glad I did not give this to my friend, my husband (who is 39)</li>
      <li>once you get it securely attached it stays stuck!!  </li>
      <li>We love it and we are not geriatric!</li>
      <li>the tile and things are running real smooth.  </li>
      <li>The indicator to let you know if it&#x27;s secure or not is a great feature.</li>
      <li>Woild recommend for temp but effective use.</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I make sure it is attached, I have no problem using it and feel it was a good solution to the problem I had.</li>

      <li>highly recommend it having an excellent price point and available through the Amazon Prime program.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I gfeel very secure with using this for balance when getting out of the shower.</li>
      <li>They are very secure.</li>
      <li>so well i re-ordered more.</li>
      <li>I still check them periodically to make sure that there is no looseness or side slippage.</li>
      <li>Try a different brand, as it&#x27;s a wonderful idea, not just THIS one.</li>
      <li>and we eventually threw it out after not being able to depend on it at all.</li>
      <li>THAT DID NOT DO ITS JOB,AND I MADE SURE</li>
      <li>If there is even the slightest curve on the wall then it will not be safe.</li>
      <li>Okay, but the instructions inside say:  \\&quot;Do not use to provide leverage or stability or maintain balance while lifting yourself.\\&quot;  And also:  </li>
      <li>I pull on it every time before I get into the tub or shower and many times I have to remove and reattach it.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered a couple more to keep at my house.  </li>
      <li>Love these handles.  </li>
      <li>It is one thing to make a product like the \\&quot;ped-egg\\&quot;and rip people off by telling them their feet will be smooth, no harm, no foul!</li>
      <li>But safety first and more muscle needed is a good thing in the bath tub.</li>
      <li>So if you cant use it on your shower because it isnt smooth it works great for laying large tiles.</li>
      <li>Works fine have had to reattach once or twice but all in all satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
      <li>These are great for our 9 month old.</li>
      <li>Makes safety in the bathroom more secure.  </li>
      <li>installs easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to install and remove.  </li>
      <li>make sure the surface is clean or it will slide.</li>
      <li>It tolerates quite a strong pull without budging.</li>
      <li>Yes, the suction is that strong.</li>
      <li>and I cringe to imagine people buying this for elderly relatives and thinking they will be fine to bathe unassisted.</li>
      <li>It holds me up fine for balance etc, I would not recommend trying to hang from it, of course.  </li>
      <li>Was easy to attached to the smooth surface of the shower.  </li>
      <li>Although the product came quickly and there were no issues with the order, the product does NOT stick on the tile at all!</li>
      <li>Works great on smooth surfaces only.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I caught myself.</li>
      <li>No way this thing is falling off by itself if you have a smooth surface.</li>
      <li>You need to ensure the surface this is being placed on is completely smooth.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t stay secure.  </li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t attach securely if you put it on a grout line.  </li>
      <li>and this will not stick to it because it isnt smooth.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it will be attached with the \\&quot;green\\&quot; light showing but then just fall off the wall.  </li>
      <li>So if you don&#x27;t have a smooth glass like surface to use it against this will not work for you.</li>
      <li>just barely fit between the edges of the tile.      </li>
      <li>We needed a handle that is portable but totally secure and reliable.</li>
      <li>My tub is smooth, so that&#x27;s not it.  </li>
      <li>so feeling secure in the shower is imperative.</li>
      <li>Would not stick to anything that I tried, a were smooth surfaces.</li>
      <li>If your walls are completely flat then this product is great.  </li>
      <li>My house is not handicap accessible.</li>
      <li>My shower already is handicap accessible and has a built in seat and support handles built in.  </li>
      <li>and it sure has worked well for its purpose ;)</li>
      <li>I had ideal conditiond, large tile and tried to mount it at every possible angle.</li>
      <li>Great worls just like I expected &amp; provides the safety I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Good Product, low price,on time deliver.</li>
      <li>The handles are easy to install for temporary use and it is not difficult to remove them.  </li>
      <li>super holding power.</li>
      <li>After a couple times of readjusting, the suction no longer worked and the gripper would fall off in the tub quickly.</li>
      <li>What can I say except that it is functional, makes me feel secure getting into/out of our shower, and looks crisp and not too &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;, also.</li>
      <li>Better than others, just make sure they lie flat on the tile.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy yet easily moved.</li>
      <li>He said because it has the large handle it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>Has little colored (red-not locked / green-locked) dots, so I feel confident letting the boy get in on his own.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money and easier to install than drilling thru the ceramic tile to install steel grip handles.</li>
      <li>its a trick that&#x27;s well worth trying for those of you who have already purchased a safety grip handle.   </li>
      <li>These shower, bath grips are great for anyone, both young and old, to help keep you steady while bathing and showering.</li>
      <li>AND IT POPPED RIGHT OFF THE WALL,</li>
      <li>I bought a Get A Grip handle elsewhere and am about to leave to return it right now.  </li>
      <li>Even though the instructions say to put it on dry surfaces, we find it grips best when both the suction cups and the tub surface are wet.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps coming off the wall-</li>
    <li> I have yet to see a commercial using the Safety Grip Handle the way we did.. My wife kept complaining that she was breaking her finger nails when ever she tried to open our heavy glass sliding doors (8&#x27; not 6&#x27; tall) so I purchased a wood handle for the inside but there was nothing on the market for the outside of the door, that is not until the idea (light bulb here) struck me to use the Safety Grip on the outside of the glass sliding door... it&#x27;s a smooth surface and works perfectly... now she&#x27;s happy and when she&#x27;s happy life is good...</li>
    <li> Trash. I tried it on diffrent surfaces. it wont stay up for more than a few minutes. anyone who uses it for safety purposes is going to end up on a gurney. I am going to try to return it, if I can not I am going to destroy it before putting it in the trash. I dont want anyone getting ahold of it and getting hurt.</li>
    <li> These are great for our 9 month old. We have two in our jacuzzi style bath tub for baby to pull up on. They are very secure. The indicator to let you know if it&#x27;s secure or not is a great feature. My only complaint is that it can be hard for me to get these secure , my husband has a much easier time than I do. But safety first and more muscle needed is a good thing in the bath tub. If you have a wiggly unstable baby don&#x27;t expect to put these up with them in the tub. Wait until you have a few minutes by yourself to verify they are secure. It only takes 2-5 minutes to get them setup.     I would recommend for anyone in the tub including babies, injured adults, elderly folks, etc,</li>
    <li> Makes safety in the bathroom more secure.  I don&#x27;t feel so vulnerable getting in and out of the tub and off the toilet.  My house is not handicap accessible.</li>
    <li> My husband and I bought this product for a friend of ours who recently had his leg amputated due to complications from a disease that my husband also has.    My husband wanted to try this out before giving it to our friend, and it is a good thing he did!  I want to agree with a past reviewer who said something along the lines of this being \\&quot;horrifying\\&quot;. I am very glad I did not give this to my friend, my husband (who is 39) attached it to many different surfaces and each time it came undone. I am appalled that this product is being sold as a safety grip. It is one thing to make a product like the \\&quot;ped-egg\\&quot;and rip people off by telling them their feet will be smooth, no harm, no foul! but this is a dangerous product and I cringe to imagine people buying this for elderly relatives and thinking they will be fine to bathe unassisted. This product is, frankly, offensive in it&#x27;s false advertising and very dangerous!</li>
    <li> My wife recently had total hip replacement surgery and needed a handle to attach to the tub wall in order to take a shower. We needed a handle that is portable but totally secure and reliable. Price was also important as the unit will only be used temporarily. This handle was simple to install and it has remained securely in place via its suction cups for about 4 weeks.  Martee has been home now for over a week and has full confidence in taking a shower thanks to this inexpensive handle.  (ps: I too am using it so it may be on the tub wall permanently.)</li>
    <li> worked great for a couple of weeks then would not stay on... i would not trust these nor recommend that you buy them</li>
    <li> You need to ensure the surface this is being placed on is completely smooth.  Glass or flat tiles with no patterns or slight indentations - or it will not hold.</li>
    <li> The one I bought break at the neck of one of the two connectors after using it for about 15 times.</li>
    <li> Suction lasts about a day before it gives out.  Usual problem getting the device out of the plastic bubble it was wrapped in.  Low price, but not worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought a Get A Grip handle elsewhere and am about to leave to return it right now.  On the outside of the box it states: \\&quot;Ideal for Temporary Support For Showers, Tubs &amp; More!\\&quot;   Okay, but the instructions inside say:  \\&quot;Do not use to provide leverage or stability or maintain balance while lifting yourself.\\&quot;  And also:  \\&quot;Not designed to restore lost balance.\\&quot;   And also:  \\&quot;If any difficulty is encountered during installation, use the services of a qualified installer.\\&quot;    I think they have included those warnings to cover themselves in the event someone depends on this product yet ends up falling because it slipped or came off.  I think the use of this product would be like an accident waiting to happen.  I personally am not going to risk that on myself or my guests.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000K8E9MW Bath Safety Grip Handle]] does not fit. I assumed incorrectly that there are standard sizes to bath tub rims. The suction cup edges are larger than my tub rim so that it is impossible to get suction with them. This was a frustrating experience. It is the only and last time that I order from a TV ad.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 5 months ago and it has been such a help. My sister visited our house this past weekend from Europe and she loved it. One of those HAVE TO HAVE item so she took mine because she was leaving in 2 days.     Thanks to her, I now have to purchase another unit. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> After repeatedly readjusting the suction, I finally left this thing off before someone had an accident.  The 17 inch Saf-er product did work as stated so buy it instead.</li>
    <li> This item has the potential to be dangerous. The  suction cups lose there suction and when you go to grab them they come off. This could cause someone to fall and get injured.</li>
    <li> super holding power. has a red indicator if suction is lost and a green indicator for good suction. actually i liked it so well i re-ordered more. i weight 110 pounds &amp; i held onto the bar, leaned back &amp; tried to get it to pull off but i couldn&#x27;t do it. works best on non-tiled and smooth surfaces.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t stay mounted but a day or so and then falls off. When first mounted it helps on getting in and out of shower.</li>
    <li> Nice product but it seems to lose its suction after a day or so, but its very solid when you first install it and it does give the support I was looking for. I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Once I found that the 2 metal stabiliaztion contact points left rust marks, I started repositioning the gripper.  After a couple times of readjusting, the suction no longer worked and the gripper would fall off in the tub quickly.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I followed instructions and it only stuck to tile for a few minutes then popped off. When I e-mailed the company and told them I felt this product was defective and wanted my shipping return reimbursed, they said no. They said just because the product won&#x27;t work does not mean it&#x27;s defective so I would have to pay for shipping. It also took over a week and 2 e-mails to get a reply. When you e-mail you get an automated e-mail back saying someone will be in touch within 24hrs. I would not advise anyone to purchase this product. I had ideal conditiond, large tile and tried to mount it at every possible angle.</li>
    <li> Works fine have had to reattach once or twice but all in all satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all and is dangerous, don&#x27;t buy. Would not stick to anything that I tried, a were smooth surfaces. Waste of time an money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for post op care and was disappointed.  It does not stick on subway size tile!  Could not use it.</li>
    <li> The suction did not work</li>
    <li> The item was larger than expected and will not work on the surface I have, it also had a slightly yellow tint as if it had me in the sun or was just really old.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for.  My shower is in a standard tub.  After badly spraining my ankle, I found it scary to stand on one foot and lift the other over the tub -- no matter which leg I led with, I would be putting all of my weight on the bad ankle for a few moments.  It was weak and painful and made me unsteady, so I feared falling, and since I live alone, that was not something I wanted to do!  I found this safety grip and it grips the shower surround well, giving me enough stability that I can get in and out with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning, however.  Don&#x27;t just grab it and trust that it is adhered properly.  I don&#x27;t know if they are all this way, but mine does lose its suction.  One of the two suction cups loses its suction every 2-3 days, the other is always firmly stuck when I have to remove and reattach them both due to the first one. Therefore, I caution anyone who wants to use this to keep this in mind and be CERTAIN it is properly adhered before you grab hold of it.  I pull on it every time before I get into the tub or shower and many times I have to remove and reattach it.  At that point it is good for a couple days, but I check it every day I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I make sure it is attached, I have no problem using it and feel it was a good solution to the problem I had.</li>
    <li> It takes awhile to figure out how to make it stick.  It won&#x27;t attach securely if you put it on a grout line.  Avoid the grout lines...........&lt;br /&gt;But once you get it securely attached it stays stuck!!  A very useful tool for those of us who are senior citizens and need a little extra help in the shower.  Well worth the money and easier to install than drilling thru the ceramic tile to install steel grip handles.</li>
    <li> I am not old and I am not in fear of slipping in the shower. I bought this to make showers with the significant other fun and it sure has worked well for its purpose ;)</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to order this handle with the number of negative reviews, but after getting it, I&#x27;m amazed at the suction.  We have a smooth cultured marble shower wall, and this handle is one mean sucker. We just got it, so I can&#x27;t speak to longevity, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine it deteriorating to any great degree.  No way this thing is falling off by itself if you have a smooth surface. It tolerates quite a strong pull without budging.</li>
    <li> Safety Grip Handle  works as advertised. make sure the surface is clean or it will slide. Yes I would buy another.</li>
    <li> For three months, it has been working perfectly on fiberglass shower wall.  Easy to install and remove.  No problems at all.  I plan to order another one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold. Can&#x27;t use on tub surround only original tiles. Comes lose which Is disastrous when getting out of the tub</li>
    <li> Very convenient for use in guest bathroom and especially for traveling.  Is especially helpful for seniors when using the shower.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the technological improvement in a product purchased several years ago from one of those, &amp;#34;as see on TV&amp;#34; locations. In most respects this is the same type of product, not the most expensive, but the design if very functional. The new red/green indicators on the side of the grab bar indicating a solid suction to the wall  are a tremendous help and comfort. I&#x27;ve used the older version of this product for several years and been very satisfied until one simply gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new product design creates a greater concern of needing to use it for balance or support, by pulling on it, rather than the grab bar giving way off the wall, one might actually pull the tile off the wall. Yes, the suction is that strong. I like the fact they are removable and can be taken on trips to be used in hotels not providing satisfactory handicapped showers. I believe the key to longevity of these suction safety grab bars is preventive maintenance, by removing them at least once every two weeks and cleaning them out thoroughly. I would advise against using products like &#x27;Tilex Tub and Tile&#x27; cleaner, as they will break down the internal components over time. As with any home safety product, one is personally responsible to insure it is utilized as designed and safe to use each time, by double checking the suction to the walls is solid with green indicators in both top and bottom locations.This is a much more durable, well designed, heavy duty and more functional product than the previous version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it having an excellent price point and available through the Amazon Prime program. Delivery was within the specified two days of order. My only disappointment was the company&#x27;s use of the heavy duty clear vacuum plastic shell around each unit. This required the use of sharp scissors to open the package, which might lead to a serious cut from any exposed edge of the packaging. Other than this point, I am very happy with all aspects of this product and find it to be a perfect safety supplemental support for home use, to remain steady and balanced while in the shower or bath.spects of this product and find it to be a perfect safety supplemental support for home use, to remain steady and balanced while in the shower or bath.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Attaches to wall and seems like it is sturdy and then falls over a few hours later.  So sorry I purchased this.</li>
    <li> This item is very safe sturdy Iknow I can be safe with it in the shower.and not worry about them coming loose .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that this grip does not stay attached very well.  Sometimes it will be attached with the \\&quot;green\\&quot; light showing but then just fall off the wall.  I can&#x27;t trust it.</li>
    <li> Very low price but it work perfect. The suction cup very strong, hold very tight, I can feel safe when I hold it.  Good Product, low price,on time deliver. It made me happy.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Does not hold on tile. Bad suction.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time works at advertised.  Was easy to attached to the smooth surface of the shower.  I purchased two and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I ordered to of these for my bathtub after suffering an ankle fracture.  They did not stay adhered to my fiberglass tub surround so had to return them.</li>
    <li> Only will stay stuck to a perfectly smooth surface, even the slightest thing&lt;br /&gt;disrupts the ability to stick, so it is a very limited product.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these safety grip handles for my dad&#x27;s shower and it has worked consistently well for him for about 8 months.  Recently he spent a few days with me so I ordered a couple more to keep at my house.  One of them has stayed on the shower wall strongly but the second one has fallen off.  The first one is on a very flat part of the molded shower but I am finding it hard to find a completely flat part for the second one.  If your walls are completely flat then this product is great.  If there is even the slightest curve on the wall then it will not be safe.</li>
    <li> I ordered the safety grip to provide support in getting in and out of the tub following knee surgery. Although the product came quickly and there were no issues with the order, the product does NOT stick on the tile at all! - I tried the tub and the tiles and neither provide a seal. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> AND BOUGHT THOSE HANDLES TO PUT AROUND THE TUB ,TO ASSIAT ME TO EXIT TE TUB...I GRABBED THE HANDLE AND IT POPPED RIGHT OFF THE WALL,THAT DID NOT DO ITS JOB,AND I MADE SURE THAT I INSTALLED IT CORECTLY</li>
    <li> Unfortunately on my shower wall the suction cups won&#x27;t hold.  However, we bought one for my brother after he had hip surgery and his works great.</li>
    <li> These were much better than I expected and they work very well they make it easier to get in and out of tub and shower</li>
    <li> Works great on smooth surfaces only.</li>
    <li> Ordered this (&amp; the longer version) for our 5 year old son. He really wanted his independence when bathing. Didn&#x27;t want Mom or Dad putting him in / taking him out of the tub. This works great! Has little colored (red-not locked / green-locked) dots, so I feel confident letting the boy get in on his own. It also has been helpful for the whole family.</li>
    <li> [ASIN:B0019Y384G BATH TUB SHOWER SAFETY GRIP SUCTION BAR HANDLE]]My wife used two of these handles several times on a road trip when accessibility options did not entirely meet her needs.  Properly placed and tested for a firm seal before each shower, the handles held when my wife transferred her weight in and out of the bathing area. The handles are easy to install for temporary use and it is not difficult to remove them.  However, as stated in the instructions, the handles must be reinstalled and tested before each use. The seal does not last and the equipment actually fell off the wall when we left it overnight.  Overall we found the handles quite useful and easy to pack.  Certainly we will take them with us on our future trips.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for using on my gardentub as I slip a bit.  This is more dangerous than having nothing at all.  My tub is smooth, so that&#x27;s not it.  It just doesn&#x27;t stay secure.  I went to get up and it was loose so I fell out of the tub.  Good thing I didn&#x27;t get hurt.  I&#x27;ve even tried it on the shower wall, same thing, doesn&#x27;t stay secure.  We heard it fall off the wall in the middle of the night.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this took me and my husband to put it on the side of the tub. I held it while he pushed the blue buttons down. the suction cups have springs behind them and help to keep them held tight. it does have little red/green slides on the side. when it&#x27;s red it means to regrip it when it&#x27;s green you are good.</li>
    <li> I had the old style (which I liked) but occasionally it would become loose (and even fall off). I thought that was a flaw so I threw it away. Later I found out that if you &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; it for 4 days it will reshape (or so they say) and stick well again. Lesson learned on this one.  Extra safety feature on this is that there are colored buttons (green and red) to show if it is secure. So far, its been secure so I have yet to see the red color, and for the less lazy, give it a tad of a tug.  I am a large person and am recouperating from a knee accident so feeling secure in the shower is imperative. It holds me up fine for balance etc, I would not recommend trying to hang from it, of course.  Prices vary on this item, so shop around. I have seen it much more expensive than at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This device works on the suction cup principal. So if you don&#x27;t have a smooth glass like surface to use it against this will not work for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for safety after spinal fusion. Almost killed myself after back surgery trying to use it. This thing came unstuck while I was trying to get out of the shower. Fortunately I caught myself.</li>
    <li> Love these handles.  We bought two of them and are very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy yet easily moved. One person complained that it came off the wall. One side came loose after a couple of months but all I had to do was rest set the thumb lock. I actually don&#x27;t use it as a safety handle but as a shelf to prop my leg for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Every time I tried using this handle, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all, doesn&#x27;t stay stuck to the shower wall.  If it does, it pops off in the middle of the night and sares everyone in the household.  Try a different brand, as it&#x27;s a wonderful idea, not just THIS one.</li>
    <li> I believe this gripper has a red light near the handle on top.  Check to see if remains red.  If not, remove from wall, and reapply.  Otherwise, I gfeel very secure with using this for balance when getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet  Appears to be as advertized</li>
    <li> always a welcome addition in a bathroom. can prevent serious injuries and falls. excellent for kids and older people too</li>
    <li> This shower safety grip suction bar is by far the worst product I have ever purchased online. It is particularly horrifying to imagine the consequences of what could later happen when the suction cups repeatedly fell off after attachment to my bathroom walls (usually 12 to 24 hours later). Almost definitely, a person could be seriously hurt when climbing out of the tub. The grip handle did not stay attached to any of my walls, such as marble, glass, plaster or tile. Not only did I waste $24.00, I feel I was falsely misled by the misleading advertising claims of this product. I hope no one finds out the hard way this product is worthless.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for quite a while now and in the beginning I too had problems with the suction starting to loosen up after about 10-15 uses.  The product information states that you should check the handle every so often in case you need to re-apply the suction and for safety&#x27;s sake this is a very good idea.  Also, all walls are not created equal...ours has large tiles and the suction cups just barely fit between the edges of the tile.      The instructions say to make sure the suction cups are well cleaned and perfectly dry before attaching to the wall (which I even cleaned them with alcohol and let them dry beforehand).  Good for about a week but not good enough as I use these to assist an invalid relative 4-5 times a day.      Discussed the problem with another relative (who is a jack-of-all-trades fixer-upper) and he suggested trying the Vaseline trick.....Taking just a teeny tiny amount and rubbing it smoothly over the flat suction cup area (the side that suctions to the wall) to help create a more \\&quot;airless\\&quot; suction.      Well, after applying a very small amount of the petroleum jelly, and I&#x27;m talking barely rubbing my finger in the jar (smaller than a pea-size portion) and then rubbing the vaseline smoothly and evenly over the entire cup area, I was pleased to find that the suction was greatly improved.  (I did have to gently slide one cup back and forth a few times for the suction to really take hold.)      RESULT:  The handles have remained intact and strong on our bathroom tiles now for the past three weeks.  NOTE:  **I still check them periodically to make sure that there is no looseness or side slippage.**      Now I&#x27;m not saying this will work for all kinds of walls but its a trick that&#x27;s well worth trying for those of you who have already purchased a safety grip handle.   I hope this helps you! Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Held well but you should check once a month as they do become less secure. Better than others, just make sure they lie flat on the tile.</li>
    <li> wow. installs easy. and flexible location in shower</li>
    <li> arrived on time and appears just as it did online. I haven&#x27;t installed it yet but I will soon as I move.</li>
    <li> Great worls just like I expected &amp; provides the safety I was looking for. Woild recommend for temp but effective use.</li>
    <li> The grips do not stay on.  They fall off easily and my elderly father cannot put them back on by himself.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by this suction grab bar. I placed it on the side of a ceramic bathtub the next morning it was on the floor. No one touched it or used it. I have other suction grab bars, different brand and they are still attached.</li>
    <li> It is performing exactly as it should and as I need it to. I could not accomplish my goals so well without it&#x27;s aid.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 grip handles for my mother in law.  They worked very well.  Appears to grip very sturdily.  I am keeping them for my husband and I when we need them. thank you,</li>
    <li> Unlike some other comments, I&#x27;ve found that this unit securely grips on my fiberglass tube and never come loose on its own.</li>
    <li> Due to a recent surgery, I purchased 2 of these handles as recommended by my physical therapist. I was pleasantly surprised (as was my p.t.) by the quality and the additional safety feature showing a green dot when suction was safe to use, and red when the suction had been compromised, making the handle unsafe to support bodyweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of my friends have now decided to purchase either for themselves, or for their elderly parents. I highly recommend this product, as well as the vendor, who was very prompt in shipping and had the product well protected for any rough handling during shipping.</li>
    <li> This product will not adhere to the bathroom tile for more than Ten minutes. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has Parkinson&#x27;s to help him get out of the shower and tub.  This product Is dangerous because it feels sturdy and you lean on it and all of a sudden it lets loose.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use on Fiberglass shower for use after total knee replacement surgery.  My shower already is handicap accessible and has a built in seat and support handles built in.  However, I wanted an additional support handle at the edge of the door to aid when exiting the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed this a week prior to surgery and was pleased to see the green/red indicator that shows if it is properly attached. We used our shower normally and every day I checked its status.  Every day the top indicator would be red.  We would reattach per instructions and have two green indicatorrs.  By the next day the top indicator would be red again.  I never trusted this item and we eventually threw it out after not being able to depend on it at all.</li>
    <li> Well I received 2 of these because I was going to put one in my shower and one for a friend of mine. Well I have a fiberglass wall in my shower and this will not stick to it because it isnt smooth.  I didnt know what to do with them and my husband is in the middle of a floor tileing job and he said let me see those.  He tried it on a tile and it worked great. The tiles are 17 inches tiles and hard to lay down without getting your fingers full of the glue so he just clamped the handle on the tiles and layed them down very easily.  He gave the other one to the guy who was helping him lay the tile and things are running real smooth.  So if you cant use it on your shower because it isnt smooth it works great for laying large tiles. He said because it has the large handle it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Even though the instructions say to put it on dry surfaces, we find it grips best when both the suction cups and the tub surface are wet.  Strong and very supportive.  This one is longer - use 2 hands on it, if needed.</li>
    <li> Don.t hold very well.</li>
    <li> Both products excellent</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I like this one a little better because it has the color code to show you when it is getting a little loose.  With any suction type object the suction may loosen up.  When I get into the shower the first thing I do is check to make sure they are tight.  If I feel that they are a little loose I tighten them.  I use them for stability and they work well.  I&#x27;ve seen where people complain about them but you need to think ahead and make sure they are tight.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is the third handle I&#x27;ve purchased.  Two are in the shower and one near the toilet.  They&#x27;re very helpful for someone who has a balance problem.  Gives me the security I need.</li>
    <li> These shower, bath grips are great for anyone, both young and old, to help keep you steady while bathing and showering. We are all afraid of falls, and these can help put your mind at ease.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday.  Peace of mind knowing that I can hold on here and not worry about slipping.</li>
    <li> For the most part I am very happy  with all my purchases.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. What can I say except that it is functional, makes me feel secure getting into/out of our shower, and looks crisp and not too &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;, also. Serves this home very well. I think our guests, especially moms and dads, will LOVE It. We love it and we are not geriatric! Just have a somewhat slippery tile//tub area. I recommend!!</li>
    <li> The hand grip works very well, but after two years, the blue locking levers broke off.  But for the price, two years is not too bad.  It works very well for placing and removing sunroom windows as the seasons change.</li>
