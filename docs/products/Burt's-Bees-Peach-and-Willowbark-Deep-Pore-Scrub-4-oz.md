      <li>This product is just wonderful!</li>

      <li>Mix this (in your hands not in the bottle) with your favorite cleanser that you know will clean your face well, and you are good to go!</li>
      <li>The smell is very bizarre.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite scrub.</li>
      <li>Love the exfoliating texture.</li>
      <li>Just remember to give it more than 2 weeks to work the magic.</li>
      <li>When I use this product on my face it becomes more oily.</li>
      <li>But for my dry skin, it was great!</li>
      <li>This stuff has worked magic, I rarely get any skin problem now!</li>
      <li>I first used this product it felt nice as I massaged my face, but when I rinsed it off, my face felt sticky, and not as clean as I wanted it to, resulting in washing my face with a cleanser.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my skin soooo smooth and it smells like HEAVEN.</li>
      <li>Cleans great and has a terrific smell.</li>
      <li>I have medium tone skin that gets somewhat greasy in the summer and is prone to light breakouts.  </li>
      <li>So easy and so worth the money.</li>
      <li>recently ran out of the apricot scrub and started using burt&#x27;s bees acne scrub; it&#x27;s not as good in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>You need something a lot more gentle.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT IS FULL OF OIL ND GREASE.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this product is the scent.</li>
      <li>My skin feels really soft! :)</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural scrub.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so I was in desperate need of an exfoliator since my Cure Aqua Gel Samples ran out and i wasn&#x27;t going to pay $42 for a bottle even though it was and AWESOME exfoliator.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so things like Benzoyl Peroxide make my skin burn and cause more breakouts.</li>
      <li>So today I decided to mix some of this exfoliator with my Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser since my cleanser didn&#x27;t have any properties to help my acne.</li>
      <li>I love love love this stuff and will honestly not consider ever using anything else.</li>
      <li>There are so many oils in it that it can only be good for someone with incredibly dry skin.</li>
      <li>love hurts bees but maybe ground the peach pit a little more</li>
      <li>When I first started using this apricot scrub twice a day, my skin broke out a little more but the texture was much better</li>
      <li>If you have mild acne or sensitive skin, use this product once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a difference right after you use it for the first time!</li>
      <li>I first used this stuff in December and in cleared my face up.</li>
      <li>love how it&#x27;s creamy, yet as you rub it in, you can feel the grains dig deep into your pores.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of grape see oil and, unless you spend a lot more time scrubbing, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
      <li>I still can&#x27;t believe that after years of searching and trying so many products that produce no results, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
      <li>Back to St. Ives, whose scrub is closer to my favorite synthetic microbead scrubs from Aveeno and Olay.</li>
      <li>Also, this product balances the natural moisture of your skin, so if you are going to moisturize, use a light, oil-free formula.</li>
      <li>I was much younger and didn&#x27;t know for sure if this caused the problem.</li>
      <li>I kept using the scrub, only once a day for 2 more weeks.</li>
      <li>I was surprised because it feels greasy when scrubbing it on and rinsing it off, but after I use a toner after the scrub, my face feels clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>After the mixed wash, my face felt clean, hydrated, and SO SOFT!!!!!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>My one tip is to not scrub it into your skin that much, though, as doing so irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>constancy is too much.</li>
      <li>this wont be much of a problem&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>no matter how much I rinse</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
      <li>Was looking for a more natural alternative to the St Ives-type of apricot exfoliating scrub, but this definitely isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>, I am in more controle of my acne, the tone of my skin is improved, and with the help of a scar-removal serum, my acne scars are finally starting to clear up</li>
      <li>i love facial scrubs because i never really feel like my skin&#x27;s really clean unless i have a scrub.</li>
      <li>Has not gotten rid of my acne, but helps it enough to where I purchased the full size.</li>
      <li>I normally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products -</li>
      <li>This one from Burt&#x27;s Bees smells lovely, but is too heavy.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was normal, so I just washed my face after I used it.</li>
      <li>I have normal to oily skin, so I don&#x27;t worry about drying out my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once I learned their new parent company, Unilver tested on animals, I went looking for another product</li>
      <li>It smells like the inside of a new house being built - the smell of plaster and primer coatings of paint.&lt;br</li>
      <li>B00005IBW0 St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Gentle, Sensitive Skin, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 6)]] for Sensitive Skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>my skin has become so much softer and I barely have any breakouts!</li>
      <li>This is the first scrub I have used that actually reduced the size of my pores.</li>
      <li>I use a few other phenomenal face products from Burts that work well, but this one isn&#x27;t worth your money.</li>
      <li>I prefer small abundant gritty stuffs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this facial scrub does a good job exfoliating and smells pleasant it caused my face to breakout horribly whenever I used it.  </li>
      <li>The grains are far larger than that of St. Ives and really it just feels like they are rolling between my fingers and the skin</li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural exfoliating scrub, trying to get away from the synthetic polyethylene/polypropylene microbeads that can hurt the ecosystem.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the 2 weeks, my acne (even the cystic ones) was almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>product will make your face feel greasy, but this can be reduced by rinsing thoroughly and drying completely with a</li>
      <li>It is way too early to determine if this will help my acne, but I like the way my face</li>
      <li>For me, at first it was like what is this strange smell, and then it became an addiction.</li>
      <li>As far as it being oily, it is.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>And this is such a small bottle for more money than the jar of St. Ives.</li>
      <li>Burt’s Bees Deep Pore Scrub with Peach &amp; Willow Bark is a creamy white face wash with large pieces of exfoliating peach stone.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like it, so I have tried it multiple times with the same result every time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the long run, even after the first few positive results, it&#x27;s going to ruin the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin apparently needs this intensive exfoliation</li>
      <li>It is creamy with large, sharp grains.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, my face will feel dry, but it usually goes away, leaving clean, soft skin.</li>
      <li>I have had moderate acne for 15 years and have not yet found a product that will get rid of it completely (except when I was on Accutane, which I got off of and acne came back the next year).</li>
      <li>Exfoliating granules are too large, too few in number in the tube to actually scrub all areas as you clean, and too sharp as I have literally put two small holes in my face after normal scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure not everyone has this problem, but I read other reviewers saying the same thing, so at least I&#x27;m not alone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The grains in this scrub are far too large and too sharp, making it a pretty uncomfortable and ineffective product.</li>
    <li> Burt’s Bees Deep Pore Scrub with Peach &amp; Willow Bark is a creamy white face wash with large pieces of exfoliating peach stone. The pieces of peach stone are on a larger and rougher side, yet, the face wash feels moisturizing while massaging it in and leaves skin feeling moisturized, rather than dry. Also, I never feel any irritation, even though the beads aren&#x27;t tiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product everyday and always apply a moisturizer before going to bed. My skin is oily, so k and acne-prone, so using a scrub is a must, otherwise, I start getting spots, especially on my jawline area. This stuff has worked magic, I rarely get any skin problem now! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling to keep my cystic acne under control for the past four years. I have used countless products, including Proactiv, which made my acne even worse. I have extremely sensitive skin, so things like Benzoyl Peroxide make my skin burn and cause more breakouts. My skin is also extremely oily, so finding a product that can keep that under control is also difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when I tell you that this product has worked miracles for my skin. The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t like it at all. It made my face feel like a grease pit. However, this greasy feeling subsided after rinsing thoroughly and drying with a towel. Also, this product balances the natural moisture of your skin, so if you are going to moisturize, use a light, oil-free formula. The next morning, ALL of my acne started to diminish, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I kept using the scrub, only once a day for 2 more weeks. By the end of the 2 weeks, my acne (even the cystic ones) was almost completely gone. Everyone I know has complimented me on the dramatic change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that has ever worked for me! I still can&#x27;t believe that after years of searching and trying so many products that produce no results, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works. Try this product, you will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will make your face feel greasy, but this can be reduced by rinsing thoroughly and drying completely with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product DAILY, if you miss a day you will start breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have moderate to severe acne, use this product twice a day. If you have mild acne or sensitive skin, use this product once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a difference right after you use it for the first time!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the St. Ives Apricot Scrub that I had been using previously.  I was looking for a more natural scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this facial scrub does a good job exfoliating and smells pleasant it caused my face to breakout horribly whenever I used it.  I have medium tone skin that gets somewhat greasy in the summer and is prone to light breakouts.  When I use this product the next day I break out just a ton. I really wanted to like it, so I have tried it multiple times with the same result every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself does what it advertises, but it is just too harsh for me.  I am going back to using the [[ASIN:B00005IBW0 St. Ives Apricot Scrub, Gentle, Sensitive Skin, 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 6)]] for Sensitive Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution those with sensitive skin against using this product, or maybe at least get a sample somewhere first.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in a Burt&#x27;s Bees sampler for christmas. I have had moderate acne for 15 years and have not yet found a product that will get rid of it completely (except when I was on Accutane, which I got off of and acne came back the next year). This scrub started to show an improvement in my acne within 2 days. I was surprised because it feels greasy when scrubbing it on and rinsing it off, but after I use a toner after the scrub, my face feels clean and moisturized. Has not gotten rid of my acne, but helps it enough to where I purchased the full size.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was in desperate need of an exfoliator since my Cure Aqua Gel Samples ran out and i wasn&#x27;t going to pay $42 for a bottle even though it was and AWESOME exfoliator. So I went to my sisters room and stole this scrub (let&#x27;s keep that on the hush hush). She wasn&#x27;t using it anymore because she said it made her face feel sticky, but I wanted to try anyway because it smelt nice and it was 98% organic! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this product it felt nice as I massaged my face, but when I rinsed it off, my face felt sticky, and not as clean as I wanted it to, resulting in washing my face with a cleanser. So today I decided to mix some of this exfoliator with my Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser since my cleanser didn&#x27;t have any properties to help my acne. After the mixed wash, my face felt clean, hydrated, and SO SOFT!!!!! It is way too early to determine if this will help my acne, but I like the way my face felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Mix this (in your hands not in the bottle) with your favorite cleanser that you know will clean your face well, and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product. It claims that it clears skin, but really it makes it worse. It smells nice, but when you use it, it feels like you&#x27;re putting sludge on your face. There are so many oils in it that it can only be good for someone with incredibly dry skin. It makes my face break out terribly. There are much better scrubs out there on the market.</li>
    <li> I have a sever form of acne called nodulocystic acne caused by a underlining medical condition (basically, an imbalance of hormones).  All of my acne since I was 12 (I&#x27;m 24) has composed of hard, painful bumps that form under the skin between 2 days and 1 week before surfacing and usually results in white-heads that \\&quot;pop\\&quot; on their own and leave deep rolling scars and red marks for months or years afterwards.  This form of acne is VERY painful, scars like none other, and is very difficult to treat, even if the underlining cause is addressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been addressing the underlining cause for about 8 months now, but until about 2 months ago nothing was helping to relieve the immediate acne or prevent future acne.  When I first started using this apricot scrub twice a day, my skin broke out a little more but the texture was much better and I noticed my acne went away faster.  After about 2 weeks, I started noticing that I had fewer marks and less acne, and now, 2 months in, I&#x27;ve noticed the texture of my skin has improved, I am in more controle of my acne, the tone of my skin is improved, and with the help of a scar-removal serum, my acne scars are finally starting to clear up significantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ran out of the apricot scrub and started using burt&#x27;s bees acne scrub; it&#x27;s not as good in my opinion.  It has a lot of grape see oil and, unless you spend a lot more time scrubbing, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.  As soon as I&#x27;m done with this tube, I&#x27;m grabbing another apricot scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keep in mind the effects of the apricot scrub on my skin may not nessecarily have the same effect on yours, but if it can help someone who&#x27;s skin is as bad as mine, it&#x27;s totally worth a shot.  Just remember to give it more than 2 weeks to work the magic.</li>
    <li> This product is just wonderful! I am a 25 year old female with very sensitive, dry skin that suffers from occasional acne, sometimes cystic. Since using this (it&#x27;s been about 4 months now) my skin has become so much softer and I barely have any breakouts! It also smells wonderful! My one tip is to not scrub it into your skin that much, though, as doing so irritated my skin. Just use it as you would a regular wash, it \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; your face enough when you wash it off.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling oily and gross. I&#x27;ll stick with St. Ives Apricot Scrub, TYVM.</li>
    <li> I first used this stuff in December and in cleared my face up. Unfortunately, when I ran out I was unable to purchase more so I had to use a different face wash. Of course, my face immediately broke out and for some reason I didn&#x27;t buy this stuff again until mid-May. That being said, my skin is now on its way to being beautiful again. My skin apparently needs this intensive exfoliation (it it a little rough for some people) because my acne clears up as soon as I use this.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin soooo smooth and it smells like HEAVEN. I love love love this stuff and will honestly not consider ever using anything else. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all and I follow up with a simple toner to finish my routine. So easy and so worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural exfoliating scrub, trying to get away from the synthetic polyethylene/polypropylene microbeads that can hurt the ecosystem.  This one from Burt&#x27;s Bees smells lovely, but is too heavy.  Even worse, the granules are too large and sparse to be of much use as an exfoliating scrub. Back to St. Ives, whose scrub is closer to my favorite synthetic microbead scrubs from Aveeno and Olay.</li>
    <li> This not a really good product as you think&lt;br /&gt;This product is considered too greasy&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is to greasy or oily it makes you skin break out&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin this wont be much of a problem&lt;br /&gt;But for those people that have acne prone skin or oily skin this may be a problem</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scrub. Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> It is creamy with large, sharp grains. I&#x27;ll be blunt. It&#x27;s not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it&#x27;s creamy, yet as you rub it in, you can feel the grains dig deep into your pores. You actually feel the cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for spots where my pores are big and get dirty fast. So I use a regular cleanser, and then I use this. This means my forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. I pour some on my finger, and scoop little by little and rub it in those spots for extra deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wipe it off with a wet towel, because I don&#x27;t trust my hands to wipe off everything since there&#x27;s no coarseness in my fingers. Then I rinse my face, and wipe dry with another towel. Afterwards, my face will feel dry, but it usually goes away, leaving clean, soft skin. I have normal to oily skin, so I don&#x27;t worry about drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it feels, the way it smells, and the way it works for me. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but it is for me.</li>
    <li> I normally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products - but I hate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I had only used St. Ives peach scrub. Once I learned their new parent company, Unilver tested on animals, I went looking for another product and I can only compare Burt&#x27;s version to the St. Ives version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell awful. It smells like the inside of a new house being built - the smell of plaster and primer coatings of paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The constancy is too much. The cream is far too thick. I want to exfoliate, not apply a thick layer of cream on me. The grains are far larger than that of St. Ives and really it just feels like they are rolling between my fingers and the skin I&#x27;m trying to exfoliate. It just feels like I&#x27;m rolling a tiny spiky ball along my body which has never actually made my skin feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing off it just feels like I pricked my skin and slathered on a thick cream. The smell of plaster and primer faintly remain. And this is such a small bottle for more money than the jar of St. Ives.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! :) I love it. My skin feels really soft! :)&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Leaves a heavy, waxy film on my face no matter how much I rinse.  I feel like I need to wash my face after washing my face!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Love the exfoliating texture. My skin responds well to product.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin so it&#x27;s very oily. When I use this product on my face it becomes more oily. This product CLOG PORES. people with ACNE prone oily skin PLEASE STAY AWAY :-(  THIS PRODUCT IS FULL OF OIL ND GREASE. EW</li>
    <li> I love burts bees the best.</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this product is the scent. You know, there&#x27;s a reason why The Body Shop changed their old tea tree exfoliate from having crushed avocado pits in them; It&#x27;s much too harsh for the skin and causes microtears. This scrub has the same situation; It&#x27;s too harsh and abrasive. In the long run, even after the first few positive results, it&#x27;s going to ruin the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with oily and acne prone skin, I understand how we want to get overzealous and grab the harshest thing possible, but please guys-- You don&#x27;t need this. You need something a lot more gentle. It&#x27;s going to destroy your face.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and the service was great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times. Your face feels oily, but it works!</li>
    <li> love this product. i love facial scrubs because i never really feel like my skin&#x27;s really clean unless i have a scrub.</li>
    <li> I was also wary of this product after reading reviews. However, after 2 uses my skin feels smoother and my pores look smaller! This is the first scrub I have used that actually reduced the size of my pores. Cons: the scrub IS abrasive and a little uncomfortable to use, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin. It does leave skin moisturized, so I could see it feeling to oily for someone with oily skin. But for my dry skin, it was great!</li>
    <li> I used this stuff before and my skin broke out. I was much younger and didn&#x27;t know for sure if this caused the problem. Now, almost ten years later, I have tried it again because I ran out of my usual scrub. It is making me break out so bad! Not just normal little zits, I&#x27;m talking big, red, deep zits. That hurt! I haven&#x27;t had acne in a while either. I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product. And I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates well at all. It has big pieces or gritty stuff--and not a lot of them. I prefer small abundant gritty stuffs. As far as it being oily, it is. It leaves a weird film. I thought it was normal, so I just washed my face after I used it. It still sucks when it gives me zits. I&#x27;m sure not everyone has this problem, but I read other reviewers saying the same thing, so at least I&#x27;m not alone.</li>
    <li> I have skin that tends to be on the drier side and I love this scrub, leaves your face feeling moisturized. I wish the kernel pieces were a little smaller, but I over all I&#x27;m into it.</li>
    <li> This is good, and the beads do a great job. However, afterwards, my face feels a little greasy (?). I prefer the results I get with St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub</li>
    <li> Love how it cleans my face</li>
    <li> Was looking for a more natural alternative to the St Ives-type of apricot exfoliating scrub, but this definitely isn&#x27;t it. Exfoliating granules are too large, too few in number in the tube to actually scrub all areas as you clean, and too sharp as I have literally put two small holes in my face after normal scrubbing. I use a few other phenomenal face products from Burts that work well, but this one isn&#x27;t worth your money.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Goes on nice. Feels like I&#x27;m washing my face in glass shards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seriously hurts. Does anyone else feel that way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love hurts bees but maybe ground the peach pit a little more so it&#x27;s a little less abrasive.</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing. The smell is very bizarre. For me, at first it was like what is this strange smell, and then it became an addiction. Cleans great and has a terrific smell. Strange but terrific</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  It does not work at all!!!  There are better scrubs out there.</li>
