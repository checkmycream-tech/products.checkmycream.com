      <li>I love it from the first use you see u face</li>
      <li>I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>like to apply this right out of the shower while my skin is still damp and lightly smooth over my face and neck.</li>
      <li>The product is quickly working on this.  </li>
      <li>I am going to keep this review super</li>
      <li>It dries up quickly and leaves streaks of the orange lotion.</li>
      <li>SO well I always lightly massage it in, so that it absorbs and really soaks in!</li>
      <li>Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away.</li>
      <li>This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt</li>
      <li>great everyday lotion.</li>
      <li>and I love how soft my skin is.</li>
      <li>I love how creamy and soft</li>
      <li>I bought this product without any discount offered to me and I am leaving my own personal review that nobody asked me to write here.</li>
      <li>That weirded me out at first, but it does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any orange on you.  </li>
      <li>This leaves my skin very soft, smooth, and somehow manages to keep the oil at bay.  </li>
      <li>All of Instanatural&#x27;s products are very high quality and provide results, including this one!</li>
      <li>REALLY like this lotion!</li>

      <li>Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that they had send me an email with instructions and tips for each product, and the fact that they were offering a refund if not satisfied.</li>
      <li>What I got was this this bright orange thick cream, my first though was &amp;</li>
      <li>% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil</li>
      <li>I have found the key is to apply lightly, letting it absorb before putting my makeup on.</li>
      <li>Very hydrating with a citrusy tingle.  </li>
      <li>Or did I use too much?</li>
      <li>It left my face really light and moisteurized.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found this company searching for skin care products to help with wrinkles that I have started to notice, as well as sun spots. I had tried other products for different companies with no real results until I stumbled upon InstaNatural. I ordered the skin clearing serum, and the night time moisturizer as my first order and started seeing results instantly!! I loved the fact that they had send me an email with instructions and tips for each product, and the fact that they were offering a refund if not satisfied. After I had been ordering those products regularly, they started sending me email invitations to try some of their other products for review, and of course I accepted because I absolutely love the ones I had ordered. I am not going to go on and on about what this product has in it or the benefits of each ingredient because all that info is in the in the description and I feel that if someone is really looking to try a product , they have already read that information in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin brightening lotion- I can honestly say that of all the products that I have tried of InstaNatural, this one is my favorite so far! I apply this lotion in the morning after my shower, and my skin instantly looks brighter, smoother and healthier! I love the citrus smell and the softness that you skin gets after applying.I am also a huge fan of glycolic acid due to my sudden onset of hormonal breakouts and oily skin that I have now began to get for the first time since going into my 30&#x27;s:(. Glycolic acid helps dry out my skin and reduce and contain breakouts so having it in a daily lotion is an extra bonus! The only bummer about this product is the coloring that can be left behind on linens, so I would suggest applying minimally and patting skin with a cotton pad after to get rid of any access lotion on skin. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten and freshen their skin. Also for those whom may have oily, acne prone skin because of the glycolic acid ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedbackhe glycolic acid ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!  I have bouts with perigo simplex on my skin.  I look like a have chicken pox.  When the lesions slowly dry up and go away, I am stuck with brown scars.  Some scars are raised.  After a few applications, the raised scars are gone and the brown color has begun to blend into my undamaged skin.  I am, also, using it on eczema on my shin.  It is beet red due to a wet spring and lots of mold spores in the air.  The product is quickly working on this.  What a blessing!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling very soft. I use it every morning and I&#x27;ve been noticing a difference in my skin in the past week. It is definitely more radiant.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to experience advertised results, I definitely notice softer skin in just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve mentioned in another review, the company clearly values customer service.  They deserve their reputation for quality products and service.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating with a citrusy tingle.  Frown lines and dark spot are softer afterb1 month of use.</li>
    <li> Instanatural Skin Brightening Lotion is made in the USA in a FDA certified facility! This lotion provides antioxidants, and nourishment to help skin  be brighter in appearance! It helps with wrinkles fine lines, elasticity, skin spots, dryness and skin tone! This lotion comes in a 1.7 FL OZ pump bottle. I love the packaging on this product, it is attractive and that alone made me want to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this Skin Brightening Lotion:&lt;br /&gt;- It only takes a half to one pump to cover my whole face, neck, and chest VERY well!&lt;br /&gt;- Since it covers my skin SO well I always lightly massage it in, so that it absorbs and really soaks in! This lotion glides over my skin and feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;-This lotion will last me a while, since it does not take a lot to use!&lt;br /&gt;- I love how creamy and soft the texture of this is!&lt;br /&gt;- This lotion is orange, and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;- My skin instantly looks healthy, hydrated, moisturized, smooth, and VERY bright and soft!&lt;br /&gt;- After a few days use my skin is silky, firm, has a natural glow, and fine lines are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin has a natural flush to it, and when combined with this lotion my skin is looking visibly vibrant and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;- No more uneven skin tone for me! After using this lotion my skin is SO soft to the touch, my husband even commented on how soft my cheeks felt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY like this lotion! I have replaced my regular daytime moisturizer with this one, and my skin looks amazing all the time now! All of Instanatural&#x27;s products are very high quality and provide results, including this one! I am very happy with the results I have got within just a few days! I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** I received this item to try for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion! ALL opinions are my own and MY OWN ONLY!!! I would never recommend a product I wouldn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use myself! *****</li>
    <li> I  been using Vitamin C products for a year now. Some I do have a reaction/ rash to  it. But  this one is quite very good. One important factor  for Vitamin C is you need to use with a  SPF . My BB Cream has  Spf so I am all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so much brighter  after  2 weeks. love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given an chance to try this with  discount, am very happy. My opinion is all mine and honest/</li>
    <li> Omg I been trying this for 3 days mornings m nite I love it from the first use you see u face clean m clear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a reviewer, aside from the fact I spend too much of my day ordering anything that looks remotely beneficial from Amazon. But alas, I found something that works. I love every Instanatural product I&#x27;ve tried. This toner works wonders post chemical peel too. My skin is glowing! My boyfriend, who hardly notices when I cut my hair, has told me multiple times how nice my skin looks since I switch to instanatural products. I have no complaints. This lotion evens out your skin.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this lotion. Packaged in a pump bottle of 1.7 ounces. When I first opened this and pumped the first pump out, I was expecting a white lotion. What I got was this this bright orange thick cream, my first though was &amp;#34;what is this?&amp;#34;. I rubbed that little bit on my arm and instantly thought &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;! It instantly melted to a thick serum consistency and just absorbed fast with no left over oily feel or residue left, it felt very nice. No smell at all, and no irritation. I have used it 3 days now morning and night and it is one of the best i have ever used, including cheap to very high end cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has all the great ingredients you need for healthy skin. Vitamin C,  Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Glycolic Acid, Alpha Arbutin &amp; CoQ10, a lot of other moisturizers. lemon, apple, palm oil, argan oil. This would be great for anti-aging, skin lightening, collagen production, firming, fine lines and wrinkles, bags under eyes. It is the closest fountain of youth I have found in a bottle in the shortest time. In just 3 days I can see a big difference in the tone and texture of my skin. It is the smoothest it has ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make up goes on easily over it, cruelty free, made in the USA. I would highly recommend this  lotion to anyone with any skin type, even oily and extremely dry, very lightweight but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no monitory compensation and I am not required to give a good review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way.

    <li> Great product!! Love this brand and love their customer service. 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. After more than weeks seen the result.</li>
    <li> Nice smell to the lotion, smooth and silky going on the face.</li>
    <li> re: Vitamin C Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;10% Glycolic Acid Cream&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Skin Bfightneing Serum&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great line of products. I created my own routine with them and it&#x27;s working out great. Look forward to sampling other items. I used the Vitamin C Cleanser twice a day; morning and night. It left my face really light and moisteurized. The lather is quite leathery so it does not drip so I also used it as a five minute mask. I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning. The jojoba oil has a trace of scent; some companies remove the scent completely, but it&#x27;s good it smells some, that way I know what jojoba smells like, or kind of, since I&#x27;ve never seen jojobas up close. Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the orange color of the 10% Glycolic Acid Cream, until I read the &amp;#34;tips and directions&amp;#34; email, which stated that&#x27;s the color it&#x27;s supposed to be. my concern was I didn&#x27;t wanna look like I got a fake tan. Then I read the part about the sun exposure, at which point I decided to rinse it out after ten minutes. Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away. This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I see &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; on a product I think of the crazy celebrities that bleach their skin to truly ugly and quickly noticeable results, that act like they look great and nothing&#x27;s wrong. So I approached the &amp;#34;Skin Brightening&amp;#34; line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use. The Skin Brightening Scrub I used twice a week, and the Skin Brightening Serum and the Skin Britghtening Lotion every other day, twice a day. because I have recurring acne I found the scrub a bit strong, though it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum. The lotion also has a trace of citrus scent. In combination, I found the line to help recede the acne noticeably after each use. As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum? Or did I use too much? a little goes a long way on the lotion: the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products. For the time I&#x27;ve been using them, I did find these to work really well for me. it could be that my face had hit a &amp;#34;product plateau&amp;#34; and using new ones gave it a little something extra? Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this few days ago and let me write a review regarding its consistency (since I cannot write a review yet about its effectiveness). I don&#x27;t like the consistency of this product. It&#x27;s very hard to apply on the face. It dries up quickly and leaves streaks of the orange lotion. I hope they will improve it so its easier to apply on the face evenly. I&#x27;m giving two stars for very fast delivery and the hope that it will still work well in spite of its bad consistency. Will update soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So I ended up returning this. After a while I hated this product more and more. It dries on top of your skin like a sticky orangey mask-like film. It says on the label that it can be used under makeup. NO! Unless you want a dark orangey mask makeup. So I did not have the patience to wait if this thing really works. Consistency is very bad and it&#x27;s not true that it can be used under makeup. And all these reviews posted because people are given discount are kind sketchy for me. SO... I bought this product without any discount offered to me and I am leaving my own personal review that nobody asked me to write here.</li>
    <li> note: this lotion is orange.  That weirded me out at first, but it does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any orange on you.  ;)  It&#x27;s a nice texture and works well</li>
    <li> Love it. great everyday lotion.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is a great addition to my skin care routine. I have serious acne scars and this moisturizer has really helped in reducing the scars, and this is my third week of using it,the scars are not totally gone but they have faded considerebly and I am really happy. I use it together with InstaNatural skin brightening serum. These are natural products so it&#x27;s a gradual process but at least I know I not harming my face with harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I use the tiner prior to applying lotion and absolutely love how great it makes my skin feel. At the end of a 12 hour shift i am not greasy/oily. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was orange which I&#x27;m ok with but it was sticky when applying and sometimes even when it dries. Didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Another great lotion from this company.  I alternate this one with a different one each evening - I always look forward to the faint scent of citrus (it&#x27;s not long lasting scent, and not strong at all!).  The first time I tried it, I had to laugh because I pumped out WAY too much (may not even take a half pump for face/neck/chest), it built up on my eyebrows and did leave an orange tint to my face, but it was my fault - so, small amount! I went the entire day with no makeup, and to my surprise, in the evening, my skin was not oily!  This leaves my skin very soft, smooth, and somehow manages to keep the oil at bay.  I do use it in the evening in case I miss a spot while massaging into my skin, personal choice and nothing that would keep me from buying this again - the ingredients and quality outweigh that minor concern.  Definitely recommend the entire line of the Skin Brightening!  My worry lines are disappearing after less than a month of using this line!</li>
    <li> Luv it, so far I have used this lotion in the morning instead of the vit c serum. I luv the result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This opinion is base on my honest and unbiased issue based on the discounted price from instanatural</li>
    <li> use it every day. it is smooth and light.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Skin Brightening Lotion has a fantastic blend of  Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Glycolic Acid, Alpha Arbutin and  CoQ10 it is produced in an  FDA registered facility in the USA. This is an impressive list of  antioxidants and anti-aging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I like to apply this right out of the shower while my skin is still damp and lightly smooth over my face and neck. I have found the key is to apply lightly, letting it absorb before putting my makeup on. My skin has some hyperpigmentation from being outdoors, regardless of my faithful use of sunscreen. After using for just a few weeks, my skin is becoming smoother, brighter and I love how soft my skin is. I have even recommended to a friend after she commented on how great my skin looked. I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased​ review.</li>
    <li> This stuff has caused me pimples. I use their other skin aging lotion just love it. I will be returning all their brightening products.</li>
    <li> Great product... Highly recommend..</li>
    <li> Wonderful on my skin -- face, arms, anywhere I have skin discolorations. Have even noticed the small broken veins at the front of my cheeks are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this  lotion - For my  summer -  morning routine is great. I use this under my BB cream wit h SPF which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I love the vitamin C it help me with  the marks.Will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a  chance to tried this with discount.My opinion is honest and unbaised.</li>
    <li> I am going to keep this review super simple.&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer its great as a skin brightener I am not sold at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame I have to give this product a lukewarm review because I am a HUGE fan of InstaNatural products, but I have to be honest. This is not a product that would be a staple in my skin care regimen. A better skin brightener would be some of the serums I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
