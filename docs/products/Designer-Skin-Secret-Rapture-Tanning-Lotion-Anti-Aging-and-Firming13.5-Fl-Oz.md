      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been cultivating a lovely vampiric pallor.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>okay though.</li>
      <li>I absolutely, love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>, nothing can replace this lotion for me, and i buy enough tanning lotions to know that this is the best!!!!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
      <li>This is a light vanilla smell and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>love the firming properties.</li>
      <li>I have only been tanning four times and my tan is looking awesome</li>
      <li>is the better choice from this line.</li>
      <li>The smell is OK before you tan, but then after you tan it enhances the smell of cooking skin</li>
      <li>i love this tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>It has a wonderful scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a strange smell after use.</li>
      <li>The smell is incredible, especially after a tanning session.</li>
      <li>Love how it makes my feel silky smooth and gives me the color I want.</li>
      <li>As far as the lotion goes, it works great -</li>
      <li>Good lotion, has a nice smell to it; it&#x27;s not gross smelling like most tanning lotions after you&#x27;re done tanning.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells good and it&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
      <li>I stray from fruity smells in tan lotions - this one is a nice change for me - I suggest smell it or try a sample first if you are unsure.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s silky and made my skin silky as well and smells really great not only before but also after tanning.</li>
      <li>but this lotion gave me such great color that I didn&#x27;t even need it.</li>
      <li>i bought this because it was cheap, theres no bronzers in it.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and light, not like most tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Good stuff especially for the price :)</li>
      <li>I think it is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>If you are just starting out tanning, then this is a good lotion for beginners...</li>
      <li>Even if it smells good in the bottle, it always smells different once its been on.</li>
      <li>a bonus - skin feels super soft and the color is a nice gradual.</li>
      <li>Not only was the price great, but I went tanning today and this lotion really made a difference.</li>
      <li>I look forward to next time and am a repeat customer for sure!</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion, very moisturizing and not too greasy, but I noticed absolutely no difference in my tan and neither did any of my friends.</li>
      <li>smells nice, could actually work out after and not worry about leaving a funk in the air.</li>
      <li>It was not that great, the smell was nothing special, and it was super hard to get the lotion out...</li>
      <li>Smells very much like warm vanilla sugar with a tiny hint of musk (maybe).</li>
      <li>My second favorite tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>so I cannot agree with first reviewer that ATO smells like modeling clay.</li>
      <li>today for the first time.</li>
      <li>The other one I kept using that liked before trying this one does not have the anti-aging and firming like this one does.</li>
      <li>Only thing I&#x27;d change would be adding more bronzer, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to get you very tan, even after a month of going every day.</li>
      <li>this is a nice natural deep tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>You skin feels super supple and soft after routine use.</li>
      <li>- I really like that aspect of the product - it does what it says it is going to do.  </li>
      <li>really?  </li>
      <li>in the end, I wouldnt really recommend this item.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a hard-core tanner, so I can&#x27;t really say how much of a difference this product makes in that regard.  </li>
      <li>I really like this lotion because you don&#x27;t have the after tan smell at all.</li>
      <li>I have used other tanning lotions and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>it cant just be short and sweet?</li>
      <li>It does a good job moisturizing, too, and isn&#x27;t thick and heavy like so many tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>cant live without this !  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell is quite pleasant and not excessively glamourous (read \\&quot;not gay\\&quot; variety of unisex).&lt;br /&gt;However, ATO (after tan odor) is very odd, like a modeling clay mixed with something</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
      <li>Designer Skin Secret Rapture Tanning Lotion,  just like their other lotions,  smells and feels great!  </li>
      <li>It gives me that nice lasting tan while helping with the added ingredients to firm my skin.</li>
      <li>However, it is just a basic lotion nothing super crazy special, but it gets the job done and leaves your skin feeling very smooth after.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good lotion, has a nice smell to it; it&#x27;s not gross smelling like most tanning lotions after you&#x27;re done tanning. However, it is just a basic lotion nothing super crazy special, but it gets the job done and leaves your skin feeling very smooth after. Good stuff especially for the price :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!It gave me a wonderful glow!It also smells good. It leaves no streaking and no orange tent, I have been using it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> Gotta admit, I&#x27;m addicted to the scent - I love it! It also makes my skin very smooth - any added tanning effect is a bonus!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion as a step 2; however, it performs like step 1, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is quite pleasant and not excessively glamourous (read \\&quot;not gay\\&quot; variety of unisex).&lt;br /&gt;However, ATO (after tan odor) is very odd, like a modeling clay mixed with something hospital-ish.&lt;br /&gt;No pronounced effect after tanning session, even 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: good for developing a base tan, not good if you want to get any further.</li>
    <li> As a Designer Skin fanatic, I looove this lotion! I prefer lotion with bronzer because I am fair skinned and I like the \\&quot;boost\\&quot;, but this lotion gave me such great color that I didn&#x27;t even need it. Plus, it&#x27;s silky and made my skin silky as well and smells really great not only before but also after tanning. A little of this lotion goes a LONG way and is well worth the money. I really liked it!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion, very moisturizing and not too greasy, but I noticed absolutely no difference in my tan and neither did any of my friends. I am a beginner tanner and this lotion did nothing to build my color. I was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used other tanning lotions and this one is my favorite. The other one I kept using that liked before trying this one does not have the anti-aging and firming like this one does. It gives me that nice lasting tan while helping with the added ingredients to firm my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. The smell is incredible, especially after a tanning session. You skin feels super supple and soft after routine use. I&#x27;ve tried other brands before, but after a while the smell gets sickening.</li>
    <li> great lotion for a rookie tanner. love the firming properties. not oompa loompa, but a nice tan that i recieved complements on. color faded in two weeks. had to maintain tanning at least 3 x a week. i am not into the crazy tanning products i have tried in the past. this is a nice natural deep tanning lotion. smells nice, could actually work out after and not worry about leaving a funk in the air.</li>
    <li> Smells very much like warm vanilla sugar with a tiny hint of musk (maybe). Have not noticed ATO afterwards so I cannot agree with first reviewer that ATO smells like modeling clay. This product has anti aging and skin firming properties in it and that is always a bonus - skin feels super soft and the color is a nice gradual. Great for intermediate tanners - I always love \\&quot;designer skin\\&quot; line of products\\&quot;. I stray from fruity smells in tan lotions - this one is a nice change for me - I suggest smell it or try a sample first if you are unsure. My second favorite tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I think that this lotions smells great, but thats about it.  It is hard to squeeze the lotion out when rushing to apply lotion in the short few minutes of time the tanning salons give you to get naked and lotioned up, before the tanning bed starts up.  The bottle design is HORRIBLE because you cannot squeeze the bottle with just one hand; I needed both hands to squeeze the smallest amount out of it, and I am no weakling.  The performance of the lotion itself is basically meant for developing a base tan.  If you are just starting out tanning, then this is a good lotion for beginners...that is, if you can squeeze the lotion out of the crappy bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a hard-core tanner, so I can&#x27;t really say how much of a difference this product makes in that regard.  I DO know that whenever I apply it, my husband can&#x27;t keep his hands off me!  The vanilla smell makes him crazy,  and I&#x27;ve even had people stop me to ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  It does a good job moisturizing, too, and isn&#x27;t thick and heavy like so many tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I reviewed lotions before deciding to purchase secret rapture and decided to purchase it online even though the girls at my salon \\&quot;strongly encouraged\\&quot; me not to. Not only was the price great, but I went tanning today and this lotion really made a difference. I saw a dramatic increase in the depth of my tan and there was very little ATO. My skin felt moisturized and wonderful. I love designer skin products to begin with, but secret rapture definitely won me over. I ordered this lotion on Tuesday and received it on Friday with a sample packet included. Great product and a great company to order from</li>
    <li> As far as the lotion goes, it works great - I have only been tanning four times and my tan is looking awesome - I really like that aspect of the product - it does what it says it is going to do.  However, I do not know what everyone else is smelling because what I smell is not good - for a lack of a better description - the product smells like afrosheen - it gives me a headache. I don&#x27;t know if I will buy the product again - I think it works wonderfully but the smell - yuck!  Maybe I will see if it comes in a different scent!</li>
    <li> The smell is OK before you tan, but then after you tan it enhances the smell of cooking skin and I hate it.  I feel like I can&#x27;t go in public after using this lotion and tanning.</li>
    <li> I have 12 years tanning experience and I love this lotion! It smells fresh and light, not like most tanning lotion. I always notice it accelerates my tan. It isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes a long way because it moisturizes so well. It does not break out my skin. This is a great accelerator for beginners or advanced tanners!</li>
    <li> I revived this product and they had just put normal white lotion in the bottle and replaced what was suppose to be rapture tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and it&#x27;s very lightweight. I did experience a little after tan smell though. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion because you don&#x27;t have the after tan smell at all. It leaves a very nice and mild vanilla fragrance. Love how it makes my feel silky smooth and gives me the color I want.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. It does smell like warm vanilla sugar! I think it is a good lotion to get a base tan but I don&#x27;t feel as though you can get really dark on it! I think it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> i bought this because it was cheap, theres no bronzers in it. its basically just an accelerator for if you are just starting off tanning. i&#x27;ve been tanning for months and this didn&#x27;t do anything, actually just made my tan decrease. smells good though.</li>
    <li> This lotion didnt get me too dark... it smells okay though. in the end, I wouldnt really recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion. It smells good and is not too oily. It works good too. I would recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> smells good and not sticky or greasy. does the job described. 9 more words required for review...really?  it cant just be short and sweet?</li>
    <li> Designer Skin Secret Rapture Tanning Lotion,  just like their other lotions,  smells and feels great!  I love this brand of lotion!  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for novice/beginner tanners. There is no DHA in it, but it does have a nice shimmer when you apply it. This is a great lotions for all skin types/tones. It builds a great tan once you&#x27;re done with the bottle and you don&#x27;t have to worry about any bronzers when applying. It has a sugary, vanilla scent, but it does smell a lil weird after you tan. Another bonus is its anti-aging and firming components, leaves your skin feeling tighter and smoother feeling. As always, don&#x27;t apply to the face and enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely, love this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  It smells wonderful and has given me a nice, even tan.  It keeps the moisture in your skin even in the hottest and driest climate.  Very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just like to add something to my review which I find very important....I have used this product throughout the summer and have NOT had one sunspot appear. I stopped sitting in the sun i in previous years due to sunspots appearing, but since I found and used this product, it&#x27;s anti aging does truly live up to it&#x27;s name. Thank goodness for this product as I don&#x27;t look pale anymore!</li>
    <li> Works great.....and makes yourskin feel wonderful, reduces dryness caused by exposure in tanning beds, and increases color and helps even tanning process.</li>
    <li> I REALLY Appreciated the great customer service! They deserve their well-earned ranking on 95%+!!!!I would definitely do business again! I look forward to next time and am a repeat customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and the feel of this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. Only thing I&#x27;d change would be adding more bronzer, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to get you very tan, even after a month of going every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body lotions in the past (usually bought from the tanning salon) and they all work awesome, but the smell stays on you forever. Even if it smells good in the bottle, it always smells different once its been on. This is a light vanilla smell and it smells amazing. Loved it.</li>
    <li> cant live without this !  a necessity for my tanning needs, nothing can replace this lotion for me, and i buy enough tanning lotions to know that this is the best!!!! from the results to the smell , which is sugar cookie/vanilla scented. I love this and you will too !!!!!</li>
    <li> It was not that great, the smell was nothing special, and it was super hard to get the lotion out...ill pass on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to use on our Cruise. I got a beautiful tan with it and my skin didn&#x27;t dry out like it usually does. I live in a dry climate and need all the moisturizer I can get in a lotion. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Product was good applying to body.. nice smell, smooth application, however; after tanning...STRONG HORRIBLE SMELL OF BURNING SKIN.. Made the entire house smell .. AWFUL!!</li>
    <li> Good lotion for moisturizing your skin.  Not good for bronzing. Will not purchase again, Believe in Me is the better choice from this line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and didn&#x27;t like it at all... The lotion feels slimy on my skin and I just sweated it off in the tanning bed.. Didn&#x27;t work well for me!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this lotion. It has a wonderful scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a strange smell after use. It feels great and leaves your skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I used Designer Skin Secret \\&quot;Rapture\\&quot; today for the first time. I bought it because it doesn&#x27;t have any stains other coloring agent in it. I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple of weeks in a level 3 bed and I was starting to get a bit of color, but after 1 application, I can actually see the difference. I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t tanned in YEARS... so I&#x27;ve been cultivating a lovely vampiric pallor. I have to say... This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Love it. Great price, smells good, good if you break out with the bronzers. No break out or rash. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these lotions increase your tan but they do soften the skin and smell really nice. I like this one because it doesn&#x27;t have self tanner in it, which I hate because it stains your hands and turns you orange after a while. I&#x27;m half Italian and half Irish so in the natural sun I burn a little early in the summer and then tan well. I have found with this lotion even if I don&#x27;t go to the tanning salon for a week or two I don&#x27;t burn. As for anti-aging or firming I don&#x27;t use it often enough to see any of those benefits.</li>
    <li> i love this tanning lotion.  it was just like described and it was very cheap compared to the lotions that salons sell.  i have no complains.</li>
