      <li>great non greasy smelled fresh</li>
      <li>This natural sunscreen is the best I have used yet!  </li>
      <li>I love love love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love the mango-coconutty tropical sent.  </li>
      <li>saying that it is formulated to stay on top of your skin where it needs to stay to work.</li>
      <li>What is not to love about this product?</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>Granted, SPF 45 is probably better for your skin.</li>
      <li>I love Coola sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for a day at the beach, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>Feels super sexy on me.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the ease of the spray sunscreen but it ran out fast</li>
      <li>It smells good and most importantly doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals found in so many of the conventional sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  allergic to most sunscreens but this is very gentle on my skin and its a mild scent.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this sunscreen was the scent.</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s how much it showed even after attempting to vigorously rub it in, and at one point he went to touch my arm and pulled back and said &amp;#34;ew&amp;#34; about the way the sunscreen felt lol.</li>
      <li>It smells AMAZING and goes on without feeling oily and is also parabon free which unlike most sunscreens will not put harsh chemicals on your skin....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply - very spreadable-</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say I love this anymore; not the way I did the first bottle.</li>
      <li>I wish they made a whole line in Mango!!</li>
      <li>It applies easily, smells super yummy and exotic and lasts a long time in my experience.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, not a white coating on your skin, smells nice, does not &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34;up in the container</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve smelled this in a store, and it is supposed to smell fresh and like mango.  </li>
      <li>Yes, you do have to reapply, but with all it&#x27;s positive attributes, who wouldn&#x27;t?!  </li>
      <li>I have bought this sunscreen through amazon several time and this is the only one I have recieved that did NOT smell good.</li>
      <li>It does not seem to rub in very well though and leaves you very white with &#x27;pills&#x27; that stay on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive to sun lotion, but Coola gave me no problems.</li>
      <li>it cost so much</li>
      <li>I still love this product other than that.</li>
      <li>It seems to blend in much better than other natural sunscreens, and the scent is divine!</li>
      <li>You can definitely tell it has been sitting in hot temperatures inside a warehouse somewhere!</li>
      <li>I live in San Diego and have a convertible</li>
      <li>but we live in Hawaii</li>
      <li>My old, dried up bottle, from which I squeezed every drop, still smells better than this new bottle.</li>
      <li>I was still using the first bottle I had purchased which seems to be a completely different formulation.</li>
      <li>and it goes on clear, so</li>
      <li>So at that time I wipe off as much of the white that I can see.</li>
      <li>The 70% organic ingredient is worry-free and a no-brainer for young kids.  </li>
      <li>will be looking for yet another natural sunscreen.</li>
      <li>my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m completely devoted.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works well on my 4 year old too.</li>
      <li>In summary, I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this particular Coola product.</li>
      <li>and I really wouldn&#x27;t choose to wear this all day on the beach since it definitely gives you the white, ghoul look.</li>
      <li>I actually bought this product directly from Coola after reviewing multiple Coola product reviews that said the product sometimes seemed old &amp; dry if bought through Amazon.</li>

<li> so I this may be a factor as my skin is dry.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to rub in and feels very tacky for a long time afterwards.</li>
<li> This made us all appear chalky white, and slightly greasy.</li>
<li> I have tried putting on less, but when it gets wet, it will still get white and drippy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Only 3 stars because this is SO messy.  </li>
<li> When I come back I can literally see the white, thick goop on my face.</li>
<li> /&gt;second, it not good for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m trying to be very careful about the sun on my face.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because it streaks a little</li>
<li> unfortunately Coola doesn&#x27;t let you return products you buy directly from them-</li>
<li> It smelled old and stale.  </li>
<li> Super disappointed because I adore the smell.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m kind of a sunscreen fanatic and this was one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
<li> I run and am usually dripping sweat when I finish.</li>
<li> I have used the SPF 30 in the past, and I thought that was a nicer sunscreen to wear.</li>
<li> So this was pretty much a waste of money (and this is EXPENSIVE sunscreen) because the product is so bad I dont think I would want to wear it anywhere, not even at the beach, and</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s  hard to rub in all the way.</li>
<li> it look like blend well in bare skin, but put foundations, bb cream what ever base makeup after this,&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;finally, after apply this sunscreen, i feel thin film coating my face.</li>
<li> everybody loves it to bad</li>
<li> Sickly.</li>
<li> I hate this.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m really disappointed !!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive to sun lotion, but Coola gave me no problems. Loved the smell and loved the results.</li>
    <li> I wish they made a whole line in Mango!! It smells AMAZING and goes on without feeling oily and is also parabon free which unlike most sunscreens will not put harsh chemicals on your skin....everybody loves it to bad it cost so much but we live in Hawaii and it protects you all day from the sun! TEN STARS if i could...this truly is the best ever!!</li>
    <li> works great and this is the second time I am buying it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Coola Sport! I live in San Diego and have a convertible so I&#x27;m trying to be very careful about the sun on my face. I run and am usually dripping sweat when I finish. Coola lasts thru my runs without dripping in my eyes so I&#x27;m completely devoted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally the mineral sun blocks leave a white cast on your skin but that is not the case with this stuff. I actually prefer this to the sunscreen I bought for daily wear under makeup so the Coola Sport has you covered for whatever you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 2013&lt;br /&gt;When I wrote this review I was still using the first bottle I had purchased which seems to be a completely different formulation. When I opened the new box it had a little note in it saying that it is formulated to stay on top of your skin where it needs to stay to work. Well, it does work but I would only wear it when I&#x27;m heading out for a run. When I come back I can literally see the white, thick goop on my face. I can&#x27;t really say I love this anymore; not the way I did the first bottle. I want to wash it off immediately once I come in and I really wouldn&#x27;t choose to wear this all day on the beach since it definitely gives you the white, ghoul look.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Works great and not greasy on your face.</li>
    <li> I love love love this sunscreen. It smells good and most importantly doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals found in so many of the conventional sunscreens. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> This made us all appear chalky white, and slightly greasy. Sickly. I have used the SPF 30 in the past, and I thought that was a nicer sunscreen to wear. Granted, SPF 45 is probably better for your skin. It&#x27;s fine for a day at the beach, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s lightweight, non greasy, smells great, and is cruelty free!!  What is not to love about this product?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to find a natural sunscreen on the market! It smells fantanstic and feels great. It does not seem to rub in very well though and leaves you very white with &#x27;pills&#x27; that stay on top of the skin. This product, however, is very effective.</li>
    <li> Only 3 stars because this is SO messy.  It leaves a white residue that rubbed off on my daughter&#x27;s wheelchair and required some work to remove.</li>
    <li> Gross. I hate this. It does not dissolve and marks everything white.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve smelled this in a store, and it is supposed to smell fresh and like mango.  This one did not smell anything like it is supposed to smell.  It smelled old and stale.  Unusable, have to return it.  You can definitely tell it has been sitting in hot temperatures inside a warehouse somewhere!</li>
    <li> great non greasy smelled fresh</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this. It doesn&#x27;t blend into your skin at all well. I put it on and about 10 mins later notice white streaks where there hadn&#x27;t been. It also balls up if you rub your skin. Definitely will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love Coola sunscreen. It seems to blend in much better than other natural sunscreens, and the scent is divine! My skin looks moisturized &amp; conditioned; not chalky like with some others.</li>
    <li> This natural sunscreen is the best I have used yet!  It goes on smoothly, not a white coating on your skin, smells nice, does not &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34;up in the container and it provides great coverage.  Even my kids commented on how nice it felt going on the skin...more like a moisturizer.  GREAT stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best water-resistant sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s a sunscreen which does double duty as a moisturizer.  I got it for my fair skinned baby who&#x27;s grown into a wiggling toddler.  It&#x27;s easy to apply - very spreadable- and it goes on clear, so you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time rubbing on a wiggling baby.  The 70% organic ingredient is worry-free and a no-brainer for young kids.  Yes, you do have to reapply, but with all it&#x27;s positive attributes, who wouldn&#x27;t?!  I love the mango-coconutty tropical sent.  Feels super sexy on me.  Just having it on makes me feel like I&#x27;m on vacation.</li>
    <li> Pros: Not so harmful to the body. It does work.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When it dries, it gets white and chalky all over (I am tan). So at that time I wipe off as much of the white that I can see. I have tried putting on less, but when it gets wet, it will still get white and drippy.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for yet another natural sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because it streaks a little and it&#x27;s  hard to rub in all the way.I wear it over lotion so I this may be a factor as my skin is dry.  I&#x27;m  allergic to most sunscreens but this is very gentle on my skin and its a mild scent. I buy this every summer.</li>
    <li> Begat ever!  And it actually works!</li>
    <li> before i get this sunscreen, i had check the skinlab.com for ingredients and sun protection lever. this sunscreen have good grade.&lt;br /&gt;so i decided buy.&lt;br /&gt;but i&#x27;m really disappointed !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first, i can&#x27;t makeup after apply this. it look like blend well in bare skin, but put foundations, bb cream what ever base makeup after this,&lt;br /&gt;white mark came out with foundation.&lt;br /&gt;So i try wait 10-20 min. but result still same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second, it not good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;when i rub into skin , i can feel micro ball? or  something in scratch my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;that provided stimulus to skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally, after apply this sunscreen, i feel thin film coating my face. that feel so uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;also packing was different with pictures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product directly from Coola after reviewing multiple Coola product reviews that said the product sometimes seemed old &amp; dry if bought through Amazon. But it turns out that&#x27;s just the consistency of this sunscreen. I&#x27;m kind of a sunscreen fanatic and this was one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever bought. It&#x27;s very hard to rub in and feels very tacky for a long time afterwards. My husband thought I had forgotten to rub it in, that&#x27;s how much it showed even after attempting to vigorously rub it in, and at one point he went to touch my arm and pulled back and said &amp;#34;ew&amp;#34; about the way the sunscreen felt lol. So this was pretty much a waste of money (and this is EXPENSIVE sunscreen) because the product is so bad I dont think I would want to wear it anywhere, not even at the beach, and unfortunately Coola doesn&#x27;t let you return products you buy directly from them- you can only exchange- so I&#x27;m just SOL. The only good thing about this sunscreen was the scent. In summary, I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this particular Coola product.</li>
    <li> The best sun screen  ,</li>
    <li> I have bought this sunscreen through amazon several time and this is the only one I have recieved that did NOT smell good. My old, dried up bottle, from which I squeezed every drop, still smells better than this new bottle. I still love this product other than that. Super disappointed because I adore the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because I had also tried Coola&#x27;s spray sunscreen and the baby unscented sunscreen and liked them both. This one didn&#x27;t disappoint. I spend a lot of time in the FL sun and have not gotten burnt or red or had any irritation from this sunscreen. It applies easily, smells super yummy and exotic and lasts a long time in my experience. It works well on my 4 year old too. I really liked the ease of the spray sunscreen but it ran out fast so I&#x27;m hoping that the lotion will last a bit longer.</li>
