      <li>I do not like these reviews, so I will not be doing any more of them.</li>
      <li>Odo Ban smells so strong that I can&#x27;t stand it much better than animal urine smell.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and good prices</li>
      <li>It still smells but not as strong.  </li>
      <li>The next day we walked in and it smelled great.</li>
      <li>We think it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>The person who was living in my mother&#x27;s house let her dog urinate freely throughout the house.</li>
      <li>We have 2 cats and have experienced several urine accidents over the years.  </li>
      <li>Important to read the directions for application.  </li>
      <li>Also, the manufacturer offers a lot of helpful suggestions for its most effective use.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I was familiar with Nok-Out because my employer buys it</li>
      <li>Quite simply it works, by far the best I have ever used.</li>
      <li>After reading many positive reviews about Nok Out, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>Helped tremendously with mold and musty smell in my car.</li>
      <li>have used Nok-Out to good effect on a seeping sewage odor, and also to rescue a curtain that for some reason had taken on a strange smell.</li>
      <li>This should more clearly be defined in the product prescription.</li>
      <li>You can clear the air without a strong scent of pine trees, flowers, etc.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>I used to spend money on so many different products that just didn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
      <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>First time user.</li>
      <li>Now the drawers smell pleasant with only a tinge of the original odd smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better success with other products.</li>
      <li>We sprayed a large amount into the vent area and wiped it up with paper towels....sprayed more....wiped again and sprayed more and let it air dry.  </li>
      <li>Used the whole bottle to eliminate the cigarette smoke smell in our truck.  </li>
      <li>Let me tell you it really works... if you are a pet owner, this product is a must to have on hand.</li>
      <li>Really have not found this to be helpful.</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>Really eliminates all odors.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it got rid of the odors but sometimes had to be applied multiple times to the same area.</li>
      <li>I still clean them regularly, at least once a day and sometimes more often if I notice that they need to be cleaned.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products , I would rate this one on top.</li>
      <li>Tried so many and wasted so much money.</li>
      <li>That was the main purpose I bought it for</li>
      <li>It absolutely knocks out odors completely!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for the vent</li>
      <li>I want to highly recommend “Nok-Out” for odor problems.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably too high priced.</li>
      <li>Expensive but great.  </li>
      <li>We were not optimistic (after having tried Nature&#x27;s Miracle without success a year earlier).  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to work on everything with the same success</li>
      <li>We bought a new dresser at a flea market.  </li>
      <li>Bissell&#x27;s Pet Odor and Stain remover is definitely unequal to any real pet disaster.</li>
      <li>I sprayed the inside of a wood chest of drawers to eliminate old furniture smell ( sprayed both the drawers as well as inside cabinet ).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to change the litter boxes completely out quite as often.  </li>
      <li>we didn&#x27;t actually see the culprit) sprayed some lawn chairs stored in our garden shed and left a powerful stink  that defied description.  </li>
      <li>In the meantime I worked on the carpet that I had attempted to clean with various other products.</li>
      <li>And it is nontoxic, and so gentle that I don&#x27;t have to spray it outside, or open all my windows.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was kind of disappointed in the NokOut because the Everyday Cheapskate made it sound like a miracle.  </li>

<li> I sprayed thoroughly with the NokOut and left a small dish of it in the closed drawer for several days.  </li>
<li> I swished around nearly half the bottle in and around the vent and let it dry over course of 2 days.</li>
<li> Did not mask the orders I expected it to!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best remedy I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with the dog smell (not urine) that was present in my sons&#x27; room. Also, thought it would help with the smoky smell in the rec room where our wood stove is. The woodstove was cleaned out for the season and the chimney was also cleaned.  After using Nok-Out, I would say the odor decreased a bit, but was not eliminated like I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I was familiar with Nok-Out because my employer buys it and I knew it worked. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent but immediately gets rid of offensive odors. You can clear the air without a strong scent of pine trees, flowers, etc.</li>
    <li> Product works great and it is the best price that I found out there.</li>
    <li> Used this and seems okay.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product. And my home is a serious challenge. I have also used Nature&#x27;s Miracle; not bad at all but a brand-specific battery operated sprayer that I paid for was inoperable regardless of battery health, and it just isn&#x27;t quite as good as Nok-Out. Odo Ban smells so strong that I can&#x27;t stand it much better than animal urine smell. Bissell&#x27;s Pet Odor and Stain remover is definitely unequal to any real pet disaster. Now we come to Nok-Out. It works amazingly well. If a bad smell can be removed this will do it. And it is nontoxic, and so gentle that I don&#x27;t have to spray it outside, or open all my windows.&lt;br /&gt;It also goes a long way. It isn&#x27;t as expensive as it seems because it really lasts.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes for this product- have cat urine in and around an air vent and on a carpet- I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for the vent but I figured I would try- I swished around nearly half the bottle in and around the vent and let it dry over course of 2 days. In the meantime I worked on the carpet that I had attempted to clean with various other products. I saturated it and blotted and the next day when it was dry it still smelled. I repeated and although it seems less I can still smell cat urine. As for the vent I dumped the remainder of the bottle in and tried again- it&#x27;s now been about 2 weeks and no improvement. Maybe this product works for other problems but for cat urine I&#x27;ve had better success with other products.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for our cat. He is still peeing in the same spots even after multiple cleanups and heavy use of the product.</li>
    <li> The product works on items you can spray. If you are trying to remove cigarett odor you will also need to wash the walls which I can&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> We used Nok-Out Odor Eliminator on tile floor. The person who was living in my mother&#x27;s house let her dog urinate freely throughout the house. We had to tear up all carpeting but the tile floor still smelled. We washed the floor down twice and then sprayed the Nok-Out on the floor. The next day we walked in and it smelled great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It really works.  Works especially well for incontinency odors as these permeate the bedding even though they did not get wet.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Use it all over the house and on trips.</li>
    <li> It did what it said it would,so I guess it is a good product.. I do not like these reviews, so I will not be doing any more of them.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray well, nor does it knock out any odors. I gave it to my daughter &amp; won&#x27;t be buying it again, obviously.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good prices......what more can you ask for</li>
    <li> We have 2 cats and have experienced several urine accidents over the years.  The biggest accident took place in one of our heat vents while we were away in Cuba.  When we returned, the house - well, you can imagine.  My husband went to the local pet store and they recommended Nok Out.  We were not optimistic (after having tried Nature&#x27;s Miracle without success a year earlier).  We sprayed a large amount into the vent area and wiped it up with paper towels....sprayed more....wiped again and sprayed more and let it air dry.  Once dry, there was a bit of an odour.  We sprayed again and let it dry.  The smell was gone!  We were incredibly relieved and very impressed.  We now use Nok Out in and around our litter area and are very, very pleased.  We think it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34;...worth the money.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it got rid of the odors but sometimes had to be applied multiple times to the same area. Not sure how cost effective that is since it is rather expensive.</li>
    <li> I have a cat, who of course had an accident on the furniture.  After reading many positive reviews about Nok Out, I figured I would give it a try. Let me tell you it really works... if you are a pet owner, this product is a must to have on hand. I sprayed it two times on the fabric out of the course of the day. The next morning after air drying the smell was gone! It saved me frustration and money!!</li>
    <li> This product was just ok. There are plenty of other products that work just as well. The product did not eliminate the source of the odor.</li>
    <li> If you have pets - they have accidents - you need this product!! Quite simply it works, by far the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle to eliminate the cigarette smoke smell in our truck.  Sprayed everything in the truck per instructions...it still stinks!!</li>
    <li> my dog met up with a skunk in the woods...when I opened the back door she came running into the house..thankfully she did not get past the breezeway..but you can imagine the smell..Nok-Out eliminator the skunk odor</li>
    <li> Thought this was an air odor eliminator.........not a spray and wipe.  This should more clearly be defined in the product prescription.</li>
    <li> If you have pets in your house, you need this. A good carpet cleaner would also be a good idea.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better, but it does work, and I did just want to try it.  It&#x27;s probably too high priced.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> We bought a new dresser at a flea market.  It has an odd smell; but not necessarly a bad smell.  The piece is made from mahogany and so perhaps the smell is actually the wood.  We sprayed it once with Nok-Out.  It still smells but not as strong.  It probably needs another application of Nok-Out.  What is working are those perfumed sample inserts that you find in magazines.  I have been tearing those out and putting them in the drawers.  Now the drawers smell pleasant with only a tinge of the original odd smell.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It absolutely knocks out odors completely!</li>
    <li> Tried this product on a whim and have been very satisfied with results.  It has worked on pet odors/accidents, mold/mildew, and a host of other cleaning issues involving unwanted smells.  Some local wildlife (maybe a raccoon, maybe a possum....we didn&#x27;t actually see the culprit) sprayed some lawn chairs stored in our garden shed and left a powerful stink  that defied description.  Two liberal applications later (allowing to dry in between) and there is virtually no trace of the odor left on those chairs. I think the secondary application was key and we washed the chairs thoroughly after the scent was eliminated to remove any residue.  I don&#x27;t expect it to work on everything with the same success but so far I have not been disappointed.  Important to read the directions for application.  Also, the manufacturer offers a lot of helpful suggestions for its most effective use.</li>
    <li> The odor in and around my cats&#x27; litter boxes seems to be less than before I used the Nok-Out.  That was the main purpose I bought it for so I am happy with it.  Since I  have several cats and several litter boxes it is an ongoing problem to try and keep the odor down.  I don&#x27;t have to change the litter boxes completely out quite as often.  I still clean them regularly, at least once a day and sometimes more often if I notice that they need to be cleaned.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really eliminates all odors.</li>
    <li> As a spot remover, it&#x27;s a one star. I find that lysol eliminates odors better than Nok-Out.  Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Have used the entire quart on a small spot in my carpet the began a mildew smell.  Never&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;knocked&#x27; it....still smells.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money. I sprayed the inside of a wood chest of drawers to eliminate old furniture smell ( sprayed both the drawers as well as inside cabinet ). Product did not eliminate odor - made it worse.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, even after following the directions carefully, this product caused our carpeting to fade in those areas that were sprayed. It may have taken the odor away, but it ruined the carpet!</li>
    <li> Great customer service and the product works better than any I have found.</li>
    <li> Guess what this works.  Very happy with this product.  Tried so many and wasted so much money.</li>
    <li> Excellent odor remover. First time user. Great service too. I&#x27;ve tried other products , I would rate this one on top. I Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I tried ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING to get the cat urine odor out of the corner of our living room, and nothing worked, except this stuff -- good product!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Expensive but great.  Helped tremendously with mold and musty smell in my car.</li>
    <li> This removed the smell of cat uine better than anything I have used.</li>
    <li> Do not use this on your cat for skunk odour removal.  I just spent $500 at the vets and have a very sick cat - severe ulcerations in the mouth, swollen throat, swollen gums.  He is on antibiotics and pain medication and has to be fed with a syringe.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to use in a drawer that had some elastic shapewear in it for years.  It had this weird elastic smell.  I sprayed thoroughly with the NokOut and left a small dish of it in the closed drawer for several days.  The odor went away.  HOWEVER, after several weeks the odor was back, and the drawer had been empty all that time.  I now use the drawer to store hard items that will not pick up the smell.  I was kind of disappointed in the NokOut because the Everyday Cheapskate made it sound like a miracle.  Not so.</li>
    <li> Really have not found this to be helpful.</li>
    <li> Nok Out is the absolute best product ever!  I will always keep a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by the effectiveness no matter how tough an odor is.  I used to spend money on so many different products that just didn&#x27;t get the job done. Nok-Out is reliable whether it&#x27;s getting cigarette smoke odors out of my car&#x27;s interior, or removing cat urine odor from a mattress, it has worked wonderfully in even the most challenging situations. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Product was in good condition</li>
    <li> Great product, really eliminates cat urine smell!!!</li>
    <li> Did not mask the orders I expected it to!  I would not recommend this product to my friends.  Save your money</li>
    <li> This product really works! I would recommend it to anyone.  My couch would have been ruined if it wasn&#x27;t for nok out.</li>
    <li> I want to highly recommend “Nok-Out” for odor problems. In my opinion it is the most potent and dependable smell-eliminating resource on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Nok-Out to good effect on a seeping sewage odor, and also to rescue a curtain that for some reason had taken on a strange smell. Yes, it’s no doubt rather expensive, but it produces results that nothing else can, and with no apparent chemical after-effects. Try it for yourself--I think you’ll like it!</li>
    <li> It worked okay, it didn&#x27;t get the smell out of my mattress or clothes. It covered them up with a bleach-like odor smell. It also ruined several shirts, a jacket and sheets by bleaching them.  The product did not say anything about containing bleach, but it bleached the items still.</li>
